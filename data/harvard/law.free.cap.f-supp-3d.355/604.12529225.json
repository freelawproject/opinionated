LAWSON, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Omar Batson alleges in an amended complaint that he was abused by his jailors at the Genessee County, Michigan jail while he was serving a misdemeanor sentence. The defendants have filed several motions for summary judgment alleging that the discovery has not borne out the claims against any of the individual defendants, the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, and the plaintiff has not identified any illegal policy that would subject Genesee County to municipal liability. Fact questions preclude summary judgment as to defendants Kennamer and Leonowicz, but the plaintiff has not offered evidence that creates a triable issue as to the other defendants. Therefore, the Curt will grant in part and deny in part the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In June 2014, Batson was convicted of misdemeanor reckless driving and drunken driving and sentenced to 45 days in the Genesee County Jail. He was due to be released on July 11, 2014. Batson alleges that he was abused in various ways during his jail stay including incidents when he was sprayed in the genitals with mace; denied prescribed medication; and, on the day when he should have been released, handcuffed and then again pepper sprayed and beaten after he was cuffed, despite offering no resistance or provocation. The parties' accounts of that last incident differ substantially and are discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Booking records from the jail show that when he was taken into custody, Batson indicated that he was taking Keppra and Lamictal for a seizure disorder for which he recently had been hospitalized. On June 6, 2014, orders were entered in his jail medical record that he was to receive doses of Keppra and Lamictal twice a day for 30 days. However, Batson submitted copies of several medical \"kites\" (a colloquialism for a written communication by a prisoner making a request or expressing a complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Itrich v. Ricumstrict\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-12495,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204140708\">\n    2018 WL 4140708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 30, 2018) ), that he sent to jail authorities in early July 2014 complaining that the had received only Keppra and had not been given Lamictal, and he had seizures as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Batson testified at his deposition that when he was seen by a doctor (unnamed) at the jail, the doctor was upset about him not getting all his medication and \"went straight to the nurse\" (also unnamed), directing her to give Batson his medication, which was done within an hour. He attested that on another occasion he told a jail nurse (again, unnamed) that he needed his medication because he had just had a seizure and probably would have another one soon. But the nurse just \"started laughing and [said] I [will] get it when I get a chance to and...go back to your bunk.\" He also testified that one time he had a seizure in his cell, which jail staff were aware of because he was making noise and his cellmate \"was screaming, he's dying, he's dying [but] they wouldn't even come.\" Finally, Batson testified that he had a seizure on another occasion while confined\n   in \"the box,\" after (unnamed) jail officers \"sprayed [his] testicles with mace.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Batson testified that when he believed he was supposed to be released, he went up to the desk in the jail area where a deputy sat, with others who had been called for release. Batson stated that he was not yelling at the deputy and never \"shoved\" anything at the deputy. The deputy told Batson to get away from his desk, and Batson then walked away. The deputy then told Batson to put his box of belongings on the floor and called out \"Code Green\" (the verbal code indicating that an officer requires assistance). A female officer then arrived and placed handcuffs on Batson. Other guards also soon arrived and started talking to the deputy at the desk, asking \"What's going on?\" When Batson replied, \"I didn't do anything,\" one of the officers told him to \"shut up\" and then sprayed mace in his eyes and face. Batson then was taken to another area of the jail, but on the way two guards with him banged his chest, shoulders, and head into doors and walls as he was being transported.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Batson had some difficulty identifying the defendants in person or by photographs presented at his deposition and saying what roles they took in the incident. The most he could say about Lieutenant Broecker was that she resembled the female officer who put handcuffs on him during the Code Green incident. He could not definitely recall Sergeant Kennamer, except to say that he thought Kennamer was \"very mean\" to him. Batson also stated that he was blinded by the OC spray - the \"mace\" - and consequently could not clearly see who beat him. Batson also conceded that he had \"no idea\" if any of the individual defendants were involved in denying him the medication that he was supposed to receive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Deputy David Hoover attested that during the incident, he stood up, told Batson to back away from the desk, drew and pointed his Taser weapon when Batson did not comply, and then called the Code Green. Hoover stated that after he signaled the Code Green, the other officers arrived in about a minute, then Hoover sat back down at his desk.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Deputy Nicolas Leonowicz testified that he responded to the Code Green and that during the incident he used a \"one-second burst\" of OC spray to subdue Mr. Batson. In his incident report, Leonowicz wrote that he used the OC spray because Batson refused to follow verbal commands, was \"talking loudly,\" and \"turned quickly toward\" Leonowicz. After Batson was sprayed, Leonowicz escorted him to the Restricted Housing Unit (RHU), where he offered Batson a shower to remove the OC residue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Sergeant (now Lieutenant) David Kennamer testified that he was present during the \"Code Green\" response and arrived after Deputy Leonowicz. Kennamer saw Leonowicz use OC spray on Batson, which according to Kennamer occurred after Batson disobeyed direct verbal commands. Kennamer said that Batson was handcuffed after he was sprayed, and then taken by Leonowicz and Kennamer to the RHU.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The plaintiff filed his complaint in this case on July 6, 2017. Initially he named more than 80 individuals whom he identified, apparently, from the employee roster of the Genesee County Sheriff Department, although it is undisputed that no more than three or possibly four persons were involved in the principal incidents alleged in the complaint. On December 18, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that dropped all but four of the named individuals and added Genesee County as a defendant. The case was reassigned\n    to the undersigned on July 3, 2018. On September 5, 2018, after a conference with the parties, the Court entered an order dismissing the complaint as to all but the remaining four individually named defendants and the County. The present defendants are Sergeant David Kennamer, Deputy Nicolas Leonowicz, Lieutenant Leona Broecker, and Deputy David Hoover (named only as \"Deputy Hoover\" in the pleadings).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The amended complaint pleads claims via\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    for (1) individual and supervisory liability for denial of necessary medical care and excessive force under the Eighth Amendment (\"First Claim for Relief\"); (2) congruent deprivations of the plaintiff's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, purportedly due to his status as a pretrial detainee (\"Fourth Claim for Relief\"); and an inscrutable claim for \"Res Ipsa Loquitur\" (\"Fifth Claim for Relief\"). The plaintiff's \"Third Claim for Relief,\" embodying certain state law claims, was dismissed by the parties' stipulation on August 16, 2018. ECF No. 57. No mention is made in the amended complaint of the mysteriously omitted \"Second Claim for Relief,\" which also conspicuously was absent from the original complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The defendants filed a \"motion to amend or correct\" the caption to excise David Hoover as a party, which will be adjudicated as a motion for partial summary judgment. In that motion, Hoover argues that he never was served with the summons, despite the fact that counsel for the County agreed to accept service on behalf of another deputy also named Hoover. Hoover filed a second motion for summary judgment, in which he argues along with the other individual defendants that the claims should be dismissed based on qualified immunity. The County also argued that the plaintiff has not offered evidence to support a claim for municipal liability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    II. Discussion\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The defendants moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). \"Summary judgment is proper 'if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n    <em>\n     Pittman v.

However, even if such a claim could be pursued, in this case it cannot be sustained because the plaintiff has not pointed to anything in the record to suggest that the alleged deprivation of his medication was due to any policy, either expressly endorsed or implied by widespread practice or custom, that was the moving force for the unlawful deprivation of the medication that had been prescribed for him. The most that the plaintiff has submitted evidence of is that (1) medication was prescribed to treat his seizures while he was in jail; (2) he was deprived of his medication for several unspecified periods, during which he suffered several seizures; and (3) after he sent several medical kites and was seen by a doctor, the doctor ordered the nurse to provide both of his medications, and they were administered to him within an hour. The plaintiff also contends that on one occasion he told a nurse that he needed his medication and she \"laughed\" and told him that she would provide it when she got around to it; the plaintiff did not testify that on that occasion the medication was not eventually provided. Those incidents, taken alone or together, may establish incompetency or even mendacity by individual county employees.

Hoover and Broecker\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The plaintiffs' claims against defendants Hoover and Broecker must be dismissed because he has not offered any evidence of - or even alleged - any unconstitutional conduct by them. The plaintiff asserts that Deputy Hoover did nothing more than call a \"Code Green,\" and the uncontradicted evidence in the record does not show that Hoover did anything after that beyond waiting for backup to arrive, then sitting back down at his desk. At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel conceded that Hoover never laid hands on the plaintiff. But he said that Hoover was responsible for setting in motion the events that led to the assault on the plaintiff by the other deputies. Liability based on such a theory might be conceivable if there were evidence that Hoover's compatriots were lying in wait, spring-loaded to administer physical force the moment that Code Green was invoked. But there is no such evidence here. And the plaintiff has not cited any legal authority for the proposition that calling for help - even unreasonably sounding the alarm - constitutes any cognizable violation of the Eighth Amendment under clearly established federal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Similarly, the record suggests at most that Lieutenant Broecker merely put handcuffs on the plaintiff when she arrived, and nothing more. The plaintiff has not cited any law suggesting that handcuffing a prisoner, with no aggravating employment of unnecessary force, can constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. And there is no evidence that Broecker handcuffed the plaintiff with the intention of incapacitating him to allow Leonowicz and Kennamer an unencumbered opportunity to beat him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Hoover also argues that he was not properly served with process in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    However, there is no need to address that ground, because the evidence does not support a claim against him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The case will be dismissed as to defendants Hoover and Broecker.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    2.

Nothing in the record suggests that Kennamer was the officer who applied the OC spray; it appears to be undisputed that Leonowicz did that. However, the plaintiff also alleges that he was shoved and slammed against walls and doors while he was being \"escorted\" to solitary confinement. It is easy to understand why, under the circumstances, the plaintiff could not clearly identify who shoved and slammed him into those walls and doors after he was sprayed with mace, because temporary blindness is one of the expected incapacitating effects of such sprays.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Adams v.

However, Kennamer admitted that both he and Leonowicz were present during the escort. And the plaintiff clearly testified that one or more officers unreasonably beat him while he was being moved from one area to the other.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The fact that the plaintiff cannot definitively say which of the two officers shoved or slammed him into walls and doors is problematic because, as noted above, he must establish the individual liability of each named defendant under section 1983. As the Sixth Circuit has explained, the plaintiff's inability either categorically or by process of elimination to link a particular individual who was present with any unlawful use of force against the plaintiff will be dispositive of that officer's liability.\n    <em>\n     Totman v.

It may be imagined that one of the defendants could be held liable on a\n    direct use of force theory and the other on the theory that he failed to intervene, but that result is not legally sound where the plaintiff has failed to identify individually any officer who actually used unconstitutional force in the presence of other officers who failed to prevent it.\n    <em>\n     Harper v.

Thus, absent any evidence or even an allegation which could establish a constitutionally cognizable claim for excessive force against any of the defendants (e.g., identification of the individual guard(s) who used excessive force against him during the transfer procedure) Harper cannot possibly establish bystander liability as to Townley or anyone else for failure to intervene, and his claim must fail.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    This case does not mirror the facts in\n    <em>\n     Harper\n    </em>\n    , however. According to the plaintiff, only two officers escorted him to the segregation cell and he was beaten by at least one of them. He could not say which one because he was blinded by chemical spray. Certainly, both defendants cannot be held jointly liable merely on the theory that both were present and either one or the other must have committed the abuse.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fillmore v.

Although this result is in some tension with\n    <em>\n     Totman\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Harper\n    </em>\n    , it also is in harmony because here the perpetrators are not wholly unidentified; and they have been reduced by their own record admissions to a discrete pair of known individuals who freely admit that they both were present when the allegedly excessive force (slamming the plaintiffs head, shoulders, and chest into doors and walls) was deployed. The Sixth Circuit has held \"that a police officer who fails to act to prevent the use of excessive force may still be held liable where '(1) the officer observed or had reason to know that excessive force would be or was being used, and (2) the officer had both the opportunity and the means to prevent the harm from occurring.' \"\n    <em>\n     Floyd v.

Thus, we may imagine three logically consistent and legally sound findings by the jury: (1) neither defendant used excessive force and therefore neither is liable; (2) both of them used excessive force, and therefore both are liable; or (3) one of them used excessive force while the other stood by and watched, doing nothing to prevent it. In any of those scenarios, both defendants indisputably were present, and both had the opportunity to intervene as they forced the plaintiff down the treacherous path to the segregation cell. On either of the latter two premises, both could he held liable under section 1983, and in both eventualities the requisite individual liability would be established.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The plaintiff is entitled to present his case to the jury and let them choose among those alternatives. The motion for summary judgment will be denied as to the excessive force claims against defendant Kennamer and Leonowicz.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    3. Municipal Liability\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Regardless of which individual officers may be held liable, the plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish municipal liability based on either an implicit policy of misusing OC spray or a failure to train officers in the use of it. Instead, all he has shown, at most, is one or two instances of allegedly excessive force that he has not connected to any systemic policy or custom or any failed training regimen. It is difficult to discern the exact basis of the plaintiff's claim here because his argument on the topic is undeveloped. However, the only apparent premises for it are either (1) an implied \"custom\" of ignoring the County's use of force policy, or (2) a failure properly to train corrections officers in the appropriate use of OC spray. The claim fails on either theory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    As noted, a plaintiff asserting liability under section 1983 against a municipality must show direct, not vicarious, liability.

However, to prevail on a failure to train theory, the plaintiff must demonstrate either (1) \"a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees and [the defendant municipality's] continued adherence to an approach that it knows or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees, thus establishing the conscious disregard for the consequences of its action...necessary to trigger municipal liability,\" or (2) \"a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a showing that [the defendant] has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious potential for a constitutional violation.\"\n    <em>\n     Shadrick v.

But he has not pointed to any evidence to illustrate either how any training received by the defendants about that policy or the use of OC spray in the jail setting was inadequate, or that the County had reason to know that any deficient training regimen was likely to precipitate constitutional abuses. Because the plaintiff has not demonstrated either a \" 'pattern of similar constitutional violations,' [or] that a violation is a 'highly predictable consequence' of the [County's] alleged failure to train,\" his putative failure to train claim must fail.\n    <em>\n     Meeks v.
