Thus, although Congress was previously concerned about drafting large numbers of people who were categorically ineligible for combat, this concern factually no longer justifies the MSSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   However, according to Defendants, Congress also worried about administrative problems caused by \"women's different treatment with regard to dependency, hardship[,] and physical standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; S.

Defendants point to an acknowledgment by the Department of Defense that \"[t]hose who are opposed\" to female mandatory registration believe \"it would be inefficient to draft thousands of women when only a small\n   percentage would be physically qualified to serve as part of a combat troop.\" Dkt. 80 at 28; Dkt. 73-1 at 145-46 (Department of Defense, Report on the Purpose and Utility of a Registration System for Military Selective Service, 2017). Therefore, \"if men will, for the foreseeable future, comprise the predominant percentage of persons serving in combat forces, then the basis for the MSSA has not materially changed.\" Dkt. 80 at 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tuan Anh Nguyen v.

At the outset, concerns about female physical ability do not appear to have been a significant factor in Congress's decision-making process regarding the MSSA. Instead, Congress mentioned concerns about female physical ability in passing, within a list, in one sentence of Defendants' cited report. S. Rep. No. 96-826, at 159. In contrast, Congress extensively discussed the ban on women in combat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312816\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/53/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312816\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/53/#p73\">\n    at 156-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress also focused on the societal consequences of drafting women, such as the perceived impropriety of young mothers going off to war and leaving young fathers to care for children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312816\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/53/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312816\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/53/#p73\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' evidence simply does not support the argument that Congress preserved a male-only draft because of concerns about female physical ability. Again, while the court must defer to Congress, the court does not have to defer to proffered justifications that have little, if anything, to do with Congress's actual judgment on the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales-Santana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604707\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1678/#p1689\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1696-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p533\">\n    518 U.S. at 533, 535-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p533\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\"It will not do to 'hypothesiz[e] or inven[t]' governmental purposes for gender classifications '\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   in response to litigation.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, under\n   <em>\n    Rostker\n   </em>\n   , the dispositive issue is whether men and women are\n   <em>\n    similarly situated\n   </em>\n   in regard to the draft.\n   <em>\n    Rostker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    453 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the relevant question is not what proportion of women are physically eligible for combat-it may well be that only a small percentage of women meets the physical standards for combat positions. However, if a similarly small percentage of men is combat-eligible, then men and women are similarly situated for the purposes of the draft and the MSSA's discrimination is unjustified. Defendants provide no evidence that Congress ever looked at arguments on this topic and then made a \"studied choice\" between alternatives based on that information.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Had Congress compared male and female rates of physical eligibility, for example, and concluded that it was not administratively wise to draft women, the court may have been bound to defer to Congress's judgment. Instead, at most, it appears that Congress obliquely relied on assumptions and overly broad stereotypes about women and their ability to fulfill combat roles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Defendants' second proffered justification appears to be an \" 'accidental by-product of a traditional way of thinking about females,' \" rather than a robust, studied position.\n   <em>\n    Rostker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    453 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722043\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/57/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Califano v.
