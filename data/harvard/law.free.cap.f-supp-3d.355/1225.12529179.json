Additionally, a statement that \"is offered against an opposing party and ... was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed\" is not hearsay.

To the extent other content was incorporated into those emails, and to the extent Univar's agents or employees manifested that they adopted or believed that the content was true, the incorporated content is admissible pursuant to Fed.

With respect to emails sent by Mr. Chin, to whom Univar refers as its independent contractor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DSOF \u00b6 135; Def.'s Resp. to\n   PCSOF \u00b6 191, the court finds that Mr. Chin was an agent of Univar for purposes of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D). First, \"the precise contractual relationship between the agent and the party against whom the evidence is offered\" is not determinative for purposes of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453385\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/454/966/#p973\">\n    454 F.Supp.2d at 973-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, notwithstanding its assertion that Mr. Chin was an independent contractor, Univar itself referred to Mr. Chin as \"our representative.\" Def.'s Mem., Attach. 29 (Univar Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) Dep.) 114:11-12, ECF No. 143-5. Therefore, Mr. Chin's emails are not hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding emails or other written communications sent to Univar employees or agents by third parties (Table 2), Plaintiff refers to those emails and communications not to prove the matters asserted therein, i.e., that the saccharin was being transshipped from China through Taiwan, but, instead, to address Univar's level of culpability.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 4-6, 15-22 (discussing evidence concerning country of origin),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 23-26 (discussing evidence concerning Univar's gross negligence in ascertaining the country of origin),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Table 2. At oral argument, Plaintiff clarified that it presented certain evidence to demonstrate Univar's awareness of its supplier's asserted lack of a Taiwanese production facility and Univar's actions in the context of reasonable care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg.

Defendant had no objection to the admissibility of those exhibits for that limited purpose. Oral Arg. Tr. at 29-30. Therefore, Univar's objection to emails or other communications sent by third parties to Univar's employees or agents is overruled to the extent that this evidence is offered for the limited purpose of showing its effect on the recipient and Univar's knowledge and state of mind with regard to saccharin production in Taiwan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077108\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/1000/#p1003\">\n    628 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1003 ;\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453385\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/454/966/#p973\">\n    454 F.Supp.2d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Similarly, Univar's internal documents, such as trip notes, inspection reports, letters or memoranda, and a PowerPoint presentation (Table 3) are admissible pursuant to Fed.

In the cited testimony, Mr. Ritell references an \"exclusivity agreement\" between HTC and Rit-Chem, and further testified as to his knowledge of HTC's production capacity and annual output.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ritell Dep. 72:2-73:18. Univar objects to the Government's reliance on Mr. Ritell's recollection of an \"exclusivity agreement\" and invokes the best evidence rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to PCSOF \u00b6 190 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Evid. 1002 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 47-48. The Government points out that in addition to the exclusivity agreement, Mr. Ritell testified as to his personal knowledge of HTC's annual production of saccharin, and the degree to which Rit-Chem and HTC's other customers were responsible for purchasing that production amount. Oral Arg. Tr. at 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the extent that the Government relies on Mr. Ritell's recollection of an exclusivity agreement, Univar's objection is sustained. Rule 1002 requires production of the original of a document, such as an exclusivity agreement, to prove its contents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 1002. Rule 1004 provides circumstances in which production of an original is excused and other evidence of the content of a writing is admissible; however, Plaintiff has not asserted that those circumstances exist here. Univar did not object to the remaining portions of Mr. Ritell's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ritell Dep. 72:1-16-73:3-18; Def.'s Resp. to PCSOF \u00b6 190.

R. Evid. 807(2) ; PCSOF \u00b6\u00b6 190, 199, 202, 204. The Government suggests that the statements in those paragraphs are \"more probative on the point[s] for which [they are] offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts\" because the Government attempted to contact HTC personnel through the issuance of a letter rogatory but received an incomplete response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The Government contends that the affidavit \"recount[s] the contents of the reports of investigation, which were made contemporaneous[ly] and with his visits and his discussions with those individuals.\" Oral Arg. Tr. at 25. In other words, according to the Government, these statements offer \"equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\" to the hearsay exception set forth in Rule 803(8)(A)(iii). Rule 803(8)(A)(iii) exempts from the hearsay rule \"[a] record or statement of a public office if [ ] it sets out ... in a civil case ..., factual findings from a legally authorized investigation.\" Fed. R. Evid. Rule 803(8)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A review of Agent Tsui's reports of investigation (\"ROI\") demonstrates that the paragraphs in his affidavit merely introduce the information contained in the ROI.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tsui Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 12, 17-27,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tsui Aff., Ex. 1 (ROI) at 63-64, ECF No. 32-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tsui Aff. \u00b6 5 (stating that the ROI contains Agent Tsui's \"contemporaneous recordation of events related to the Univar investigation.\") The paragraphs in the affidavit and the ROI appear to be merely a transcript of Agent Tsui's interview with Mr. Weng. Without further information on the record, the court cannot make the detailed findings regarding the \"special facts and circumstances which, in the court's judgment, indicate[ ]\" that Mr. Weng's statements to Agent Tsui have \"a sufficiently high degree of trustworthiness and necessity to justify [their] admission;\" therefore, the court sustains Univar's objections with respect to those paragraphs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The Government's new exhibit shows, and both Univar and the Government acknowledge, that only Article 10 of this Act has been amended since 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s OA Ex. 1; Def.'s 2nd Suppl.

The activities of LH Chemical and LH Trading, during the 2009-2012 period, do not reflect the type of uniform conduct that would suggest a habit or routine practice for purposes of Rule 406.
