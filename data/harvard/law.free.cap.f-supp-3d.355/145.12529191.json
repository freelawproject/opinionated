CONCLUSION...162\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This multi-district litigation arises out of defendant Allergan's alleged actions to improperly delay the market entry of generic competitors to its dry-eye medication Restasis \u00ae (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion). There are two groups of plaintiffs: those that purchased Restasis \u00ae directly from Allergan and End-Payor Plaintiffs (\"EPPs\"), health and welfare funds that purchased (or reimbursed members' purchases of) Restasis \u00ae from distributors or retailers. Both groups contend that the price they paid for Restasis \u00ae would have been lower if Allergan had faced competition from generic manufacturers and that they were also deprived of the opportunity to purchase lower-priced, generic versions of the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The EPPs are precluded from asserting federal damages claims under\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick Co. v.

For the reasons set forth below, Allergan's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PLAINTIFFS' ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For a full recitation of plaintiffs' factual allegations, I refer to my Opinion and Order dated September 18, 2018 denying defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to allege causation. (Docket No. 146.) Briefly, EPPs allege that Allergan took a number of improper actions to delay the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") in approving generic competitors for Restasis \u00ae, including: (1) filing sham citizen petitions with the FDA; (2) defrauding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") into issuing second-wave patents for Restasis \u00ae; (3) using those patents to file baseless patent infringement lawsuits, further delaying the FDA's approval process for generic Restasis \u00ae equivalents; and (4) when it appeared that its patents were likely to be invalidated, transferring those patents to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which licensed them back, in an effort to frustrate invalidation of the patents by renting the Tribe's sovereign immunity. As a result, EPPs allege that Allergan has maintained a monopoly for several years beyond what it would have had absent its wrongful conduct and has used that monopoly to charge an inflated price for Restasis \u00ae. The EPPs assert that they have been injured because they overpaid for cyclosporine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   EPPs bring five claims, only two of which are at issue on this motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Second Claim challenges Allergan's monopolistic conduct and seeks damages under the laws of 22 jurisdictions on an antitrust theory. The Third Claim challenges Allergan's unfair, unconscionable, deceptive, and fraudulent conduct under the consumer protection laws of five states. For each claim, EPPs rely on the same factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Allergan moves to dismiss the antitrust claims as to eight of the 22 jurisdictions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and moves to dismiss the consumer protection claims as to each of the five jurisdictions. In their opposition, EPPs voluntarily withdraw their claims brought under the laws of Puerto Rico, but they oppose dismissal of their other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the EPPs' Consolidated Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). When considering such a motion, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and must draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Swiatkowski v.

Defendant contends that the claims brought under the laws of five of those jurisdictions-Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Missouri-rely on consumer protection statutes that cover a range of theories of liability and therefore leave ambiguous how these statutes apply to an\n   antitrust theory of harm. Allergan argues that the claims are confusing and that it lacks \"fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Allergan is correct that the statutes cited by EPPs are broad and provide for a variety of claims under different theories of liability. EPPs make it clear, however, that they have one factual theory of liability-that Allergan engaged in improper efforts to extend its monopoly in order to delay market entry of generic substitutes for Restasis \u00ae. EPPs are asserting that Allergan's conduct violated several states' antitrust laws, as well as several states' consumer protection laws. Whether or not the conduct does so is addressed below on a state-by-state basis. Allergan's more general argument that plaintiffs have not provided it with sufficient notice of the claims they are asserting, however, is meritless. Allergan has not received notice of any theory other than a monopolization theory precisely\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   EPPs are not asserting any other theories of liability. Moreover, even if the Consolidated Complaint were unclear on that front, EPPs' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to defendant's motion has confirmed that they are not raising a separate theory of liability on their consumer protection claims, but are merely alleging that the same conduct violated two separate sets of laws. (Mem. in Opp. at 4 (\"EPPs intended to assert exactly what they did assert: a claim under the relevant consumer protection statutes based on Allergan's anticompetitive conduct.\").) Rule 8's notice requirement has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its Reply Brief, Allergan insists that EPPs must amend their Consolidated Complaint to pursue a certain theory or to rely only on specific subsections of a listed statute. It cites authority for the proposition that a party may not amend its pleadings through a brief. Plaintiffs, however, have not amended their complaint. Rather, they have confirmed that they are not pursuing certain theories that they did not plead. I thus disagree that an Amended Consolidated Complaint is needed, but I do consider the representations made by EPPs to be binding. I will not allow EPPs to revive a theory that they have foregone in their opposition papers and did not articulate in their Consolidated Complaint merely because such a theory is cognizable under a statute listed in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Arkansas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204-88-101\">\n    Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4-88-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"ADTPA\"), contains a \"catch-all\" provision, which prohibits \"any other unconscionable, false, or deceptive act or practice in business, commerce, or trade.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204-88-101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4-88-107(a)(10). EPPs represent that, for this claim, their \"scheme to monopolize\" theory of harm is the \"unconscionable\" practice for which they seek to hold Allergan liable. For the reasons stated above, I reject defendant's argument that plaintiffs' claim under the ADTPA should be dismissed for failure to provide notice of the specific claim being alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Federal courts are divided on whether the term \"unconscionable\" in the Arkansas statute includes monopolization claims-a question Arkansas courts have not addressed.

EPPs do not plead, and explicitly state in their opposition that they are not pursuing, any claims based on fraudulent misrepresentations to consumers. (Mem. in Opp. at 17.)

While EPPs do not specify in the Consolidated Complaint whether they rely on one of the enumerated types of conduct or the catch-all provision, they clarify in their opposition that their theory is that Allergan was deceptive when it filed sham citizen petitions and patent infringement lawsuits in an attempt to retain its monopoly, as alleged in the Consolidated Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As Allergan argues, however, this theory is not covered by the UTPCPL.
