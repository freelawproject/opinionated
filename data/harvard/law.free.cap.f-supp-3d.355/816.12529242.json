(collectively, Plaintiffs), brought this action against ProMove's former employees Mark Siepman and Joseph Hammerslough (the individual defendants) as well as Sunset Transportation LV, Inc., and Tantara Transportation Group (the corporate defendants), asserting multiple claims, including breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets. Defendants collectively move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or, alternatively, to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.

Logisys purchased Lightning Logistics and retained the individual defendants as employees. The individual defendants, who were ProMove employees for approximately five years, executed employment agreements with ProMove that included confidentiality and non-compete clauses, as well as a choice-of-law and forum-selection clause stating that each party to the agreement \"irrevocably submits itself to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts sitting in Minnesota.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, while employed by ProMove, the individual defendants made preparations to leave ProMove with the intent to begin employment with the corporate defendants, including the solicitation of ProMove's employees and customers\n   on behalf of the corporate defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the corporate defendants knowingly assisted with this preparation. Plaintiffs also allege that, before leaving ProMove, Hammerslough copied proprietary and confidential information from ProMove computers with the intent to benefit himself, the corporate defendants, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Individual Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to establish a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants based primarily on the employment agreements, which include a forum-selection clause that prescribes that each contracting party submits to personal jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Due process is satisfied when a defendant consents to personal jurisdiction by entering into a contract that contains a valid forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Dominium Austin Partners, L.L.C. v.

Here, however, the record does not include signed copies of the employment agreements. Based on this omission, Defendants argue that the forum-selection clause is not enforceable against them. But the question before the Court is not whether the contracts are enforceable. Rather, for personal jurisdiction, the central question is whether a defendant has purposefully availed itself of the laws of the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Fastpath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148796\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/816/#p821\">\n    760 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The presence of a valid forum-selection clause typically obviates the need to analyze a defendant's contacts with a forum state because the contract itself establishes the defendant's voluntarily consent to personal jurisdiction in the forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rykoff-Sexton, Inc. v. Am. Appraisal Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10596462\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/469/88/#p90\">\n    469 N.W.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 (Minn. 1991) (\"With consent, resort to the constitutional test for personal jurisdiction is not required because the defendant obviously can reasonably anticipate being haled into court after consenting to jurisdiction.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The legal issue here is whether the individual defendants, through their employment agreements, voluntarily consented to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota, not whether signed copies of the employment agreements are in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Strong circumstantial evidence exists that the individual defendants voluntarily consented to the terms of the employment agreements, including the forum-selection clause. Before Logisys purchased Lightning Logistics in 2012, each individual defendant executed a Letter of Intent with Beltmann Group Incorporated (BGI)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   addressing the terms of the sale. According to the letter, BGI would structure acceptable employment agreements for the individual defendants in light of the \"importance of retaining key employees of [Lightning Logistics] after the closing date.\" When Paul Zagaria, the executive vice president of BGI and ProMove, inquired of both individual defendants by email whether they had signed their employment agreements, Hammerslough replied that he had signed the agreement and that he would be willing to resend a copy to Zagaria. Both individual defendants\n   subsequently became employees of ProMove and continued in that capacity for approximately five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, other factors support the requisite \"minimum contacts\" for personal jurisdiction. The individual defendants were ProMove employees for slightly less than five years and, although there are no allegations that either traveled to Minnesota, both individual defendants were employees of ProMove, a Minnesota company. They both executed the Letter of Intent with BGI, also a Minnesota company. And that letter clearly displayed in the letterhead BGI's Roseville, Minnesota address. Jeanne Considine, BGI's vice president of accounting, also stated by affidavit that each individual defendant \"submitted expense reports directly to Minnesota via Federal Express on at least [a] monthly basis, and sometimes weekly.\" And these expense reports, as well as the individual defendants' paychecks, were processed in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the totality of the circumstances, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing that the individual defendants voluntarily consented to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota through their employment with ProMove. For these reasons, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction with respect to each individual defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Corporate Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the corporate defendants are also bound by the forum-selection clause in the individual defendants' employment agreements. At issue here is whether a forum-selection clause in a contract to which the company is not bound is sufficient to meet the due process requirements of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To advance its argument, Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v. Endologix, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which Medtronic initiated a lawsuit against two former employees and their new employer, Endologix, in Minnesota state court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544464\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/1054/#p1055\">\n    530 F.Supp.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (D. Minn. 2008). After Endologix removed the action to federal court, Medtronic moved to remand the case to state court, citing a forum-selection clause in the employees' employment agreements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544464\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/1054/#p1055\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544464\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/1054/#p1055\">\n    at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Without more, the presence of a forum-selection clause in a contract to which the corporate defendants were not parties, and of which they may have been completely unaware, is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the corporate defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the corporate defendants' tortious conduct subjects them to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota under the\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   \"effects test.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p790\">\n    465 U.S. at 789-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p790\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
