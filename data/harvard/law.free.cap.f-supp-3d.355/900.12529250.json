(Tr. 21) She alleged disability beginning on March 22, 2013, due to fibromyalgia, pacemaker, chronic pain, restless body syndrome, diverticulitis, anxiety, panic attacks, cognitive problems, forgetfulness-poor memory, and fatigue. (Tr. 179, 180)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Her application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. (Tr. 106-113) Rector requested review and appeared with counsel at a hearing before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Yasmin Elias on September 19, 2016. (Tr. 36) In her decision, dated January 11, 2017, the ALJ found Rector was not disabled because, considering her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, she could work as an accounts investigator or a store facility rental clerk. (Tr. 21-29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rector appealed, but on September 22, 2017, the Appeals Council denied review making the decision of the ALJ the final decision of the Commissioner. (Tr. 1-4) Rector subsequently filed this action seeking review. (Doc. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Claimant's Work History and Medical History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rector was 44 years old at the hearing before the ALJ. (Tr. 42) She has an associates degree in nursing and worked as a certified nurse assistant, a registered nurse, and a nursing director. (Tr. 42) She stopped working on March 22, 2013 after an episode of pain, fatigue, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (Tr. 42-43) She also was having cognitive or memory problems. (Tr. 43)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rector subsequently sought treatment from her primary care physician, Jeffery Bushman, D.O., for what she believed was trouble with her pacemaker. (Tr. 340, 341, 343) On May 14, 2013, rheumatologist Augusto Posadas, M.D., observed 16 of 18 trigger points and diagnosed arthralgia (joint pain), fibromyalgia, and fatigue. (Tr. 290)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 30, 2013, Bushman observed 16 of 18 trigger points and diagnosed cardiac dysrythmia, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, and depression. (Tr. 338) The medical record contains additional treatment notes from May of 2013 through August of 2016. (Tr. 305-419, 458-487, 616-629) During this time, Bushman prescribed a series of medications in the hopes of ameliorating Rector's pain and other symptoms while minimizing adverse side-effects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At various times, Rector was taking Cymbalta, Sinemet, Xanax, Norco, Butrans patches, Nortriptyline, Zoloft, hydrocodone, gabapentin, Fentanyl patches, Vicodin, Valium, Ambien, lamotrigine, clonazepam, Oxycontin, alprazolam, Flexeril, and Lyrica.

(Tr. 492-502) She presented to the emergency room on July 3, 2016 and again on July 9, 2016 for low back pain radiating to her legs. (Tr. 546, 540)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 29, 2016, Rector was evaluated by Mateja de Leonni Stanonik, M.D., Ph.D., for progressive memory loss for over three years. (Tr. 693) Leonni Stanonik diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy, amnesia, adjustment disorder with anxiety, and cervical and lumbar spondylosis. (Tr. 694)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In February of 2014, Bushman completed an assessment of Rector's physical abilities. (Tr. 296) He opined that she could lift and/or carry 20 pounds occasionally and less than 10 pounds frequently. (Tr. 296) She could stand and/or walk for less than 2 hours in an 8-hour day. (Tr. 296) She could sit for 4 hours in an 8-hour work day. (Tr. 296) She must alternate between sitting and standing every 30-60 minutes. (Tr. 296) She should never climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl. (Tr. 297) She should only occasionally handle or reach with either hand. (Tr. 297)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In July of 2014, Richard M. Palmer, M.D., examined Rector for the state disability determination service. (Tr. 420) He diagnosed fibromyalgia, implanted pacemaker, tachycardia by history, chronic low back pain and left sciatica, chronic right and left knee pain, chronic fatigue, sleep dysfunction, and \"overweight.\" (Tr. 424) He opined that she could lift 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently. (Tr. 424-425) She could stand and/or walk for 6-8 hours in an 8-hour day. (Tr. 425) She could sit for 6-8 hours in an 8-hour day. (Tr. 425) She should never climb ladders, rope, or scaffolds. (Tr. 426) She should only occasionally climb ramps or stairs, kneel, crouch, or crawl. (Tr. 426)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the hearing before the ALJ, Rector testified that she has pain and fatigue. (Tr. 42) She has joint pain in her elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. (Tr. 44-45) This joint pain can flare up two or three times a month for typically two to three days at a time. (Tr. 45) Rector testified that she has good days as well as bad ones. (Tr. 46) But if she tries to work around the house on one of her good days, she will be in bed for the next day or so recuperating. (Tr. 46) Even on an average day, she must lie down three to four times for 30 minutes to an hour each time. (Tr. 54)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rector also has cognitive or memory problems. (Tr. 43) She could watch a movie with her husband and a week or two later forget that she saw it. (Tr. 36) She forgot to pick up her son at the bus stop a couple of times, thinking she already got him. (Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   47) She has insomnia, feels drained, and feels depressed. (Tr. 48-49)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the end of the hearing before the ALJ, Stephen Davis testified as a vocational expert. (Tr. 59) He testified that a person with the same age, education, and work experience as the claimant, who could work at the light exertional level; could never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; could occasionally climb ramps and stairs, balance, kneel, crouch, and crawl; must avoid concentrated exposure to extremes and temperatures, humidity and fumes and/or work place hazards; must be able to alternate between sitting and standing every 30 minutes to an hour; was limited to simple routine and repetitive work due to an inability to concentrate or focus for long periods of time; could only occasionally handle and reach bilaterally, and could constantly manipulate and feel bilaterally, could work as an accounts investigator or a storage facility rental clerk. (Tr. 62, 63, 64, 66)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Davis conceded that a person with the functional limitations as described by Bushman who \"could occasionally lift and/or carry 20 pounds, frequently, less than 10\" and \"could stand and/or walk with normal breaks for a total of less than two hours in an eight-hour day and sit with normal breaks for a total of less than six-hours in an eight-hour day, specifically four hours\" could not work full-time.

Earlier in her decision, the ALJ stated generally that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   While the claimant has complained of many different symptoms and seen many physicians, the record does not contain the types of\n   <em>\n    objective evidence\n   </em>\n   of symptoms related to a particular identifiable condition that would reasonably produce those symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Tr. 26) (emphasis added) And in her critique of Bushman's opinion, she specifically notes that Rector's physical examinations were \"grossly normal.\" (TR. 27) It seems apparent that the ALJ's primary reason for discounting Bushman's opinion of Rector's\n   functional limitations was a perceived lack of supporting objective evidence in the medical record. The ALJ's rationale, however, fails to account for the idiosyncratic nature of Rector's diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rector suffers from fibromyalgia, \"a rheumatic disease that causes inflammation of the fibrous connective tissue components of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other tissues.\"\n   <em>\n    Benecke v.

Fibromyalgia does not result in objective medical signs. The ALJ unreasonably discounted Bushman's opinion based on his failure to supply something that does not exist. The ALJ, therefore, did not supply \"specific and legitimate\" reasons for discounting his opinion of Rector's functional limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benecke v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180220\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/587/#p589\">\n    379 F.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"The ALJ erred by effectively requiring 'objective' evidence for a disease that eludes such measurement.\") (punctuation modified);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Revels v.

The medical record does contain reports that Rector's medications were helping to control her pain. For example, \"[i]n July 2014, [Rector] reported that her medications helped control her pain and allowed her to do her activities of daily living.\" (Tr. 26) (citing Exhibit 8F at 16) \"In August 2014, [Rector] reported having had one of her best months in a long time.\" (Tr. 26) (citing Exhibit 8F at 16) And \"[o]n March 31, 2015, [Rector] reported that her pain was well controlled on her medications.\" (Tr. 26) (citing Exhibit 18F at 21) But the fact that Rector experiences periods of reduced pain does not mean that she has the ability to work in a sustained fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the hearing, Rector testified that she has good days and bad days. (Tr. 46) And on good days, she often tries to accomplish things around the house \"that have piled up.\" (Tr. 46) Unfortunately, when she does so, \"[f]or the next day or so, I'll be in bed, just trying to reciprocate [sic] from the previous day, usually.\" (Tr. 46) \"I'm not able to function like I should be able to function.\" (Tr. 46) She explained that in exchange for an active day, she must \"pay for it essentially.\" (Tr. 46)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The ALJ correctly states that the medical record contains reports that Rector's medications are controlling her pain, at least from time to time. This fact, however, is not a legitimate reason for discounting Bushman's opinion of her functional limitations. Bushman's evaluation of Rector's ability to perform work-related activities takes into account the fact that these activities must be performed throughout an 8-hour work day and a 5-day work week. (Tr. 296-297) Rector might be able to sustain a full 8-hour day of working from time to time, but there is no evidence that she could sustain this level of activity the following day and for the remainder of the work week.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Revels v.

As the Ninth Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   , \"our precedent and the objectives of the credit-as-true rule foreclose the argument that a remand for the purpose of allowing the ALJ to have a mulligan qualifies as a remand for a 'useful purpose' under the first part of credit-as-true analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrison v.
