R. Civ. P. 56(a). As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant's factual assertion can result in the movant's fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court need only consider disputed facts that are material to the decision. A disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Therein, with respect to Pittsboro, Plaintiffs allege that the town maintains an unconstitutional and illegal policy of intercepting, recording, and disclosing conversations. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that Chief Patterson and Major King's actions in intercepting, recording, and disclosing their private conversations constitute an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the Federal Wiretap Act. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Plaintiffs further allege that Captain Weber violated the Federal Wiretap Act by using and disclosing Plaintiffs' recorded conversations. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] On September 7, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 41\n   </em>\n   ], and that Motion is now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In support of their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants make one primary argument - that all of Plaintiffs' claims fail because Plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the lobby of the police department or the areas surrounding it. Thereafter, Defendants make several alternative arguments, each of which the Court will consider in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Expectation of Privacy under the Fourth Amendment and the Federal Wire Tap Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \"cannot demonstrate a reasonably objective expectation of privacy\" under the Fourth Amendment because the conversations at issue \"took place in an area where they could be overheard and recorded by the security camera in the public lobby of the Police Department,\" while the door to the police department was unlocked and the doors to the secure area of the police department and Matthew Stumm's office were open. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 9-10\n   </em>\n   .] Similarly, Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs cannot show that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversations at issue, they \"do not meet the Federal Wiretap Act definition of oral communication.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 10-11\n   </em>\n   .] Specifically, Defendants contend that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [t]he conversations took place in a public building, where they could be overheard in the public lobby. Plaintiffs did not\n   lock exterior doors to preclude others from entering the lobby and listening to the conversation. They did not close the door from the lobby to the secure area of the police department, nor did they close the door to [Matt] Stumm's office. They did not whisper or take any action that would prevent others from hearing their conversation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 11-12\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs contend that they \"did not believe that their conversations\" were being recorded \"because Chief Patterson told them they were not recorded.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Plaintiffs argue that they \"were entitled to rely on assurances they received from King and Patterson that their conversations would not be recorded.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 8\n   </em>\n   .] In addition, Plaintiffs argue that their \"expectation of privacy when they are alone in their office was objectively reasonable.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 8\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In their reply brief, Defendants reiterate their argument that \"there is no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in conversations that are had in the open and are not protected against being overheard.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 46 at 3\n   </em>\n   .] As such, Defendants argue that each of Plaintiffs' claims fail and that the Court need not reach the issue of whether the recordings were made intentionally.

However, these cases are inapposite to this case because Matt Stumm testified that he was not in the PPD lobby when he was recorded, but rather in his office just off of the lobby with the door open, or in the squad room. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-4 at 13\n   </em>\n   (\"Q. Let's talk about the conversations that were recorded .... A. The ones that I've seen were in my office and with just two people, and then the other ones we were in the squad room...\").] More analogous to the situation at hand is a Ninth Circuit case in which the defendants argued that a plaintiff's expectation of privacy was unreasonable given the physical characteristics of the plaintiff's office, combined with the fact that the plaintiff's office door was open.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Matt Stumm testified that when the camera was installed, Chief Patterson and Major King informed him that no audio recordings\n   would take place in the police department. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 43-1 at 17\n   </em>\n   .] Jason Stumm testified that at a subsequent department meeting in April or May 2014, Major King informed him and others that the camera had been installed in the lobby of the PPD due to the secretary not being able to see who came in the door, but that the camera would record video only, and no audio. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-6 at 3\n   </em>\n   .] Jason Stumm further testified that he was informed that the squad room of the PPD was a place where officers needed to be able to feel comfortable and have discussions without feeling that they were being recorded. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-6 at 3\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants' arguments ignore the Plaintiffs' evidence that PPD management informed them that they would not be subject to audio recording in the PPD offices, and what's more, Defendants' evidence contradicts Plaintiffs' evidence on this point. Major King testified that he and Chief Patterson did not tell Matt Stumm that officers were going to be recorded in the squad room, but did inform Matt Stumm that the cameras had audio capabilities. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-2 at 10\n   </em>\n   .] Major King then said, \"[w]e tested the system to make sure that with the door closed between the squad room and the lobby that it would not be - that conversations could not be heard with that door closed ... [but] that you could hear conversations with the door open,\" and that Matt Stumm was aware of these results because he was present for the tests. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-2 at 10-11\n   </em>\n   .] Similarly, Chief Patterson testified that she believed that all the officers at PPD knew that the building was video and audio recorded, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 27\n   </em>\n   ], and that the officers were never told expressly that they were not being audio recorded, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 28-29\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Whether these representations to Matt and Jason Stumm actually occurred is a question of material fact, as it goes to the very issue of whether the recordings in this case qualify as \"any oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Matt or Jason Stumm were explicitly told that their conversations were not being recorded, it follows that they would have \"an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception\" and would therefore qualify as an oral communication under the Federal Wiretap Act.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amati v.

As such, the Court need not determine whether the logistical and architectural facts at issue in this case created an expectation of privacy. Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the expectation of privacy element of all of Plaintiffs' claims, and the Court will now consider Defendants' alternative arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Brian Helmer's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   With respect to Brian Helmer, Defendants argue that \"[e]ven if the recordings fell within the protection of the Federal Wiretap Act or the Fourth Amendment, Brian Helmer has no claim to assert\" because \"there is no evidence that the lobby camera recorded any conversations of Brian Helmer outside of the lobby, or that Defendants listened to, used or disclosed, any such recordings.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 12\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge that recordings of Mr. Helmer \"are not part of the record\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   and that his \"oral communications were not used or disclosed by Defendants,\" but Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that \"the mere fact that recordings of him were not preserved does not mean that an intrusion into his privacy didn't occur.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 9\n   </em>\n   .] Instead, Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Helmer's conversations \"were necessarily intercepted every time he entered the building and spoke,\" and that each interception is a violation of the Federal Wiretap Act. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 9\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In their reply brief, Defendants argue that Mr. Helmer \"was required to come forward with evidence demonstrating that his objectively private conversations were recorded,\" and that \"there was no evidence that [Mr.] Helmer's private conversations were recorded.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 46 at 4\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Seventh Circuit has repeatedly stated, summary judgment \"is the 'put up or shut up' moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of events.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

For example, he testified that he is a plaintiff in this matter because after the internal affairs investigation, Matt Stumm informed Mr. Helmer that he was on one of the video recordings. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-5 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] He further testified that his concern was that there may be other recordings out there and that he had conversations with his wife \"in there\" and conversations in the squad room. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-5 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] However, Mr. Helmer has presented no evidence that the PPD lobby camera was activated and that any conversation of his was intercepted. The Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    McCann v. Iroquois Memorial Hospital\n   </em>\n   initially appears to support Mr. Helmer's position by noting that plaintiffs seeking relief under the Federal Wiretap Act \"need not produce direct evidence of the intentional interception; for often the only way to prove that a stealthy interception occurred is through circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n    622 F.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751-52 (7th Cir. 2010). But\n   <em>\n    McCann\n   </em>\n   turned on whether there was sufficient evidence to show that the interception was intentional, not upon whether there was an interception to begin with. The\n   <em>\n    McCann\n   </em>\n   court noted that \"[n]ecessary to all of the plaintiffs' claims ... is an intentional interception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n    at 751-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Seventh Circuit held that even if the recording had been made illegally, the hospital trustees \"could be liable only if they had reason to know the recording was made illegally and they used or disclosed the recording.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Noting that \"[o]n summary judgment we make reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor,\" the Court held that the evidence in\n   <em>\n    McCann\n   </em>\n   was \"too thin a reed on which to base a reasonable inference that [defendants] knew the recording was illegally obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 754. As such, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the hospital trustees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 754.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Similarly, in this case Captain Weber testified that she had no concerns that the recordings she received as part of the internal affairs investigation were illegally obtained due to the fact that her department has cameras recording audio and video throughout. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-3 at 13-14\n   </em>\n   .] In contrast, Plaintiffs presented no evidence other than their own conjecture that Captain Weber knew or should have known that the recordings were illegally obtained. Additionally, Plaintiffs present no evidence whatsoever that Captain Weber was on notice that Matt or Jason Stumm were told they were not being recorded. Based on the same principles set forth by the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    McCann\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' mere speculation is \"too thin a reed on which to base a reasonable inference\" that Captain Weber knew the recording was illegally obtained.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786812\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/745/#p751\">\n    622 F.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiffs' claims against Captain Carri Weber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether the PPD Lobby Recording was Intentional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants next argue that because the camera was placed in the lobby, any conversations occurring in areas outside of the lobby were recorded inadvertently. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 14\n   </em>\n   .] As such, Defendants contend that the recordings at issue in this case were not intercepted intentionally, such that the interceptions\n   violated the Federal Wiretap Act. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 14\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that \"a jury could infer\" that Chief Patterson knew that the cameras at issue had the ability to record inside the secure area of the PPD and that she was monitoring the cameras for statements of criticism or disloyalty. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 12\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs offer no evidence that would allow a jury to infer that the device was intended to make audio recordings inside the secured area of the PPD. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 46 at 4\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The parties do not point to any definitions of \"intent\" in Seventh Circuit cases; however, the Second Circuit, considering criminal charges under the Federal Wiretap Act, offered the following definition of \"intentionally\" - \"[b]efore you can find that the defendant acted intentionally, you must be satisfied ... that the defendant acted deliberately and purposefully; that is, defendant's act must have been the product of defendant's conscious objective rather than the product of a mistake or an accident.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515595\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/927/#p930\">\n    987 F.2d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (2d Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that Chief Patterson and Major King intended to intercept conversations at the PPD; rather, they argue that Chief Patterson and Major King's intent extended only to conversations that occurred in the PPD lobby and did not extend to conversations in the PPD offices. In her deposition, Chief Patterson testified that she tested activating the camera in the PPD lobby and ensuring that the camera shut off when the door to the secured portion of the PPD was closed. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 21\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 29\n   </em>\n   .] However, she did not testify about testing the camera system with the door to the secure portion of the PPD open. What Defendants ask this Court to do is to determine as a matter of law that Chief Patterson's and Major King's intent was limited in scope. However, \"the law presumes every man to intend the natural consequences of his acts,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Irwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362744\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/565/#p572\">\n    149 F.3d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572 (7th Cir. 1998), and at the summary judgment stage, the Court is required to view the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. A reasonable jury could find that the recordings at issue here were the product of Defendants' conscious objective and were, therefore, made with the requisite intent. As such, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to the issue of Chief Patterson's and Major King's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Whether the Town Had a Policy of Recording its Officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Lastly, Defendants argue that the town of Pittsboro is entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' claim that it \"maintains an unconstitutional and illegal policy of intercepting, recording, and disclosing the conversations of police personnel in areas that had been represented to officers as safe for private conversation,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28 at 6\n   </em>\n   ], because Pittsboro did not have such a policy, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 15\n   </em>\n   ]. In addition, Defendants contend that Pittsboro cannot be held liable for proof of a single incident of discovering and listening to such recordings. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42 at 15\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs contend they have brought this case \"against the Town of Pittsboro based to a large degree on the actions of [Chief] Patterson, who was at the time and remains Chief of Police\" and, as such, \"is the final policy maker for [her] municipal police department.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 13-14\n   </em>\n   .] Plaintiffs therefore contend that they have brought \"a valid\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim\" against Pittsboro because \"the municipality's policy or custom [was] made by\n   those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 44 at 13-14\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In response, Defendants argue that \"conversations in a public lobby do not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy\" so \"[r]ecording those conversations would not be unconstitutional and a practice of allowing such recordings would not provide a basis for an actionable\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 46 at 4\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To establish an official policy or custom under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

Plaintiffs contend that their case against Pittsboro is based on the third type of claim, wherein a person with final policymaking authority caused their constitutional deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants declined to brief the issue of whether the chief of police is a policymaker for\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   purposes. However, as Plaintiffs correctly contend, the Seventh Circuit has found that \"a police chief in Indiana is the final policymaker for [her] municipal police department.\"\n   <em>\n    Eversole v. Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179259\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/710/#p716\">\n    59 F.3d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-8-3-3\">\n    Ind.

Code \u00a7 36-8-3.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -11 ). Moreover, Chief Patterson's testimony indicates that initially installing cameras in the PPD lobby was her idea, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 43-4 at 3\n   </em>\n   (\"A. Approximately ... 2005 or 2006 was the first camera that we installed in the police department lobby. Q. Whose idea was it to do that? A. It was something that I wanted to have done\") ], and that subsequent installations were done in order to comply with changes in the law, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 16\n   </em>\n   (explaining that the 2010 camera replacement was to comply with a law that felony arrests should be recorded) ], and in order to deal with electrical interference, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 45-1 at 22\n   </em>\n   (discussing the 2016 installation) ]. Therefore, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, supports a finding that Chief Patterson had final policymaking authority over recordings made in the PPD lobby.
