D. 15. Pesce brings this lawsuit against Defendant Kevin F. Coppinger (\"Coppinger\"), in his official capacity as Sherriff of Essex County, and Aaron Eastman (\"Eastman\"), in his official capacity as Superintendent of the Essex County House of Corrections at Middleton, Massachusetts (\"Middleton\"), (collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging that Defendants' policy of denying inmates access to methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Eighth Amendment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . D. 1. Due to imminent probation and criminal matters pending against him in Essex County, including a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of sixty days, Pesce will be incarcerated at Middleton as early as December 3, 2018. Pesce seeks injunctive relief requiring that Defendants provide Pesce with access to his physician-prescribed methadone treatment. D. 12. For the reasons discussed below, Pesce's motion for preliminary injunction is ALLOWED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

D. 13 at 10-11; D. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, 9. Specifically, he suffers from a chronic disease known as opioid use disorder. D. 1 \u00b6 3; D. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20. This disease claims the lives of over one hundred Americans every day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Centers for Disease Control and\n   Prevention, Opioid Overdose: Understanding the Epidemic,\n   <em>\n    https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic\n   </em>\n   (last visited Nov. 20, 2018) (explaining that \"[o]n average, 115 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose\"). More than half a million people in the United States have died from opioid overdose in the last twenty years and the death toll has rapidly increased in the last five years. D. 1 \u00b6 22. Here in Massachusetts, opioid-related deaths have surpassed the national average and increased exponentially in the last two years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2782657\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/13/#p18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Massachusetts Department of Public Health, The Massachusetts Opioid Epidemic, A Data Visualization of Findings from the Chapter 55 Report,\n   <em>\n    http://www.mass.gov/chapter55\n   </em>\n   (last visited Nov. 20, 2018) ). Essex County, where Pesce resides, has had the second highest number of opioid-related deaths of any county in Massachusetts since 2013. D. 13 at 9; D. 14-1. In addition, the opioid-related death rate in Massachusetts is 120 times higher for people released from jails and prisons as compared to the rest of the adult population. D. 17-8 at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As with other chronic diseases, opioid use disorder involves cycles of relapse and remission. D. 1 \u00b6 21. Without treatment or other recovery, opioid use disorder may result in disability or premature death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2782657\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/13/#p18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Before entering active recovery, Pesce's battle with opioid use disorder caused him to lose his job, forced him to surrender custody of his son and rendered him effectively homeless. D. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 7-10. Pesce overdosed on opioids at least six times, and, on multiple occasions, paramedics administered Narcan to save his life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Pesce made numerous attempts to overcome his opioid addiction, including by enrolling in at least four detoxification programs and by taking medications such as buprenorphine (commonly known by the brand name Suboxone \u00ae) and naltrexone (commonly known by the brand name Vivitrol \u00ae).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; D. 19 \u00b6 6. None of these efforts were successful at helping Pesce maintain long-term recovery. D. 15 \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pesce was admitted into a treatment program for substance abuse at the Lahey Behavioral Services facility (\"Lahey\") in Danvers, Massachusetts in December 2016. D. 19 \u00b6 10. Pesce's physician there, Dr. Shorta Yuasa (\"Dr. Yuasa\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   prescribed medication-assisted treatment (\"MAT\") with methadone to treat Pesce's disorder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10. According to Dr. Yuasa, MAT is the \"standard of care for treatment of opioid use disorders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. MAT involves the use of FDA-approved pharmaceutical medications, including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, in combination with counseling, behavioral therapy and other interventions for the treatment of substance use disorders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As part of his decision to prescribe methadone, Dr. Yuasa considered, among other things, the length and severity of Pesce's addiction to opioids and his previously unsuccessful attempts to achieve long-term recovery using buprenorphine and naltrexone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In Dr. Yuasa's experience, \"there are some people for whom buprenorphine and naltrexone simply do not work, and [Pesce's] history suggests that he is one of those people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since late 2016, Pesce has received a daily dosage of methadone in liquid form at Lahey. D. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 44 \u00b6 8 (explaining that methadone is a liquid that is administered orally). With this methadone\n   treatment, Pesce has been in active recovery from opioid use disorder for almost two years. D. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; D. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 14-22. During this time, Pesce has not had a positive drug screening and he has not intentionally missed a day of treatment. D. 19 \u00b6 13. He is working again as a machinist, contributes financially to his family and is able to spend time with his son. D. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Pesce is now able to take home and self-administer a three-day dosage of methadone. D. 19 \u00b6 14. Nevertheless, Dr. Yuasa opines that Pesce must continue to use methadone as part of his ongoing recovery as he is not ready to be tapered off his medication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. According to Dr. Yuasa, without methadone treatment, Pesce will no longer be in remission from active addiction and his tolerance for opioids will diminish significantly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Dr. Yuasa has treated numerous patients who have relapsed, overdosed and died after being denied access to MAT during incarceration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Pesce's Current Criminal Matters\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pesce has two criminal matters pending in Essex County. In March 2016, prior to his recovery, Pesce was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs. D. 26; D. 26-2 \u00b6 3. Pesce entered a guilty plea in September 2017 and received a sixty-day sentence that was suspended under the condition that he successfully complete probation, set to expire in September 2019. D. 26-2 \u00b6 3; D. 26-1 \u00b6 2. In July 2018, while still on probation, Pesce was pulled over on the way to Lahey and charged with driving with a revoked or suspended license. D. 26-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The criminal charge for driving with a revoked or suspended license constituted a violation of the terms of Pesce's probation. D. 26-2 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pesce must now appear in Lynn District Court for a probation violation hearing on December 3, 2018. D. 31. At that hearing, as a sanction for violation of the terms of his probation, the court could impose the sentence of sixty days previously imposed, but suspended. D. 26-2 \u00b6 5. On January 14, 2019, Pesce must appear in Ipswich District Court for entry of a guilty plea and sentencing for driving with a revoked or suspended license in July 2018. D. 31 at 1. That charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of sixty days pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 26-1 \u00b6 4. The parties agree he would serve any sentence imposed upon him at either hearing at Middleton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 26 at 4; D. 13 at 12-13: D. 41 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Middleton does not currently provide methadone treatment to its inmates, Pesce attempted to taper down his methadone prescription in anticipation of going through forced withdrawal upon incarceration. D. 19 \u00b6 16. When Pesce reduced his methadone dosage from 120 mg per day to 20 mg per day, he became sick, suffered from insomnia and felt anxious, unmotivated, fatigued and depressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Dr. Yuasa, Pesce's reaction to a reduced dosage indicates that he should be taking between 80 and 100 mg of methadone a day to treat his opioid use disorder properly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Yuasa opines that sudden, involuntary withdrawal of treatment will cause Pesce \"severe and needless suffering, jeopardize[s] his long-term recovery and is inconsistent with sound medical practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Dr. Yuasa believes that denying Pesce \"medically necessary\" methadone treatment will place him at a high risk of overdose and death upon his release from Middleton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21-22 (explaining that disruption of MAT has \"long-term consequences for inmates during and after their incarceration,\" including inability to successfully resume methadone treatment after release, loss of opioid tolerance and risk of fatal overdose upon\n   re-exposure to even small amounts of certain drugs, especially in the first thirty days after returning to society).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pesce's counsel sent a letter, dated September 11, 2018, to Defendants, who are responsible for the housing and care of Middleton's incarcerated population, D. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, requesting assurance that Pesce will be allowed to continue methadone treatment during his time in custody. D. 13 at 14; D. 14-2. The letter requested a response by September 17, 2018, but the Court understands that Defendants had not responded to the letter as of Pesce's filings a few days later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Essex County House of Corrections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To create an environment where individuals can \"safely\" withdraw from opioid addiction, Middleton is committed to maintaining a drug-free environment. D. 41-15 \u00b6 12. Consistent with the majority of correctional facilities in Massachusetts, Middleton expressly prohibits opioids like suboxone and methadone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. As part of its substance abuse treatment program, Middleton requires incarcerated individuals to undergo forced withdrawal under medical supervision, followed by a treatment plan that includes substance abuse therapy, educational programming, re-entry services and after-care treatment upon release to the community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. During the forced withdrawal process, individuals may receive non-opioid medication to mitigate their symptoms. D. 41-13 \u00b6 6 (explaining that individuals may receive \"Ibuprofen for pain, Bentyl for stomach cramps, Imodium for diarrhea, Zofran for nausea, Maalox for indigestion and Clonidine for anxiety and/or elevated blood pressure\"). In some cases, Middleton administers Vivitrol\u00ae at the end of a term of incarceration on the eve of release. D. 41-15 \u00b6 6; 41-13 \u00b6 10 (describing Vivitrol\u00ae as a \"non-opioid medication aimed at preventing substance abuse relapse\"). The non-opioid treatment program implemented in Essex County correctional facilities, including Middleton, was recently awarded a three-year, $1.5 million grant from the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. D. 41 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 19, 2018, Pesce instituted this lawsuit, D. 1, and filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. D. 12. The next day, Pesce filed an emergency motion for an expedited briefing schedule and hearing. D. 20. As support for the motion, Pesce asserted that he was scheduled to appear in a pending criminal case on September 24, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The motion was denied given the Court's interest in giving full consideration to the arguments by both sides and in the absence of an explanation of why Pesce could not seek a continuance of his criminal matter. D. 25. Shortly thereafter, Pesce informed the Court that his new criminal case was continued to January 14, 2019 and that he was scheduled to appear for a probation revocation hearing on December 3, 2018. D. 31. On November 5, 2018, the Court heard the parties on Pesce's motion for injunctive relief and took the matter under advisement. D. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Pesce's Claims are Ripe\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pesce seeks injunctive relief requiring that Defendants provide him with access to methadone treatment while he is incarcerated. Defendants contend that Pesce's claims are not ripe for adjudication since there is \"uncertainty\" about what sentence Pesce will receive during his probation revocation hearing on December 3, 2018 and in the matter scheduled for his plea and sentencing on January 14, 2019. D. 41 at 4. The ripeness doctrine \"asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen to warrant judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Gun Owners' Action League, Inc. v.

D. 41 at 4. Pesce has two pending criminal matters in Essex County. On December 3, 2018, Pesce must appear in Lynn District Court for a probation violation hearing. D. 31. If the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that Pesce's new criminal offense constitutes a violation of his probation, Pesce could be ordered to serve his previously suspended sixty-day sentence. D. 26-2 \u00b6\u00b6 3-9 (explaining that the district court need only find by a preponderance of the evidence that Pesce is guilty of violating his probation to revoke the same and order him to serve the suspended sentence of sixty days, which would start immediately). In addition, on January 14, 2019, Pesce must appear in Ipswich District Court for entry of a guilty plea and sentencing for driving with a revoked or suspended license in July 2018. D. 31. Pesce attests that he will plead guilty to this offense, D. 15 \u00b6 26, which carries a mandatory minimum penalty of not less than sixty days and not more than two and a half years, D. 26-1 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court is, therefore, satisfied that Pesce's impending incarceration renders this case ripe for judicial review. Pesce faces a sixty-day sentence for violation of his probation which was previously imposed but suspended,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D. 26-2 \u00b6 5, and a sixty-day mandatory minimum sentence for driving with a suspended or revoked license due to operating under the\n   influence of alcohol or drugs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mass.

Regardless of any continuances he may receive, Pesce will join Middleton's incarcerated population given the pending mandatory minimum sentence and, on his first day there, he will be denied the methadone treatment he has received on a near-daily basis since late 2016. D. 41 at 5 (explaining that Middleton does not provide opioid treatment to inmates).

Dr. Yuasa also explained that Pesce risks severe physical and mental illness, relapse into opioid addiction and death if he is denied access to methadone and subjected to Defendants' treatment program. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 20-27. Defendants, in lieu of conducting an individualized assessment of Pesce's medical needs or his physician's recommendation, would require Pesce to participate in a treatment program that bares strong resemblance to the methods that failed Pesce for five years, including detoxification, D. 13 at 11 (describing Pesce's four unsuccessful attempts at detoxification\n   programs), and administration of Vivitrol\u00ae, D. 15 \u00b6 12 (explaining that the same is ineffective as it pertains to Pesce). Not only would Defendants' treatment program contradict Pesce's physician's recommendations and place Pesce at a higher risk of relapse upon his release from Middleton, but it would also make him physically ill for several days while he undergoes forced withdrawal.

Defendants also note that courts in other districts have\n   held that prison officials did not violate the Eighth Amendment where the medical treatment provided differed from what the plaintiff (as opposed to a physician or other medical professional) requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Love v.

Pa. Nov. 28, 2016) (concluding there was no Eighth Amendment violation where prison official refused to provide methadone treatment despite plaintiff's unsupported assertion that he had a prescription). Here, however, Pesce alleges that Defendants' course of treatment ignores and contradicts his physician's recommendations. In the First Circuit, \"[a]llegations that prison officials denied or delayed recommended treatment by medical professionals may be sufficient to satisfy the deliberate indifference standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Because Pesce has alleged that Defendants' policy \"ignore[s] treatment prescriptions given to Plaintiff by [his] doctors,\" the Court concludes that, on the present record, Pesce is likely to succeed on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim.\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5910989\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/486/#p493\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiff, who alleged that prison officials repeatedly ignored her physician's recommendations, stated sufficient facts to establish an Eighth Amendment violation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Irreparable Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To obtain injunctive relief, Pesce must also show a \"significant risk of irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld.\"\n   <em>\n    Nieves-M\u00e1rquez v.

Pesce will be irreparably harmed if denied methadone treatment while incarcerated. D. 15 \u00b6\u00b6 11-16 (describing Pesce's unsuccessful attempts at sobriety, including through the use of detoxification programs, living in half-way houses, and attending group and individual therapy). After overdosing three times in less than twenty-four hours, Pesce enrolled in the methadone treatment program that helped him reclaim his life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. According to the physician who first diagnosed and treated his condition, Pesce presents a \"high risk of overdose and death upon his release\" if not treated during his incarceration at Middleton. D. 19 \u00b6 24. Indeed, \"[o]ver 82% of patients who leave methadone treatment relapse to intravenous drug use within a year,\" and \"[d]eath is three times as likely for people out of treatment versus when in treatment.\" D. 18 \u00b6 36. Unfortunately, the statistics become even more alarming when considering incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals. D. 17 \u00b6 22 (explaining that the \"opioid-related overdose death rate is 120 times higher for people released from jails and prisons compared to the rest of the adult population\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (noting that \"nearly 50 percent of all deaths among those released from incarceration were opioid-related\" and the \"vast majority of these deaths occurred within one month after release\"). Pesce, therefore, has established a reasonable likelihood of irreparable harm if denied injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The final considerations in weighing the grant of a preliminary injunction are \"a balance of equities in the plaintiff's favor, and [ ] service of the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Arborjet, Inc. v.

The Court acknowledges that prison officials must prioritize legitimate security concerns in determining whether to introduce opioids to incarcerated populations. The Court also accords substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators.\n   <em>\n    Overton v.

With respect to this plaintiff and based on this particular record, however, the Court concludes that the balance of harms between the parties tips in Pesce's favor and the public interest is better served by ensuring Pesce receives the medically necessary treatment that will ensure he remains in active recovery. That Pesce has established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits tips the balance of interests in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For these reasons, Pesce's motion for preliminary injunction, D. 12, is ALLOWED. The parties did not address the issue of security for the granting of such motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). Accordingly, the Court has not set security with the issuance of this Order.
