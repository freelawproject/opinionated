In their joint stipulations of fact, the parties agree that the Wake County Sheriff's Office's decision to require plaintiff to register as a sex offender was based on the determination that plaintiff's 2004 conviction in Washington was \"substantially similar\" to a reportable conviction in North Carolina. [DE 33-2, p. 1]. They further stipulated that this determination was made by a deputy in the sheriff's office, that the deputy had the authority to make that determination without consultation with the Wake County District Attorney's Office or the North Carolina Attorney General's Office, and that North Carolina law does not \"require a court hearing or other process\" prior to determining that a sex offender must register on the basis of substantial similarity. [DE 33-2, p. 2]. In fact, \"[t]he process to determine whether an out-of-state conviction is 'substantially similar' to a North Carolina reportable conviction is not set out in any official statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9320062\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties also agreed that the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-208.14\">\n    N.C.

Defendants \"do not concede that placement on the [sex offender registry] is itself an injury that would satisfy the first prong of standing,\" but argue that the injury cannot be traced to them and cannot be redressed in the present lawsuit. [DE 35, p. 4-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants argue that they cannot be held responsible for plaintiff's injury because only the Wake County Sheriff's Office is responsible for determining whether plaintiff's out-of-state sex offense is \"substantially similar\" to a reportable conviction in North Carolina. But in advancing this argument, they misconstrue plaintiff's position. Plaintiff seeks not to remedy the fact that he was placed on the sex offender registry, but the fact that he could be placed on it again tomorrow, next month, or next year-without any process whatsoever, let alone adequate process under the Constitution. \"Plaintiff seeks protection from the enforcement of criminal laws applicable solely to registrants.\" [DE 37, p. 3; DE 1, \u00b6 16]. The injury that satisfies the first standing prong, then, is not the June 2017 incident, but the ongoing unpredictability of plaintiff's legal circumstances. Defendants rely on the fact that they are not\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   requiring plaintiff to register as a sex offender to argue, in turn, that plaintiff lacks standing or his claims are moot; but North Carolina has not modified its procedures for determining whether an out-of-state offense is \"substantially similar\" and defendants have given no reason why plaintiff could not be required to register as a sex offender in North Carolina in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Schurmeier, in his official capacity as Director of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, is responsible for administering the sex offender registry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-208.14\">\n    N.C.

This is not an archaic, vestigial law which is rarely enforced; rather, as seen by plaintiff's placement on the registry thirteen years after moving to North Carolina, the sheriff's office in the county where plaintiff resides, now or in the future, can make the determination to place plaintiff on it again. In making such a determination, the sheriff's office would afford plaintiff neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard.

Defendant Waters has stated that he \"sees no reason to prosecute plaintiff because plaintiff is not required to register as a sex offender.\" [DE 35, p. 8]. But this is not sufficient to remove plaintiff's \"actual and well-founded fear\" of being required to register as a sex offender again and being prosecuted if he fails to register. The decision of whether or not to require plaintiff to register rests, at the moment, with the sheriff's office in Franklin County, where plaintiff now resides. If he moves to a different county, that county's sheriff, too, will be able to determine whether plaintiff's out-of-state offense is \"substantially similar\" to a reportable conviction in North Carolina. And again, as in June 2017, plaintiff will receive no notice and no opportunity to be heard prior to the determination that he must register. None of the defendants have disclaimed the authority to place plaintiff on the state-wide registry if he is forced to register, and none have disclaimed the authority to prosecute plaintiff if he is required to register but fails to do so. The injury which plaintiff complains of, the violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, is ongoing and he faces a \"credible threat of prosecution.\" Plaintiff meets the first\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants also argue, however, that plaintiff does not meet the second\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   requirement because he seeks retroactive relief. Again, defendants erroneously conclude that plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief are moot, and therefore address only the appropriateness of plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception encompasses only suits for prospective relief.\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v.

Defendants argue, categorically and incorrectly, that \"[a] declaratory judgment constitutes retrospective relief.\" [DE 35, p. 9]. While there are certainly claims for declaratory judgment that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   retroactive, and one example can be found in\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Each of the cases defendants cite deals with an alleged constitutional violation that has been in some way remedied, either\n   through the repeal of a statute or the amendment of a procedure. No such change has been made to North Carolina's process for determining whether out-of-state offenses are \"substantially similar\" to reportable convictions in North Carolina. Accordingly, plaintiff's claim for a declaration that this process, through which he was required to register as a sex offender in June 2017 and might be required to register again, is constitutionally inadequate is a claim for purely prospective relief. It does not fall afoul of\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief are, similarly, prospective. Thus, plaintiff's claims fit squarely within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception, and defendants may not claim Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In their motion for summary judgment, defendants make no arguments concerning the merits of plaintiff's procedural due process claims. Because both of defendants' arguments, that plaintiff lacks standing to sue them and that they are immune from suit, are legally deficient, defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    II. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, the Court turns to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff argues that there are no genuine disputes as to any material facts and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court agrees, finding that North Carolina's process for requiring individuals who have committed out-of-state sex offenses to register as sex offenders in North Carolina (1) deprives plaintiff of a cognizable liberty interest and (2) the procedures protecting that interest were constitutionally inadequate. Thus, plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his procedural due process claim, and his motion must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As discussed above, both parties have successfully established that there are no genuine disputes as to any material facts. The only question that remains, then, is whether plaintiff has established that his constitutional rights are being violated. Procedural due process is implicated when the state alters or extinguishes a previously recognized right or status.\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

In determining that an individual must register as a sex offender because his out-of-state conviction is \"substantially similar\" to a reportable conviction, North Carolina provides neither prior notice nor a hearing. In fact, North Carolina provides nothing at all. Rather, each county sheriff's office can decide unilaterally whether any out-of-state offense is \"substantially similar\" to any reportable North Carolina conviction. The sheriff's deputies responsible for making the determinations do not need to consult with legal counsel, even though substantial similarity has been described as a \"question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

No evidentiary hearings are held. The registrants are given no opportunity to provide input. The substantial similarity determinations are final and result in individuals being forced to register within days or face felony prosecution; there is no opportunity to appeal. There is no statute, regulation, policy, or ordinance outlining the determination process, listing factors that are considered, or identifying who is responsible for making the determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The substantial similarity determination is a complicated one. Plaintiff argues that \"in every analogous context, North Carolina law requires that [the substantial similarity determination] be made by a judge in a formal evidentiary hearing.\" [DE 33, p. 8]. In determining \"recidivist\" status for the purposes of imposing satellite-based monitoring, substantial similarity must be determined by the North Carolina trial judge following the state's presentation of evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, North Carolina is not the first state to vest the power to make substantial similarity determinations in sheriff's deputies, without further process, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creekmore v. Attorney General of Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155410\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/341/648/#p666\">\n    341 F.Supp.2d 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (E.D. Tex. 2004) (finding a due process violation where sheriff's deputy required registration based on a \"substantially similar\" offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, defendants raised three arguments that the existing procedures are sufficient: first, that plaintiff received due process\n   when originally convicted; second, that the availability of a declaratory judgment action provides due process; and third, that there is an effective post-registration removal process. [DE 15, p. 15-16]. The Court has already rejected each of these three arguments. [DE 30]. In sum, the due process that plaintiff received in Washington during his initial prosecution was not sufficient to protect him from the subsequent deprivation of liberty effected thirteen years after he moved to North Carolina, which could be readily repeated in the future. The ability to file a lawsuit in state court challenging the registration requirement does not provide sufficient process, either. And the mechanism provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-208\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .12A, permitting registrants to petition to have their registration requirement terminated after ten years and in specific circumstances, also does not provide sufficient process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, plaintiff has adequately demonstrated that North Carolina's process of determining whether out-of-state offenses are \"substantially similar\" to reportable convictions in North Carolina violates his procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff possesses a protected liberty interest, was deprived of that interest without sufficient process, and might be deprived of that interest again in the near future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    III.
