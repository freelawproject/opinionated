Hanen, United States District Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Omar Hernandez Lozano (\"Hernandez Lozano\") and Juan Gabriel Ruiz-Baena (\"Ruiz-Baena\") are charged with illegal reentry into the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and \u00a7 1326(a) respectively. They seek to have their indictments dismissed because the Notices to Appear (\"NTA\") in their underlying deportations did not specify an exact time and location to appear. Hernandez Lozano claims that this omission voids not only his initial 1999 deportation, but all of his subsequent removals, while Ruiz-Baena makes similar claims as to his 2015 deportation. Consequently, they both claim this flaw in their underlying immigration proceedings deals a fatal blow to the Government's current attempts to prosecute them for illegal reentry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hernandez Lozano\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The pertinent facts do not seem to be a source of controversy. Hernandez Lozano is a citizen of Mexico who entered into the United States in October 1997 pursuant to a non-immigrant visa. He was given permission to remain in the United States for six months. In April of 1999-well beyond the six-month period-he was arrested in Houston, Texas, for the offense of Endangering a Child. He later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of deadly conduct, a Class A misdemeanor, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After being released from jail he was placed in the custody of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (hereinafter \"INS\"). While in INS custody, he was served with a Notice to Appear before an immigration judge for the purpose of a deportation hearing. The pertinent portion of that notice is reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As one can readily see, no hearing time or location was included in this notice. Instead the NTA indicates that the hearing will be calendared and notice will be given. This lack of specificity is the genesis of Hernandez Lozano's Motion to Dismiss the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hernandez Lozano signed the above notice to acknowledge receipt, waived his ten-day waiting period, and requested an immediate hearing. Five days later the hearing was held. He attended the hearing and conceded the underlying facts. The immigration judge ordered Hernandez Lozano to be removed to Mexico-the country of which he is a citizen. He waived his appeal and was deported the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since that deportation Hernandez Lozano returned to the United States illegally at least five more times. He was deported/removed in 2000 after being convicted of Burglary of a Habitation, in 2007, in 2009 after being convicted of Assault on a Family Member, in 2011 after being convicted of Harassment of a Public Servant, and in 2014 after having been convicted of Illegal Reentry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ruiz-Baena\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Juan Gabriel Ruiz-Baena also moves to dismiss the illegal reentry indictment against him. While the facts concerning his background and deportation are similar, they contain some differences from those concerning Hernandez Lozano.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ruiz-Baena is a citizen of Mexico. He entered the United States illegally some time prior to September 27, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   when he was arrested in Houston, Texas, for Assault Family Violence and Evading Arrest. Three days later he was released on bond from the Harris County jail to the custody of immigration officials. He received a Notice to Appear in which the blank for the location and time of the hearing was filled in with \"[t]ime and date to be set.\" His actual NTA language is set out below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ruiz-Baena signed the notice and waived his right to the ten-day waiting period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 7, 2015, he was warranted back to state custody to deal with the two pending criminal charges. On October 27, he pleaded guilty to both state charges and was sentenced to 80 days in jail on each count to run concurrently. While Ruiz-Baena was in state custody, the immigration proceedings were suspended. When Ruiz-Baena was released from state custody on November 4, 2015, he was once again turned over to the immigration authorities and was re-calendared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   His deportation hearing was held on December 17, 2015. He attended the hearing, participated, and was ultimately ordered to be deported. He waived his right to appeal this order and was deported on December 21, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ruiz-Baena re-entered the United States some time thereafter and was once again arrested for assault on September 25, 2017. This time he was charged with a third-degree felony assault on a family member. He pleaded guilty on November 9, 2017 to the assault charge and was sentenced to two (2) years in prison. After serving this sentence and being released to federal immigration authorities, Ruiz-Baena was charged with the instant offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Claims of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hernandez Lozano claims that all his deportations (except for the original one) relate back to or are reinstatements of his 1999 removal and that his original 1999 removal was defective due to the lack of a designated time and place on the NTA. He claims that because of this defective notice, the immigration court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and thus his 1999 deportation was invalid and void. Consequently, he argues that there is no valid removal on which to base an illegal reentry indictment. Ruiz-Baena claims his 2015 deportation was void and the pending illegal reentry indictment are defective for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The United States (\"Government\") argues that these claims distort the two Supreme Court cases upon which Defendants rely and that not only were both Defendants informed of the date, time, and location of their respective hearings, but it is beyond dispute that each attended and participated. As a result, the Government contends that whatever ambiguities or defects may have existed in the original notices were cured by subsequent actual notice and that each immigration judge had jurisdiction when each Defendant was ordered deported. Further, the Government argues that these motions to dismiss the indictments are impermissible collateral attacks on the orders of removal and as such are contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both sides cite multiple court decisions which support their respective positions. Consequently, this Court has a number of different opinions from which to seek guidance. (See Appendix \"A\" for a list of opinions which support the position of the Defendants\n   and Appendix \"B\" for a list of opinions supporting the Government's position.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Supreme Court Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While this Court has reviewed quite a number of opinions from a wide variety of different jurisdictions, the obvious starting point is the two Supreme Court cases underlying the Defendants' position:\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    481 U.S. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is not a criminal case, it is the genesis of the Defendants' arguments. In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reviewed a Notice to Appear containing \"notice\" provisions similar to those cited in the instant cases but in a civil context. The exact question the Court answered was framed by Justice Sotomayor, the author of the majority opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, the dispositive question in this case is much narrower, but no less vital: Does a \"notice to appear\" that does not specify the \"time and place at which the proceedings will be held,\" as requested by \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger the stop-time rule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, the basic issue was whether \"... if the Government serves a noncitizen with a document that is labeled 'notice to appear,' but the document fails to specify either the time or the place of the removal proceedings, does it trigger the stop-time rule [found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) and which stops the time for which an alien might qualify for cancellation of removal].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 2110. It is important to note that Pereira never received any notice of the time and place of the hearing and as a consequence did not attend the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Supreme Court held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ... common sense compels the conclusion that a notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a removal proceeding is not a \"notice to appear\" that triggers the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    If the three words \"notice to appear\" mean anything in this context, they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government has to provide noncitizens \"notice\" of the information, i.e., the \"time\" and \"place,\" that would enable them \"to appear\" at the removal hearing in the first place\n   </em>\n   . Conveying such time-and-place information to a noncitizen is an essential function of a notice to appear, for without it, the Government cannot reasonably expect the noncitizen to appear for his removal proceedings. To hold otherwise would empower the Government to trigger the stop-time rule merely by sending noncitizens a barebones document labeled \"Notice to Appear,\" with no mention of the time and place of the removal proceedings, even though such documents would do little if anything to facilitate appearance at those proceedings. \" 'We are not willing to impute to Congress ... such [a] contradictory and absurd purpose,' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The majority opinion emphasized that the Court was only answering the narrow question posed to it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   It therefore follows that, if a \"notice to appear\" for purposes of \u00a7 1229(b)(1) must include the time-and-place information, a \"notice to appear\" for purposes of the stop-time rule under \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) must as well. After all, \"it is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to\n   have the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p571\">\n    566 U.S. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p571\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p571\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2115. The instant cases obviously do not involve the stop-time rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   is a criminal case that discusses the very statute under which Hernandez Lozano and Ruiz-Baena are charged. In that case, the Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant in a \u00a7 1326 case could collaterally attack his prior deportation. In that case it was conceded, for purposes of the appeal, that the group of deportees, including the Respondent, were deported in proceedings that did not comport with due process requirements. Because the prior deportation is an element of a 1326 violation, the Court held that if the prior deportation involved a lack of due process, the Respondent could collaterally attack the current illegal reentry prosecution. Many courts throughout the nation have subsequently reached similar conclusions if there were underlying due process deprivations in the deportation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Application of These Supreme Court Decisions to the Instant Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants' attack on their pending indictments really involves two interrelated questions: 1) Can they collaterally attack their prior removals in this 1326 criminal case; and 2) Are their prior deportations void? The Court will take them in reverse order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Validity of The Prior Removals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants essentially claim that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that a NTA without the exact time and date of the deportation hearing renders the entire hearing process jurisdictionally fatal. They contend that if the notice was flawed, then the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction and any subsequent deportation is void and of no effect. Moreover, their argument further suggests that this notice, if initially defective, cannot later be remedied by actual notice. In support of their contentions Defendants cite an array of district court cases from throughout the country including many from this Circuit and this District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the reasoning in support of Defendants' position is fairly consistent between cases, this Court will address their reasoning generally through the discussion of one or two cases, as well as the applicable statutory and regulatory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Initially,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which sets the requirements for the contents of a NTA, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In removal proceedings under section 1229(a) of this title, written notice shall be given in person to the alien ... specifying the following: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (G)(i) the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Current immigration regulations provide that \"jurisdiction [in the immigration court] vests ... when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Some courts have concluded that if the initial Notice to Appear is lacking in any manner, it does not constitute a Notice to Appear. If it does not constitute a Notice to Appear, then those courts conclude the immigration judge did not have jurisdiction. Without the removal must be void. If the removal is void, the alien cannot subsequently be prosecuted for illegal reentry.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pedroza-Rocha\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-CR-1286,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206629649\">\n    2018 WL 6629649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

Supp. 3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Wash. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-CR-2593, Dkt. No. 32 (W.D. Tex.

Tex. 2018). These cases necessarily entail a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   in that they explicitly hold that the Supreme Court found that no jurisdiction exists if a specific time and place is not included on the initial NTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This Court cannot agree with that basic proposition because the Supreme Court never made such a holding. In fact, it is clear that the majority opinion was purposefully narrow. The word \"jurisdiction\" does not appear anywhere in the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   majority opinion. To read that requirement into the majority's opinion either assumes that the majority of the Supreme Court did not understand the significance of that term or that they were purposefully trying to hide the opinion's real meaning from the rest of the federal judiciary. This Court will not presume either. If the Supreme Court had wanted to reach this result it could have easily held that the failure to include the time and place of a hearing in the NTA is jurisdictional. It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Indeed, the Fifth Circuit has already noted that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is to be narrowly read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

As the Supreme Court emphasized, \"[t]he narrow question in [that] case\" was whether a NTA that does not specify the time or place of the removal hearing triggers the \"stop-time rule\" for purposes of a cancellation of removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2109-10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he dispositive question in this case is much narrower[.]\").

Second, the appellant in that case never received notice of his hearing and never appeared for or participated in that hearing. Here, the \"stop-time rule\" is not at issue. Moreover, despite the statutory defect in his initial NTA, Defendant appeared for his hearing on October 19, 2000, and at the hearing had an opportunity to be heard. Defendant was then personally served with a Notice of Hearing indicating the date, time, and place for his second and third hearings, where he also appeared and had an opportunity to be heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, given that Defendant appeared for his initial removal hearing on October 19, 2000, along with two subsequent hearings, any statutory defect in the initial NTA was cured.

Tex. 2018) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This Court agrees. In the instant cases Defendants cannot prevail on any of the prongs of \u00a7 1326(d), despite the requirement that they must prevail on all three. The Defendants' sole argument in the instant cases is that the immigration judge did not have jurisdiction because of the lack of specificity in the initial NTAs. Both defendants were subsequently given adequate notice. They appeared and participated. They also had more than adequate opportunities for judicial reviews which they both rejected. They both knowingly waived their appellate rights and did not pursue either administrative or judicial remedies. They even admitted the allegations supporting their removals. Consequently, there was nothing fundamentally unfair about the deportations in either case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This Court denies the motions to dismiss the indictments in question. Neither the legislation passed by Congress nor the dictates of the Supreme Court suggest that the immigration judges in question in either case lacked jurisdiction. The Defendants had actual notice, appeared and participated in their respective hearings, and admitted their removability. At most,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   suggests that the removals in some circumstances might be voidable if the NTA lacked times and locations and if, as in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the immigrant did not get notice and could not appear. These defenses might be the basis of a conclusion that the\n   removals were voidable, but they do render the proceedings in question here void. This Court holds that the lack of specificity in the NTAs in question do not render the proceedings to be\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   void due to lack of jurisdiction. Even if the lack of a time and location in the NTA rendered these notices deficient, such that they were open to challenge, these deficiencies were cured by actual notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This Court further holds the Defendants cannot collaterally attack their removals as neither has met the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d). They have not even tried to show that they exhausted their administrative remedies or that they were deprived of their judicial appellate rights. Aside from their theoretical jurisdiction argument, the Defendants have not tried to demonstrate that any aspect of the removal proceedings or the subsequent entry of the removal order were fundamentally unfair. Therefore, the motions to dismiss the indictments are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    Appendix A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Cases Supporting the Dismissal of the Indictment\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
