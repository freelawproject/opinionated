did not receive a contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fradella's, another body shop, sought admission to the Select Service Program in 2010, but at that time there were already five shops participating in Slidell and hence no need for another shop to be admitted to the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fradella's was admitted to the Select Service Program in May of 2011, shortly after another Slidell shop was removed from the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 26, 2011, BBC sent a letter to State Farm inquiring about admission into State Farm's Select Service Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, there were five Select Service shops operating in Slidell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm replied to BBC on November 22, 2011, advising BBC that State Farm was not considering BCC for admission to the program at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm further stated it would reconsider that decision should its business needs change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC again inquired about admission into State Farm's Select Service Program in early 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the spring of 2014, there were five Slidell shops in the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same five Slidell shops had participated in the Select Service Program from October of 2011 until the spring of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm responded to BBC's inquiry on March 5, 2014, stating it was not considering BBC for admission to its Select Service Program at that time and again stating it would reconsider its decision should its business needs change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the March 5, 2011 letter, State Farm and BBC continued to communicate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm employees Ramona Latiolais and Kevin Barras visited BBC on July 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   State Farm asserts it is undisputed that, at the time BBC inquired about admission to the Select Service Program in October of 2011 and March of 2014 and when State Farm employees visited BBC in July of 2014, State Farm was not considering adding shops to the program and, as a result, there was no available contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm employee Ramona Latiolais testified that, \"[f]rom May 2011 through 2014,\" the same five Slidell body shops participated\n   in the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Latiolais also testified that, at the time BBC sought admission to the Select Service Program in October of 2011 and March of 2014, there was no need for an additional Slidell shop in the Select Service Program because the five Select Service shops in Slidell were sufficient for State Farm's business and customer needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm employee Kevin Barras testified that there was no business need to add another Slidell shop to the Select Service Program when he visited BBC in July of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm argues that this evidence establishes that no contract was available at the times BBC applied for the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BBC disputes the facts asserted by State Farm relating to the availability of a contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish that a material fact exists with respect to whether there was an available contract in July of 2014, BBC points to the email communications surrounding the July 10, 2014 visit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm's documentation after the visit reflects that employees Ramona Latiolais and Kevin Barras visited the shop, \"stayed about an hour ... and ended with Kevin asking Mr. Cook to stay in touch with me and whenever we have a need to add a Select Service shop in the Slidell area he would be one of the first to look at.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC also points to the fact that, when State Farm rejected BBC for the program in October of 2011 and March of 2014, State Farm did not indicate that it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have any available contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC argues these combined circumstances \"g[a]ve BBC the impression that [State Farm] had available contracts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although BBC may have had the \"impression\" that State Farm had an available contract, this is not enough to create a disputed issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to BBC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   and assuming the factual allegations put forth by BBC are true, no reasonable trier of fact could find that State Farm had an available contract in July of 2014. BBC has not directed the Court's attention to \"evidence already in the record that was overlooked or ignored\" by State Farm that is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether there was an available contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds there are no disputed issues of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Instead, the Supreme Court requires courts to apply a limitations period that is applicable to similar claims under state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   For Section 1981 claims in Louisiana alleging precontract misconduct, the Fifth Circuit applies\n   Louisiana's one-year prescriptive period for torts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Although state law governs the substantive limitation[s] period, federal law determines when a civil rights action accrues and, therefore, when the statute of limitations begins to run.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit has held that \"[t]he limitations period for [ Section] 1981 employment discrimination cases commences when the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that the [challenged] discriminatory act has occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   This takes place \"the moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury or has sufficient information to know that he has been injured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   BBC filed suit on June 16, 2015, bringing a claim against State Farm for its failure to contract with BBC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC argues that State Farm failed to contract with it on three occasions-(1) November of 2011, (2) March of 2014, and (3) July of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC argues the statute of limitations did not begin to run on its March 2014 claim until July of 2014 because it did not have reason to know of the challenged discriminatory failure to contract until then.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties do not dispute that State Farm sent BBC a letter on November 22, 2011, advising BBC that State Farm was not considering its facility for the Select Service Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that State Farm sent BBC another letter on March 5, 2014, advising BBC that State Farm was not considering its facility for the Select Service Program at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm's letters to BBC clearly state that it is not considering BBC for admission to the Select Service Program, giving BBC notice that it sustained injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC did not file suit until June 16, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   The alleged instances of State Farm's discriminatory failure to contract in November of 2011 and March of 2014 are time barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   BBC also makes a claim based on State Farm's failure to contract in July of 2014 after the State Farm representatives' visit to BBC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   BBC timely asserted its claim based on State Farm's alleged discriminatory refusal to contract with it at the time of the July 2014 visit, but summary judgment on that claim is granted nevertheless for the reasons stated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although Ms. Latiolais may have been \"rude and unprofessional,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no evidence that the alleged rudeness was motivated by racial animus. The only racially related comments that BBC presents\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   do not indicate discriminatory intent because they are neither derogatory nor disparaging.
