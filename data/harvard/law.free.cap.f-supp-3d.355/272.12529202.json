Grimm, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In May 2018, as Americans were continuing to learn the details of a far-reaching Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential contest, the state of Maryland enacted a new law to combat foreign interference in its elections. The law, known as the Online Electioneering Transparency and Accountability Act (the \"Act\"), sought primarily to curb foreign nationals' exploitation of Facebook, Instagram,\n   and other social media sites, but its reach was broader than that, extending to many established newspapers' websites. It requires social media sites and news sites alike to self-publish information about the political ads they run and to make records about those ads available for state inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Act's passage into law spurred an immediate response from the Washington Post and other media outlets with an online presence in Maryland. The outlets (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") brought this action in federal court to enjoin enforcement of the portions of the Act applying to online publishers, primarily (but not exclusively) arguing that the disclosure and record-keeping requirements codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n    Md.

The issue before me at this stage of the proceedings is whether Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I conclude that Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is likely to succeed on the merits. This conclusion stems from my determination that the Act's impositions on online publishers are subject to strict scrutiny and that they most likely would not withstand this form of judicial review. I further conclude that, even if I were to analyze the statute under the more forgiving standard of \"exacting scrutiny,\" the Plaintiffs have shown they would likely prevail. As I am satisfied, as well, that Plaintiffs have met the other requirements for preliminary injunctive relief, their request to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of section 13-405, as applied to them, will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Maryland statute is among a number of state responses\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to revelations that Russia exploited social media in a campaign to sway public opinion in the United States ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The details of the Russian operation are still emerging; in fact, roughly one month after the hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence announced the release of two reports chronicling Russian efforts to sow discord in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Press Release, U.S. Senate Select Comm. on Intelligence, New Reports Shed Light on Internet Research Agency's Social Media Tactics (Dec. 17, 2018), https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/press/new-reports-shed-light-internet-research-agencyE2% 80% 99s-social-media-tactics.

The State's argument, in brief, is that those bedrock principles do not apply here because\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   and its progeny supply a different standard for election-related disclosure requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Maryland statute is indisputably unlike the various statutes the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeals have reviewed under the\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   exacting scrutiny standard.

They did not burden ostensibly neutral third parties such as publishers of political advertisements, as the Maryland statute does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To this, the State offers two replies. First, it argues that \"nothing in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   or its forebears supports\" Plaintiffs' inference that exacting scrutiny applies only to disclosure requirements burdening \"\n   <em>\n    speakers\n   </em>\n   of election-related speech.\" Defs.' Opp'n 16-17 (emphasis in original) (quoting Pls.' Mem. 17).

My reading of\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Becerra\n   </em>\n   persuades me that this would be improper. The applicable standard, I am convinced, is strict scrutiny.

Nevertheless, at a hearing on Plaintiffs' motion, counsel for the State said he was \"not prepared to concede\" the point, arguing that an opportunity to further investigate the issue through the discovery process might bolster the State's position. Counsel also suggested that the Act's requirements may yet be \"refined\" (translation: narrowed) in such a way as to survive strict scrutiny as the State Board of Elections exercises its power to promulgate regulations under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   These are not the arguments of a party that is confident in its case. To begin, the issue before me at this stage of the litigation is whether Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is likely to succeed on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Surely, it can always be argued that discovery\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   uncover facts that strengthen one party's position. The State, though, has not identified any specific points of contention in this case that demand clarification through discovery. The mere, ever-present possibility that some unknown and unanticipated new facts will emerge to prop up the non-moving party's case is no reason to deny the moving party a preliminary injunction that is otherwise justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The State's other argument - that future regulations may refine the Act's requirements - is equally unpersuasive. The only way regulations could \"implement\" the Maryland statute in a way that would allow it to survive strict scrutiny would be to narrow its impact to such an extent that it would be contrary to what was enacted by the Maryland legislature.

This is because the Act imposes its obligations on any and all \"online platforms,\" a term it defines to include \"any public-facing website, web application, ... social network, ad network, or search engine\" that accepts ads and that can claim \"100,000 or more unique monthly visitors or users for a majority of months during the immediately preceding 12 months.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-101\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law \u00a7 1-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dd-1). This definition casts a wide net. It is broad enough to ensnare not only Facebook, Instagram, and other social media giants that foreign operators are known to have exploited, but many news sites as well, including smaller, regional sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Publisher Affs., ECF Nos. 9-5 to -9. And yet, the State has not been able to identify so much as a single foreign-sourced paid political ad that ran on a news site, be it in 2016 or at any other time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   It is clear enough that a state could fashion a more narrowly tailored regulation than the one Maryland has enacted. New York, in fact, has done just that; its definition of \"online platform\" closely resembles Maryland's but requires the site to have at least 70 million \"unique monthly United States visitors or users for a majority of months during the preceding 12 months.\" 9 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. 6200.10(b)(12) (2018). I do not mean to suggest that the threshold in Maryland must be in line with the one in New York - which, after all, is a considerably more populous state. Strict scrutiny, though, demands an exceedingly tight fit between the regulation's burdens and its aims. It seems unlikely that Maryland will be able to show that a less expansive definition of \"online platform\" would detract in any way from the Act's goal of neutralizing foreign influence in the state's elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   This alone would justify a determination that Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is likely to succeed on the merits. Ultimately, though, the Act appears to suffer from an even more fundamental defect in that it solely targets \"qualifying paid digital communications\" - which is to say, political advertisements a buyer pays to place on an online platform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-101\">\n    Md.

As the legislative history of the Act and the Albright declaration make clear, the primary evil the Act was intended to redress was\n   <em>\n    unpaid\n   </em>\n   Internet postings (many of which mentioned no election or candidate at all) on social media sites that are not news publishers. Thus,\n   the reach of the Act is dramatically broader than the threat it was chiefly enacted to counter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Strict scrutiny is demanding, to say the least.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

Here, there is simply no way the State can show its law is the least restrictive means of achieving its compelling interest in deterring or exposing foreign attempts to meddle in its elections. I conclude Plaintiffs will likely succeed in demonstrating the Act fails strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As I have noted, the State made little attempt to argue its statute could overcome strict scrutiny.

But exacting scrutiny requires a showing that the means adopted by the state are sufficiently effective in achieving an important state objective without doing unwarranted collateral damage to First Amendment rights.

It is not that the Act promises no benefits whatsoever. Here, though, the publication and state inspection requirements appear ill suited to their missions in at least three ways: first, they are duplicative of other campaign finance disclosure requirements; second, they do not target the deceptive practices the Act ostensibly seeks to deter; and, third, they are poorly calibrated to prevent foreign operatives from evading detection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   I have already addressed the first of these defects. Under subsection 13-405(b) (the publication requirement), online publishers must disclose the identity of political ad buyers and the total amount paid for each ad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n    Md.

Law \u00a7 13-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). But Maryland campaign finance laws, as amended by other portions of the Act, already require the ad buyers themselves to disclose this same information.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-304(a) - (b), -306(c)-(e), -307(c)-(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Subsection 13-405(c) (the state inspection requirement) also overlaps with other campaign finance disclosure requirements. Specifically, this subsection requires online publishers to keep records that, among other things, identify the candidate or ballot issue to which each ad relates and whether the ad supports or opposes that candidate or ballot issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-405(c)(3)(i). This is information state law elsewhere requires the groups or people who pay for political ads to themselves disclose.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-306(e)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To be sure, the state inspection requirement is not entirely duplicative. Several of its demands go farther than other Maryland campaign finance disclosure requirements - in particular, the obligation to maintain records of the dates and times the ads appeared online; an \"approximate description\" of the ad's audience and the \"geographic locations\" where it appeared; and the total number of \"impressions\" the ad generated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-405(c)(3)(ii), (iv)-(vi). Nowhere, though, has the State articulated its interest in this information. It is far from clear how forcing online publishers to reveal details about the number, demographic makeup, and geographical dispersion of visitors to their site might advance the Act's goals. This information does not offer voters any useful insights about the sources or funding of campaign ads or shine a light on any bribery schemes in which a candidate might be embroiled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, certainly, it is difficult to see how these disclosures might possibly contribute to the Act's chief aim of deterring foreign meddling in federal and state elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   What is clear, at least, is that publishers have a legitimate grievance with a law that obligates them to cough up proprietary information about their customer base and the reach of their websites (information akin to circulation figures for traditional print media). The compelled disclosure of this information could expose their proprietary data - if not necessarily to competitors, then at least to the state, which may well count itself as a participant in the market for online ads. Given the risks, a publisher that prizes the privacy of its data might find it preferable to simply decline to accept political ads - a prospect that runs counter to the First Amendment's aim of promoting the free expression of ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   This leads me to the second of the Act's most critical defects: its failure to remedy the harms that inspired its enactment. I have already discussed this failing in some detail, and there is no need to repeat myself here. In short, the Act's publication and state inspection requirements overshoot their target by a wide margin. They regulate international, regional, and local websites alike, even as all available evidence suggests that foreign operatives largely confined their activities to Facebook, Instagram, and other global social media platforms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 5-6,\n   <em>\n    Internet Research Agency\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-cr-32-DLF; Albright Deck 7-8; Brennan Center Testimony 2. At the same time, the Act reserves its fire for paid political advertisements, even though it appears the Russian disinformation campaign relied far more heavily on fake websites and free social media posts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Albright Decl. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   These are just two of the ways in which the Act's requirements and its aims are substantially mismatched. Plaintiffs have identified one more, and it concerns the\n   Act's efficacy. The issue, in brief, is that the Act leaves it to ad buyers to trigger the publication and state inspection obligations by notifying online publishers that their ad meets the statute's definition of a \"qualifying paid digital communication.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law \u00a7 13-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d)(1). A buyer who wishes to avoid detection - as any self-respecting foreign operative surely would - can simply withhold the notice, in which case the publisher never incurs an obligation to disclose any information about the ad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 19,\n   <em>\n    Internet Research Agency\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-cr-32-DLF (alleging that Russian operatives who meddled in the 2016 election did not report their expenditures to the FEC or register as foreign agents with the Department of Justice). Alternatively, the buyer could submit false information to the publisher; in that case, the publisher would be obliged to make the requisite disclosures but would be permitted by law to \"rely in good faith on the information\" the buyer provided.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-405(d)(2). In either case, the state is no closer to achieving its aim of rooting out foreign attempts to interfere in its elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   These infirmities separate Maryland's statute from the more traditional campaign-finance disclosure requirements that have withstood exacting scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

Here, though, Maryland has promulgated a rather different type of statute - one with a distinct set of obligations and objectives. The State has not persuaded me that the Act's publication and state inspection requirements are substantially related to its aims. The method it has chosen to remedy an admittedly important state interest is ill suited to the task and threatens in the process to impose substantial burdens on Plaintiffs' First Amendment-protected rights of free speech and a free press.

Even if I were to agree, the question is not whether the anticipated harm is severe, but whether it is irreparable. Here, in the absence of preliminary relief, Plaintiffs would have no choice but to prepare to accommodate the Act's requirements and decide whether to accept or reject political ads as they begin to pour in.

While there is no denying that states have a strong interest in countering newly emerging threats to their elections, the approaches they choose to take must not encroach on First Amendment freedoms that are the hallmark of our nation. Maryland's statute appears to overstep these bounds. While I have no cause to block its enforcement wholesale, Plaintiffs have persuaded me that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"463\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-405\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law \u00a7 13-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which includes both the publication requirement and state inspection requirement, is most likely unconstitutional as it applies to these Plaintiffs. With respect to this section and to section 13-405.1, which authorizes the state administrator of elections to investigate potential violations of section 13-405, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction is granted. Accordingly, the State is enjoined from enforcing these provisions against Plaintiffs during the pendency of this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs have challenged the Act on broader grounds than I have discussed in this ruling; while their arguments primarily have focused on how the Act applies to them, they also contend it is facially unconstitutional. It is not necessary for me to address this contention at present, because the grounds discussed warrant the injunctive relief they seek at this stage in the litigation. Before determining what, if any, further proceedings are necessary to conclude this case, I will schedule a telephone conference call with counsel. The State may well wish to file an interlocutory appeal, and if so it may be prudent to stay further proceedings until the appeal has been decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The motion for preliminary injunctive relief has been fully briefed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 9, 9-1, 24, 31, 37.
