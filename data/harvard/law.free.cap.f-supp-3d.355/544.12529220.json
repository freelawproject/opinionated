DAVIDSON, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Officer Hunter Solomon of the Hernando Police Department performed a search of a vehicle owned and driven by the defendant, Corey Delmar Smith. The search revealed a number of stolen driver's licenses, social security cards, and devices to produce counterfeit identification documents and checks. Smith was indicted in this Court for possessing the stolen identification documents with intent to defraud and possessing the counterfeit-making devices with intent to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Smith moves to suppress [Doc. 10] the evidence obtained. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on this matter, received briefs from the parties, and is now ready to rule. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the motion should be denied and the evidence should not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From the testimony given at the evidentiary hearing conducted in this matter, and other evidence submitted by the parties, the Court finds the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Solomon was observing northbound traffic on Interstate 55 in Hernando, Mississippi. Solomon saw a black Chevrolet Suburban that did not have a license plate. Solomon initiated a stop of the vehicle at 5:57 p.m. Solomon positioned his patrol car so that it was behind the Suburban and offset to the left, closer to traffic, than the vehicle. He was joined on site by Officer Tarra Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon stopping the vehicle, Solomon was able to observe a Texas paper license tag in the rear window. Solomon approached the vehicle and found it occupied by Smith, who was driving, and two passengers, Willie Carroll and Gregory Carter. Solomon removed Smith from the vehicle and brought him to the rear of the vehicle to speak to him. Smith informed Solomon that he was traveling from Texas to Indiana to pick up an icemaker for a restaurant he owned in Texas. Smith stated that Carroll and Carter worked for him, that he had picked up them up in Jackson, that they were traveling to Memphis that night, on to Indiana to purchase the icemaker, and then back to Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Solomon then went to the passenger side of the vehicle to speak to Carroll and Carter and check their identification. Carroll\n   told Solomon that he did not know Smith very well, and that they were traveling to Memphis that evening for a party and then back to Jackson the next day. Carter stated that he had worked for Smith at one point, and told Solomon that they were going to Memphis for a party, but he did not know when they were going back to Jackson. Neither knew of a trip to Indiana to pick up an icemaker. At 6:10 p.m. Solomon was informed that Carroll had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Solomon placed Carroll under arrest and put him in Davis's patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Solomon removed Carter from the vehicle and placed him alongside Smith at the front of Solomon's patrol car. Solomon asked Smith for permission to search the vehicle. Smith denied permission and became upset. Solomon then retrieved his canine unit, Krash, and, at 6:21 p.m. deployed Krash to sniff the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Solomon and Krash began a sweep at the rear driver side of the vehicle. They crossed behind the vehicle and on to the passenger side. While sweeping the passenger side, Krash paused and then alerted by sitting. Solomon proceeded to search the vehicle. At 6:40 p.m., Solomon began uncovering the subject evidence in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, on a motion to suppress, the defendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the evidence in question was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, Smith argues Solomon did not have not have reasonable suspicion to prolong the traffic stop after determining Smith and his passengers' identities and determining that status of his tag in order to conduct a narcotics investigation. Second, Smith argues Solomon did not have reasonable suspicion to prolong the traffic stop to perform a sweep of the vehicle with Krash. Third, Smith argues that during the sweep, Solomon manipulated Krash to falsely alert. Smith also argues that even if Krash did alert, it was unreliable such that his alert did not give Solomon probable cause to search the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Though the Fifth Circuit ultimately affirmed the district court for other reasons, the Fifth Circuit found that the inconsistent statements given by the defendant in that case did not provide an articulable basis for reasonable suspicion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Smith indicated that Davis made inconsistent statements regarding his criminal history, he did not identify the statements, their inconsistencies, or the reason they aroused his suspicions. In contrast, the officers in\n   <em>\n    Brigham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   identified specific inconsistencies, including contradictions in the statements made by the driver and his passengers regarding travel plans, conflicts in the driver's own statements, and fabrications about a passenger's identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701179\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/341/#p350\">\n    612 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   345-46 and\n   <em>\n    Brigham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190356\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/500/#p507\">\n    382 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   504-05 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court can thus extrapolate from these cases that in order for inconsistent statements by vehicle occupants to arouse reasonable suspicion the inconsistencies must be significant, the officer must be able to identify the inconsistencies, and he must be able to explain why those statements coupled with additional factors made him believe specific criminal activity was underway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds the government has met that burden here. Solomon identified the inconsistent statements at issue: that Smith told him that Carroll and Carter worked for him and they were traveling to Indiana to obtain an ice machine; Carroll stated that he did not know Smith well at all; Carter stated he did not currently work for Smith; and both denied having any knowledge about a trip to Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   These inconsistencies are more significant than not. Most notably, Carroll and Carter denied having knowledge that they were being taken on a trip three states away. This is much more akin to the inconsistent stories provided in\n   <em>\n    Brigham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   , where the defendants could not provide consistent stories about the duration and purposes of their respective trips. In both cases the prolonging of the stops were upheld.\n   <em>\n    Brigham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190356\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/500/#p507\">\n    382 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   509-512 ;\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701179\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/341/#p350\">\n    612 F.3d at 358-362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Solomon was able to identify why those inconsistent statements raised suspicion of criminal activity. I-55 is a major interstate highway, running from New Orleans, Louisiana to Chicago, Illinois. As he testified, it is commonly used to transport contraband throughout this state. Those facts, coupled together, provided Solomon with reasonable suspicion to extend the stop and further investigate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701179\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/341/#p350\">\n    612 F.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Considering the large volume of contraband that is moved along our major highways on a daily basis ... a reasonable officer could fairly conclude that the most likely single alternative explanation, for the nervousness and irreconcilable stories raising reasonable suspicion of some criminal activity, is that the occupants are carrying contraband, particularly when the stop occurs on a highway that is frequently used by smugglers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court does note that on cross-examination Solomon stated that the had a \"hunch\" that Smith was engaged in illegal activity because of the inconsistent stories\n   given to him. While a mere \"hunch\" is not reasonable suspicion, the Court must give weight to the specific facts and reasons to which Solomon testified. Those facts and reasons justified the prolonged detention in this instance. The Court finds that the information provided to Solomon during his investigation of Smith's license plate violation gave him reasonable suspicion to further investigate, and that the entire length and the scope of search was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Did the dog's alert provide probable cause to search Smith's vehicle?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Smith next challenges Krash's alert in two ways. First, Smith asserts that Solomon yanked Krash's leash causing him to sit, which was Krash's alert indication. Second, Smith argues that Krash is unreliable such that his alert cannot constitute probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   An alert by a drug dog is sufficient to create probable cause for a search.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [A] probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog's alert should proceed much like any other. The court should allow the parties to make their best case, consistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure. And the court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to decide what all the circumstances demonstrate. If the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the court should find probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has challenged the State's case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence.... The question-similar' to every inquiry in probable cause-is whether all the facts surrounding a dog's alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    568 U.S. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247-48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Even if the dog is generally reliable, \"circumstances surrounding a particular alert may undermine the case for probable cause-if, say, the officer cued the dog (consciously or not), or if the team was working under unfamiliar conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this case, Krash gave his \"alert\" signal by sitting. As to whether Solomon manipulated Krash to alert, the Court finds that the government has established he did not. Solomon testified that when deploying Krash, he utilized a collar and leash attached to a \"dead ring\" that allowed Krash to move around with no tension on his collar. He also demonstrated how the leash worked. Solomon testified that while performing this sweep, he handled Krash's leash as he always does. He further testified that he left slack on the leash the entire time Krash swept the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Officer Davis testified that she had seen Solomon deploy Krash multiple times. She testified that he typically left slack in Krash's leash when deploying him. She further testified that she did not see Solomon pull on Krash's leash when sweeping the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Smith testified that he observed Solomon pulling the leash, causing Krash to stop and sit. The Court does not find Smith's testimony in that respect credible enough to overcome Solomon and Davis's testimony. Both Solomon and Davis testified\n   that Solomon's patrol car was parked behind Smith's Suburban and offset to the left, meaning that the patrol car was parked closer to the highway than Smith's vehicle. All parties testified that while Solomon deployed Krash, Smith and Carter were standing in front of, or sitting on, the hood of Solomon's patrol car. Smith's car was a large SUV. Krash alerted in the middle of the passenger side, on the right of the vehicle. Because Smith would have been several feet behind the SUV and over to the left, it is doubtful he would have been able to clearly witness Solomon manipulating Krash's leash at the right of the vehicle. Further, even if Smith did witness Solomon pulling Krash's leash, Solomon's testimony and demonstration about how the leash worked showed that Solomon could move the leash without placing tension on Krash's collar. Accordingly, the Court finds that Krash made a valid alert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Next, the Court must decide whether Krash's was reliable enough such that his alert would provide probable cause that narcotics were in the car. \"[E]vidence of a dog's satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself provide sufficient reason to trust his alert.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058. Likewise, \"if the dog has recently and successfully completed a training program that evaluated his proficiency in locating drugs,\" the dog may be deemed generally reliable. The defendant may challenge the dog's reliability by \"cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Solomon testified that he and Krash regularly trained together. The government introduced training logs and certificates obtained by Solomon and Krash. That is sufficient evidence of Krash's reliability. Nothing solicited by Smith on cross-examination calls Krash's reliability into doubt. Although Smith asked about Krash's demeanor during this sweep and whether he'd been given food or water that day, nothing was said that calls into doubt Krash's reliability. And while Solomon stated that Krash was rewarded with a tennis ball in training sessions for finding contraband, that does not undermine his reliability\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lozano\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:17-CR-605,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206508410\">\n    2017 WL 6508410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 20, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Smith's sole basis for challenging Krash's reliability is that Krash provided a false positive on this occasion. There is no evidence that Krash is trained to detect ID's and social security cards and no narcotics were found in the vehicle. But the Supreme Court has instructed courts to be wary of on-field results when assessing a dog's reliability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Conversely (and more relevant here), if the dog alerts to a car in which the officer finds no narcotics, the dog may not have made a mistake at all. The dog may have detected substances that were too well hidden or present in quantities too small for the officer to locate. Or the dog may have smelled the residual odor of drugs previously in the vehicle or on the driver's person. Field data thus may markedly overstate a dog's real false positives. By contrast, those inaccuracies-in either direction-do not taint records of a dog's performance in standard training and certification settings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    568 U.S. at 245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/#p247\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
