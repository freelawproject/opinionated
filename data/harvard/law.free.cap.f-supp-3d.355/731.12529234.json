Gottschall, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Terrace Browner (\"Browner\") has brought a one count complaint, ECF No. 1, alleging that defendant, American Eagle Bank (\"defendant\"), illegally accessed her individual and personal credit file from Trans Union, a \"consumer reporting agency\" as defined in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f), in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b (hereinafter the Fair Credit Reporting Act or FCRA). Plaintiff alleges that at the time, she had no personal business relationship with defendant; defendant had no information in its possession to suggest that plaintiff owed defendant a debt or was responsible to pay a debt to defendant; and plaintiff did not consent to defendant's accessing her individual and personal credit report: in short, that defendant had no legitimate business reason for accessing the report and impermissibly obtained information relating to plaintiff's personal and individual credit accounts including plaintiff's payment history, individual credit accounts, and credit worthiness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-26. By accessing plaintiff's credit report, defendant obtained personal information about plaintiff including her current and past addresses, birthdate, employment history, and telephone numbers. Compl. \u00b6 25. Plaintiff alleges that unknown employees, representatives, and/or agents of defendant viewed this information, which she asserts constituted a publication of her personal information. Compl. \u00b6 26. Moreover, plaintiff alleges that defendant's accessing of plaintiff's credit report will be displayed on plaintiff's credit report for two years. Compl. \u00b6 26. Plaintiff alleges that she has suffered \"financial and dignitary harm arising from the [d]efendant's review of her personal information and her credit information and an injury to her credit rating and reputation.\" Compl. \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Critically, with respect to a credit or insurance transaction not initiated by the consumer, the statute provides specific requirements that must be satisfied. And most important for the present case, the statute contains this explicit prohibition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (f) Certain use or obtaining of information prohibited\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A person shall not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose unless-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) the consumer report is obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished under this section; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) the purpose is certified in accordance with section 1681e of this title by a prospective user of the report through a general or specific certification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681b(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Congress could not have made clearer that this statute was intended to protect consumer privacy by preventing the dissemination of consumer credit information to third parties, except under carefully specified conditions. Plaintiff here alleges that defendant accessed her information for no permissible purpose, a clear violation of the statute if proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   counsels that in determining whether an intangible injury (as this clearly is) causes injury in fact, the judgment of Congress is relevant but not determinative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1549\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . History must also be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As for the judgment of Congress, Congress could not have been clearer that it intended to provide fulsome protections to ensure that confidential credit information was released by credit reporting agencies only under carefully drawn conditions. Those conditions were designed to make sure that, except where Congress made a contrary judgment, the consumer's authorization is required before disclosure occurs and that any release is justified by a legitimate business or governmental purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681b(f). When it enacted the FCRA, Congress found, among other things, that \"[t]here is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Reading this statute, the court has no doubt that Congress intended to protect a consumer's credit information to the greatest extent practicable and to prohibit access where there was no legitimate business or statutorily-allowed purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bormes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406999\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/6/#p7\">\n    568 U.S. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406999\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/6/#p7\">\n    133 S.Ct. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407065,12406999\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/184/317/\">\n    184 L.Ed.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (The Fair Credit Reporting Act has as one of its purposes to \"protect consumer privacy\" (quotation and citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

In an analogous situation, the district court in Minnesota considered whether, under\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff had standing to complain when she learned that a number of her coworkers had accessed her confidential, password-protected, driver's license information. The defendants claimed that accessing plaintiff's information, without more, was a mere statutory violation and not an injury in fact. The district court disagreed. Citing the case of\n   <em>\n    Potocnik v. Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203919950\">\n    2016 WL 3919950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (D. Minn. July 15, 2016), Judge Montgomery wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Potocnik\n   </em>\n   , the district court held that an alleged DPPA [Driver's Privacy Protection Act] violation constitutes a concrete injury because \"the type of harm at issue-the viewing of private information without lawful authority-has a close relationship to invasion of the right to privacy, a harm that has long provided a basis for tort actions in the English and American courts.\" In so holding, the court noted that the Supreme Court does not require that the harm caused by a statutory violation be\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   to the type of harm that would give rise to a recovery under common law, only that the harm bear a \"close relationship\" to a harm that has traditionally served as a basis for suit in English and American courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Engebretson v.

It found that the invasion of privacy involved in the unauthorized access to plaintiff's credit information is closely related to the kind of injury which has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit, as the common law has long recognized the right of an individual to control information concerning himself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20869\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 873 (citing\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dept. of Justice v.

Moreover, an invasion of privacy is similar to the harm involved in the traditional tort of intrusion upon seclusion which holds a person liable for intentionally intruding, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652B (1977) ). This, the court held, coupled with Congress' judgment in the FCRA to provide consumers a right to privacy in their credit reports, makes clear that an invasion of privacy within the meaning of the FCRA is a concrete harm that meets the injury in fact requirement for standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Numerous cases reach a similar conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267934\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/240/1070/#p1076\">\n    240 F.Supp.3d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (D.
