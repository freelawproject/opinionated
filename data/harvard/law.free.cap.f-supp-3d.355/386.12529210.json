Before the Court are the County Defendants' motion to dismiss [Dkt. No. 49], the Commissioner's motion to dismiss [Dkt. No. 52], and BTA's motion for summary judgment and injunctive relief [Dkt.

It then identified six types of signs that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   exempt from the Highway Signs Statute (identified as \" \u00a7 33.2-1224\"). As amended, the Exceptions Statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The following signs and advertisements, if securely attached to real property or advertising structures, and the advertising structures or parts thereof upon which they are posted or displayed are excepted from all the provisions of [Article 1] except those enumerated in ...

Simply signing an agreement authorizing another body to enforce a statute is not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nor can BTA claim that the Commissioner is liable in a supervisory capacity. The Commonwealth and the County operate as coequal enforcers of the Sign Statutes, not as supervisor and supervisee. Even if the Commissioner were deemed the County Defendants' supervisor, BTA has failed to plead facts indicating the Commissioner knew that the County Defendants' actions posed a \"pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury\" or that the Commissioner's failure to act bore a causal relationship to the injuries BTA allegedly suffered. Pleading supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983 is difficult; BTA has failed to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant the Commissioner's motion to dismiss as to BTA's \u00a7 1983 claims against the Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Justiciability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, defendants mount several defenses to BTA's suit based on justiciability principles.

The County Defendants have fined and sought to enjoin BTA for violating the Highway Signs Statute. BTA claims that it was unconstitutional for them to have done so because the Highway Signs Statute, together with the Exceptions Statute, is facially unconstitutional. That puts BTA and the County Defendants squarely at odds over a cognizable injury, and adjudicating the request for declaratory relief would be neither premature nor unwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The same conclusion applies to the dispute between BTA and the Commissioner. The Commissioner is responsible for enforcing the Sign Statutes; BTA is a frequent violator of the Highway Signs Statute; the state has enforced the provision against BTA in the past; and although the Commissioner has not cited BTA in a number of years, that does not make the dispute so hypothetical that it does not satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement. Moreover, adjudicating BTA's request for declaratory relief will \"serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations in issue,\"\n   <em>\n    White v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

This argument is equally meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To have standing, a plaintiff must show that (i) it suffered an actual or imminent injury in fact that is both concrete and particularized, (ii) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and (iii) the injury will be redressed by a favorable judicial determination.\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

All three elements are met here. The County Defendants' argument to the contrary rests on the idea that \"the County Defendants cannot ameliorate any injury allegedly caused\" by the Exceptions Statute. Cty. Defs.' MTD Memo. 7. That argument is not valid because if the Court were to determine that the Highway Signs Statute and the Exceptions Statute together were facially unconstitutional, and consequently that they could not be enforced against BTA, the resulting judgment would redress BTA's injuries. BTA clearly has standing to seek this relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     First Amendment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Both counts of the Amended Complaint allege that the Sign Statutes violate BTA's First Amendment right to free speech because they form a content-based restriction on speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Defendants disagree, arguing that the bulk of the exceptions in the Exceptions Statute do not apply to the Highway Signs Statute and that therefore the Highway Signs Statute is content neutral. After the April 2018 amendment to the Exceptions Statute, which altered how the two statutes interact, the parties were invited to file supplemental briefing addressing the effect, if any, of the April 2018 amendment on BTA's First Amendment claim [Dkt. No. 122], and all of the parties did so [Dkt. Nos. 125, 126, and 127].

As discussed above, BTA argues that before the recent amendment, all of the provisions of the Exceptions Statute applied to the Highway Signs Statute. Because some of those exceptions were content-based restrictions on private speech,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.2-1204\">\n    Va.

Code Ann. \u00a7 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Because the Highway Signs Statute is included in Article 1, BTA argues that the effect of the pre-amendment Exceptions Statute was to carve out categories of signs from the Highway Signs Statute's general prohibition. But BTA has never offered a satisfactory explanation for why, if all of the exceptions applied to the Highway Signs Statute, one (and only one) of the exceptions began with the phrase \"notwithstanding\n   the provisions of \u00a7 33.2-1224.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.2-1204(19) (2017).

Nor did BTA include a single allegation or cite any fact indicating that any of the other exceptions were ever actually applied to allow signs to be posted within the limits of the highway, even after defendants made clear that they disputed whether the exceptions applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants' alternative construction is not without problems of its own. Defendants first look to the policy and definitions provision of Article 1, arguing that Article 1 generally is oriented toward regulating \"the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising in areas\n   <em>\n    adjacent to\n   </em>\n   \" highways.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.2-1200\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 33.2-1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (emphasis added). The way defendants construe the pre-amended Exceptions Statute, the prefatory provision's statement exempting categories \"from all the provisions of this article\" means those provisions that regulate signs \"adjacent to\" highways. This construction would exclude the Highway Signs Statute's more specific regulation of areas \"within the limits of\" highways. To be sure, defendants' construction is not the most natural reading of the prefatory phrase, but it makes sense of subsection (19)'s language with respect to the Highway Signs Statute. Further, it accords with the structure of Article 1 as a whole.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mellouli v.

In plaintiff's view, the Exceptions Statute would apply to\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   provision in Article 1 unless specifically stated otherwise, but this would produce the odd result of applying the Exceptions Statute to the provision designating the Commissioner as the official responsible for administering the scheme,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.2-1201, and provisions governing activity wholly unrelated to signs,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.2-1222 (tree-trimming).

BTA alleges a few instances of differential treatment, but nothing approaching a \"consistent pattern\" of overzealous or selective enforcement against BTA.

That the County Defendants used a BTA sign as an example is at best \"consistent with\" a conscious scheme,\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and is far more likely a result of BTA's posting a significant number of signs in a geographically concentrated area. Likewise, BTA's claim that VDOT began enforcing the statute against it due to citizen complaints does not help its argument. Awareness on the part of VDOT or the Commissioner that BTA may have been violating the statute is a far cry from an intentional policy or practice on the County Defendants' part of arbitrarily enforcing the statute against BTA.

County started issuing penalties, it was contacted by Supervisor Patrick Herrity who personally insisted that BTA comply with the statutes at issue.\" Pl.'s Consolidated Opp'n to the Defs.'
