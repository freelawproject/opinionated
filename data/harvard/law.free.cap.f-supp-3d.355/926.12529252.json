Plaintiff brings seven claims for relief: (1) Horizontal Restraint of Trade in the Admissions Markets; (2) Horizontal Restraint of Trade in the Online College Application Processing Market; (3) Exclusive Dealing; (4) Tying; (5) Monopolization; (6) Attempted Monopolization; and (7) Conspiracy to Monopolize. Defendant moves to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims and transfer this action to the Eastern District of Virginia. The Court denies Defendant's Motions to Dismiss and Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff CollegeNET is a Portland-based corporation that offers various web-based administrative services to higher education and non-profit organizations, including customized online application forms, processing services, and contact management services. First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\") \u00b6 6, ECF 75. Defendant The Common Application is a Virginia-based non-profit corporation comprised of 549 non-profit member colleges and universities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. It offers a standard college application data service, application forms, and processing services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was formed in 1975 as a limited group of selective colleges seeking to simplify the college admissions process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 38. The application was initially a paper form that was universally accepted by all member colleges, eliminating the need for applicants to write their basic information more than once.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. According to Plaintiff, Defendant has since \"transformed itself into a dominant online college application processing provider.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. As it grew, Defendant's members began to \"understand that Common Application was providing tangible monetary benefits to them at the expense of applicants. What started out as a service to simplify the college application process for students had become a pipeline of applicants\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. According to Plaintiff, membership grew \"not to serve students but in part to secure a boost in applications, application fees, and rankings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is not a single entity, but rather a \"consortium of competitors\" that have participated with Defendant as co-conspirators in connection with the alleged antitrust violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 84. A majority of Defendant's steering committee or board of directors is made up of admissions officers from member colleges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85. The board discusses and approves membership agreements, Common Application changes, and restraints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86. Each year, member colleges sign an agreement with Defendant to abide by its rules and regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Evolution of Defendant's Unlawful Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges various anticompetitive behavior resulting from membership restrictions and restraints, including but not limited to: (a) Tying and Bundling/Forced Purchase Requirements; (b) Exclusivity Restrictions; (c) the \"Equal Treatment\" Requirement; and (d) Uniformity Requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff suggests that none of these requirements-which Defendant operated without for 25 years-is necessary to achieve any legitimate or procompetitive goal of the Common Application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. According to Plaintiff, these restraints \"have the primary effect of suppressing competition to provide online\n   college application processing services to applicants and colleges, reducing net output, and excluding rival providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They \"are not ancillary to or reasonably necessary to carry out Common Application's official mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2003, Defendant \"redefined its 'equal treatment' requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. Specifically, it began requiring members to \"encourage the use of the Common Application\" by \"(1) charging an application fee to Common Applicants that was 'no greater than the fee charged for [their] other accepted applications; (2) providing 'an equally prominent link to the Common App Online wherever [they] post[ed] a link to another online application; and (3) not 'explicitly offer[ing] any special benefits to students regardless of the application they choose.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also began charging non-exclusive members a higher fee per application than was charged to exclusive members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2005-06, Defendant entered into agreements with Naviance and ApplyYourself (\"AY\"). Naviance is the \"largest provider of planning and advising systems for secondary schools\" with an \"electronic document transmission system ... integrated into more than 5,500 schools.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. Defendant became \"tightly integrated\" with Naviance's system, and college counselors familiar with Naviance \"encourage[d] students to apply to college through the Common App.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant also awarded an \"exclusive Online College Application Processing Services contract\" to AY from 2007 to 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During this time, Defendant also made several changes to its services and pricing structure. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's \"typical pattern was to begin by offering additional 'optional' services and then, after a few years, (1) bundle the services with its core offering, (2) make their use mandatory, and/or (3) impose penalties on members who did not agree to use Common Application's services exclusively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. In the mid-2000's, for example, Defendant introduced supplemental forms and payment processing services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Initially, members could pay for membership, applications, application payment processing, supplemental applications, and maintenance of supplemental applications separately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, in the late 2000's, Defendant \"bundled all of its distinct services (except for payment processing) into a single offering for one all-in fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. In other words, Common Application still charged a membership fee and a fee per application, but the supplemental application and other services were \"free.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, members who were fully exclusive and did not use other application providers were charged $4.00 per application processed as opposed to the standard $5.50 fee per application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Defendant also began \"restricting member institutions' ability to customize and personalize their Institutional Supplements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2011, Defendant announced its intent to end its contract with AY and-in 2014 with its fourth-generation system \"CA4\"-to bring the online processing staff, software, and infrastructure in-house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66. According to Plaintiff, Defendant was equipping itself to \" 'handle the full volume of the entire American college application process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that CA4 was a \"woefully deficient, technologically backwards, glitch-riddled product that would never survive in a competitive marketplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. By further homogenizing the college application process, CA4 made it \"harder for applicants and Colleges to identify good 'matches.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. CA4 eliminated file uploads and used text boxes that were limited to 650 words.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Applicants were further limited in the number of versions of essays they could upload and\n   to answering four specific essay prompts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, Defendant made further changes to its pricing and membership structure. Under its new three-tiered membership structure, all members had to (1) use Defendant's Common Application for all form and payment processing-including Institutional Supplements-for Common Applicants; (2) accept all Common Applicant evaluation forms (including final transcripts) online, for schools that chose to send them online; and (3) accept the Common Application fee waiver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. In addition, \"Exclusive I\" members had to use the Common Application as their only admission application for full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking applicants, and \"Exclusive II\" members had to (1) establish uniform fees for all applicants; (2) use the Common Application as their only transfer application; and (3) use Slideroom.com for their Arts Supplement (if they offered one).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 76, 77. According to Plaintiff, the \"penalties\" for choosing to be a Non-Exclusive versus Exclusive II member are \"extreme.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since 2000, Defendant's membership has grown substantially, reaching 549 members in the 2014-2015 academic year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. With that growth, its total revenue increased from $339,046 in 2003 to $14.5 million in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It processed 3.45 million applications in the 2013-2014 application cycle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. In addition, in 2014 Defendant eliminated its \"holistic admission membership requirement,\" allowing \"virtually any College ... to join Common Application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Anticompetitive Effects and Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's agreements and the challenged restraints have had various anticompetitive effects. They have harmed competition in the Admissions and Online College Application Processing Markets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 149. They have resulted in lower \"Net Output,\" defined as the net value derived from Online College Application Processing services including (1) quality, functionality, features, ease of use and level of innovativeness of Application Processing services; (2) the ability of applicants and Colleges to find good matches; (3) the ability to predict yield or matriculation; and (4) the amount of time and money spent by Colleges and applicants using these services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 151, 153-56. According to Plaintiff, the equal treatment requirement in particular has reduced competition among members to offer better alternatives to the Common Application. It amounts to a group boycott and an agreement to suppress demand for application services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 151-52. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has impermissibly tied its Standard College Application Data service to its Online Application Processing service through its \"one-price-for-all-services model.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 153. The exclusivity provisions have also foreclosed rival providers by making it \"prohibitively expensive for members to use and offer to applicants those rivals' services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 154. The uniformity requirements have similarly reduced Net Output by decreasing the value that applicants derive from the application process and limiting their ability to find a good match.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff has also been injured by the restraints. Plaintiff alleges that it has lost over 200 college customers to Common Application in the last 10-15 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. Prior to the alleged restraints, Plaintiff asserts that it hosted Common Application Institutional Supplements and supported Common Application member colleges in other ways.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff attributes its losses to these restraints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Plaintiff, members receive certain benefits from the restraints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157. The restraints allow them to spend less on online application processing services\n   without a reduction in applicants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157(a). They boost their application numbers, fees, and rankings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157(c). Plaintiff alleges that early members in particular have a \"significant financial interest and have invested substantial time and effort\" in the commercial joint venture such that they are motivated to prevent competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Relevant Markets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that there are four relevant markets in which to analyze the effects of Defendant's allegedly unlawful restraints: \"(1) the market for applicants to Colleges (the \"Student Application Market\"); (2) the market for admission to Colleges (the \"College Admissions Market\") ( (1) and (2) collectively, the 'Admissions Markets'); (3) the Online College Application Processing Market and each of its submarkets; and (4) the College market for Standard College Application Data Services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90. In the alternative, Plaintiff contends that the Admissions Markets may be limited to Elite Colleges, defined as top-50 universities and top-50 liberal arts colleges by U.S. News &amp; World Report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Online Application Processing Market is a distinct product market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. It is limited in geographic scope to the United States, and suppliers include: Defendant, Plaintiff, Applications Online LLC (\"AOL\"), XAP Corporation, Hobsons U.S., and AY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 93. Plaintiff alleges that the market does not include applications to graduate programs (which cost more and are not a reasonable substitute for the college product) or student information systems (\"SIS\") (which are more limited products and require significant investment from the college).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 96-106. Plaintiff alleges that barriers to entry are high because of the high fixed costs involved in entering the industry and the difficulty obtaining and retaining customers due to Defendant's entrenchment and exclusivity agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 107-10. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant's exclusivity agreements, equal treatment requirements, bundling/forced purchase requirements, and tying behavior disincentivize offering other applications and have made switching costs high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 110-13. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's share of this market is 60%: \"In 2014-15, an estimated 9.4 million undergraduate applications will be submitted, with 5-6 million processed online by third-party providers, and approximately 3.6 million of which will be processed by Common Application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Standard College Application Service Market is a distinct product market. Unlike the Online Application Processing Market, \"which includes full application form development and processing,\" the Standard College Application Data Service \"provides a generic, text-based data entry form for applicants to input their background information required by more than one College.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118. Plaintiff alleges that there are no reasonable substitutes for access to this product, which generates an \"applicant pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121. Competitors in this market include AOL (provider of the Universal College Application) and Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 122. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's share of this market is 90%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Student Application Market and College Admissions Markets are also distinct product markets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124. They are supplied by Online Application Processing providers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125. The Student Application Market is limited to applications for admission to full-time, four-year degree programs at Colleges (\"regionally accredited, non-profit, undergraduate colleges and universities\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124. Similarly, the College Admissions Market is comprised of full-time, four-year College degree programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contends\n   that graduate programs; part-time or two-year programs; programs at non-regionally accredited, for-profit schools; or non-US institutions are not substitutes for Colleges and thus excludable from these markets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127. Plaintiff contends that Defendant will process 40-45% of College applications in 2014-15 year and therefore controls at least 40-50% of the Student Application Market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129. Plaintiff alleges that this number is an understatement of Defendant's market power, or \"their ability to reduce Net Output without losing applicants\" as a result of the network effects of its applicant pipeline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 130. There are also high barriers to entry in this market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The College Admissions Market is the market for admission to full-time, four-year College degree programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 138. For the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph, this market excludes other degree programs, and Defendant has similar market share and market power.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 139-40. Plaintiff contends that the ability of Defendant to offer a product with \"inferior functionality\" at a high cost with limitations on Colleges' advertising opportunities and the ability of applicants to find a good College (without losing users) is direct evidence of Defendant's \"unconstrained exercise of their market power.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff filed this case in the District of Oregon on May 8, 2014. Compl., ECF 1. On May 15, 2015, the Court granted Defendant's first Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claims for failure to plead antitrust injury. Opinion &amp; Order, ECF 96. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the district court and remanded this case for further proceedings. Mandate, ECF 112. On July 12, 2018, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss, and on August 3, 2018, Defendant filed its Motion to Transfer. Def. Mot. Dismiss, ECF 137; Def. Mot.

The Court disagrees. Plaintiff plainly alleges that the challenged restraints are anticompetitive. By limiting members' abilities to offer more affordable alternatives, making non-exclusive memberships more expensive, and requiring members to purchase processing services to obtain access to the student data pipeline, Colleges are disincentivized to explore superior or more affordable alternative online college application processing services. In other words-as a result of the unlawful tying, equal treatment provisions, and exclusivity discounts-the members have \"effectively agreed not to purchase higher-quality, more innovative, or lower-priced ... services from rival providers.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 150, 152-54. In addition, Plaintiff alleges that the agreements-which constrain choice among the member colleges-have caused Net Output to decrease and quality in the relevant markets to suffer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant also makes more targeted challenges to Plaintiff's \"Refusal to Deal\" Claim. Specifically, it argues that (1) Plaintiff's claims are illogical because a buyer's cartel in this context would only hurt all market participants, including Defendant and its member schools; and (2) that Plaintiff cannot allege suppression of demand because the number of applications (\"output\") increased as a result of increased demand. Def. Mot. Dismiss 14-19. With respect to Defendant's first argument, the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are not implausible. Plaintiff specifically alleges that Defendant and its member colleges have an interest in reducing demand and prices for application services. It is in their economic interest to eliminate all suppliers except Common App (which is controlled by members) and to prevent other competitor colleges from using a different supplier and changing the competitive landscape of the Admissions Market. FAC \u00b6 157. These restraints benefit the members by allowing them to spend\n   below-competitive levels on services without losing applicants and boosting their applications, application fees, and rankings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, members-particularly those who joined the venture early-have invested time and effort in Defendant and have a financial interest in the success of The Common Application. On the second argument, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Net Output has decreased as a result of Defendant's market power.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-56, 166, 173. Members and Colleges have derived less value from the process, including a reduction in their ability to find good matches, poorer quality and innovativeness of the application process, and increased monetary costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-57.

First, with regard to the exclusion of in-house or SIS-based application services from the Online Application Processing Market, Plaintiff alleges that they are not a reasonable substitute for third-party processing. Third-party solutions have distinct features, such as better data security and payment processing, and SIS-based application services require substantial time investment by the College. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 100-05. Because these systems are so \"barebones,\" Plaintiff alleges that Colleges would not turn to them in response to a small but significant, nontransitory increase in price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff excludes two-year, part-time, and graduate schools from the Admissions markets because of their distinct characteristics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 127, 139. The customer base is distinct because students seeking four-year or full-time undergraduate degree programs would not consider these-or could not consider them in the case of graduate programs-as alternatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Graduate program applications all require more specialized applications and processing, and graduate school application processing services are sold at a higher price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97-98. Thus, according to Plaintiff, a small but significant, nontransitory increase in the price of College programs would not result in students applying to these other programs, nor would an increase in price result in Colleges using graduate products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98, 127, 139.

Other Factors in the Interest of Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As to the remaining factors, the Court finds that they are, on balance, neutral and\n   therefore have little impact on this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The place of negotiation and execution of the relevant agreements is neutral. Defendant argues that the place of negotiation was Virginia, where Defendant is located, and that this factor weighs in favor of transfer. The Court disagrees. The contracts in this case were negotiated by phone and email in Virginia and throughout the United States, wherever the relevant member school was located. Rickard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. In other words, \"there is no one prominent location for negotiation or execution that would sway this Court's determination under this factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Shee Atika Languages, LLC v.

Alaska Feb. 27, 2008) (where the parties negotiated by phone and email and the parties were located in Virginia, Maine, and Alaska and not \"one place\" it had no bearing on the courts analysis under \u00a7 1404 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Overall, the interest of judicial efficiency is a neutral factor. The relative court congestion and time of trial in each forum weighs in favor of transfer. As Defendant notes, the Court's recent scheduling order, which set trial just under two years from now in August of 2020, is consistent with the \"26.5 month median timeline from the filing of a civil case to trial in the District of Oregon.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011429798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18 (citing Adam Decl. Ex. E). By comparison, the Eastern District of Virginia is a \"rocket docket,\" such that the median timeline from filing to trial is 10.8 months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011429798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As Plaintiff points out, however, the Court has already familiarized itself with the issues of the case, handled multiple motions, and set a global case schedule. In addition, this case has been pending in this district and the Ninth Circuit for over four years now. This factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Commc'n v.

The Court finds that this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court concludes that the evidence is located in multiple locations, though perhaps more evidence will be located in Virginia where Defendant is located.
