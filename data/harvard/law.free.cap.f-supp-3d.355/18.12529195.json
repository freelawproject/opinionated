In August 2018, the Court issued a memorandum and order dismissing the claims against several Defendants, while permitting claims against three Defendants to go forward.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Allen v. Alere Home Monitoring, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2018). What follows assumes familiarity with that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to issuing the decision, the Court had twice stayed proceedings against Defendant Tambra Investments (\"Tambra\") pending settlement discussions. The most recent stay expired before the Court issued its decision. But the Court's decision did not address the claims against Tambra in light of the prior stays and the parties' representations that they were attempting to settle the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now before the Court is a motion by Relator James Allen to enforce a purported settlement agreement, filed two days after the Court issued its decision. Relator claims that Tambra and he reached an enforceable settlement agreement prior to the Court's opinion. Tambra counters that no such agreement existed because its consent was contingent on the government agreeing to release Tambra's corporate officers from liability -- a proposal the government ultimately rejected. Without an enforceable settlement agreement, Tambra asks the Court to rule on its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with Tambra that the parties never reached a meeting of the minds on the scope of the release from the government that Tambra sought. Because this was a material term of the contemplated settlement, they did not reach an enforceable agreement. Thus, the motion to enforce (Dkt. No. 154) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the merits, Tambra's motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 101) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The material facts are drawn from written communications between the parties submitted in connection with the motion to enforce a settlement. They are not subject to genuine dispute. Facts relating to the underlying litigation are set forth in more detail in the Court's prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at 352-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Initial Settlement Offer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Relator made his initial settlement offer to Tambra in a February 2018 letter, which proposes that Relator obtain a monetary payment, and that Tambra agree to allow the blood testing at issue in the case to be done at the frequency independently chosen by a prescribing physician. Dkt. No. 155-1 at 3. In exchange, Tambra would receive a \"\n   <em>\n    release of all claims of the United States related to conduct\n   </em>\n   alleged by the Amended Complaint through the date of the settlement agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The letter contains a full paragraph describing the importance of government approval to the settlement process. Relator stated that \"the United States remains the real party in interest in this action, and any proposed settlement will require the consent of the Department of Justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The letter later reiterated that the settlement proposal \"is necessarily contingent upon approval from the Department of Justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The attorneys for Relator and Tambra continued to negotiate the terms of a possible monetary payment into March and April 2018. In a March 2018 email, Tambra's counsel proposed a monetary payment in exchange for \"a broad mutual release\" and the dismissal of the case against Tambra with prejudice. Dkt. No. 198-1 at 13. Relator's attorney said these terms were \"generally fine (subject, as always, to the government's blessing).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In a subsequent March 2018 settlement offer, Tambra's counsel again stated, \"Naturally there must be a full release and dismissal with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In April 2018, the parties jointly asked the Court for a stay. Dkt. No. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tambra's counsel wrote, \"I agree with the idea of staying as to [Tambra] so we can close on settlement.\" Dkt. No. 155-2 at 3. At this juncture, Relator's counsel remained cognizant of the fact that the parties would still need \"to get [the settlement agreement] by the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This understanding was also reflected in the motion for a stay. Dkt. No. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 2-6. The motion stated, \"Allen and [Tambra] agree that, if for some reason, the government objects to the settlement and the settlement cannot be effectuated, the stay may be lifted, and the case against [Tambra] will proceed ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. The Court allowed the motion. Dkt. No. 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Government's Involvement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April and May 2018, the federal government became involved in the settlement talks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 168-4 at 1; Dkt. No. 198-1 at 5. The parties agreed to begin drafting a settlement agreement using a government template. Dkt. No. 198-1 at 5. The government later provided Tambra's counsel with a first draft of a proposed settlement agreement, cautioning that the settlement \"remain[ed] currently under consideration by the United States.\" Dkt. No. 168-4 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June 2018, the government \"approved the settlement parameters.\" Dkt. No. 155-3 at 2. The agreement still lacked \"[f]inal approval\" from the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the United States Attorney's Office, but such approval could come only after Relator and Tambra finalized the draft from their end.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Around the same time, the parties' initial 60-day stay expired. They sought, and received, a second stay on June 4, 2018. Dkt. Nos. 151, 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In July 2018, settlement discussions faltered. On July 3, 2018, counsel for Tambra sent a redline draft of the settlement agreement to the assistant United States attorney working on the case. Dkt. No. 168-5 at 2. In the email accompanying the draft, Tambra's attorney stated that his \"primary concern relate[d] to the scope of the release.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Individual officers, directors, and employees, acting in their respective corporate capacities, need to be included in the scope of the release. I can't have a world where the company is dismissed and released, and then one week later, the officers, directors, and employees are sued for the exact same thing. Need to include everyone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel for Relator was copied on this email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   About an hour later, the government's attorney responded (again copying Relator's counsel), stating that \"many\" of Tambra's proposed edits remained \"very problematic\" for the government. Dkt. No. 168-6 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 5, 2018, the government's attorney sent a new draft. Dkt. No. 168-7 at 2. Despite the government's prior email, this version\n   <em>\n    accepted\n   </em>\n   Tambra's proposed release for officers and directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the government's email again concluded with the caveat that DOJ would still need to review and accept the draft agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Relator's attorney, who was copied on this email, approved the new draft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 6, 2018, the government's attorney retracted his acceptance of the release. Dkt. No. 168-9 at 2. He informed the parties that releasing the individual officers or directors would violate a DOJ policy instituted in a 2015 memorandum by former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He proposed different release language that did not apply to individual officers or directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As of July 10, 2018, Tambra still had not given a thumbs up or thumbs down to this\n   new release language. Dkt. No. 168-10 at 2. The government's lawyer advised that if Tambra did not assent to the more limited release, a settlement between Relator and Tambra could still go forward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But if that happened, the United States would dismiss the claims against Tambra only \"without prejudice,\" meaning the government could refile the claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 13, 2018, Relator's lawyer sent a text message to Tambra's lawyer to check in about the government's most recent draft of the agreement. Dkt. No. 168-11 at 2. Tambra's lawyer responded with his position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The entire value [of the settlement] was for [the] owners and employees to have peace of mind from the feds. We aren't getting that anymore. Not leaving a loophole open for a double dip opportunity at them.... Paying [redacted] for barely any release is not what I bargained for. I'm not pushing them to agree to this, unless [the] settlement amount drops or unless [the] scope of release expands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He later reiterated that, for his client, the main value of the proposed settlement was obtaining a personal release for the owners, officers, and employees of Tambra, as well as saved litigation expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is undisputed that Tambra never accepted the government's July 6 or July 10 proposals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Was There an Enforceable Settlement Agreement?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Relator argues that settlement negotiations occurred on two tracks: one involving him and Tambra, the other involving the federal government and Tambra. Relator asserts that he and Tambra had agreed to all material terms of a settlement, independent of any negotiations Tambra had with the government. He argues that the only outstanding contingency as to his agreement with Tambra -- approval of the release by the \"upper echelons\" of the federal government -- is not enough to render the agreement unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tambra contends there was only one contemplated settlement agreement, and it involved all three entities (Relator, Tambra, and the government). In its view, the parties never agreed on the language of the government's release, which was a material term. Specifically, Tambra wanted the government to broadly release its officers from personal liability and dismiss all claims with prejudice. Tambra states it did not agree to a settlement that did not include these terms. It insists that any such agreement would have been substantially less valuable to the company than its monetary offers up to that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

One provides a single test-frequency option (\"Weekly\"), followed by the notation, \"Medicare will cover up to 52 tests per year.\" Dkt. No. 206-2 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Another provides a different test-frequency option: \"As ordered by Beaumont [Anticoagulation Management Services].\" Dkt. No. 206-1 at 2. A third provides two test-frequency options: \"Weekly\" and \"Bi-Weekly.\" Dkt. No. 206-2 at 2. According to Relator, this third form is offered only to patients referred to Tambra by University of Michigan Anticoagulation Services. Relator asserts that these latter two forms belie Tambra's previous claim that it offers only weekly testing and support his theory that the \"weekly only\" form is part of \"a ruse\" to trick doctors and patients into ordering unnecessary tests. Tambra contends that it advised Relator that he was not a candidate for weekly testing services and asked Relator to stop contacting the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Relator's argument starts off on the wrong vein by asking the Court to consider two additional enrollment forms (the Beaumont and University of Michigan forms) that were not mentioned in the operative complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amend. Compl. \u00b6 242 (depicting the first enrollment form, but not the other two). As stated in the prior opinion, the Court cannot consider documents outside of the pleadings without converting this into a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v.

One of Relator's theories that survived in the prior opinion alleged that the enrollment form of Advanced Cardio Services (\"ACS\") included the false statement, \"Medicare recommends weekly testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it was reasonable to infer that a doctor would rely on this allegedly false statement in ordering tests, the claim satisfied Rule 9(b) and Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Unlike the ACS form, Tambra's forms contain no false statements. Relator does not allege, for instance, that Medicare does not cover up to 52 tests per year. Instead, the forms permit a prescribing physician to exercise her independent medical judgment in deciding whether to order the tests at the frequency options provided. The fact that Tambra offers different testing options to patients from different facilities is not, on its own, indicative of fraud. And Relator does not explain how these forms would otherwise support a strong inference of fraud. This theory of liability fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Tambra and the Dismissed Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the prior opinion, the Court separated the Defendants into two categories: those who actually provided tests to Relator, and those who did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The allegations in the complaint put Tambra into the latter category, as Relator never enrolled in Tambra's home-testing program, and Tambra never provided Relator with any testing kits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 230-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This categorization leaves Relator facing an uphill battle because it is difficult, based on an enrollment form alone, to satisfy Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527392\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/349/\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at 356-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the United States is the real party in interest in a qui tam action like this one, it is likely that federal common law governs. On the other hand, Relator seeks to enforce a settlement that, according to him, involved only two private parties -- Relator and Tambra.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In any event, the Court need not resolve this question because here Massachusetts law is similar to federal common law:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    It is axiomatic that to create an enforceable contract, there must be agreement between the parties on the material terms of that contract, and the parties must have a present intention to be bound by that agreement. It is not required that all terms of the agreement be precisely specified, and the presence of undefined or unspecified terms will not necessarily preclude the formation of a binding contract. The parties must, however, have progressed beyond the stage of \"imperfect negotiation.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v.
