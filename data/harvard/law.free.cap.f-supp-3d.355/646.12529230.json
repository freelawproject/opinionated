(Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 32.) Z.J., a resident of Tennessee, matriculated at Vanderbilt in the fall of 2012 and intended to graduate. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8, 11-12, 96.) Upon enrolling at Vanderbilt, Z.J. - like every other student - became (1) generally bound by Vanderbilt's honor code, which is embodied in the \"Community Creed,\" and (2) specifically governed by the policies and regulations set forth in the Vanderbilt Student Handbook (\"Handbook\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. Nos. 27-1 at 1-2.) Vanderbilt specifies that it reserves the right to \"add to, modify, or revoke any of its regulations and policies, including those in the [H]andbook, without notice,\" and students are cautioned that \"the information provided, and the regulations and policies articulated in the [Handbook\n   ] are not intended to be all-inclusive and do not constitute a contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2) The Handbook includes a general provision regarding \"Fair Procedures\" in which Vanderbilt states that it is \"committed to providing students with the opportunity to present complaints about the action of any member of the University community.\" (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 105.) Vanderbilt generally commits to providing \"fair and appropriate procedures, including the opportunity for appeal, for addressing and resolving complaints,\" that will be administered openly, fairly, cooperatively, and with a mutual respect among the participants. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Vanderbilt's Sexual Misconduct Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Handbook includes a dedicated disciplinary policy concerning \"Sexual Misconduct and other Forms of Power-Based Personal Violence\" (\"Sexual Misconduct Policy\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 99-121.) According to the Sexual Misconduct Policy, \"Vanderbilt takes reports of sexual misconduct and power-based personal violence seriously.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 108.) Vanderbilt (1) explains that it \"prohibits and seeks to eliminate all forms of sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment and sexual assault, and other forms of power-based personal violence, which includes dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking\"; (2) declares that it \"has a duty to take steps to prevent and redress sexual misconduct and power-based personal violence\"; and (3) affirms that \"[s]uch conduct is contrary to Vanderbilt's values, represents socially irresponsible behavior, and is not tolerated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Policy lists and defines a variety of prohibited offenses, several of which are relevant here. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 104.) \"Non-Consensual Sexual Contact\" includes \"any contact of a sexual nature - however slight - with the breasts, buttocks, groin, genitals, mouth, or other body part of another, by any person upon another without effective consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 104; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 50.) \"Dating Violence\" is defined as \"sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the person against whom the violence is perpetrated.\" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 104; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 50.) Finally, \"Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse\" is \"any vaginal and/or anal penetration - however slight - by a penis, object, tongue, or finger, and/or oral copulation (mouth to genital contact), by any person upon another without effective consent.\" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 104; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 50.) The Sexual Misconduct Policy clarifies that \"[d]eterminations regarding whether a person's level of intoxication affects their ability to give effective consent will be made on a case-by-case basis.\" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 106.) It also notes that intoxication does not \"provide a valid explanation or excuse for engaging in any form of sexual misconduct or power-based personal violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Finally, the Sexual Misconduct Policy defines effective consent as \"consent that is informed and freely and actively given.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   How Vanderbilt responds to complaints under the Sexual Misconduct Policy \"depends upon a variety of factors, including the wishes of the victim, the facts and circumstances of the specific incident, to whom it was reported, and [Vanderbilt's] obligations under applicable federal and state laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 108.) Vanderbilt recommends that students make complaints of sexual misconduct directly to its Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disabilities Services Department (\"EAD\"), which is led by the University's Title IX Coordinator (at the time Anita Jenious), and has responsibility for administrative investigation of reports of Sexual Misconduct Policy violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 110.) \"The EAD staff is trained annually and on an ongoing basis on issues related to sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and power-based personal violence, and in conducting investigations in a manner that protects the well-being and safety of the complainant, the respondent, and the [Vanderbilt] community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Students may also make an initial complaint to another Vanderbilt employee, and that person will refer the matter to EAD. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) \"Everyone is encouraged to report sexual misconduct or power-based personal violence even if some or all information is\n   unavailable or cannot be provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Sexual Misconduct Policy Complaint and Investigation Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After a complaint of a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy is brought to the attention of EAD, the first step is for the Title IX Coordinator and EAD to determine whether to proceed with an investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 111.) The Title IX Coordinator and EAD consider a variety of factors, including \"the interests of the complainant and [Vanderbilt's] commitment to a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all members of the [Vanderbilt] community.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 57.) On the other hand, in weighing a request that no investigation be conducted, \"the Title IX Coordinator will consider a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the complainant's desire for confidentiality, information concerning any previous allegations involving the respondent, the likelihood of repeated offenses, evidence that the alleged misconduct is part of a pattern of misconduct, and [Vanderbilt's] ability to ensure that the alleged misconduct does not contribute to the creation of a hostile environment for any students.\" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 111.) EAD will gather evidence from the complainant, including the names of potential witnesses and supporting documentation such as emails, text messages and social media posts. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 112.) If EAD determines a complaint involves an alleged violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, it \"will normally commence an investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon a determination by the Title IX Coordinator that an investigation involving a student respondent will be conducted, \"the EAD investigator will normally provide a summary of the allegations to the Director of Student Accountability,\" who will then \"determine the charge(s) to be brought, if any, and present the charge(s) and possible sanctions to the respondent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 112.) \"After the presentation of any charge(s), \"the respondent will have the opportunity to agree or disagree with the charge(s).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The completed charge sheet is then sent to EAD for further investigation and a determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) But whether or not the Director of Student Accountability has already presented charges, the Sexual Misconduct Policy directs that \"the EAD investigator will inform the respondent of the allegations, the status and/or initiation of an investigation, and the possibility of sanctions, and will provide the student alleged to have engaged in misconduct with an opportunity to respond to the allegations, ask questions, provide information, and offer names of witnesses or other people with relevant information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 113; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Policy provides that EAD investigators will interview the respondent and other individuals that it determines \"may have pertinent knowledge.\" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 113.) \"[S]upporting\n   documentation and information may be collected from the complainant, respondent, and witnesses,\" and \"EAD may request access to premises, records, documents, and other forms of evidence it deems relevant to the complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 59.) As the investigation progresses, EAD investigators may seek clarification from any person participating in the investigation regarding the incident or their statement. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 113.) The complainant and respondent are allowed to notify EAD investigators of \"any additional information during the course of the investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The Sexual Misconduct Policy states that the complainant and the respondent will be given the opportunity \"to review and revise the summar[ies] of their interview[s] prepared by the EAD investigator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Student are expected \"to cooperate with the investigation[ ] conducted by EAD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) During an investigation, both a complainant and respondent are permitted to have an \"adviser\" of their choosing to accompany them to meetings related to disposition of the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The adviser for either party may confer privately with that party, but may not speak on the party's behalf or otherwise participate in any meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the conclusion of an investigation, and prior to making a determination, EAD prepares a preliminary investigation report that contains a summary of the information and documents that EAD considers to be relevant to whether the respondent violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 114; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 59.) The complainant and respondent are each given an opportunity to review a copy of the preliminary report. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 114.) Both the complainant and respondent are then allowed to submit, within five days, up to five pages of written comments. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) After considering those comments on the preliminary report, EAD issues a final investigation report that sets forth EAD's final determinations, based on a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., more likely than not) standard, regarding whether the respondent violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy by engaging in any prohibited offenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 63.) The final investigation report contains a summary of the information and documents on which it is based and addresses, \"to the extent EAD considers appropriate,\" any comments received from the complainant or respondent on the preliminary report.

Also present at that interview was Z.J.'s personal adviser, a senior Vanderbilt student. (Doc. No. 45 at 3.) At this time, Z.J. was shown photographs of the bruising on A.H. He acknowledged that there were bruises on the upper part of both of A.H.'s breasts. (Doc. No. 45 at 10.)

(Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 80.) EAD sent it to Z.J. and A.H. the same day via email. (Doc. No. 45 at 4.) A.H. submitted comments in response - namely, that she did not remember Z.J. biting her or specifying that Z.J. threw her to the ground. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 77a.) A.H. also confirmed to\n   EAD that she told Z.J. that she had a previous negative interaction with someone who had put his hands around her throat. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 77b.) Z.J. did not respond to the preliminary investigation report. (Doc. No. 45 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   EAD issued the final investigative report (\"Final Report\") on May 9, 2016. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81; Doc. No. 45.) The Final Report explained EAD's analysis of the credibility of A.H. and Z.J., including its evaluation of consideration of the consistency of their statements, demeanor, their incentives to lie, the existence or absence of corroborating evidence, and the presence and/or plausibility of specific details in witnesses' statements. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 83; Doc. No. 45 at 14.) EAD concluded that A.H.'s account of the events of March 19, 2016 was more credible. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 84; Doc. No. 45 at 14.) This was based on A.H.'s more consistent reporting of the events to several different people, including VUPD, Alcorn, Student 1, and EAD (i.e., initial consensual petting, refusing sexual intercourse, Z.J. becoming upset, and Z.J. grabbing her neck) versus Z.J.'s less consistent reporting of events (including uncertainty as to whether A.H.'s clothing was removed and regarding where and how he placed his hands on A.H.'s neck). (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 84a; Doc. No. 45 at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Next, the Final Report reviewed the evidence and concluded that A.H. had the ability to recall details whereas Z.J. gave noncommittal answers. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 84b; Doc. No. 45 at 15.) In short, EAD found that A.H. could recall \"many more\" details than Z.J., some of which Z.J. confirmed, others of which Z.J. simply could not recall. (Doc. No. 45 at 15-16.) EAD also found corroborating evidence for A.H.'s reports to EAD or VUPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 16; Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 84c.) Specifically, the Final Report listed corroboration in the form of medical evidence, photographic evidence, surveillance video, A.H.'s more accurate time estimate, and Student 1's testimony. (Doc. No. 45 at 16.) EAD also noted that, although Z.J. later indicated that he thought A.H. was not being truthful, in his first EAD interview, Z.J. said that he was \"not calling A.H. a liar.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Informed by EAD's conclusions that A.H. was more credible and had better recall of details, EAD made several findings in the Final Report - namely, that: (1) Z.J. groped A.H. in an aggressive manner, (2) A.H. \"communicated clearly\" to Z.J. that she did not want to have sex because they were intoxicated and/or Z.J. did not know A.H.'s name; (3) the aggressive groping continued and is \"apparent\" in the medical and photographic evidence of significant bruising to the A.H.'s breasts; (4) Z.J. got upset when A.H. indicated that she did not want to have sex; (5) Z.J. got on top of A.H. and stated he wanted to have sex with her; (6) Z.J. removed A.H.'s underwear; (7) Z.J. attempted to push A.H.'s legs apart for the purpose of penetration; (8) as A.H. struggled to leave, Z.J. grabbed A.H.'s neck from the front and held her down for a few seconds; (9) it is not plausible that the tenderness to A.H.'s hyoid bone situated in the front of the neck and cricoid cartilage region near the middle and center of the neck was caused by Z.J. holding A.H. by the back of her neck; (10) A.H. was able to get out from under Z.J., had a panic attack, and spent nearly 30 minutes in Z.J.'s dorm restroom - behavior consistent with someone who has just experienced a traumatic event; (11) A.H. returned to her room, immediately took a shower and experienced another panic attack - further behavior consistent with someone who has just experienced a traumatic event. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 86; Doc. No. 45 at 17-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the end, EAD found that Z.J. engaged in contact of a sexual nature without effective consent, used physical force against A.H. during the encounter, and attempted to engage in non-consensual sexual intercourse with A.H. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 82; Doc. No. 45 at 2.) Accordingly, the Final Report explained that \"there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the respondent engaged in Non-Consensual Sexual Contact, Dating Violence, and Attempted Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse in violation of the [Sexual Misconduct Policy] based on a preponderance of evidence standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc.

No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 89, 92.) Z.J. stated that EAD's decision had been based on unfounded assumptions from second-hand sources, incomplete information, and \"lack of consideration for his own narrative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 92.) Z.J. noted in his appeal that a VUMC nurse had expressed the view that the bruises on A.H.'s thighs were not related to the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) On June 2, 2016, EAD Compliance Manager Carter filed a response to the appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 93.) Carter stated that EAD examined the totality of the evidence, did not know what incomplete evidence Z.J. referred to, and still found A.H. more credible. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) On June 3, 2016, Director of Student Accountability Solomon sent a letter to the Appellate Officers about Z.J.'s case. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 94.) She relied on the Final Report and stated that expulsion was the appropriate sanction because physical violence was involved. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Thereafter, the Appeals Officers affirmed the Final Report and decision to expel Z.J. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Z.J. was expelled from Vanderbilt three days before his 2016 graduation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 96.) He was not allowed to receive his degree, and his transcript was marked with the disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 96, 99.) Despite having been in the U.S. Army Reserve Officer Training Corps Program, Z.J. was not commissioned as an officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 97.)

(Doc. No. 1. at 1.) Z.J. filed an amended complaint one week later. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) On June 12, 2017, Vanderbilt removed this action to federal court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1331, and 1367. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) In June 2017, Vanderbilt filed a Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 7.) However, before the Court could rule on that motion, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued the decision in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Miami University\n   </em>\n   , which contained a relevant and important discussion of Title IX claims in the context of university sexual misconduct disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Miami Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p588\">\n    882 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To give the parties the opportunity to address that precedent, the Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice, granted Z.J. an opportunity to file a second amended complaint,\n   and allowed Vanderbilt to file a new motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 21 at 1-2.) Z.J. filed the Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") on March 9, 2018 (Doc. No. 23), and Vanderbilt thereafter filed a second Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Complaint generally purports to bring numerous causes of action, specifically (1) Title IX; (2) Clery Act; (3) Declaratory Judgment Act; (4) breach of contract; (5) promissory estoppel; (6) defamation; (7) negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ; (8) negligence; (9) gross negligence; (10) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (11) unjust enrichment claims, including sub-claims based on different theories of liability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 23.) Each of Z.J.'s claims is broadly premised on the allegation that Vanderbilt mishandled A.H.'s complaint against Z.J. under Vanderbilt's Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Z.J. seeks damages over $25,000,000; certain declaratory relief; and certain injunctive relief, including a ruling that Vanderbilt's findings were \"not supported by substantial evidence beyond the preponderance of evidence standard\" and to command Vanderbilt to expunge the incident from Z.J.'s records and confer a degree on him.

Thus, there is no basis for the Court to draw an inference of gender bias. Beyond that, the Complaint and Final Report suggest the contrary - that is, that Z.J. and A.H. were not similarly-situated.

Stated differently, conclusory allegations of gender bias, unsupported by even minimal data, credible anecdotal references, or the purported presence of specific external pressures, are insufficient to support a plausible erroneous outcome claim.

No. 23 at \u00b6 144.) Z.J. further alleges that (1) the facts are sufficient to \"cast some articulable doubt\" on the outcome of the disciplinary process; (2) Z.J. was discriminated against during that process despite the fact that A.H. was also intoxicated, (3) A.H. should have been investigated for violating Vanderbilt policies; (4) Vanderbilt inappropriately \"took the word of\" A.H. over his; and (5) Z.J.'s expulsion was an \"erroneous outcome\" when \"less drastic measures were applicable\" and because Z.J. was not arrested by law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 183-189.) Z.J. also, arguably, makes several other allegations scattered throughout the Complaint in support of this claim, including that (1) EAD's findings of fact were made \"despite some evidence to the contrary\"; (2) EAD's decision was the result of \"insufficient training and a cognitive bias towards male students\"; (3) EAD and the Appeals Board did not sufficiently address evidence put forward by Z.J.; and (4) the Appeals Board affirmed the decision to expel Z.J. \"despite acknowledging his cooperation with [ ] EAD and disciplinary record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88, 93, 95.)

Z.J. has neither alleged any statistics, patterns, or anecdotal evidence showing gender bias in reporting, investigation, or punishment under Vanderbilt's Sexual Misconduct Policy, nor alleged\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   policy or practice designed to produce gender-specific outcomes.

In a similar vein, Z.J. has not alleged a single statement by any university official evidencing gender bias before or during the disciplinary process. Z.J. has also not alleged any language in the Handbook that would suggest that gender bias played a role in the outcome of EAD's investigation, the Director of Student Accountability's sanction, or Z.J.'s appeal. Indeed, throughout the Sexual Misconduct Policy, complainants and respondents are carefully referred to as \"he or she or they,\" indicating that Vanderbilt believes that men\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   women can both be victims and perpetrators. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 27-1.) Most of Z.J.'s general allegations simply reflect dissatisfaction with the outcome of his particular case.

Z.J. further alleges that Vanderbilt proceeded with its investigation even though (1) VUPD and VUMC records did not contain sufficient evidence of his guilt, and (2) A.H.'s statements varied too much over time. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 110-113.) However, the Sexual Misconduct Policy does not require that any particular evidentiary threshold be met to for EAD to proceed with an investigation or terminate an investigation before completion. The Sexual Misconduct Policy sets forth various factors that EAD should take into consideration in determining whether to conduct an investigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   but none of these dictate a specific determination regarding the sufficiency of the evidence. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 57; Doc. No. 27-1 at 111.) This makes sense because, initially, EAD is not in possession of all the evidence, let alone in a position to evaluate it; EAD is only in a position to make a threshold finding regarding whether a student's complaint arguably falls within the Sexual Misconduct Policy. To that end, there is a process whereby EAD will gather some evidence from the complainant, including the names of potential witnesses and supporting documentation such as emails, text messages and social media posts, for the purpose of determining if a complaint actually involves a potential violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 112.) If such a determination is made, the Sexual Misconduct Policy states that EAD \"will normally commence an investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Once an investigation is commenced, the Sexual Misconduct Policy provides the procedural steps that EAD shall follow, proceeding through to preliminary and final investigative reports. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 113-14.) There is no requirement for EAD to reach\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   determinations regarding the sufficiency of the evidence\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   producing the investigative reports containing final conclusions based on the totality of the evidence and EAD's credibility determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Stated differently, there is no evidence-based yardstick in the Sexual Misconduct Policy for EAD to abandon an investigation prior to delivering its investigative reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, to proceed with an investigation pursuant to the Sexual Misconduct Policy, EAD need only follow basic steps to determine if the concerns raised in a student's complaint fall under the purview of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, and, once an investigation is commenced, EAD must follow its procedures and complete the investigation to reach a conclusion, by a preponderance of the evidence, regarding whether the respondent violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy. As long as the Sexual\n   Misconduct Policy is relevant to the complaint, there is neither a requirement of a particular evidentiary threshold for a complainant to be eligible for an EAD investigation, nor any metric for a respondent to assert that he is entitled to have EAD discontinue an ongoing investigation based on evidence that a respondent believes undercuts the complaint. Indeed, weighing evidence is the heart and soul of an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Here, the Complaint itself alleges that facts existed (including A.H.'s first-hand report to VUMC and VUPD of the events of March 19, 2016 and medical observations and photographs of \"obvious bilateral bruising to the breast tissue\") to support the conclusion that A.H.'s complaint indeed fell under the Sexual Misconduct Policy to justify the next step - EAD's investigation of the complaint. Accordingly, Z.J. cannot plausibly allege that Vanderbilt's decision to proceed with that investigation is a breach of contract simply by pointing to certain evidence that he believes weakened A.H.'s complaint or Vanderbilt's ultimate conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Belmont Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527438\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/877/#p899\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   897-98 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Instead, the Sexual Misconduct Policy only requires that an investigation be conducted in the broadest sense. In most relevant part, the Sexual Misconduct Policy specifically requires that EAD investigators interview the respondent and other individuals that EAD determines may have pertinent knowledge. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 113-14.) All other matters of \"appropriateness\" are left purely to EAD's discretion: EAD (1)\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   collect supporting documentation and information\n   from the complainant, respondent, and witnesses; (2)\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   request access to premises, records, documents, and other forms of evidence it deems relevant; and (3)\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   seek clarification from any person participating in the investigation regarding the incident or their statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) At the end of EAD's investigation, it\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   : (1) prepare a preliminary investigation report that contains a summary of the information and documents that EAD considers relevant to whether the respondent violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy; and, subsequently, (2) issue a final investigative report that sets forth EAD's final determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, regarding whether the respondent violated the Sexual Misconduct Policy by engaging in any of the prohibited offenses, including \"a summary of the information and documents on which it is based\" and addressing \"to the extent EAD considers appropriate,\" any comments received from the complainant or respondent. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The Appeals Officers are given even less guidance; they are merely required to consider the appeal based only on the materials presented to the EAD or new information introduced in certain limited circumstances.

Z.J. alleges that Vanderbilt conducted a timely investigation, interviewed witnesses (including Z.J. in person and A.H. through written question and answer over several weeks, and timely produced a Preliminary Report and Final Report that provided explanations of EAD's consideration of the evidence, witnesses' credibility, and factual conclusions related thereto.

(Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 114-115.) Specifically, Z.J. alleges that the Final Report contained as exhibits A.H.'s written statement to VUPD, but not A.H.'s (1) written narrative summary, (2) responses to questions asked by EAD; or (3) comments on the Preliminary Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Z.J. bases this claim upon the provision in the Sexual Misconduct Policy that states the final investigation report \"will contain a summary of the information and documents on which the final determination is based and will address, to the extent EAD considers appropriate, any comments received from the complainant or respondent.\n   <em>\n    The comments from the complainant and respondent will also be attached as an exhibit.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. No. 27-1 at 114 (emphasis added in Complaint).) However, the Sexual Misconduct Policy does not entitle a respondent to review all evidence or comments a complainant has supplied during the investigation process. The quoted language above is located in the \"Determinations\" section of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, which consists of a paragraph discussing the preliminary investigation report and a paragraph discussing the final investigation report. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The \"comments\" that this section refers to are clearly those provided in response to the preliminary investigation report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201569826\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201569826\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Both the complainant and respondent will have the opportunity to submit written comments to the preliminary investigation report.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Accordingly, the Sexual Misconduct Policy provides only for the following: (1) EAD shall summarize information on which its decision is based and need only discuss prior statements or comments of a complainant in its discretion, and (2) EAD shall attach copies of comments on the preliminary investigation report to the final investigation report. The Complaint concedes that Vanderbilt has summarized the information on which its decision was based (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 66-78), and the comprehensive Final Report reflects that this is so (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 45). Given no additional disclosure requirements exist under the Sexual Misconduct Policy, Z.J.'s claims based on EAD's alleged failures to attach A.H.'s (1) written narrative summary or (2) responses to questions must fail.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Faparusi v.

Ohio Feb. 28, 2017) (plaintiff cannot state plausible breach of contract action based upon procedural guarantee absent from university disciplinary policy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   That leaves the allegation that Vanderbilt did not attach to the Final Report A.H.'s comments to the Preliminary Report, an omission that the copy of the Final Report filed with the Court confirms. (Doc. No. 45.) However, the Complaint explicitly alleges that EAD summarized those comments in the Final Report (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 77), and the Final Report reflects that EAD indeed did so (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 45 at 12 n.16; 13 n.21). Thus, the failure to separately attach the comments was, in this instance, a mere technical violation of the policy that did not harm Z.J.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coll. of Wooster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275058\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/875/#p886\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (technical violation of handbook requirement was not a material breach where the procedure employed was \"fundamentally, or essentially, fair\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (Doc. No. 27-1 at 118 (Handbook specifying that procedural irregularities that are considered harmless by Appellate Officers are not a basis for upsetting a determination or sanction) ). Moreover, Z.J. has not alleged that he made any attempt to bring the omission of this exhibit to EAD's attention (i.e., to ask for the exhibit and be refused by Vanderbilt) after receiving the Final Report and before preparing his appeal. Thus, beyond the substantive insufficiency of this claim, it has been effectively waived.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tigrett v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509656\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/97/752/#p762\">\n    97 F.Supp.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (W.D. Va. 2000) (finding that where student had an opportunity to question members of disciplinary panel concerning alleged bias but did not challenge their impartiality, he waived subsequent claim of bias). This is therefore an insufficient basis for Z.J.'s breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Claim Based on Testimony of Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Z.J. alleges that he \"had the right to provide witnesses that interacted with [him] after the alleged incident, as well as any witnesses that could comment on [his] character and capability of committing such acts,\" and Vanderbilt breached this promise when EAD \"informed him that his witnesses were irrelevant because they were not present at the time of the incident.\" (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.) While Z.J. does not include any specific allegations in the factual narrative section of the Complaint, under the cause of action Z.J. alleges that his roommates were no different than Student 1 because Student 1 was \"only present afterwards,\" and his roommates were also present \"after A.H. left [Z.J.'s] suite.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 118.) Z.J. further alleges that \"EAD completely misinterpreted the conversation about witnesses that they had with [him],\" and that, as a result, \"[his] roommates were denied the right to potentially testify.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 118-119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Policy provides that the respondent may \"offer names of witnesses or other people with relevant information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 117; Doc. No. 45 at 113.) But it does not require that EAD interview every witness proposed by the respondent (or the complainant, for that matter). Rather, as discussed above, the Sexual Misconduct Policy gives EAD discretion to conduct interviews as it sees fit by merely stating that EAD \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   \" collect information from the complainant, respondent, and witnesses that EAD deems to have \"pertinent knowledge.\" (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 117; Doc. No. 45 at 113.) In other words, EAD is given the responsibility to determine what witnesses it interviews and what questions it asks them.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of the South II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201258104\">\n    2011 WL 1258104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (university procedures required investigator to meet with any witness identified by parties). Under the Sexual Misconduct Policy, therefore, a respondent or complainant has no specific contractual right to insist that EAD interview a witness that EAD determines, in its discretion, does not have pertinent knowledge. Furthermore, there is no obligation imposed by the Sexual Misconduct Policy that EAD explain its decisions regarding which witnesses it will interview to any party's satisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Z.J.'s attempt to equate Student 1 and his roommates is of no moment. The Complaint alleges, and the Final Report reflects, that Student 1 (1) directly witnessed A.H.'s panic attack in the shower and her alleged immediate physical injuries and (2) accompanied A.H. to VUMC. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 67, 76; Doc. No. 45.) Under the \"pertinent knowledge\" standard,\" EAD elected to interview Student 1. On the\n   other hand, the Complaint does not allege when Z.J.'s roommates arrived at his suite, aside from conceding that it was at some point after A.H. left. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 118.) While the Complaint states that Z.J. would have liked his roommates to \"potentially testify,\" it does not make offer any details regarding the specifics of EAD's alleged denial. This is peculiar, given that Z.J. would have personal knowledge of this issue if he proposed the witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Z.J. does not allege what steps he took to clarify the vague \"misinterpretation\" that he claims EAD was under about his proposed witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In sum, given the discretion afforded to EAD and the lack of specific allegations in the Complaint, Z.J. does not plausibly allege that Vanderbilt breached its contractual obligations by not interviewing his roommates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belmont Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527438\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/877/#p899\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   894 n.7 (dismissing breach of contract claim where policy allowed university investigators to meet with witnesses as reasonably necessary in its sole judgment);\n   <em>\n    Tsuruta v.

First, he repeats the claim that Vanderbilt breached the Sexual Misconduct Policy by not releasing A.H.'s statements and answers to EAD's questions - but this time, Z.J. contends that it was a breach of a separate obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence. (Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 121.) Second, Z.J. alleges that Vanderbilt had a duty to investigate A.H.'s potential mental illnesses and medications because she had a self-reported panic attack as a result of the alleged incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 122.) However, the Complaint identifies no basis for either of these claims in the Handbook or Sexual Misconduct Policy. As discussed above, the Sexual Misconduct Policy procedures specify what must be disclosed to a respondent. If there is no requirement that Vanderbilt disclose a complainant's statements and answers to questions to a complainant, then \"failure to do so cannot be deemed an intentional act of hiding information.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of the South II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201258104\">\n    2011 WL 1258104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 (explaining that, without procedural mandate, there is \"no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -like duty to disclose any potentially exculpatory evidence to the [r]espondent in private [university] disciplinary hearing context\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flaim v.

In any event, the Complaint alleges only that some investigation might have revealed that an unknown prescription drug that A.H. might have been taking could have somehow affected her \"state of mind\" in some unknown way.

(Doc. No. 23 at \u00b6 128-131.) Indeed, at no point after EAD commenced its investigation did A.H. answer questions in person. However, the Complaint does not allege that the Sexual Misconduct Policy requires a complainant to appear and be cross-examined by a respondent, and, indeed, there is no such requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Under the Sexual Misconduct Policy, EAD's determination of responsibility is made without a hearing, precluding an opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses. Thus, the implied contractual relationship between Z.J. and Vanderbilt does not provide for the right to confrontation that Z.J. alleges that he was denied. Admittedly, as the Court has previously recognized, in the context of a procedural due process claim against a public university a different result regarding the viability of this claim would likely arise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belmont Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527438\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/877/#p899\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   893-95 (citing\n   <em>\n    Baum\n   </em>\n   , 903 F.3d at 582-584 (holding that, if a public university has to choose between competing narratives to resolve a sexual misconduct case, the university must give the accused student or his agent some opportunity to cross-examine the accuser in the presence of a neutral fact-finder);\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p400\">\n    872 F.3d at 400-404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2017) (holding that a respondent facing suspension was entitled to cross-examination where the university was deciding between competing narratives and making a judgment as to the credibility of the accuser) ).

The court \"agree[d] .... that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing[ ] imposed on every contract ..., applied in the context of school disciplinary proceedings, creates an independent duty to provide basic fairness,\" but it clarified that \"whenever a school expressly promises no less than basic fairness ... the school's implied duty becomes superfluous and the court's analysis to ensure that the disciplinary proceedings were conducted with basic fairness[ ] focuses on assuring compliance with the express contractual promise[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517259\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/67/#p93\">\n    892 F.3d at 88-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   By means of its general promises of \"Fair Procedures,\" Vanderbilt promises to be open, fair, cooperative, and have respect for students.
