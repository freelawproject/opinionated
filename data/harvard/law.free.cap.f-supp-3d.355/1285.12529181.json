Zhaoqing Tifo does not contest Commerce's selection of P.T. Tifico's financial statements; in fact, that is the result for which Zhaoqing Tifo advocated at the administrative level. The gravamen of Zhaoqing Tifo's claim is that - to avoid double-counting - energy expenses must be excluded from the FOP database, because those expenses are already embedded in the financial ratios that\n   Commerce derived from the financial statements of P.T. Tifico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the Final Determination failed to address Zhaoqing Tifo's double counting claim,\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   remanded the matter to Commerce, to permit the agency to analyze whether energy costs are already reflected in the surrogate financial ratios that the agency derived from the financial statements of P.T. Tifico, such that the agency's inclusion of coal in the FOP database results in double-counting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1361-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the First Remand Results, filed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , Commerce reopened the decision that it made in its Final Determination concerning the selection of financial statements, abandoning its selection of the financial statements of P.T. Tifico. In lieu of the financial statements of P.T. Tifico, Commerce substituted an entirely different set of financial statements - the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific - because those statements are more detailed and, in particular, break out energy costs. In the First Remand Results, using P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements, Commerce excluded energy costs from the surrogate financial ratios and included them in the FOP database, thus accounting for energy costs but avoiding double counting.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand at 2, 5-10, 18 (Supp. Pub.

Thus, as\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   explained, the First Remand Results not only exceeded the scope of the remand ordered in\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , but, in addition and even more fundamentally, the First Remand Results were beyond the scope of Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint and, as such, beyond the scope of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1326-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now pending are Commerce's Second Remand Results, in which Commerce has derived the surrogate financial ratios using the financial statements of P.T.

That explanation, together with other relevant background information, is summarized below, for the sake of convenience and completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   explained, in calculating dumping margins for respondents in non-market economy countries, Commerce generally determines the normal value of the merchandise at issue based on the value of the factors of production (\"FOPs\") that are used to produce that merchandise in a surrogate market economy country selected by Commerce (\"the surrogate country\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there). Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(3), the factors of production to be valued \"include, but are not limited to - (A) hours of labor required, (B) quantities of raw materials employed, (C) amounts of energy and other utilities consumed, and (D) representative capital cost, including depreciation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, valuing the factors of production consumed in producing the merchandise at issue does not capture certain items such as (1) manufacturing/factory overhead, (2) selling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG &amp; A\"), and (3) profit. Commerce calculates surrogate values for those items using ratios - known as \"surrogate financial ratios\" - that the agency derives from the financial statements of one or more companies that produce identical (or at least comparable) merchandise in the relevant surrogate market economy country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there). This surrogate value analysis is designed to determine a producer's costs of production as if the producer operated in a hypothetical market economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1332-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Zhaoqing Tifo's claim here is that there are certain energy costs that are embedded in the surrogate financial ratios that Commerce derived from the financial statements of P.T. Tifico and then used in the agency's Final Determination that are also included elsewhere in the agency's antidumping calculations (specifically, in the FOP database).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zhaoqing Tifo argues that this results in the \"double counting\" of energy costs and inflates Zhaoqing Tifo's dumping margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   noted, in Commerce's Preliminary Determination here, Commerce selected Indonesia as the surrogate country and, in calculating surrogate financial ratios, relied on the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific, an Indonesian producer of polyester staple fiber. Commerce based its selection of P.T. Asia Pacific in part on its understanding at that time that P.T. Asia Pacific \"shares the same level of integration as Zhaoqing Tifo.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Certain Polyester Staple Fiber From the People's Republic of China: Preliminary Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C990\">\n    77 Fed.

P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements are relatively detailed and include separate line items for that company's energy inputs. In Commerce's Preliminary Determination, the agency therefore was able to exclude all energy costs from the surrogate financial ratios that it derived from P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements, and to value all of Zhaoqing Tifo's energy inputs - coal, electricity, and water - separately, in the FOP database, with no concerns about double counting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the administrative case brief that it filed with Commerce following the Preliminary Determination, Zhaoqing Tifo argued that the operations of P.T. Asia Pacific are much more highly integrated than those of Zhaoqing Tifo, and that it was therefore not appropriate for Commerce to rely on P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements in calculating surrogate financial ratios. Zhaoqing Tifo characterized itself as more comparable to P.T. Tifico - an Indonesian producer of polyester fiber which, according to Zhaoqing Tifo, has \"less integrated, less complex, production operations.\" As such, Zhaoqing Tifo argued that Commerce should use the financial statements of P.T. Tifico in the agency's Final Determination.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Zhaoqing Tifo's Administrative Case Brief (Pub. Doc. No. 94) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Domestic Producer filed a rebuttal brief responding to Zhaoqing Tifo's case brief. There, the Domestic Producer argued that, in calculating surrogate financial ratios, Commerce's Final Determination should continue to rely on the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific that Commerce had used in the Preliminary Determination. The Domestic Producer argued that Zhaoqing Tifo \"ha[d] not demonstrated that [the] difference in integration levels actually exists\" and that, in any event, any differences between the levels of integration of Zhaoqing Tifo and P.T. Asia Pacific are \"trivial.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1337-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Domestic Producer's Administrative\n   Rebuttal Brief (Pub. Doc. No. 101), quoted above).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, the Domestic Producer's rebuttal brief emphasized that the financial statements of P.T. Tifico are less \"complete and detailed\" than those of P.T. Asia Pacific - a consideration that the Domestic Producer deemed \"more critical\" than any differences in the levels of integration of the companies' operations. In particular, the Domestic Producer expressly and specifically cautioned Commerce that, because P.T. Tifico's financial statements \"include[ ]\n   <em>\n    no separate breakout\n   </em>\n   of [P.T. Tifico's] energy costs,\" Commerce's use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements in the Final Determination would require the agency to \"place all potential energy costs into the [manufacturing/factory] overhead numerator\" in the surrogate financial ratios and to \"turn off all company-specific energy and water consumption factors, in order to capture all costs while also preventing double-counting.\" In short, the Domestic Producer told Commerce flatly and unequivocally that - if Commerce used the financial statements of P.T. Tifico in the Final Determination to derive surrogate financial ratios - Commerce would have no choice but to remove coal from the FOP database in order to avoid double counting, because the lack of detail in P.T. Tifico's financial statements would make it impossible for the agency to identify and exclude energy expenses from the surrogate financial ratios.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including the Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum, and Domestic Producer's Administrative Rebuttal Brief, quoted above).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its Final Determination, Commerce reversed course. Rather than relying on P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements (as Commerce had in the Preliminary Determination), Commerce used the financial statements of P.T. Tifico to derive the surrogate financial ratios. In the words of the Final Determination, Commerce concluded that P.T. Tifico's \"less integrated and less complex production operations are more comparable to Zhaoqing Tifo's than those of P.T. Asia Pacific.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including the Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum, quoted above).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Final Determination acknowledged the Domestic Producer's admonition regarding the lack of detail in P.T. Tifico's financial statements, noting that P.T. Tifico's statements \"do[ ] not include a separate breakout of [P.T. Tifico's] costs for electricity and water.\" Therefore, \"in order to prevent double counting,\" Commerce in its Final Determination \"placed all electricity and water costs into the [manufacturing/factory] overhead numerator\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , included electricity and water in the surrogate financial ratios) and removed from the FOP database the \"electricity and water consumption factors\" that the agency had included in the database for purposes of the Preliminary Determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1338-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including the Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum, and Domestic Producer's Administrative Rebuttal Brief, quoted above).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, Commerce's Final Determination inexplicably left coal in the FOP database. Commerce gave no rationale as to why concerns about double counting - which led the agency to exclude water and electricity from the FOP database in the Final Determination - did not similarly compel the exclusion of coal. Nor did Commerce address the Domestic Producer's statement that using P.T. Tifico's financial statements would require Commerce to remove coal from the FOP database, in order to avoid double-counting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (and authorities cited there, including the Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Zhaoqing Tifo appealed, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Commerce's Final Determination double-counts certain energy expenses. Specifically, Zhaoqing Tifo contends that Commerce's inclusion of coal in the FOP database in the Final Determination results in double-counting, and is unsupported by substantial evidence, contrary to law, and arbitrary and capricious, because energy costs are already reflected in the surrogate financial ratios that Commerce derived from the financial statements of P.T. Tifico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Counts I-III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   No party sought judicial review of Commerce's selection of financial statements (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Commerce's decision to select the financial statements of P.T. Tifico rather than those of P.T. Asia Pacific) for use in the Final Determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Zhaoqing Tifo favored, and successfully advocated for, Commerce's use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements in the Final Determination, Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint does not contest Commerce's selection of financial statements. Zhaoqing Tifo's double-counting claim is much more narrow, much more specific, and much more refined. Taking (accepting) Commerce's decision selecting P.T. Tifico's financial statements in the Final Determination as a given, the claim in Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint is that, if energy expenses cannot be isolated and excluded from the surrogate financial ratios that Commerce derived from P.T. Tifico's statements, then coal expenses must be excluded from the FOP database in order to avoid double counting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Counts I-III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Domestic Producer intervened in the instant action. The Domestic Producer could have filed its own action, to challenge Commerce's selection of financial statements in the Final Determination -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Commerce's decision to use the financial statements of P.T. Tifico, rather than those of P.T. Asia Pacific (which the Domestic Producer had consistently favored). As summarized above, the Domestic Producer had pressed Commerce to use the more detailed financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific in the Final Determination. The Domestic Producer had expressly cautioned Commerce that use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements would require the agency to exclude energy expenses (including coal) from the FOP database in order to avoid double counting, because the agency would find it impossible to isolate and exclude energy expenses from P.T. Tifico's statements. Commerce failed to heed the Domestic Producer's warnings. Nevertheless, for whatever reason, the Domestic Producer elected not to seek judicial review of Commerce's selection of financial statements -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Commerce's decision to use the financial statements of P.T.

Tifico's financial statements, such that Commerce's inclusion of coal in the FOP database results in double counting in the Final Determination, and, in addition, to allow the agency, if appropriate, to explain the disparity in its treatment of water and electricity\n   <em>\n    versus\n   </em>\n   coal. Notably,\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   encouraged Commerce to consider reopening the administrative record on remand, observing that additional information could be placed on the record to illuminate relevant points concerning P.T.

Nor did those remand instructions refer to the use of any financial statements other than those of P.T. Tifico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notwithstanding the remand instructions in\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , Commerce's first remand did not address Zhaoqing Tifo's claim, which is confined to the use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements, the inclusion of coal in the FOP database, and the alleged resulting double-counting of energy expenses. Instead, Commerce reopened the broad issue of the selection of financial statements as a whole - an issue that Commerce had decided in the Final Determination and which was not challenged by any party in this litigation. Just as Commerce used the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific in its Preliminary Determination, but then used P.T. Tifico's statements for the Final Determination, Commerce flip-flopped once again in the First Remand Results. In the First Remand Results, Commerce reverted back to the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific - the same statements on which the agency had relied in its Preliminary Determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Remand Results at 2, 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In effect, the First Remand Results did not reconsider Commerce's decision in the Final Determination to leave coal in the FOP database notwithstanding the double-counting that allegedly resulted from Commerce's asserted inability to exclude energy expenses from the financial ratios that the agency derived from P.T. Tifico's financial statements. Rather, in the First Remand Results, Commerce reconsidered a different decision from the Final Determination:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Commerce's decision to select the financial statements of P.T. Tifico for the surrogate financial ratios over those of P.T. Asia Pacific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The First Remand Results did not directly address why Commerce on remand did not focus specifically on P.T. Tifico's financial statements and related surrogate financial ratios from the Final Determination, in order to determine whether it is possible to isolate and exclude energy expenses. Like the Final Determination, the First Remand Results also ignored the\n   disparate treatment of water and electricity\n   <em>\n    versus\n   </em>\n   coal in the Final Determination, where Commerce relied on the financial statements of P.T. Tifico and removed water and electricity from the FOP database for the professed purpose of avoiding double counting, but inexplicably left coal in the database. Similarly, the First Remand Results gave no indication as to whether Commerce had conducted a considered analysis of the matter and had concluded that using P.T. Tifico's financial statements while including coal in the FOP database in fact results in double-counting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Reopening the issue of the selection of financial statements, the First Remand Results once again reviewed the pros and cons of all of the financial statements on the administrative record, and quickly narrowed the field to the statements of P.T. Tifico and those of P.T. Asia Pacific (much like Commerce's Final Determination).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Remand Results at 5-6. As between those two, the First Remand Results revisited Commerce's earlier analysis of the relative levels of integration of Zhaoqing Tifo (on the one hand) and P.T. Tifico and P.T. Asia Pacific (on the other) - another decision made by Commerce in the Final Determination that no party challenged in litigation. The First Remand Results attributed Commerce's \"about-face\" - its selection of the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific, rather than those of P.T. Tifico - to an asserted error on the part of the agency in the Final Determination's analysis of the broad issue of the selection of financial statements.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to the First Remand Results, \"[u]pon reexamination of both financial statements,\" Commerce found that it had \"erred [in the Final Determination] in evaluating the similarities between Zhaoqing Tifo and P.T. Tifico on one hand, and the dissimilarity between P.T. Tifico and P.T. Asia Pacific on the other hand in terms of the level of integration.\" First Remand Results at 7. In its Final Determination, Commerce had based its decision to select the financial statements of P.T. Tifico over those of P.T. Asia Pacific in large measure on Commerce's conclusion that P.T. Asia Pacific is significantly more highly integrated than P.T. Tifico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum at 10-11. However, the First Remand Results stated that Commerce's re-review of the record evidence in the course of the remand did not support the Final Determination's finding that \"there is a meaningful difference in the level of integration between these two potential surrogate companies [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , P.T. Tifico and P.T. Asia Pacific], such that level of integration would be the deciding factor in determining which statement represents the best available information.\" First Remand Results at 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the First Remand Results, Commerce further decided that, if the choice between the financial statements of P.T. Tifico and P.T. Asia Pacific was no longer driven by the relative levels of integration of the three companies, the decisive factor\n   would be the level of detail reflected in the financial statements. The First Remand Results noted that P.T. Tifico's financial statements do not include a separate breakout of the company's energy expenses, such that - if the agency were to select P.T. Tifico's statements for purposes of deriving surrogate financial ratios - Commerce would be required to exclude coal from the FOP database in order to avoid double-counting, because energy costs would be embedded in the financial ratios. In the First Remand Results, Commerce therefore selected P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements, which are more detailed and include line item breakouts for energy expenses (among others). That level of detail allowed Commerce to exclude energy from the surrogate financial ratios and to instead value it separately in the FOP database, without double-counting.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   First Remand Results at 2, 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Commerce's use of P.T. Asia Pacific's financial statements in the First Remand Results significantly increased Zhaoqing Tifo's dumping margin. The Final Determination calculated Zhaoqing Tifo's dumping margin as 9.98%, using the financial statements of P.T. Tifico to derive surrogate financial ratios and removing water and electricity from the FOP database (because those costs were subsumed in the financial ratios), but leaving coal in the database. Zhaoqing Tifo's dumping margin jumped to 25.56% in the First Remand Results, where Commerce used the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific, rather than those of P.T. Tifico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Reviewing the First Remand Results,\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   explained that Commerce was not permitted to use the financial statements of P.T. Asia Pacific, because the agency's decision to use P.T. Tifico's financial statements in the Final Determination became final when no party sought judicial review of that decision.\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   therefore concluded that the First Remand Results exceeded the scope of the remand instructions in\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , and more importantly, the scope of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1326-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing the First Remand Results in the context of the scope of this litigation, in light of specific claim set forth in Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1331-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing the First Remand Results in the context of the scope of the remand instructions in\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   ).

Again, Commerce was encouraged to reopen the administrative record to afford the agency and the parties to place relevant evidence on the record that might help break down P.T. Tifico's financial statements as to energy, providing greater detail and at least conceivably permitting Commerce to exclude energy costs from the surrogate financial ratios derived from P.T. Tifico's financial statements, such that energy expenses could be included in the FOP database (as Commerce and the Domestic Producer urge).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1337-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the pending Second Remand Results, which Commerce has filed \"under protest,\" Commerce has used the financial statements of P.T.

Commerce therefore cannot include energy costs in the FOP database, because doing so would result in the double-counting of such expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Remand Results at 6. Commerce states that it would \"prefer\" to derive the financial ratios using the \"more complete and detailed\" financial statements of P.T.

The Domestic Producer could have challenged that decision by commencing an action in this forum on or before February 11, 2013 - the last day on which the Domestic Producer could have timely filed a summons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(1) (requiring that any action challenging a final determination in an antidumping proceeding be commenced by the filing of a summons within 30 days after Federal Register publication of the determination, followed by a complaint within 30 days thereafter); USCIT Rule 3(a)(2) (same).

Having failed to file its own action asserting such a challenge, the Domestic Producer, with the support of Commerce, now seeks to graft this broader challenge onto Zhaoqing Tifo's claim. But, regardless of Commerce's support, the Domestic Producer cannot use the back door to do what it should have done through the front door.

Tifico\n   for purposes of the agency's Final Determination. Certainly Zhaoqing Tifo has not sought to amend its Complaint to add such a claim; nor would it be in its interests to do so. The Domestic Producer could have - and apparently should have - preserved its rights by timely filing its own complaint, so as to challenge Commerce's selection of P.T. Tifico's financial statements over those of P.T. Asia Pacific.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is far too late for the Domestic Producer to do that now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(1) ; USCIT Rule 3(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Notwithstanding three rounds of briefing in this litigation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the initial briefing, the briefing on the First Remand Results, and the briefing on the Second Remand Results), neither the Government\n   nor the Domestic Producer has ever made any serious effort to respond either to Zhaoqing Tifo's arguments concerning the narrow, precise nature of the claim at issue (including the role of a complaint in defining the scope of litigation, and a court's jurisdiction) or to its arguments concerning the strict statutory time limits for filing an action challenging a final determination. As Zhaoqing Tifo has maintained, and as has been explained previously and yet again here), the scope of this action is determined by the claim set forth in Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint, which does not contest Commerce's decision in the Final Determination to select the financial statements of P.T. Tifico (rather than those of P.T. Asia Pacific). Because the Domestic Producer elected not to file its own action contesting Commerce's decision on the selection of financial statements, and because the \"double-counting\" claim asserted by Zhaoqing Tifo is laser-focused on\n   <em>\n    the implications\n   </em>\n   of Commerce's decision to select the financial statements of P.T. Tifico - and does not challenge that decision itself - Commerce's selection of the financial statements of P.T.

Tifico's financial statements and asserts that the use of those statements (rather than the statements of P.T. Asia Pacific) results in a dumping margin that is \"less accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second Remand Results at 2-3 (stating that the Second Remand Results are filed \"under protest\" and asserting that the use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements is \"as instructed by the Court\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (asserting that using P.T. Tifico's financial statements makes the dumping margin \"less accurate\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both of these positions miss the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   foisted on Commerce the use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements. It is Commerce itself that chose P.T. Tifico's financial statements in Commerce's own Final Determination, reversing the position that the agency had taken in its Preliminary Determination, which used the statements of P.T. Asia Pacific. Commerce made that decision over the vehement objections of the Domestic Producer, which expressly and specifically cautioned Commerce that use of P.T. Tifico's less detailed financial statements would require Commerce to exclude the cost of energy sources (including the cost of coal) from the FOP database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Similarly, as noted in section III.A above, given Commerce's decision to use the financial statements of P.T. Tifico in the Final Determination (ignoring the Domestic Producer's explicit and unambiguous warnings), the Domestic Producer could have filed its own action challenging Commerce's selection of financial statements (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the selection of P.T. Tifico's statements over those of P.T. Asia Pacific in Commerce's Final Determination). Had the Domestic Producer done so, the broad issue of Commerce's selection of financial statements (and the relative merits of one statement\n   <em>\n    versus\n   </em>\n   the other) would be a proper subject for litigation here and Commerce would have been free to reconsider its selection of financial statements. As it is, however, the Domestic Producer made an informed, deliberate, intentional decision not to file such an action. Therefore, like virtually all of the scores of decisions that Commerce made in reaching its Final Determination, Commerce's decision as to its selection of financial statements (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its selection of P.T. Tifico's statements over those of P.T. Asia Pacific) became final when the Domestic Producer failed to commence an action contesting that decision on or before February 11, 2013. The only aspects of Commerce's Final Determination that did not become final at that time are those that were preserved for judicial review in Zhaoqing Tifo's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, contrary to the implications in the Second Remand Results, it is not the\n   court that required Commerce to use the financial statements of P.T. Tifico. The requirement to use P.T. Tifico's financial statements is the product of, and is directly and exclusively attributable to, Commerce's decision to use P.T. Tifico's statements (rather than those of P.T. Asia Pacific) for purposes of the agency's Final Determination, in tandem with the Domestic Producer's failure to seek judicial review of that agency decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, the filing of the Second Remand Results \"under protest\" evinces a decision on the part of Commerce to rely on P.T. Tifico's financial statements based solely on the existing administrative record, without exhausting available avenues that might have shed light on P.T. Tifico and matters such as the company's energy consumption and how energy is accounted for in the company's financial statements, and thereby helped resolve any outstanding questions or concerns. Specifically, although the combined actions of Commerce and the Domestic Producer (as outlined above) preclude Commerce from using financial statements other than those of P.T. Tifico, there was nothing that prevented Commerce from reopening the administrative record (on the first remand and/or the most recent remand) to seek to clarify P.T. Tifico's energy costs and accounting practices, or for any other similar purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Commerce could have reopened the record and sought new evidence that might have permitted the agency to break down the energy figures in P.T. Tifico's financial statements so as to allow the agency to extract from those statements values for relevant production-related energy inputs (as opposed to, for example, values for energy properly accounted for as overhead) and thus to permit the agency to account for coal separately in the FOP database. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   encouraged Commerce to do exactly that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo I\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132372\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/1328/\">\n    60 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1365 ;\n   <em>\n    Zhaoqing Tifo II\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273901\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/1314/\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 1333, 1337-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because Commerce elected to forego such steps that might have permitted the agency to clarify the manner in which P.T. Tifico's financial statements account for energy, Commerce's complaints about the use (and limitations) of those financial statements - and the agency's filing of the Second Remand Results \"under protest\" - have a hollow ring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For much the same reason, Commerce's assertion that the use of P.T. Tifico's financial statements result in a \"less accurate\" dumping margin cannot be taken at face value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Commerce elected not to reopen the administrative record to seek\n   evidence that might have clarified the energy values reflected in P.T. Tifico's financial statements (and, for example, might have allowed Commerce to account for coal separately in the FOP database), any representations about the relative accuracy of dumping margins relying on the financial statements of P.T. Tifico\n   <em>\n    versus\n   </em>\n   those of P.T. Asia Pacific must necessarily be limited by the caveat \"on the\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   administrative record.\" By choosing not to reopen the record, Commerce precluded any possibility of enhancing the accuracy of the dumping margin calculated using P.T.

Although it is true that the issue that Zhaoqing Tifo has raised is related to the issue of Commerce's selection of financial statements, the two issues are entirely discrete. There is - as a matter of logic - no need for Commerce to reassess the relative merits of the financial statements of P.T. Tifico and P.T.

The remarkable fact is that Commerce wants the equivalent of a \"do-over\" in a case where it was warned expressly and in no uncertain terms (by the Domestic Producer, no less) that - if Commerce selected P.T. Tifico's financial statements for the Final Determination - Commerce would be forced to exclude coal expenses from the FOP database to avoid double-counting, because all energy expenses are already reflected in (and cannot readily be extracted from) those statements, due to their less detailed nature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    If Commerce were permitted to reopen the issue of the selection of financial statements here, it would be a very slippery slope.

But that is the agency's own, self-imposed constraint; and, however sound Commerce's policy might be as a general matter, this is a somewhat unusual situation. Because Commerce and the Domestic Producer were concerned about the lack of detail in P.T.

But Commerce squarely de-bunks that contention. The Second Remand Results state that Commerce \"disagrees\" with the Domestic Producer's contention and explain that, as standard agency practice, Commerce recognizes that, in financial statements, \"energy costs are captured in the manufacturing overhead unless the ... financial statements provide a detailed breakout of specific line items,\" including a line item for energy expenses.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8.

Reading the Second Remand Results as a whole, however, it is clear that this early statement does not accurately reflect Commerce's position.
