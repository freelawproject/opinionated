Service was made on the chief clerk of appellee at its offices in the Shoreham Building in this City. Appellee moved to dismiss the complaint and quash the service on the ground appellee was not authorized to transact business in and was not doing business in the District of Columbia. Appellee filed a supporting affidavit devoted' to the nature of its activities in this jurisdiction. Promptly thereafter appellants moved for a continuance of the hearing on the motion to dismiss to allow discovery to be obtained on the basis of interrogatories directed to appellee under Rule 33, Fed.R.Civ.P. The District Court granted appellee's motion to dismiss without benefit of answers to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">Appellants rely upon the first paragraph of 13 D.C.Code \u00a7 103 to support the service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-17\">\u201cIn actions against foreign corporations doing business in the District all process may be served on the agent of such corporation or person conducting its business, or, in case he is absent and can not be found, by leaving a copy at the principal place of business in the District, or, if there be no such place of business, by leaving the same at the place of business or residence of such agent in said District, and such service shall be effectual to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>bring the corporation before the court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Since appellee does have a place of business in this jurisdiction, service upon it does not depend upon the tort having been committed in the District of Columbia if appellee was \u201cdoing business\u201d here within the meaning of the first paragraph of Section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The question whether appellee was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the District of Columbia within the meaning of this section of course turns upon the facts. Appellee\u2019s affidavit contains a conclusionary statement that it did not have authority to transact business here. This, however, does not answer the question whether it was, in fact, doing business here, which is an issue of a combined factual and legal nature to be decided by the court. The affidavit also averred <em>inter alia </em>that the sole function of appellee\u2019s office here was to solicit traffic \u201clargely from the Federal Government,\u201d the traffic to be moved over transportation lines located entirely outside the District of Columbia, .that with respect to such traffic all financial matters were conducted outside the District of Columbia, and that appellee did not execute contracts, perform executive duties or approve or adjust or negotiate claims in this District. The interrogatories were designed to draw out more detailed information, including the .title and duties of every employee of appellee in its office here, whether any of its employees had authority to accept orders from any source, governmental or otherwise, and the function of the freight department located in the Shoreham Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In Mueller Brass Co. v. Alexander-Milburn Co., 80 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 152 F.2d 142 (1945), corporate activities consisting almost entirely of maintaining contact with government agencies, coupled with some solicitation of orders, were held not \u201cdoing business\u201d within the Code provision; and of similar tenor is Cancelmo v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 56 App.D.C. 225, 12 F.2d 166 (1926); and see Traher v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd., 111 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 294 F.2d 229 (1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 954, 82 S.Ct. 397, 7 L.Ed.2d 387 (1962). However, in Fiat Motor Co. v. Alabama Imported Cars, Inc., 110 U.S.App.D.C. 252, 292 F.2d 745, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 898, 82 S.Ct. 175, 7 L.Ed.2d 94 (1961), and Mutual International Export Co. v. Napco Industries, Inc., 114 U.S.App.D.C. 392, 316 F.2d 393 (1963), service in this jurisdiction was sustained, the court holding the foreign corporate defendants were \u201cdoing business\u201d here, though it should be added that in the latter case the alleged tort also occurred here; and in Frene v. Louisville Cement Co., 77 U.S.App.D.C. 129, 134, 134 F.2d 511, 516, 146 A.L.R. 926 (1943), where the subject is treated extensively, the court said, \u201cSolicitation plus maintaining an office is sufficient,\u201d a statement difficult to reconcile with the later holding in the <em>Mueller Brass Co, </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">The cases referred to,- without more, show the difficulty in drawing the line between doing and not doing business and the'consequent need of the court to be informed of the facts' before deciding the issue. Appellee\u2019s affidavit clearly implies that traffic is solicited, whether substantially is not disclosed, from others than the -Federal Government. Moreover, nowhere does it unequivocally aver .that the activities of its office in the Shoreham Building are its only activities in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Further information is necessary to determine whether solicitation is substantial and whether other activities, if any, are merely incidental to it or of greater significance. Appellants\u2019 interrogatories sought fuller disclosure in this as well as in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Action on the motion to dismiss should have awaited answers to the interrogatories, except as the interrogatories might be subject to valid objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Urquhart v. American-La France Foamite Corp., 79 U.S.App.D.C. 219, 144 F.2d 542, cert. denied, 323 U.S. 783, 65 S.Ct. 273, 89 L.Ed. 625 (1944). They were propounded under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This Rule provides for written interrogatories to be answered by an adverse party. If such party is a corporation the answers shall be by any officer or agent of the corporation. The Rule also provides that the interrogatories may relate to any matter which can be inquired into under Rule 26(b) and that the answers may be used to the same extent Rule 26(d) provides for the use of a deposition. Rule 26(d) (2) provides that the deposition of an officer or agent of a corporation may' be used by an adverse party for any purpose. This covers our case. Moreover, Rule 26(a) provides that any party may take testimony by discovery. Referring to Rule 26(a) this court in <em>Urquhart, </em>79 U.S.App.D.C. at 221, 144 F.2d at 544, said, in language equally applicable to this case, that the correct interpretation of the Rule is found in Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (1938) 2467, 2468, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-6\">\u201cWhere the defendant serves in advance of answer a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b), such as a foreign corporation moving to dismiss on the ground of the insufficiency of service of process, it would seem that the court should ordinarily grant leave to the plaintiff to take depositions on the issues of fact, if any, raised by the motion, such as matters relating to the question whether the foreign corporation is doing business in the state *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Jiffy Lubricator Co. v. Alemite Co., 28 F.Supp. 385 (D.C.N.D.1939) is cited in support. And see General Indus. Co. v. Birmingham Sound Reproducers Ltd., 26 F.R.D. 559 (E.D.N.Y.1961); 4 Moore, Federal Practice 2302 (2d ed. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\">. The second paragraph of 13 D.C.Code \u00a7 103 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">\u201cWhen a foreign corporation shall transact business in the District without having any place of business or resident agent therein, service upon any officer or agent or employee of such corporation in the District shall be effectual as to suits growing out of contracts entered into or to be performed, in whole or in part, in the District of Columbia or growing out of any tort committed in the said District.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-12\">.

MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AjS\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">As partially pointed out in the majority opinion, this suit was filed July 27, 1962, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by a husband and wife, who are residents of Virginia, to recover for injuries sustained by the husband in an accident at Lock-port, New York, allegedly caused by the negligence of the railroad company\u2019s employees. Process was served July 30, 1962, on the chief clerk of the appellee\u2019s office in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">On August 27, 1962, the New York Central, appearing specially, moved to dismiss or in the alternative to quash the service of process on the ground that on July 30, 1962, it was not doing business in the District of Columbia, and in support filed the affidavit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of its vice president averring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-16\">\u201c(1) That on June 8, 1961, the New York Central System was a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>solidated corporation incorporated in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan; that it is presently incorporated solely in the State of Delaware; and that its executive offices are, and always have been, located in the State of New York; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-3\">\u201c(2) That the corporation is engaged in the operation of lines of railroad, as a common carrier of passengers and freight, in the States of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and West Virginia ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\">\u201c(3) That the corporation has no authority to transact business in the District of Columbia and does not have, and never has had, a certificate of authority pursuant to the District of Columbia Code, Title 29, Section 933; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">\u201c(4) That the corporation does not own or operate, and never has owned or operated, any lines, track-age rights or transport facilities of any kind into or within the District of Columbia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201c(5) That the sole function of the New York Central System office, located in Room 228 of the Shoreham Building, Washington, D. C., is to solicit traffic, largely from the Federal Government, to be moved over lines entirely outside of the District of Columbia; and that all financial matters pursuant to such traffic are conducted outside of the District of Columbia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">\u201c(6) That the said District of Columbia office of the defendant does not execute contracts, perform executive duties, or approve, adjust, or negotiate claims; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">\u201c(7) That the said District of Columbia office does not determine the routing or scheduling of the defendant\u2019s trains as a result of orders solicited; and that all such orders are forwarded to New York where approval and all other executive decisions are made; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apc-dedup-1\">\u201c(8) That all employment agreements with the personnel of the District of Columbia office and their wages are determined by and paid from offices outside of the District of Columbia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-10\">\u201c(9) That the corporation has no funds, or bank accounts of any kind in the District of Columbia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An0g\">\u201c(10) That it owns no property located in the District of Columbia, other than office furniture of nominal value; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-11\">\u201c(11) That no formal meetings of shareholders or directors are held in the District of Columbia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayw-dedup-0\">\u201c(12) That the corporation has no registrar, transfer agent, trustee, or other agent for the transfer of its securities within the District of Columbia ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-12\">\u201c(13) That a copy of the Summons and Complaint in the above-entitled cause was personally served on July 30, 1962 at 11:00 a.m. by a Deputy U. S. Marshal on Ernest Hoff, Chief Clerk in the defendant\u2019s office located in Room 228 of the Shoreham Building, Washington, D. C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">The appellants did not controvert the foregoing affidavit, but on September 8, 1962, moved to continue the hearing on the railroad company\u2019s motion pending its response to interrogatories propounded to it that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">On September 26, 1962, the appellee moved the court to strike or quash the interrogatories on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-16\">\u201c1. The interrogatories as propounded go beyond the issues of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction raised by the defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or, In the Alternative, to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-17\">\u201c2. The plaintiffs have not controverted or denied that service of the Summons and Complaint was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>made upon a person authorized to receive service under Rule 4, of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-6\">\u201c3. The plaintiffs have made no showing that the defendant is doing business in the District of Columbia and that it is amenable to service of process in the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">\u201c4. The plaintiffs have the duty, under the circumstances, to controvert or deny the central elements of the defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or, In the Alternative, to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-8\">\u201c5. The plaintiffs have made no showing that the answers to their interrogatories are either necessary to or would help their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-9\">\u201c6. For such and other further reasons as will appear at the hearing on this Motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The cause came on for hearing on November 7, 1962, on the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint or to quash the service of process, on appellants\u2019 motion to continue the hearing thereon pending response to the interrogatories, and on the appellee\u2019s motion to strike or quash the interrogatories; and, after argument of counsel, the court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">On appeal from this action of the District Court, the appellants present two questions, which they describe in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">\u201cThe question is [1] whether, in a negligence action for personal injury filed against appellee railroad, the trial court erred in refusing to allow appellant to undertake discovery before ruling on a motion to quash service and [2] whether the trial court erred in granting a motion to quash service when the ap-pellee railroad has had an office in the District of Columbia since 1940 with an average staff of six to eight persons and is actively engaged in soliciting business from the Federal Government.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">Thus, the appellants contend that the District Court erred in quashing the service of process without awaiting answers to interrogatories and, at the same time, contend that the local activity disclosed by appellee\u2019s affidavits \u2014 active solicitation of business from the Government by a staff maintained for that purpose \u2014 constituted \u201cdoing business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 13-103, D.C.Code (1961). They devote the larger portion of their brief to argument in support of the second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">The majority answer the first of appellants\u2019 questions by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-15\">\u201cAction on the motion to dismiss should have awaited answers to the interrogatories, except as the interrogatories might be subject to valid objection. Urquhart v. American La France Foamite Corp., 79 U.S.App.D.C. 219, 144 F.2d 542, cert. denied 323 U.S. 783, 65 S.Ct. 273, 89 L.Ed. 625 (1944). * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">On this holding they reverse and remand, without discussing the second question raised by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">Thus the majority merely say the trial judge erred in acting on the motion to dismiss without requiring and awaiting answers to the interrogatories \u2014 a holding with which I cannot agree, and which I shall discuss later. Very properly, they do not hold that the trial judge erred in dismissing the complaint on the showing made by the affidavits that the railroad company was not doing business here within the meaning of the applicable Code provision. Such a holding would have been contrary to established principles, as will appear from what follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-18\">The averments of the affidavits, reproduced above, show that the New York Central System, a Delaware corporation, does not own or operate any lines, track-age rights or transport facilities of any kind into or within the District of Columbia, and that the sole function of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Washington office \u201cis to solicit traffic, largely from the Federal Government, to be moved over lines entirely outside of the District of Columbia.\u201d The affidavits further state that the District of Columbia office \u201cdoes not execute contracts, perform executive duties, or approve, adjust or negotiate claims,\u201d and that orders solicited and obtained by the Washington office \u201care forwarded to New Yoi-k where approval and all other executive decisions are made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The situation disclosed by the undisputed affidavits is exactly that which we referred to in Cancelmo v. Seaboard Air Line Ry.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">\u201c * * * A railroad company which has no tracks within a district is not doing business therein, in the sense that liability for service is incurred because it hires an office and employs an agent for the merely incidental business of solicitation of freight and passenger traffic. Green v. C[hicago] B. &amp; Q. Ry. Co., 205 U.S. 530, 27 S.Ct. 595, 51 L.Ed. 916. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">This principle has not changed in the intervening years. We repeated it in Mueller Brass Co. v. Alexander Milburn Co., 80 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 152 F.2d 142 (1945), and in Traher v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd., 111 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 294 F.2d 229 (1961). In the latter case we said De Havilland\u2019s employee in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-8\">\u201c * * * is without authority to accept orders from any source, governmental or otherwise, or to execute contracts on behalf of appellee. All contracts are entered into at ap-pellee\u2019s offices in Canada, and deliveries of aircraft are made in that country. The present suit has no connection with the District of Columbia or appellee\u2019s activities here, such as they are. We conclude that under these circumstances the attempted service of process was properly quashed. See Mueller Brass Co. v. Alexander Milburn Co., 80 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 152 F.2d 142* (1945); cf. Frene v. Louisville Cement Co., 77 U.S.App.D.C. 129, 134 F.2d 511, 146 A.L.R. 926 (1943).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-10\">\u201cOur recent decision in Fiat Motor Co. v. Alabama Imported Cars, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 252, 292 F.2d 745 (1961), is not to the contrary. That was a suit instituted under the Automobile Dealers Franchise Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1225, affecting-business relationships and transactions between private parties within, the District of Columbia. In Mueller Brass the governmental contracts of the defendant were held insufficient to provide a basis for service in a suit brought by a plaintiff not involved in those contracts. The same is true in the instant case, which is strikingly similar in its facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">In Frene v. Louisville Cement Co., 77 U.S.App.D.C. 129, 134 F.2d 511, 146. A.L.R. 926 (1943), service on the foreign corporation was sustained because-there was more activity here than mere-solicitation and the maintenance of an. office, as we carefully pointed out in the-<em>Mueller Brass </em>decision. Hence the statement in the Frene case that \u201cSolicitation plus maintaining an office is sufficient,\u201d' to which the majority refer, is a bit of <em>dictum </em>which has no effect and so was disregarded by the <em>Mueller Brass </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Although they recite the salient aver-ments of the affidavits which, in my view, bring this case within the doctrine of the decisions above summarized,, the majority hold that action on the motion to dismiss should have awaited' answers to the interrogatories which; they say</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-13\">\u201c * * * were designed to draw out more detailed information, including the title and duties of every employee of appellee in its office-here, whether any of its employees-had authority to accept orders from, any source, governmental or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>wise, and the function of the freight department located in the Shoreham Building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">It is noted, however, that the appellee\u2019s affidavits amply showed the function of the Washington office and the lack of authority in its employees to accept orders from any source, and that detailed information could not have changed the basic and controlling facts. Moreover, I suggest that information concerning \u201cthe title and duties of every employee of ap-pellee in its office here\u201d could not have changed the situation presented and would not have been helpful to the court in evaluating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Under Rule 43(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial judge is authorized to hear a motion on affidavits. Those filed by the appellee were not controverted in any manner: the appellants did not present counter-affidavits, nor did they offer to disprove the allegations of appellee\u2019s affidavits by depositions or by the interrogatories. As the statements of appellee\u2019s affidavits were not disputed, the trial court properly considered them as having been admitted by the appellants. Washington v. McGrath, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 182 F.2d 375 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The majority cite Urquhart v. American-La France Foamite Corp.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as authority for holding that action on the motion to dismiss should have awaited answers to the interrogatories. That case involved the construction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (1946),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which was the only statute governing jurisdiction over a non-resident in a patent infringement suit. Such a suit may be brought \u201cin any district in which the defendant * * * shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.\u201d This is quite different from the concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d contained in \u00a7 13-103, D.C.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The District Court in the <em>Urquhart </em>case found, on affidavits, that no act of infringement occurred in the District of Columbia. The court refused to permit the plaintiffs to take depositions for the purpose of disproving the allegations of defendant\u2019s affidavits, on the idea that it lacked power to do so. We held this refusal was error, quoting Professor Moore\u2019s statement that in such cases \u201cthe court should <em>ordinarily </em>grant leave to the plaintiff to take depositions on the issues of fact, if any, raised by the motion [to quash service of process] * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">We recognized, however, \u201cthat the court has discretion under Rule 43(e) to decide on affidavits alone such a motion to dismiss as the one we are considering here.\u201d But we decided that \u201cin view of the terms of the affidavits it is likely that permission would have been granted to take depositions had the court thought it had power to do so.\u201d No such consideration exists here. As I have said, in the <em>Urquhart </em>case the affidavits were disputed and there was an offer to disprove them by depositions; in this case, they were not disputed and there was no offer to disprove them. The interrogatories amounted to nothing more than a fishing expedition in which the appellants hoped to induce the appellee to contradict its own affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">For these reasons, I dissent from the decision of the majority.
