The evidence referred to was an indictment of appellant, followed by his plea of guilty, for violation of the Dyer Act. However, appellant had some six or seven months notice, prior to his final revocation hearing, that the Board considered this new evidence to be ground for revocation. In these circumstances we do not think the use of the evidence invalidates the revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
