His prior conviction on the same charges was reversed for failure of the first indictment to allege the limited subject under inquiry at the time the questions were asked. Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962). At the second trial new testimony raised legal issues not considered in our first <em>Shelton </em>decision, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 153, 280 F.2d 701 (1960), which we find require reversal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>At the first trial Subcommittee counsel Sourwine testified that there had been received an anonymous letter suggesting that a \u201cShelton\u201d of the New York Times could give the Subcommittee useful information concerning Communist infiltration of the press. It was for this reason, he said, that he included the name \u201cWillard Shelton\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on a proposed list of witnesses to be subpoenaed which lie submitted to the Subcommittee chairman for approval. At the second trial<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sourwine testified he did not inform the Subcommittee chairman or any other member of the Subcommittee about the letter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or communicate to them any other reason for selecting \u201cWillard Shelton.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a matter of fact, no effort was made, according to Subcommittee counsel, to explain the reason for subpoenaing any particular witness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Subcommittee chairman was merely ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>vised in general terms why counsel wanted subpoenas to issue. The record indicates that the subpoenas were prepared under the direction of the Subcommittee counsel and submitted to the chairman for signature. It does not appear, however, that the chairman always signed the subpoenas himself, having on occasion delegated that function to his administrative assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">On the first trial, appellant repeatedly attempted, without success, to have Subcommittee counsel produce the anonymous letter which he claimed supported the subpoena for a \u201cShelton.\u201d Sourwine maintained it was still in existence, but the Government simply declined to produce it. At the second trial, when appellant made an attempt to obtain the letter, Sourwine testified that while appellant Robert Shelton\u2019s first conviction was pending on appeal he had the letter destroyed as obsolete, through inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Shelton contends that his First Amendment rights as an individual and as a member of the press were violated by the Subcommittee\u2019s effort to have him answer questions. At the time he refused to answer questions, asserting his First Amendment freedom, he told the Subcommittee that it was \u201cpeeking over my shoulder\u201d while he was writing for the Times and \u201cnudging the end of my copy pencil.\u201d He asserts here that, in addition to attempting to influence what he wrote, the Subcommittee lacked probable cause under the First or Fourth Amendments<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to subpoena him. He states he was the victim of the accidental subpoenaing of the wrong Shelton. He also maintains that the Subcommittee violated its own rules in subpoenaing him, a point not raised on the prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The Government asserts that the Subcommittee\u2019s investigation was of Communism, not of the press; that Shelton was subpoenaed on the basis of an anonymous letter which satisfied any need for probable cause under the First or Fourth Amendments; and that the subpoena for Shelton was validly issued over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>signature of the chairman of the Subcommittee on the recommendation of Subcommittee counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In this ease we tread in the delicate area of First Amendment freedoms. As in Rumely v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 382, 197 F.2d 166 (1952), affirmed, 345 U.S. 41, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770 (1953), this court is asked to resolve a conflict between the informing function of Congress and appellant\u2019s First Amendment freedom as an individual and as a member of the press. We are asked to weigh the interest of the Government to obtain information in an area which may affect national security and the competing interest of the individual to be free from compulsory participation in such an inquiry. In short, we are asked to balance Congress\u2019 need to know against the right of the individual and the press to be let alone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Unquestionably, \u201c[t]he power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad.\u201d Watkins v. United States, supra Note 9, 354 U.S. at 187, 77 S.Ct. at 1179, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273. But \u201c[t]he Bill of Rights is applicable to investigations as to all forms of governmental action. Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves. They cannot be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure. Nor can the First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, religion, or political belief and association be abridged.\u201d <em>Id., </em>354 U.S. at 188, 77 S.Ct. at 1179, 1 L.Ed. 2d 1273. Thus in this case we are asked to stake out the limits of the investigative power of Congress insofar as that power affects the First Amendment rights of Shelton as a member of the press. We shrink from this awesome task and adopt a narrower disposition of this case which will not require the resolution of the constitutional problem presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In so doing, we press into service our opinion in Rumely v. United States, supra. There, faced with the same problem, we found that by an interpretation of the resolution which created the House Committee before which Rumely, a publisher, refused to testify and produce documents, we could avoid the constitutional question. We found that the resolution did not authorize the type of inquiry addressed to Rumely, and his contempt conviction was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">In affirming that disposition, the Supreme Court indicated that even a strained interpretation of the congressional resolution was preferable to deciding the case on a constitutional basis. The Court noted that \u201c[t]o give such meaning is not barred by intellectual honesty. So to interpret is in the candid service of avoiding a serious constitutional doubt.\u201d United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 47, 73 S.Ct. 543, 546, 97 L.Ed. 770 (1953). Fortunately, here straining is unnecessary, for the charter of the Subcommittee makes clear that the Shelton subpoena was invalidly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee was created pursuant to Senate Resolution 366 of the Eighty-first Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>gress, Second Session. Section 2 of that resolution outlines the power of the Subcommittee with respect to the attendance of witnesses at hearings: \u201cThe committee, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof, is authorized * * * to require by subpenas or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses * * * as it deems advisable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> * * * Subpenas shall be issued by the chairman of the committee or the subcommittee, and may be served by any person designated by such chairman.\u201d Examination of this authorization discloses that the resolution divides the authority with respect to the attendance of witnesses into two parts. The first gives to the committee or subcommittee itself the discretionary function of calling such witnesses \u201cas it deems advisable.\u201d Thus it places in the Subcommittee the power <em>and the responsibility </em><footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of deciding who shall be called. It then places the mechanical or ministerial function of issuing the subpoenas in the chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Here, admittedly,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Subcommittee did not determine the witnesses to be called. But the Government points to Rule 2 of the Subcommittee\u2019s rules and argues that, since the Subcommittee itself has interpreted the resolution in its Rule 2, the court must accept that interpretation. Rule 2, however, merely refers to the ministerial duty of issuing subpoenas. It says: \u201cSubpenas for attendance of witnesses * * * shall be issued by the subcommittee chairman or by any other member of the subcommittee designated by him.\u201d Thus Rule 2 would allow the chairman to delegate his ministerial responsibility under the resolution for issuing subpoenas to another member of the Subcommittee. Rule 2 makes no reference whatever to the discretionary function of calling witnesses \u201cit deems advisable,\u201d which function Senate Resolution 366 imposes on the Subcommittee itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since the Subcommittee did not authorize the issuance of the subpoena to Shelton, the subpoena was invalid. Compare Yellin v. United States, 374 U.S. 109, 83 S.Ct. 1828, 10 L.Ed.2d 778 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Actually, one cannot read this record without realizing that the whole function of determining who the witnesses would be was <em>de facto </em>delegated to the Subcommittee counsel. Not even- the chairman, by his own admission and that of the Subcommittee counsel, made the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to call Shelton, nor did he know why Shelton was called. Thus, assuming the language of Senate Resolution 366, \u201cThe committee [may] require by subpena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses * * * as it deems advisable,\u201d can be read to mean \u201cas the chairman deems advisable,\u201d still the subpoena to call Shelton was invalid because the decision to issue it was <em>de facto </em>made by Subcommittee counsel alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As its final argument<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> on this point, the Government says that, in any event, the Subcommittee, by its presence at the time Shelton refused to answer the questions, ratified his appearance as a witness. We do not agree. Shelton had a right under the Subcommittee charter to have the Subcommittee responsibly consider whether or not he should be subpoenaed before the subpoena issued. Shelton\u2019s rights were abridged when the subpoena was issued without Subcommittee authorization.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Cf. Christoffel v. United States, 338 U.S. 84, 69 S.Ct. 1447, 93 L.Ed. 1826 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Finally, since this case is in many respects similar to Yellin v. United States, supra,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we repeat here what the Supreme Court observed there: \u201cThe Committee prepared the groundwork for prosecution in Yellin\u2019s case meticulously. It is not too exacting to require that the Committee be equally meticulous in obeying its own [charter].\u201d 374 U.S. at 124, 83 S. Ct. at 1837, 10 L.Ed.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">.

In addition to the reason for reversal shown in the text of this opinion, wo question the factual findings of the District Court with reference to <em>subject under inquiry, </em>a central element of the offense charged. See Russell v. United States, supra, 309 U.S. at 764, 82 S.Ct. at 1047, 8 L.Ed.2d 240. In the first <em>Shelton </em>ease, the Government succeeded in proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, as alleged in the first indictment and as stated in the bill of particulars, that the subject under inquiry was <em>not more limited </em>than the authorization to investigate \u201csubversive activities in the United States\u201d stated in Senate Resolution 366, 83 st Cong., 2d Sess. The second indictment alleged, as to this element of the offense, and the trial court found proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that the subject under inquiry at the time was indeed <em>more limit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ed, <em>i.e., </em>limited to \u201cCommunist activities in news media.\u201d In view of the disposition made herein, we do not pursue this apparent inconsistency or the related questions of estoppel and prejudice resulting from the six-year delay between trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b655-4\">.

Shelton was called because of an anonymous letter mentioning a \u201cShelton.\u201d The Subcommittee counsel stated, \u201cI think we could have called anyone on the editorial side of the New York Times and asked them whether they had any knowledge of it\u201d (Communist infiltration), but then testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask the committee to authorize the subpoenaing of anyone on the basis of that theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">At another time he stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">\u201cA. * * * Now, I\u2019m not trying to withhold the facts from you, and I will be perfectly willing to concede here that he probably would not have been called; that is, we would not have sought to secure the testimony of the Shelton who worked on the news side of the New York Times if we had not received information from this informant that there was such a Shelton and that he was connected with a Communist group on the Times and should be able to\u00bb give us information.

The mere summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be disastrous. This effect is even more harsh when it is past beliefs, expressions or associations that are disclosed and judged by current standards rather than those contemporary with the matters exposed. Nor does the witness alone suffer the consequences. Those who are identified by witnesses and thereby placed in the same glare of publicity are equally subject to public stigma, scorn and obloquy. Beyond that, there is the more subtle and immeasurable effect upon those who tend to adhere to the most orthodox and uncontroversial views and associations in order to avoid a similar fate at some future time. That this impact is partly the result of non-governmental activity by private persons cannot relieve the investigators of their responsibility for initiating the reaction.\u201d Watkins v.

The authority \u201cto delegate the exercise of the subpoena power is not lightly to be inferred. It is a power capable of oppressive use * * Cudahy Packing Co. of Louisiana v.

The Government suggests that \u00a7 2 of Senate Resolution 366 relating to the subpoenaing of witnesses concerns only the internal management of the Subcommittee and not the protection of the rights of witnesses. We think that Yellin v. United States supra, 374 U.S. at 115\u2014118, 83 S.Ct. at 1832-1834, 10 L.Ed.2d 778, provides the answer to this suggestion. It is perfectly clear that here, as in <em>Yellin, </em>the rule governing the committee is for the protection of witnesses. Senator Hennings\u2019 statement at the January 6, 1956, Subcommittee hearing restates the duty of the Subcommittee itself, rather than Subcommittee counsel, to determine which witnesses to call. The statement phrases the decision in terms of balancing the value of the witness\u2019 testimony against the injury that would be caused by requiring testimony. Indeed, Senator Hennings explicitly refers to the Subcommittee\u2019s duty in this regard as \u201ca duty to protect witnesses.\u201d See Hearings Before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Pursuant to S.Res. 58, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., Part 17, at pp. 1718-1719 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b659-13\">.

In <em>Yellin, </em>which involved a rule on private and public sessions of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Court noted two improprieties, both analogous to the facts of this case: the \u201cdecision to question Yellin publicly, made before serving him with a subpoena, was made without' following\u201d the Committee rule, and a Committee \u201cStaif Director, who lacked the authority to do so, acted in the Committee\u2019s stead\u201d in making a decision on Yellin\u2019s testifying in public. Yellin v. United States, supra, 374 U.S. at 119, 83 S.Ct. at 1834, 10L.Ed.2d 778. The factual similarity to this case is obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
