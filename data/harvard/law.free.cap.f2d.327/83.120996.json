His employer Strachan, the appellant here, paid him $27,836.92 compensation and other benefits under the Longshoreman\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Melvin then employed an attorney to prosecute his claim against a third party tort feasor. The contract between Melvin and his attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201cIt is hereby understood and agreed that I am to receive sixty (60%) per cent of all damages recovered by way of suit or settlement, and my attorney is to have for his fee the balance derived from said suit or settlement and disbursements and taxable costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Suit was filed and the case was tried by a jury which returned a verdict for Melvin of $30,000.00. The third party against whom the judgment was rendered paid that amount into the registry of the court and Melvin\u2019s attorney filed a petition asserting that he was entitled to 40% of the sum plus his expenses arising out of the suit, and claiming that his lien had priority over the subrogation lien claimed by appellant. The District Court held that Melvin \u201c * * * is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses of the litigation, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, as a first charge against the fund recovered from the third party.\u201d The court thereafter conducted a hearing, took evidence, and determined that a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee was 40% of the amount recovered plus expenses. Accordingly, out of the $30,000.00, Melvin\u2019s attorney was awarded $12,000.00 as a fee plus $558.88 expenses. The remainder was ordered to be paid to appellant. It is well settled and not disputed on this appeal that both the employer and the attorney have a lien on the recovery. The sole question here is, which of the two liens take priority when the recovery is insufficient to pay both liens in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">Appellant contends that since the payment of the attorney\u2019s fee has reduced the amount recovered to less than its $27,836.92 subrogation lien, it in effect is being required to pay part of the fee of an attorney it did not employ. The Federal Courts have long recognized the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">\u201cThat under certain circumstances attorneys, who are officers of the court, will be protected by the court in the collection of their fees is not to be doubted. This is ordinarily done on the theory that attorneys have a lien upon any fund in the hands of the court or being administered by the court or that has been brought into the court by their efforts, for the value of the services rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Wessinger v. Sturkie, 4 Cir.1935, 77 F.2d 751. See also Sprague v. Ticonic Nat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1938); and United States v. Jacobs, (D.C. Maryland 1960) 187 F.Supp. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In the order directing the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees, the District Court considered all factors involved and concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c * * * Upon consideration of such petition, the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s chief counsel and testimony adduced with respect to the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fee claimed, the Court finds that a reasonable fee for the services performed by the plaintiff is 40% of the amount of the recovery or the sum of $12,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Title 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 933 allows the employer to sue the third party tort feasor if the injured employee fails to do so within the prescribed period. Section 933(e) prescribes the method and priorities of the distribution of any recovery made by the employer to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c(1) The employer shall retain an amount equal to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(A) the expenses incurred by him in respect to such proceedings or compromise (including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the deputy commissioner);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(B) the cost of all benefits actually furnished by him to the employee under section 907 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(C) all amounts paid as compensation ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(D) the present value of all amounts thereafter payable as compensation, such present value to be computed in accordance with a schedule prepared by the Secretary, and the present value of the cost of all benefits thereafter to be furnished under section '907 of this title, to be estimated by the deputy commissioner, and the \u2022amounts so computed and estimated to be retained by the employer as \u2022a trust fund to pay such compensation and the cost of such benefits as they become due, and to pay any sum finally remaining in excess thereof to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">(2) The employer shall pay any excess to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative, less one-fifth of such excess which shall belong to the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">The act makes no provision for the method and priorities of distribution where the employee brings the suit. This court in Voris v. Gulf-Tide Stevedores, 5 Cir. 1954, 211 F.2d 549, was faced with the difficulties presented by this void in the statute. There, the employee was drowned on the job and his children were awarded $16.62 per week under the Longshoreman\u2019s Act, the payments to terminate upon their eighteenth birthdays. An action against a third party was instituted on behalf of the minor children and a judgment in the amount of $13,500.00 was recovered. The District Court, in the third party action, awarded to the children\u2019s attorneys, fees of $3,900.00; to the employer $1,742.58 for compensation already paid; and the balance of $7,857.42 was directed to \u201cbe recovered by the minor libellants * * * \u201d The District Court then held that it was the total or gross recovery of $13,500.00 that should be credited to the employer against the future payments. On appeal, this court reversed stating the decisive question to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">\u201c* * * whether \u2018the amount recovered\u2019 referred to in Section 933 (f) means the amount actually received by the compensation beneficiaries in the third party action (that is less attorneys\u2019 fees) or whether it means the total amount paid by the third party defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">In answering the \u201cdecisive question\u201d, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-19\">\u201c * * * To hold that the minors recovered the aggregate amount paid by the defendant would be to disregard the realities of the situation, and to ignore the age-old equitable principle that one who accomplishes the creation of a fund for the benefit of another is entitled to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>bursement therefrom for the reasonable costs thereby incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzM\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auz-dedup-0\"><em>u </em>\u00bb \u00ab j. mi i \u2022 x \u201c * * * The issue here is as to , , \u201e , , <em>j, </em>,, who shall bear the burden of the , <em>n </em>, . .,, necessary cost of that recovery with , , ,, ., \u00ab \u00ab respect to the item of attorneys fees. , The insurance carrier was the sole , ,, . \u00bb . . beneficiary of the legal services ren- , t <em>j, </em>,, ,, ,, . , dered for the plaintiff m the third , ,. , ., , , party action, and it does not appear f, , , that it was in any way prejudiced , ,. . , , .i. by the judgment; on the contrary, it was greatly benefited by it.

BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AsY\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"ALx\">rpQ a literal void in the stat-ut6j the Court\u2019s solution produces inequitable, if not shocking, results. None of these consequences could have been intended by a Court speaking, as does this one&gt; in the high and noble terms of equitable principles linked with a liberal application of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act in favor of the injured maritime worker as the some-time ward of the Admiralty, jn g0 deciding, the Court rejects contrary holdings of at least two other Circuits an(j applies our prior Voris decision to a situation not even remotely contemplated by that case. Moreover, this meth-0(j 0f distribution might encourage questionable professional practices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This last comes about from the fact that it is the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, not the injured' harbor worker, who is the sole beneficiary of the rule now announced. Congress, in my judgment, could have intended no such result. Consequently, the decision in terms of statutory construction of \u00a7\u25a0 933(f) is not sustainable. And apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>from statutory construction it has no support in equitable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"A6M\">Decisions of Other Courts</p>\n<p id=\"AUrr\">Although it is true that neither of them precisely involve situations in which recovery from the third party was insufficient to (a) reimburse the employer for compensation payments paid or payable, (b) pay to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel his agreed percentage attorney\u2019s fees, and (c) leave a substantial amount for the injured plaintiff, this circumstance can hardly serve as a basis for distinguishing and then rejecting Fontana v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., S.D.N.Y., 1952, 106 F.Supp. 461, 1952 A.M.C. 1535, affirmed 2 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 151, 1953 A.M.C. 1258, cert. denied, 346 U.S. 886, 74 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed. 390, and Davis v. United States Lines Company, 3 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 262, 1958 A.M.C. 633. Each of these cases expressly prescribes this formula for distribution of a recovery in the worker\u2019s suit for damages<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in contrast to the one here announced:</p>\n<p id=\"A9P\">Fontana-Davis</p>\n<p id=\"A4z\">(1) Total recovery</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">(2) Less:</p>\n<p id=\"AnU\">Employer\u2019s Compensation payments \u2022 \u2014 -</p>\n<p id=\"AzL\">(3) Net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"ALT\">(4) Less:</p>\n<p id=\"Avg\">Atty\u2019s. fees &amp; expenses based on % of (3) -</p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">(5) Balance to worker</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">Melvin</p>\n<p id=\"A93\">(The instant case)</p>\n<p id=\"AZn\">(1) Total recovery</p>\n<p id=\"AnR\">(2) Less:</p>\n<p id=\"AKba\">Atty\u2019s. fees on</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">% of (1) -</p>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">(3) Net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"Az-\">(4) Less:</p>\n<p id=\"AhF\">Employer\u2019s Compensation payments -</p>\n<p id=\"ANa\">(5) Balance to worker <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aag\">No case under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act up to the present decision ever allowed the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to get his fee out of the employer\u2019s prior portion of the recovery. As illustrated later on, the decision is a bonanza. It is a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose gamble: if there is any\u2014 I repeat <em>any </em>\u2014 recovery from the third party vessel owner, the lawyer is guaranteed a first claim to the full extent of his contingent percentage fee (plus expenses), and this even though the injured worker gets nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Our Voris Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Voris decision is binding and there is neither request nor occasion for reconsidering it. Application of some of its broad statements to the instant situation demonstrates, however, that the result, and such expressions, should be confined to the problem there presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In Voris the question was not <em>distribution </em>of third party recoveries. The problem was the amount of the additional compensation benefits to be awarded to the injured worker by the Deputy Commissioner under \u00a7 933(f). As the statutory scheme works, an injured worker has a guaranty that he will get as a <em>minimum </em>the amount of compensation benefits due under the Act. The statute gives him, however, an added and frequently valuable, benefit. He can sue a third party, knowing that he runs no real risk because, no matter how the suit against the third party comes out,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the worker\u2019s benefits will be not less than those prescribed by the Act. Over and above the amount of the recovery from the third party, the employer remains, liable for full compensation benefits. The-problem in Voris was, therefore, not the-one of determining whether, and if so,, to what extent and from what sources,, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer was to be compensated. The question was <em>what </em>amount, the minor beneficiaries had in fact received upon which to predicate the statutory guaranty of minimum benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under no possible reading of Voris was. the employer required to pay to plaintiff\u2019s counsel an attorney\u2019s fees on its-, own recovery ($1742.58) representing compensation theretofore paid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">The Voris case stands in substance for the proposition that where the employer seeks <em>credit </em>against further and added compensation benefits then due and owing only the net recovery from the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>party may be deducted. In effect the employer bears all, not just a pro rata part, of the attorney\u2019s fees. This is essential to effectuate the statutory purpose of giving the injured worker his minimum benefits. But here there is no question of added, further, future benefits due Melvin, the injured worker. Indeed, there is no problem between the employer and the injured employee under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. The employer has paid all due by him and the employee has received all he is entitled to. The dispute is between the employer claiming its statutory priority for reimbursement, on the one hand, and the plaintiff s lawyer, on the other. But not until today has the injured worker s lawyer been regarded as one within the protection of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEz\">_ , , mpac on e njure or er</p>\n<p id=\"a4b-dedup-0\">If the rule now announced incidentally benefited the plaintiff\u2019s counsel by benefiting the injured worker, there might be some justification for the implied supposition that judicial construction of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act compels this result, The fact is, however, that the rule announced works against the injured worker and subordinates his interests to those of the lawyer with a contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">This is graphically illustrated by the inescapable arithmetical fact that with the employer\u2019s prior compensation payments in this case totaling $27,836.92, in order for the injured worker to get a red cent the recovery would have to approach nearly $48,000.00.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is in sharp contrast to his recovery were the FontanaDavis rule applied. Application of the MeMn rule means that the difference to the injured worker \u2014 in whose behalf the plaintiff\u2019s counsel has been employed and whose interests presumably are close to his professional heart \u2014 stands to lose, while his counsel stands to gain, over $11,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These are not fanciful figures adroitly contrived to present an extreme example.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Perhaps even more spectacular is the fact that for the injured worker\u2019s recovery under the Melvin rule to even begin to equal that of his counsel under a 60/40% contract, the jury ver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>diet in this instance would have to be in the neighborhood of $140,000.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It is a strange rule, if not shocking in its professional implication, which in this case requires that the recovery from the third party come close to $50,000 before the injured worker even benefits at all, and must approach $140,000 before judicial balm for his \u201cpain and suffering\u201d equals that of his lawyer. But even this is not right. For the bargain was not 50/50. It was 60/40%.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Irreconcilable Hostility Between Vicarious Attorney and Client</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I suppose we could overlook allowance of extraordinary compensation to a lawyer despite the fact that the legal services conferred no benefit or even were a detriment to his only client, if somewhere in this vague picture one could find that the lawyer did perform valuable services for someone, whether his client or not. But it is going too far too fast to suppose that while the employer may recoup part or all of his compensation payments out of the recovery, the suit was in any sense instituted in his behalf, or for his benefit or, for that matter, he wanted it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In this sometime weird Ryan-Yaka world,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there is only one thing certain: no stevedore in his right mind wants, or encourages, a suit by an injured employee against a third party vessel or vessel owner. The visionary dream of recouping compensation payments almost always evaporates. For the filing of the third party suit precipitates a three-cornered Kilkenny Fair in which all lash out against the other,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in the end it is so often the case of the injured worker winning, and the impleaded-stevedore-employer losing as a result of an injury that some thought was exclusively covered under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The obligations imposed on the stevedore-employer under the Ryan doctrine are ominous and ever-expanding. For present purposes these may be quickly capsulated. In nearly every situation the question whether the stevedore has breached its warranty of workmanlike service is a fact issue exposing the stevedore to the peril of an adverse judge or jury finding. Negligent use by the stevedore of seaworthy equipment creating an unseaworthy condition may be a breach. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Failure to observe or take steps to correct known unseaworthy conditions may impose a liability for indemnity. If workmanlike performance by the stevedore would have prevented the injury, the vessel owner\u2019s right of indemnity is not necessarily precluded even though the vessel was unseaworthy. Uncertainties, both legal and factual, remain concerning circumstances permitting or precluding indemnity. These include, for example, whether it is necessary for the stevedore to cease work pending correction of defective conditions by the vessel owner, the existence or scope of any implied warranty of seaworthiness for gear furnished by the stevedore to the vessel, and the like.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Any realistic appraisal of the currently developing law under the Ryan doctrine demonstrates that the worker\u2019s counsel could not possibly be representing the stevedore-employer. Indeed, nearly everything required of counsel in the conscientious representation of the worker\u2019s interest was against, not for, the stevedore-employer. In many ways, no good could come to the stevedore from the worker\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-25\">First, by filing the lawsuit against the vessel, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel precipitated an impleader action for indemnity against the stevedore which was actually filed. The best the stevedore-employer could hope for was a complete victory, that is, a denial of the shipowner\u2019s im-pleader. But such a victory would not be cheap. Obviously in such impleader suit, the stevedore could not turn its defense over to the worker\u2019s counsel since the facts to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s recovery against the vessel owner would very likely give rise to an automatic right of indemnity by shipowner against stevedore.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, even the eventuality of an outright denial of the ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>owner\u2019s indemnity claim, would mean large expenditures by the stevedore for its own counsel\u2019s fees in defense of the impleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Second, if the injured worker recovered damages and the stevedore was held to have breached its warranty of workmanlike performance, the stevedore would have to indemnify the vessel owner for the full amount of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment notwithstanding the exclusive liability provision of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. \u00a7 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Third, after paying the total judgment for the worker\u2019s damages, the stevedore would also be liable under the indemnity for the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred by the vessel owner in defending the worker\u2019s suit. At that point the stevedore will thus have paid (a) its own counsel\u2019s fees and (b) those of the defendant-vessel owner. But it does not end there, for it is possible for the vessel owner to defeat the claim of the worker and still recover from the stevedore the legal expenses and fees incurred by the shipowner in the defense of the main suit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Thus the best the stevedore can come out for is its own attorney\u2019s fees, with a strong likelihood that it will have to pay those of the defendant shipowner, and may well end up paying those of the injured worker\u2019s counsel as well.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>rule producing that remarkable result is surely open to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Despite the fact that the institution of the worker\u2019s suit against the steamship company locked him and his stevedore-employer in positions of irreconcilable conflict, the Court on some undisclosed notions of equity requires the stevedore to pay these lawyers for the privilege of being exposed at their hands to substantial liabilities which became greater, not less, as these lawyers did their job well. Again, we are not talking about theoretical, extreme, Socratie examples. On the argument counsel candidly stated that during the trial of the case a settlement for $80,000 was rejected. Considering the extent and nature of the injuries sustained, no criticism could, or is, directed at them for this strategic-tactical judgment. But if these lawyers are entitled to eompensation for a supposed benefit conferred upon one who never employed them, I would think they would have a serious professional responsibility to consider the interest of such hoped-to-be-client. Consideration of the stevedore\u2019s interest for even a slight moment would have demonstrated that the settlement had to be accepted. But to ignore this positive demand out of like consideration for the interests of their real client Melvin put them in a position of irreconcilable conflict requiring them to withdraw for one or both of their \u201cclients,\u201d actual or vicarious. The result is that because of the activities of a lawyer whom they never hired, who instituted a suit they never wished, the failure of that lawyer to accept the settlement tendered cost the stevedore not less than $10,000<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u201c and might have run as high as $30,000' to $40,000.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Insupportable by Statute or Equity</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">As I analyze it, the working of the Court\u2019s rule benefits the worker\u2019s lawyer only, works against the interest of the injured plaintiff, and subjects the stevedore-employer to the obligation of paying substantial fees to a person not hired by it to institute unwanted litigation having awesome and expensive perils which are necessarily ignored by the vicarious counsel as they faithfully discharge their duties to their real \u2014 and only \u2014 client.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Nothing in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act remotely requires that.

In none of my remarks do I mean to criticize the professional conduct of the distinguished members of the Bar of this Court who are plaintiff\u2019s counsel. It is plain that I do not think the fee allowed is legally supported, but since three out of the four Judges passing on it conclude otherwise, it is certainly not professionally improper for them to accept it.
