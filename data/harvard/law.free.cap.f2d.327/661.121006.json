The original record was filed with the Clerk of this Court on January 14, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Appellant filed a motion in this Court on January 28, 1964, that the Clerk of the District Court be required to issue to appellant photostatic copies of all the papers sent to this Court or that he be transported under guard to Toledo, Ohio, for the purpose of copying \u201ccertain necessary papers.\u201d The motion states that the District Clerk has denied appellant\u2019s request to supply him \u201cwith copies of the necessary records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The statutory right to proceed in forma pauperis, Section 1915(a), Title 28 United States Code, does not include the right to obtain copies of court orders without payment therefor. Hullom v. Kent, 262 F.2d 862, C.A. 6th, and cases cited therein. Section 753(f), Title 28 United States Code, deals with a copy of the transcript of evidence at Government expense, not with a copy of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">The motion does not specify what are-the so-called \u201cnecessary papers\u201d or why-appellant needs such copies. He necessarily knows what he alleged in his complaint, even if he did not retain a copy.. No evidence was heard in the District. Court. The District Judge wrote an, opinion in sustaining appellees\u2019 motion, to dismiss, a copy of which no doubt was-mailed to appellant at the time of the, ruling. See: Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550,1 L.Ed.2d 593; Miller v. United States, 317 U.S. 192, 198, 63 S.Ct. 187, 87 L.Ed. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">In the absence of a more specific-statement of what papers he seeks copies, of, and a showing of the need for such, copies, the motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
