The portion of the judgment awarding damages for the appellee\u2019s own personal injuries is not questioned. The only basis of the appeal is that the appel-lee failed to prove that the collision on May 26, 1959 was the proximate cause of her husband's subsequent gangrene and leg amputation and of his death that followed on September 25, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-24\">The question raised involves a pure fact issue. While the matter was sharply contested by appellants, there was evidence, direct and circumstantial, expert and non-expert, to support the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and his judgment entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-25\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
