We think this holding is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"aly-dedup-1\">The State of Louisiana has a statutory interest rate of 5%, which is in derogation of deciding this 6% exaction interest also. Moreover, the 6% is not due if the insurance contract is settled within 60 days. The federal statute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sets the minimum in removals at $10,-000.00, exclusive of interest and costs. We hold that this exaction is intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>be in the nature of a coercive penalty towards prompt settlement. The statutory amount here sued for is, therefore, sufficient. The appellant\u2019s complaint states, according to LSA-R.S. 22:656, that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2I\">\u00ab* * * defendant has refused and/or neglected to pay petitioner <em>under </em>said policy [for more than 60 days], and said refusal on the part of the defendant is arbitrary, capricious, unwarranted and without probable cause and therefore the Petitioner is entitled to an award of penalties as provided for in the Insurance Code of the State of Louisiana \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqB\">^ ^ ,, . , , The Supreme Court and this Court has uniformly, m resolving such questions, looked to the amount the plaintiff m good faith demands and, here, it ex- . .... ... .. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A3Zz\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AO2\">. \u201c\u00a7 656 Payment of claims; life policies; penalty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOE\">\u201cAll death claims arising under policies of insurance issued or delivered within this state shall be settled by the insurer within sixty days from the date of receipt of due proof of death and should the insurer fail to do so without just cause, then the amount due shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from date of receipt of due proof of death by the insurer until paid.\u201d Amended and reenacted Acts 1958, No. 125.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AgMq\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
