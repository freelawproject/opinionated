Boughner. Compliance with the summons was pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a). The District Court, by its order dated December 16, 1963, directed Boughner to comply with the summons. Boughner appealed from that order to-this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-23\">Section 7604(a) gives the District. Court jurisdiction \u201cby appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony * * <em>*\u00bb </em>e\u00a3c_ Section 7604(b) is a section which gives the District Court power to conduct a hearing and punish for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-24\">We have heretofore held that orders, to comply with a summons issued by the-Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(b) were not final appeal-able orders. Jarecki v. Whetstone, 7 Cir., 192 F.2d 121;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Application of Davis, 7 Cir., 303 F.2d 601. However, it is apparent from the discussions in those opinions that we distinguished orders under \u00a7 7604(b) from those under \u00a7 7604(a). This distinction was also-pointed out by the Ninth Circuit in a. discussion of our Jarecki and Davis de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>cisions. D. I. Operating Co. v. United states, 9 Cir., 321 F.2d 586, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">On January 20,1964, the United States Supreme Court decided Reisman v. Cap-lin, 375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508,11 L.Ed.2d 459. The Court there held that orders under \u00a7 7604(b) are appealable. There can be no doubt but that orders under \u00a7 7604(a) are likewise appealable. We so hold. The motion to dismiss the appeal will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3615(e) of the 1939 Code was involved.
