On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the penalty was valid and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Challenging the statutory foun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>dation for the imposition of the penalty, plaintiff has brought this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. For the period in question, Rosenberg was a principal officer of Ross-Reines Manhattan Furs, Inc., a retail dealer in furs. On May 4, 1951, plaintiff, the corporation, and its other principal officer were indicted for willfully attempting to defeat and evade the excise taxes imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 1650 and 2401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Admitting that false and fraudulent returns had been filed, the three defendants pleader! guilty to the indictment, and plaintiff was fined $5,000, and placed on two years probation. In May of 1957, after the corporation had failed to pay an assessment of the excise taxes due, Rosenberg was assessed with a 100% civil penalty in the amount of $110,065.81, pursuant to \u00a7 2707(a) of the 1939 Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of this amount, Rosenberg paid $200, filed a claim for a refund, and instituted this action to recover the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">At the outset, plaintiff contends that the penalty provisions of \u00a7 2707(a) have no application to the excise tax imposed on the sale of furs. In essence, Rosenberg argues that \u00a7 2707 was intended to apply only to those taxes which are required to be \u201cset out as a separate item on the invoice and collected as tax.\u201d Since the levy on furs is not required to be separately stated or collected as such, plaintiff insists that it is not subject to the penalty provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We can find no support, either in the wording of the statute or in its legisla-five history, for the plaintiff\u2019s argument in this regard. While \u00a7 2707(a) does speak of the willful failure to \u201ctruthfully account for and pay over\u201d the tax imposed, perhaps suggesting application to taxes collected as such, it also penalizes \u201cany person who willfully fails to pay * * * the tax * * * or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax * * * \u201d And this latter phrase hardly seems restricted to taxes directly and specifically collected as taxes from the consumer. Further, the statutory pattern seems clearly to subject the taxes <em>imposed </em>upon the retail sale of furs, whether or not collected, to the penalties of \u00a7 2707(a). Thus \u00a7 2401 of the 1939 Code imposed the excise tax on furs. Under the terms of \u00a7 2408, \u201call provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of the taxes imposed by section 2700 shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with this Act, be applicable in respect of the taxes imposed by this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 2707, under which the present penalty was Invoked, is one of the provisions \u201capplicable in respect of the taxes imposed by section 2700.\u201d By virtue of the cross-reference technique long common to the excise tax statutes, the sanctions of \u00a7 2707 are thus rendered applicable to those who \u201cwillfully attempt * * * to evade\u201d the taxes imposed by \u00a7 2401. Since Rosenberg has offered absolutely no evidence of legislative history or administrative construction which might dictate a contrary result, the clear language of the statute must prevail, and his unduly restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 2707 must be rejected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Appellant\u2019s more substantial contention is based on the concluding sentence of \u00a7 2707(a), which provides that \u201c[n]o penalty shall be assessed under this subsection for any offense for which a penalty may be assessed under authority of section 3612.\u201d Under this latter section, a 50% penalty is imposed for the filing of false and fraudulent returns. Insisting that the acts in question constitute an \u201coffense for which a penalty may be assessed under authority of section 3612,\u201d Rosenberg argues that the 100% penalty imposed under \u00a7 2707(a) was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Although this argument is not without force, we conclude it must be rejected since we believe it rests on an improper reading of the word \u201coffense.\u201d Unlike the penalty of \u00a7 2707(a), \u00a7 3612 is directed only at the taxpayer itself, and in the present case could only be invoked against the defaulting corporation; thus, \u00a7 3612(d) specifically provides that the 50% penalty is to be <em>added </em>to the tax due. Since the tax was \u201cdue\u201d from the corporation and not from Rosenberg personally, he is not directly punishable by \u00a7 3612. Section 2707, on the other hand, which penalizes \u201c[a]ny person who willfully * * * attempts in any manner to evade or defeat\u201d the excise tax, is not subject to a similar limitation. Thus, \u201cany person\u201d is explicitly defined to include \u201can officer or employee of a corporation * . * * who as such officer * * is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.\u201d Int.Rev.Code of 1939, \u00a7 2707(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">While conceding that <em>he </em>was not subject to the \u00a7 3612 penalty, Rosenberg maintains that the final sentence of \u00a7 2707(a) excludes any \u201coffense\u201d punishable by the former section. Since the \u201coffense\u201d of filing fraudulent returns might be punished by the imposition of the 50% penalty against the corporation, appellant seems to contend that he may not be assessed with the penalty of \u00a7 2707(a), even though he could not be held personally liable for the \u00a7 3612 addition to tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">While this \u25a0 argument does show considerable ingenuity, it must be rejected. In the first place, Rosenberg\u2019s interpretation reads the expanded definition of \u201cany person\u201d in \u00a7 2707 out of the statute in cases of fraudulent returns. Indeed if plaintiff\u2019s contentions were accepted, the corporate officer who deliberately files a false return would be punishable neither by \u00a7 2707 nor by \u00a7 3612. In view of the expressed intention that such officers be held personally responsible, such a result seems unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Secondly, it does not comport with the apparent purpose of the exemption to read \u201coffense\u201d without relation to the offender. Accordingly, we would construe the final sentence of \u00a7 2707(a) as designed not to absolve corporate officers of responsibility but rather to avoid the imposition of double civil penalties on the same offender for the samfe offense; it should therefore be read to exempt only the offender who is liable under \u00a7 3612 and not the agent whose fraud renders his principal subject to \u00a7 3612 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Finally, Rosenberg claims that the penalty assessment is barred by the four-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 3312(a) of the 1939 Code. While recognizing that \u00a7 3312(c) provides that assessments may be made \u201cat any time\u201d in cases of willful fraud, he argues that this unlimited period is superseded when<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ever an assessment is, in fact, made. More specifically, he contends that the fraud rule of limitations became inapplicable in the present case as soon as an assessment was made against the corporation, and that this assessment against the corporation started the limitations period running for any penalty assessment against corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In the present case, the date of the assessment against the corporation is in dispute. But even accepting Rosenberg\u2019s contention that the corporation was assessed more than four years before the present penalty was imposed, his argument cannot be dispositive here. For, contrary to appellant\u2019s apparent assumption, the penalty of \u00a7 2707, when invoked against corporate officers, is entirely distinct from the earlier assessment against the corporation. As an utterly separate statutory liability, it need not be assessed within any particular period after the corporate assessment is made. See Bloom v. United States, 272 F.2d 215, 221 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The judgment is affirmed, and the complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">. Unlike the procedure required in the case of income taxes, a suit for refund of excise taxes may be commenced after only a portion of the tax has been paid. See Christie v. United States, 179 F.Supp. 709 (D.Ore.1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">. \u201cAny person who willfully fails to pay, collect, or truthfully account for and pay over the tax imposed by section 2700(a), or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty of the amount of the tax evaded, or not paid, collected, or accounted for and paid over, to be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes are assessed and collected. No penalty shall' be assessed under this subsection for any offense for which a penalty may be assessed under authority of section 3612.\u201d Int. Rev.Code of 1939, \u00a7 2707(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-16\">. Rosenberg\u2019s argument would carry more weight with respect to \u00a7 6672, the successor section to \u00a7 2707(a) in the 1954 Code. Thus, \u00a7 6672 is limited in application to \u201c[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over\u2019\u201d' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the tax imposed. Both the House and Senate' Committee Reports on \u00a7 6672 emphasize that the change was not merely one of wording. Thus, after noting that \u00a7 6672 is \u201csimilar to certain sections of existing law\u201d, the Reports go on to point out the significant distinction: <em>\u201cHowever, </em>the application of [\u00a7 6672] is limited only to the collected or withheld taxes which are imposed on some person other than the person who is required to collect, account for and pay over, the tax.\u201d 1954 U.S.Code Cong, and Ad.News pp. 4568, 5245 (emphasis supplied). The use of the word \u201chowever,\u201d to set \u00a7 6672 in contradistinction to the prior law, indeed, strongly suggests that \u00a7 2707(a) was not intended to carry the limitation urged by the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
