Finding no error in the decision of the district court, we affirm that court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">The facts are essentially undisputed. Dangovich was employed as an oiler aboard Isthmian\u2019s vessel S.S. Steel Seafarer. On November 24, 1960, while the vessel was moored in Khorramshahr, Iran, Dangovich desired to go ashore to a seamen\u2019s club. Never having been in Khorramshahr previously, he sought advice from his colleagues as to the quickest route to the town. One crew member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>advised him to take a railroad trestle quite near the-boat. Although the actions of the third mate, an officer of the vessel, are left somewhat unclear by the testimony, at most the third mate concurred in this advice and indicated the bridge, stating \u201cThere it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">At about 5:30 P.M. Dangovich went ashore, traversing the railroad trestle. After several hours in Khorramshahr and the neighboring town of Abadan, he returned via a taxi, which left him a short distance from the trestle. After proceeding some 35 feet along the catwalk which led to the trestle, Dangovich stepped on some pebbles and fell off the catwalk into a ravine below. The trial judge found that the catwalk was narrow and unguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The appellant predicates his claim on the proposition that an officer of the vessel, the third mate, in the course of his employment instructed the appellant negligently as' to a means of egress from the ship and that in consequence the negligence of the mate is attributable to the owners of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether the acts of the third mate are attributable to the defendant, for we can find no support for the appellant\u2019s charge of negligent conduct on the part of the third mate. Viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant, the testimony established merely that the mate advised the appellant as to the quickest route to Khorramshahr. No evidence was adduced to indicate that the mate knew or had reason to know of the condition of the trestle. Dangovich was apparently aware that at least one other road led away from the dock, although he did not know the 'destination to which it led. Moreover, the condition of the trestle was readily apparent to all who chose to use it. In any event there was no evidence that the trestle was dangerous for ordinary use.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
