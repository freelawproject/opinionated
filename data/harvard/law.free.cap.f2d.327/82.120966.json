In the course of his work, while at sea, he sustained a serious injury to his right hand, which ultimately resulted in the amputation of a portion of his middle finger. He brought a libel against the Master and the ship for the alleged failure to furnish him proper treatment. There was ample evidence to sustain the District Court\u2019s finding of liability and the award of $4,000.00 in his favor. We find no ground for disturbing the court\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
