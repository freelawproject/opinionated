Concurrent sentences of imprisonment were imposed by Judge Timbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">There was abundant evidence to support the verdict of the jury with respect to each of the defendants, his part in causing the transportation of the women from Connecticut to New York, and his knowledge of the purpose in such transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">There was no error in receiving the evidence of the conversation which one of the women had over the telephone with \u201cHarry\u201d after calling a number which she was asked to call by the defendant Morgan. United States v. Johnston, 318 F.2d 288, 291, 292 (6 Cir. 1963). There was sufficient credible circumstantial evidence that \u201cHarry\u201d with whom the woman talked was the defendant Harry Stein, and from all the circumstances in the case the jury could so have found. We find the other alleged errors to be without substance. The defendants had a fair trial at which there was overwhelming proof of their guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
