The district court held that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for two reasons: 1) There was no substantial evidence of any negligence on the part of the defendant which was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury; 2) the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">Two sets of the defendant\u2019s railroad tracks run in a north and south direction down the center of Tarragona Street in the City of Pensacola, Florida. As Mrs. Shirey, a 65-year-old woman, was walking in a westerly direction on the north side of Government Street, she approached its intersection with Tarragona Street. Mrs. Shirey had on previous occasions walked across this intersection, but there is no other evidence that she was familiar with the details of construction of the railroad tracks at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">Mrs. Shirey and an old man named Church reached the intersection at about the same time. An automobile also going west on Government Street was attempting to make a right turn to go north on Tarragona, but the motor had stalled. After stopping, Mrs. Shirey and Mr. Church stepped down off the sidewalk and Mrs. Shirey made about three steps, when the car started and \u201cjust whipped right around\u201d into their path \u201cat a fast speed.\u201d Mr. Church stepped back to get out of the way of the car, and Mrs. Shirey hurried on \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>keep from getting hit.\u201d The car passed behind her \u2014 \u201cit just did miss me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Mrs. Shirey fell with her left knee striking one of the railroad tracks, she could not tell which.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Describing her fall, Mrs. Shirey testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cQ. Which foot was it that caught or slipped or went wrong first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cA. My left foot, seemed to slip in a hole, or something went wrong, and then I caught the right foot under something or another and when I come to know anything, I was \u2014 the leg, I couldn\u2019t get up. I tried and had to go back to the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cQ. Now, do you know when it was that your left foot slipped or tripped on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\u201cA. I could not tell you. It was fouled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">\u201cQ. It was what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">\u201cA. Fouled. I couldn\u2019t make the track but I tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">\u201cQ. I am sorry. I don\u2019t understand. You mean fouled \u2014 f-o-u-1e-d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">\u201cQ. It was caught on something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">\u201cA. Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t know what that something was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-17\">\u201cA. No, I couldn\u2019t have time to look. If I had I wouldn\u2019t have fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-19\">\u201cQ. And what happened to your right foot? Did you say that it caught on something, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-20\">\u201cA. When I picked it up over the track, I struck something with it and then I went down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">The shoes which Mrs. Shirey was wearing are forwarded as original exhibits. According to Mrs. Shirey\u2019s affidavit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-22\">\u201c * * * they were new and had been worn approximately two times and had no scuffs and mars on the toes, and that the scuff and mar appearing on the right hand shoe and to a lesser extent on the toe of the left were made by the catching of the said shoes upon her feet against the rails or cracks adjacent thereto of the defendant\u2019s track.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">The defendant introduced photographs of the intersection. Wooden timbers had been placed on each side of each rail. An affidavit of Mr. Coker, one of defendant\u2019s employees, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-25\">\u201cI was instructed to measure the area in particular in the vicinity of the easternmost rail of the westernmost track at said intersection since that is where Mrs. Lillie Mozell Shirey in her complaint filed against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company alleges that she tripped and fell. At the time of my measurements I found that the top of the easternmost rail of the westernmost track was one and one-half inches above each of the timbers placed beside the track. I also found that the distance between the west side of the timber on the east side of the rail and the east edge of the rail was two inches, and that the distance between the west side of the rail and the east side of the timber on the west side of the rail was from two and one-quarter to two and one-half inches wide. These measurements were made within a north-south distance of nine feet, five and one-half inches, which is the width of the pedestrian crosswalk at the intersection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">It is necessary that the timber on the inside of each rail be spaced at least two inches from the rail so that the flange of the wheels of trains can roll along the side of the rail. No necessity appears for the two inch distance between the rail and the timber on the outside of the rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The plaintiffs had demanded a trial by jury. The rule seems now fairly well established by decisions of the Supreme Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of this Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that in a diversity case, state law controls as to the substantive elements of plaintiff\u2019s case and of defendant\u2019s defense, but the sufliciency of the evidence to raise a question of fact for the jury is controlled by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">As to the substantial elements going to make up defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, there is no dispute but that defendant owed a duty to \u201cmaintain and keep in good condition highway crossings at all points where said line of railroad is crossed * * * by any public street.\u201d Sec. 357.01, Florida Statutes Annotated. The Florida Supreme Court has declared that, \u201cThe company was liable for an injury resulting from a negligent breach of this duty, if its breach in this respect was the proximate cause injury Loftin v. Dagley, 1943, 152 Fla. 831, 13 So.2d 311, 313.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"an0-dedup-0\">In Reuter v. Eastern Air Lines, 5 Cir. 1955, 226 F.2d 443, 445, 446, we restated the federal test as to the sufii-ciency of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a9r-dedup-0\">\u201cIn determining whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury, a federal judge performs a judicial function and is not a mere automaton. Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U.S. 90, 93, 50 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed. 720. He must determine, \u2018not whether there is literally no evidence, but whether there is any upon which a jury can properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it.\u2019 Improvement Co. v. Munson, 14 Wall. 442, 448; see Railway Express Agency v. Mallory, 5 Cir., 168 F.2d 426, 427. \u2018The requirement is for probative facts capable of supporting, with reason, the conclusion expressed in the verdiet.\u2019 Myers v. Reading Co., 331 U.S. 477, 485, 67 S.Ct. 1334, 1339, 91 L.Ed. 1615; see Thomas v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuR5\">We cannot agree that there was no genu\u00bfne jssue as to whether defendant breacbed its duty. A jury could reasonably find otherwise from all of the attendant facts and circumstances, including defendant&gt;s ra\u00fc extending U/2 inehes above tbe timbers and the unneces_ 24nch gap at the outer edge of the rail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1M\">Proof of causation presents a more' serious question. We cannot, however, hold that it would be unreasonable for a jury to find from the place of fall and all of the other circumstances, including the scuffs on Mrs. Shirey\u2019s shoes and the photographs of the intersection, that a preponderance of the evidence went to show that Mrs. Shirey\u2019s foot was caught in the unnecessary 2-inch gap or that she tripped on the rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>As to contributory negligence, the substantive rule has been stated in a late Florida case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cWhile we have held repeatedly that it is not contributory negligence to fail to look out for danger when there is no reason to apprehend any * * *, nevertheless a normal adult person is charged with the duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care for his own safety and to see that which would be obvious upon the ordinary use of his senses * * Chambers v. Southern Wholesale, Inc., Fla.1957, 92 So.2d 188, 190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"> Florida recognizes distractions as a valid excuse.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cThis court is committed to the proposition that contributory negligence is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury. It is true that by her own admissions appellee was familiar with the scale and with the locus of the accident. She asserts, however, that the case was one for jury consideration because of the \u2018distraction rule\u2019 whereunder, if her attention were diverted from the known danger by a sufficient cause, the question of contributory negligence is for the jury. With this contention we are inclined to agree. At the time appellee was distracted by her employer\u2019s call to her she, according to her testimony, immediately looked both at the traffic and the traffic light, which we consider to have been her duty in exercising ordinary care and caution for her own safety before attempting to cross the street.\u201d Deane v. Johnston, Fla. 1958, 104 So.2d 3, 9, 65 A.L.R.2d 957. See also, Panama City Transit Co. v. Du Vernoy, 1948, 159 Fla. 890, 33 So.2d 48, 50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Applying the federal rule as to sufficiency of the evidence, we think it clear that the issue of contributory negligence was for the jury. See cases collected in Annotation 64 A.L.R.2d at 1219-1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-16\">.

See Mayhew v. Pierce Tire Co., Fla.App., 120 So.2d 451; Pope v. Pinkerton-Hays Lumber Co., Fla.App., 120 So.2d 227; McWhorter v. Curby, Fla.App., 113 So.2d 566; Florida Power Corporation v. Willis, Fla.App., 112 So.2d 15; Williams v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 56 Fla. 735, 48 So. 209, 24 L.R.A.,N.S., 134, 131 Am.St.Rep. 169; Florida Cent. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Williams, 37 Fla. 406, 20 So. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">The testimony of Mrs. Shirey is enough to go to the jury on the questions of defendant negligence and plaintiff injury. I cannot join in saying that there is enough evidence to make a jury issue on the question of causation. Mrs. Shir-ey fell and as an incident of her fall she scuffed her shoes. But she could have scuffed her shoes as the result of a fall resulting from her sole negligence. So also could she have suffered the injuries which she sustained from a fall resulting from her sole negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">In support of its view that Mrs. Shir-ey\u2019s testimony was enough to go to the jury on the question of causation, the court cites, among other decisions, the opinion of this Court in Pogue v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, 5th Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 575. Of this decision of this Court, the Supreme Court of Florida has said that the Court, in the Pogue decision, interpreted the decisions of the Florida courts more broadly than the decisions justify. Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Trusell, Fla., 131 So.2d 730. The court has, I am convinced, in this case, continued to interpret the decisions of the Florida courts more broadly than is justified. .</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>It is <em>my </em>view that the evidence here is purely speculative on the issue of causation and inadequate to produce a jury question. Food F\u00e1ir Stores, Inc. v. Tru-sell, supra. I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
