He had been indicted for two alleged violations of this statute. Prior to the swearing of the first witness, defense counsel moved for a direction that the Government elect between the first count, mail theft, and the second count, possession of stolen mail. The trial court reserved decision on this motion until the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief when it dismissed the first count. The trial court\u2019s reservation of its decision was clearly within its discretion and did not constitute error. Cf. United States v. Ketchum, 320 F.2d 3 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 905, 84 S.Ct. 194, 11 L.Ed.2d 145 (1963). Moreover, since the second count was premised upon prior mail theft, it was not error, despite the dismissal of the first count, to receive evidence of theft to prove the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>count, a distinct indictable offense. Marshall v. United States, 299 F.2d 141 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 958, 82 S.Ct. 1606, 8 L.Ed.2d 824 (1962). Finally, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, cf. United States v. Kane, 322 F.2d 787 (2d Cir. 1963), it cannot be said that the evidence adduced at the trial did not support beyond a reasonable doubt the inference that appellant unlawfully possessed a package stolen from an authorized depository for mail matter, with knowledge that it was stolen, for which the judgment of conviction under the second count was duly entered. See United States v. Hines, 256 F.2d 561 (2d Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
