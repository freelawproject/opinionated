The use plaintiff, Olmos Building Materials Company, furnished materials used in the prosecution of the work. National Surety Corporation was surety on the bond of Madden Company, Inc., as principal, by the terms of which the principal and the surety bound themselves jointly and severally for the amount of the bond conditioned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AepV\">\u201cthat if the principal shall <em>promptly </em>make payment to all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract and any and all duly authorized modifications of said contract, then said obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuX\">Without question the bond was accepted and approved; Olmos furnished materials to Madden on open account, which materials were used in the prosecution of the work to be done pursuant to the contract; Madden unqualifiedly promised and agreed to pay Olmos the sums chai g-ed for the materials; and after the allow-anee of all just and lawful offsets, payments and credits, the sum of $2,295.24 was past-due and unpaid when plaintiff filed suit; and Madden had failed and refused to pay any part of said sum.</p>\n<p id=\"AIe\">The last delivery date of the building materials and products involved was made by Olmos to Madden on May 14, 1962, over 90 days prior to but less than one year before suit was filed. On September 13, 1962, Olmos filed a written proof of claim with National Surety in which clear notice of the default on the part of Madden was given. Olmos made demand for payment on Madden and on National Surety, which demand was ignored for more than 30 days after it was made. At the time the proof of claim, notice of default, and demand for payment were made, attorneys for Olmos made the following statement in the letter transmitting the same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjKt\">\u201c * * * However, if this claim is paid <em>promptly, </em>no suit will be filed -and, therefore, no attorneys\u2019 fees nor costs of Court will be added to the claim. By promptly, we mean at least within thirty days from ths (sic) date.\u201d (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am2o\">National Surety failed and refused to make payment, whereupon Olmos employed counsel, obligated itself for attorneys\u2019 fees and filed suit on October 25, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"AGV\">National Surety filed an answer on NoVember 15, 1962. On January 11, i9g3; National Surety tendered into the registry of the court the above mentioned gum ^ $2,295.24 plus interest and court costs, making a total payment of $2,355.-gg_ The tender was made shortly before pre-trial hearing. A pre-trial order was entered on January 29, 1963. The Clerk was directed to pay the sum tendered to olmog without prejudice to the right of olmos to prosecute its claim for reason-a^je attorneys\u2019 fees incurred, and to be incurred on appeal, and without prejudice of National Surety to contest its obligation to pay attorneys\u2019 fees. The principal, Madden Company, Inc., defaulted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The trial court found that Olmos has employed competent counsel to file suit and had agreed to pay reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for services to be rendered; that up to the time of the entry of judgment, counsel for Olmos had spent approximately 40 hours in the preparation \u25a0of prosecution of the claim; that the evidence showed that such services were valued at the rate of $25.00 per hour; and that approximately half of such time was devoted to the case up until November 15, 1962, when National Surety filed its answer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and half of such time was devoted subsequent to that date. The court concluded that Olmos was entitled to recover jointly and severally from Madden, as principal, and National Surety, as surety, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, including attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal if incurred; and the court fixed as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees the sum of $750.-00 \u201c * * * for attorneys\u2019 services up to and including entry of judgment.\u201d \u2022Jurisdiction was reserved to fix attorneys\u2019 fees to which Olmos \u201c * * * is entitled should this case be appealed until a reasonable time after all appellate action has terminated and the mandate \u2022of the appellate court filed herein.\u201d The record further discloses that the reasonableness of the fee awarded by the court is not questioned by National Surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On this appeal, National Surety contends that it is not liable for attorneys\u2019 fees because there is no Texas statute .specifically authorizing the same, and that the contract between the parties \u25a0does not authorize such fees. It is further contended that even if such fees are \u2022allowable, the trial court erred in allowing fees for services \u201c * * * up to and including entry of judgment\u201d; that no fee should be allowed for services rent* dered after it admitted liability and tendered principal and interest into the registry of the court; and further, that attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered on appeal are not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Olmos and National Surety are directly opposed in their contentions as to the proper interpretation of Article 2226, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.Stats.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the former claiming that the statute authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees and the latter claiming that it does not. Both parties cite numerous Texas decisions, each contending that the decisions are favorable to their diametrically opposed contentions. There seems to be little dispute as to the rule that the principal contractor, in this case Madden, is liable for attorneys\u2019 fees under the above mentioned statute. The dispute arises as to whether such fees are recoverable against the surety of the principal contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">No useful purpose would be served in undertaking to analyze every Texas case cited; or in drawing the fine distinctions which seem to be necessary in order to reconcile all of the opinions involved in the varied fact situations presented by the cases. It is sufficient to say that none of the cases cited is directly and exactly in point, and the fact situations presented by the Texas cases are not sufficiently similar in the essential and controlling factual details here under consideration to be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In addition to numerous other cases, National Surety relies heavily on Mundy v. Knutson Construction Co., 156 Tex. 211, 294 S.W.2d 371; and F &amp; C Engineering Co. v. Moore, 300 S.W.2d 323, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(Tex.Civ.App.1957) err. ref\u2019d, n. r. e. The Mundy case asserts the general principle that a surety is not liable for attorneys\u2019 fees, unless provided for by statute or by contract between the parties. It should be observed however that there was no express provision to pay attorneys\u2019 fees in the contract under eon-sideration in the Mundy case, but the performance bond contained an agreement to * * * repay all costs and expenses * * *\u201d incurred m the proseention of any suit maintained against the principal for breach of contract or or breach of the surety bond. The court interpreted the language to include attorneys fees and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKy\">\u201cSince the wording of our bond expressly provides for payment of \u2018all costs and expenses\u2019 incurred in the prosecution of a suit or suits on a breach of the construction contract, or on that very bond, we feel attorneys\u2019 fees so incurred was a proper measure of recovery by Knutson. An attorneys\u2019 fee for the prosecution\u201eof a suit is an \u2018expense\u2019 incurred-\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhD\">In Mundy the court further reviewed other cases which allowed attorneys\u2019 fees in suits against sureties where there was no direct, express agreement to pay attorneys\u2019 fees, but where there were provisions to pay all damages, costs, charges or expenses. In the F &amp; C Engineering case, the court held the general contractor liable for attorneys\u2019 fees because the general contractor made a direct, special , ,, , . , ,, , ., ,, promise to the materialman that it would \u00a3 ... . , , ..... be responsible for and guarantee \u2018 * payments for a 1 material delivered to the subcontractor. The court concluded that the promise was made to induce the delivery of the material, and that such delivery would not have been made without the promise. Article 2226, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.Stats. was held applicable and attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded against the general contractor. The court held the surety not to be liable and used only the following language with respect to the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agl-dedup-1\">\u201cThese attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable as against the surety. Its obligation to pay arose from the bond sued upon and is controlled by its provisions to pay for labor and materials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-2\">Unfortunately, the opinion does not quote the termg of the gurety bond; nor ig it entirely dear whether the guarantee made by the general contractor was taken into consideration at the time the surety bond therein mentioned was executed. It may wen foe said that F &amp; C Engineering gtandg for the proposition that where a general contractor makes a speeial con. tract agreeing that it would be responsible for and guarantee payment \u201c * * for all material delivered to the subeon-tractor,\u201d the general contractor, as guarantor or surety, is liable for attorneys\u2019 fees. There was no provision in the guaranty contract relating to the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">The latest Texas case which has come to our attention and the one nearest in points, is Ferrier Bros., et al. v. Brown, et al., 362 S.W.2d 181, (1962 Eastland Ct.Civ.App.) err. ref\u2019d, n. r. e. In Ferrer reliance was placed upon our case Umted States for Use and Benefit of Caldwell Foundry &amp; Machinery Co. v. Texas Construction Co., 5 Cir. 1955, 237 F.2d 705\u2019 wherein our court held in a Miller case\u2019.that attorneys\u2019 fees are recoverable against the surety, and that questl0n ,1S Reined by state law. The opinion m Ferrier also relies upon , , . ,. , the McGregor Act, Texas Statute, Article 5160, par. A, effective January 1, 1960, whieh wag taken frQm the Mmer Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYc\">Finally, it should be noted that in Mundy the court concluded that attorneys\u2019 fees were recoverable as a part of costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution of a suit on a breach of the construction contract, \u201c * * * or on that very bond * * *referring to the surety bond. In the instant case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>surety undertook to assure \u201cprompt payment\u201d to persons supplying labor and material. When the chronology <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of events is considered together with the other circumstances of this case, it is clear that the prime contractor defaulted in making \u201cprompt payment\u201d, and further that the surety also defaulted and breached the condition of the bond when it failed to make \u201cprompt payment\u201d, necessitating the employment of counsel and the institution of legal proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was correct in its conclusion that the surety is liable, under the peculiar facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"> We come now to a consideration of the contention of National Surety that even if attorneys\u2019 fees were allowable, the court committed error in allowing fees for services rendered subsequent to the date when liability was admitted and funds were \u201c * * * unconditionally tendered * * * \u201d into the registry of the court; and for concluding that Olmos is entitled to such fees for services rendered on the appeal of this case. As a matter of fact, at the late date when the tender was made, it was agreed by the parties and ordered by the court that such tender was made without prejudice to either party to contest the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees; and as heretofore stated, the record shows that the reasonableness of the fee awarded by the trial court is not questioned. The evidence is without dispute that the attorneys spent approximately 40 hours and that the rate of $25.00 per hour was a reasonable charge for such services. After considering all factors involved, the court allowed a fee of $'750.00. Considering all of the circumstances involved, including the time of tender, the services rendered, the fee allowed, and the period over which the services were rendered, together with all other factors in the case, we find no merit in the contentions of National Surety. Only 18 days elapsed from the time the tender was made until the date of the pre-trial order, and the order directing the payment of the funds to Ol-mos without prejudice. Final judgment was entered approximately 3 weeks later. We find the order of the court fixing the fee reasonable, proper and without error. In view of the reservation of the question as to attorneys\u2019 fees when the tender was made, and the fact that most of the services were rendered prior to the date of tender, we further conclude that it was entirely proper for the court to make the provision as to attorneys\u2019 fees for services on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">What constitutes a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for services rendered upon appeal in this court .should be determined by the District Court. The judgment is affirmed and the cause remanded for the purpose of allowing the District Court to fix such attorneys\u2019 fees for services on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGZ\">.

The parties are in agreement that under the Texas laws attorneys\u2019 fees may not be recovered in a suit of this character, unless provided for by statute or agreed to by the parties in their contract. The only cases in which the Texas courts have permitted a recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees are cases in which the court has construed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>surety contract itself embodied such an agreement, e. g. Mundy v. Knutson Construction Company, 156 Tex. 211, 294 S.W.2d 371. The court in that case permitted a recovery against a surety because the bond itself provided that the surety was to \u201crepay all costs and expenses * * * [Knutson] may incur in the prosecution of any suit or suits, which they [it] may maintain against said principal on account of any breaches of said contract, or of this bond * It is difficult for me to see how a suit on a bond having such language as that would be authority for a decision of the court in the case before us. The language in the bond we are to construe was identical with that in F &amp; C Engineering Co. v. Moore, Tex.Civ.App., 300 S.W.2d 323, in which the Court of Civil Appeals (San Antonio Division) found that attorneys\u2019 fees could be recovered against the principal but held that no recovery could be had against the surety since there was no provision in the bond to do more than pay promptly for materials furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It is difficult for me to see what reliance can be placed on the case of Fer-rier Bros. v. Brown, Tex.Civ.App., 362 S.W.2d 181, to support the majority opinion. Having held in the Ferrier Bros, case that there was no doubt but that a recovery could be had against the principal, the court then said \u201cAny doubt as to appellees\u2019 right to also recover attorneys\u2019 fees from Ferrier Brothers\u2019 surety is dispelled by the decision of United States for Use and Benefit of Caldwell Foundry &amp; Machine Company v. Texas Construction Company, 5 Cir., 237 F.2d 705 * * * \u201d The opinion then quotes from an opinion of this court which raised the question on its own motion, and then as stated, \u201cknock [ed] it down with the observation that, in suits under the Miller Act, the recovery of interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees is governed by the state law.\u201d Our opinion then cited an Alaska District Court case and an Arkansas District Court case for the proposition that allowance for attorneys\u2019 fees was proper. No Texas decision was cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u2022I think that in light of the clear Texas jurisprudence, as disclosed by Mundy and F &amp; C Engineering, supra, this Court is required to determine that the judgment should be reversed and the trial court directed to enter an order denying the right to recover on a bond worded like the one here in contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Rehearing denied; TUTTLE, Chief Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
