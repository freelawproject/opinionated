The error so claimed was duly preserved for review by the Court. After verdict of guilty and sentence, the District Court denied appellant leave to appeal <em>in forma pau-peris. </em>We granted such leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-25\">The following facts appear in the record of this case. \u2014 After apprehension on warrant of arrest and before arraignment on the charges made against appellant, the United States District Attorney, on June 15,1962, filed in the District Court a \u201cmotion for judicial determination of defendant\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) mental competency.\u201d In that motion it was alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-26\">\u201cMovant has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant * * * may be presently insane, or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, which belief is based upon the records of proceedings had in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Texas, Houston, Texas, on or about May 12, 1955, in the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>United States of America versus Cecil Marvin Hurt, copies of which are attached and made a part hereof, from which it appears that this defendant <em>has a history of mental incompetency; was adjudicated incompetent </em>(in the above Court); and there has been to Movant\u2019s knowledge, <em>no subsequent determination </em>or adjudication of his competency.\u201d (Emp. &amp; par. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-3\">After hearing on that motion, appellant\u2019s trial court made a specific finding that he \u201cmay be presently so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense,\u201d and committed appellant to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, at Springfield, Missouri, as provided in Section 4244, Title 18 U.S.C.A., for a \u201cperiod of ninety (90) days\u201d to be examined as to his then mental condition and for report thereon to be made to the court in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Appellant was accordingly committed to that federal institution. In due course, a report in writing, dated September 12, 1962, of neuropsychiatric examinations made of appellant was lodged with the District Court, manifesting the \u25a0opinion of the Psychiatric Staff of the Medical Center, that appellant \u201ccould be said to be able to understand the nature \u25a0of the charges\u201d pending against him and \u201cto rationally assist counsel in his defense\u201d as of that date; and it was requested by the Warden of the Medical Center \u201cthat such report be admitted into evidence at the hearing in lieu of actual testimony by our examiners.\u201d No hearing as to appellant\u2019s competency to \u25a0stand trial was ever held by the District \u25a0Court after his return thereto and before he was arraigned and put to trial \u2022on the three-count indictment returned against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The issue of appellant\u2019s mental ineom-petency at the time of commission of the \u2022offense with which he was charged was raised during his trial, as follows: * * Appellant did not testify as a witness. However, prior to resting his defense appellant\u2019s counsel offered in evidence as an exhibit an authenticated copy of the adjudication by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, supra, to raise a \u201cpresumption of mental incompetency once established\u201d and \u201covercome the presumption of sanity\u201d and \u201cshift the burden of proof on the Government to prove\u201d that appellant was mentally competent to commit the offense with which he was charged. By that previous adjudication it appeared that as of June 8,1955, appellant\u2019s mental incompetency had been judicially determined to be \u201cpermanent in nature\u201d; that he was \u201cof unsound mind, * * * unable to distinguish right from wrong, and unable properly to assist in his own defense to the charges (then) pending against him (in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas) or intelligently to cooperate with his counsel\u201d; and that \u201csmall hope was entertained for a complete restoration to sanity * After that exhibit was offered in evidence the District Court heard arguments of counsel <em>in camera. </em>Thereafter, it sustained the Government\u2019s objection to the admission in evidence of such previous adjudication, by ruling it was inadmissible and insufficient to raise any issue of appellant\u2019s mental incompetency at the time of the commission of the offense for which he was then on trial. In so doing, appellant\u2019s trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-8\">\u201c * * * in order that there may be no misunderstanding * * *, I now hold that based upon the findings of the psychiatrist at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners filed with this Court on September 13th, 1962, I find * * * him (appellant) competent to stand trial, be able to properly assist in his own defense ; <em>and I find further that at the time of the alleged commission of these offenses, that the Defendant </em>(appellant) Cecil Marvin Hurt, <em>was competent.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">Hence, appellant\u2019s counsel was foreclosed, from raising before the jury the issue of appellant\u2019s mental incompetency to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>\u25a0commit the offense for which he was then \u2022on trial, and the Government did not \u25a0undertake to adduce any evidence at appellant\u2019s trial as to his mental competency to commit the offense of which he was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The manifest error in that situation is established by Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895), where it is ruled that whenever evidence appears in the trial of a criminal case, from whatever source, tending to establish insanity or mental ineompetency of the accused to commit the offense charged, the burden of proof is on the Government to prove sanity, or mental competency to commit the offense, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d as well as \u201cthe existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.\u201d (160 U.S., 1. c. 493, 16 S.Ct. at page 360, 40 L.Ed. 499.) See also, Davis v. United States, 165 U.S. 373, 377-378, 17 S.Ct. 360, 41 L.Ed. 750 (1897). It is the invariable rule in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">\u201call federal courts, (that) an accused \u2018is entitled to an acquittal of the \u25a0specific crime charged if upon all the evidence there is reasonable \u25a0doubt whether he was capable in law of committing crime.\u2019 (citing cases) Consequently, the trial judge or jury must reach a judgment or verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity even if the evidence as to mental responsibility at the time the offense was committed raises no more than a reasonable doubt of sanity.\u201d Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 713, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 1068-1069, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">See also, Dusky v. United States, 295 F.2d 743, 754 (8 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">That a prior adjudication of mental incompetency gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of continued incompetency is established by Ashley v. Pescor, 147 F.2d 318 (8 Cir. 1945); Byrd v. Pescor, 163 F.2d 775 (8 Cir. 1947); Gunther v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 215 F.2d 493 (1954) ; Kitchens v. United States, 272 F.2d 757 (10 Cir. 1959) ; In Re Judge\u2019s Petition (D.C.S.D.Cal.) 148 F.Supp. 80 (1956); and Robinson v. Johnston (D.C.S.D.Cal.) 50 F.Supp. 774 (1943). Because such an adjudication was not considered to be of that legal effect in Frame v. Hudspeth (10 Cir. 1939), 109 F.2d 356, reversal by memorandum followed, Frame v. Hudspeth, 309 U.S. 632, 60 S.Ct. 712, 84 L.Ed. 989 (1940). See also, Panico v. United States, 375 U.S. 29, 84 S.Ct. 19, 11 L.Ed. 2d 1 (1963). Such rebuttable presumption is a rule of evidence which has the effect of overcoming the legal presumption of sanity and mental capacity to commit the crime charged. Dusky v. United States, supra. Cf. United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751 (3 Cir. 1961); Kitchens v. United States, supra; Fitts v. United States, 284 F.2d 108 (10 Cir. 1960) . Introduction of evidence of insanity, though disbelieved by a trial judge, places the burden on the Government of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Beltran v. United States, 302 F.2d 48 (1st Cir. 1962). Only slight evidence of insanity at the time of commission of an offense is required to raise that issue for submission to the jury. Howard v. United States, 232 F.2d 274 (5 Cir. 1956); Clark v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 259 F.2d 184 (1958). That such is an issue for the jury and not for the court to decide is affirmed in McIntosh v. United States, 176 F.2d 514 (8 Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">A determination of mental competency to stand trial is <em>sui generis. </em>It is not the same legal issue as competency to commit a criminal offense, occurring two years and three months prior to a trial. Winn v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 270 F.2d 326 (D.C. Cir. 1959); Swisher v. United States, 326 F.2d 97 (8 Cir. 1964). The District Court\u2019s determination of the issue of appellant\u2019s mental competency to commit the offense for which he was then on trial constituted plain error. A finding by a trial judge that a defendant is mentally competent to stand trial \u201cshall in no way prejudice the accused in a plea of insanity as a defense to the crime charged,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>is the mandate of \u00a7 4244, Title 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Lyle Huseby, Esquire, of the North Dakota bar, was appointed by this Court to represent appellant in this appeal. We take special note of his acceptance of such appointment and our indebtedness to him for his representation of appellant in aid of our review of this indigent party\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
