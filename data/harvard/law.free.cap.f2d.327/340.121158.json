He petitioned for naturalization under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1489.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-25\">A naturalization examiner, acting under the authority of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1443 and 1446, and, thereafter the district court, acting pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421 and 1447, both concluded that the petition should be denied because the petitioner had not been lawfully admitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>United States for permanent residence as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">This court has jurisdiction on this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The issue here is: Must a petitioner under \u00a7 1439 have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence for his petition to be granted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We believe and hold that he must. The decision below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The applicable case law supports such a determination. In Tak Shan Fong v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 102, 104, 79 S.Ct. 637, 639, 3 L.Ed.2d 662, the Supreme Court expressly stated that \u00a7 1439 \u201cprovides no exemption from the requirement that they have been \u2018lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.\u2019 \u201d This was only dictum, as the Court was there giving examples \u25a0of the varying degrees of liberality with which Congress has treated different .groups of alien servicemen. Yet, this .-statement is entitled to some weight. In Aure v. United States, 9 Cir. 1955, 225 F.2d 88-89, this court also made such a \u25a0categorical statement, agreeing with the district judge who had so held. Although the court of appeals ultimately found for the petitioner on a different issue not raised below, this statement is entitled to weight. In In re Naturalization of Fernandez, N.D.Cal. 1961, 196 F.Supp. 107, 108, Judge Oliver J. Carter 'held that a petitioner under \u00a7 1439 must satisfy that requirement of \u00a7 1429. In United States v. Rosner, 1 Cir. 1957, 249 F.2d 49, 51, the court categorically made the same statement, although the statement played only a minor role in its decision, which was basically on another issue. In United States v. Aronovici, 7 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 559, 561, the court, in deciding the same issue raised in Rosner, quoted at length from Rosner with approval, including the categorical statement that \u00a7 1429 was applicable to and limited \u00a7 1439. In In re Jocson, D. Hawaii 1954, 117 F.Supp. 528, Judge Wiig as well as the parties apparently assumed that \u00a7 1429 applied to \u00a7 1439, although the case was decided on a different issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Finally, the regulations enacted pursuant to the Act make the same assumption. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 328.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">In face of this authority, appellant advances several arguments. One is that a phrase in \u00a7 1439 (\u201cand without having been physically present in the United States for any specified period\u201d) exempts \u00a7 1439 from the requirement of \u00a7 1429. Literally read, this could be true, for if one never need be physically present in the country, he need never have been lawfully admitted. However, in the light of past legislation, this interpretation urged by appellant does not appear to be necessary. The residence requirements from which petitioners under \u00a7 1439 are exempted are those listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the 1952 legislation the physical presence requirement was added to the predecessor of \u00a7 1427(a), and at the same time, the exemption from physical presence requirements was added to the predecessor of \u00a7 1439.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No reference was made to the requirements of what is now \u00a7 1429. Thus it seems that the phrase in \u00a7 1439 concerning exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>from physical presence requirements refers only to the requirement in \u00a7 1427 and not to that in \u00a7 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Secondly, appellant contends that the third sentence of \u00a7 1429 indicates that the lawful admission requirement of \u00a7 1429 does not apply to \u00a7 1439. That sentence reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) of this Act, and <em>except as provided in sections US8 and HS9 of this title </em>no person shall be naturalized against whom there is outstanding a final finding of deport-ability * * * and no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard by a naturalization court if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Appellant contends that since neither \u00a7 1438 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor \u00a7 1439 contain any provisions concerning deportation proceedings, the except clause here must indicate that \u00a7 1439 is not limited by the lawful admission requirement of \u00a7 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">With this we cannot agree. Section 1438 (b) expressly requires that the petitioner must have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. That is entirely inconsistent with the argument urged by appellant. In addition, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause should probably be read as meaning only that proceedings pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1438 and 1439 should not be delayed by any deportation proceedings. Such is the interpretation given the except clause in Application of Chin King, S.D.N.Y. 1954, 124 F.Supp. 911, 912, and in In re Petition for Naturalization of Yow Leslie Chung, E.D.N.Y. 1961, 199 F.Supp. 566, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Thirdly, appellant argues that since the predecessor of \u00a7 1439 was interpreted such as to not require what is now required by \u00a7 1429,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and since the 1952 legislation did not make any significant changes between \u00a7 1439 and its predecessor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 1439 should be interpreted so as to not require what is generally required \u2018by \u00a7 1429. This argument carries, weight. However, in the Internal Security Act of 1950, the predecessor of what is now \u00a7 1429 was enacted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From then-on the provisions of what is now \u00a7 1429' apparently applied to the predecessor of what is now \u00a7 1439. Thus, the fact that no significant changes in what is now \u00a7 1439 were made in the 1952 legislation does not help appellant here, for the lawful admission requirement of \u00a7 1429 had already been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">Fourthly, appellant cites a footnote inYuen Jung v. Barber, 9 Cir. 1950, 184 F.2d 491, 497, n. 12, in support of his-position that the lawful admission requirement of \u00a7 1429 does not apply to \u00a7 1439. That footnote, however, was-concerned with what is now \u00a7 <em>1440,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>not. what is now \u00a7 1439. Moreover, that case-was decided under the law in effect prior to the enactment of the Internal Security-Act of 1950. Although the opinion was; filed twelve days after the Act was approved by two-thirds of both Houses of' Congress, over the President\u2019s veto, there-is no indication in the opinion that the-court was aware of \u00a7 27 of that Act.. Also, when we consider that the case was-before this court on appeal, we doubt, whether the Act would have been relevant, to that case, because its effective date-was subsequent to the hearing. Based-, on any of these three positions, we think the citation to the Yuen case is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\">.
