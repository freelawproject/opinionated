In view of the painstaking and comprehensive report of the examiner, the Board\u2019s careful brief, and the largely unwarranted contentions of the respondents, we see no purpose in detailing either the evidence or the objections. In one matter we might agree with respondents, viz., that in the absence of any affirmative evidence of observation of union activities an inference should not have been drawn that an admittedly secret organizational campaign came to management\u2019s attention simply by reason of the small size of the plant. However, we agree with the concurring member that the express statements of the company officials well justified an inference of knowledge. In such circumstances proof of the source is immaterial. This remedies the only instance in which it could be said that the trial examiner failed to place the proper burden on the Board, or to make proper findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
