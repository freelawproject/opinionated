We think the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-24\">The facts are as follows: Malan Construction Corporation was granted the general contract, RB-28, in 1960 for improvement work at O\u2019Hare International Airport by the City of Chicago. Malan subcontracted a portion of the work to Cupples Products Company on September 16, 1960, and another portion to plaintiff on October 25, 1960. Cupples subcontracted a portion of its work to plaintiff on December 15, 1960. It was while plaintiff was working on the Cupples subcontract, on March 10, 1961, that equipment \u201ccollapsed\u201d injuring several workmen. Plaintiff\u2019s demand for benefits under its policies with defendants was denied. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Defendant issued \u201cMaster\u201d policies to Malan, insuring the operations of Malan and its \u201csubcontractors and their subcontractors as hereinafter <em>designated.\u201d </em>(Our emphasis.) When Malan let a subcontract it would notify the Ostheimer Agency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who would then write the subcontractor for information to file an application with defendant for coverage of the subcontract. Upon acceptance by defendant the subcontract was included under the \u201cMaster\u201d policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\">After Malan \u201cdesignated\u201d plaintiff as its subcontractor, Ostheimer wrote plaintiff for necessary application information, including plaintiff\u2019s starting date. On November 22, 1960, plaintiff responded that the \u201capproximate date * * * is March 15, 1961.\u201d There was no further correspondence between plaintiff and Ostheimer until March 1, 1961, when Ostheimer wrote that it had \u201cbound coverage\u201d with defendant covering plaintiff \u201cunder Contract RB-28 with Malan Construction Corp.\u201d and the \u201cpolicies should be forthcoming.\u201d The policies sought to be reformed issued April 19, 1961, effective March 15, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The district court gave an excellent oral statement of the facts and found<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that circumstances surrounding the exchange of correspondence precluded reading Ostheimer\u2019s March 1 letter as binding defendant to coverage of plaintiff\u2019s sub-subcontract with Cupples, and that defendant was bound only to coverage of plaintiff\u2019s subcontract with Malan. Having no \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d we cannot say the district court finding was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Footlik v. United States, 323 F.2d 635, 636 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In its November 22, 1960 letter to Ostheimer plaintiff gave the necessary information for inclusion under the \u201cMaster\u201d policies, listing the insurance it already carried, and then informed Ostheimer of its \u201cadditional contract * * as subcontractor to Cupples\u201d and asked for a \u201cquotation\u201d for its required insurance \u201cover and above our coverage listed * * It assumed that \u201cunder the terms of the contract, Malan would be probably paying<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for any \u2018Master\u2019 policies unless, of course, we give you the insurance for this increased coverage.\u201d This letter indicated to the district court that plaintiff \u201cwas not sure\u201d it wanted the coverage of work under the Cupples sub-subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Malan was requested, but refused, to <em>designate </em>plaintiff as a subcontractor of Cupples so as to bring the sub-subcontract under the \u201cMaster\u201d policies. We cannot see how an Ostheimer letter of February 17, 1961 to Cupples, stating \u201ccoverage is binding for any subcontractor on this project from the date he actually begins his work,\u201d changes the situation. This contemplates <em>designation </em>of the subcontractor. The district court need not from all this have distilled an intention of defendants to insure plaintiff\u2019s work under the Cupples sub-subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">Plaintiff was required to prove as a basis of reformation that it came to an understanding with defendant for insurance of the Cupples sub-subcontract, but that in reducing it to writing the instrument as written did not conform to' the contract agreed upon. Harley v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 378 Ill. 19, 37 N.E.2d 760, 765, 137 A.L.R. 900 (1941). Since the court found no agreement, that work under the Cupples sub-subcontract be covered, it did not err in concluding plaintiff\u2019s suit should fail. Mahon v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 36 Ill.App.2d 368, 184 N.E.2d 718 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Finally we are not convinced that plaintiff has shown by clear and convinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ing evidence, Cravens v. Hubble, 375 Ill. 51, 30 N.E.2d 622 (1940), that defendant fraudulently drafted its policies so as to exclude from its coverage the accident of March 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Since we agree with the district judge that the work under the Cupples sub-subcontract was not included in the coverage of the policies issued April 19, 1961, there is no need to determine whether the court\u2019s finding that the policy was not effective March 1 was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We cannot find that the district court\u2019s conclusion, that \u201cthe evidence * * * does not justify\u201d a finding of estoppel, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> Plaintiff did not secure insurance \u201cover and above\u201d the insurance it already carried to cover its work on the Cupples sub-subcontract, but that failure has not been shown to be caused by detrimental reliance on defendant\u2019s conduct. Furthermore, a party cannot claim estoppel where he knows or has the means of knowing that the other party\u2019s actions or omissions might be to its detriment. Lowenberg v. Booth, 330 Ill. 548, 162 N.E. 191, 194-195 (1928). Here plaintiff, through its subcontract with Malan and its sub-subcontract with Cupples, had full knowledge of the insurance requirements, knew that it would have to be \u201cdesignated\u201d before being included under the \u201cMaster\u201d policies, and knew that it did nothing to secure coverage of its work on the Cupples sub-subcontract after its letter of November 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">When Cupples questioned the necessity of obtaining coverage under the \u201cMaster\u201d policies Ostheimer wrote its letter of February 17, 1961, in which it told Cupples its coverage was in effect \u201csince the day you commenced operation.\u201d Then it added: \u201cIn fact, coverage is binding for any subcontractor on this project from the date he actually begins his work.\u201d This letter to Cupples is of no avail to plaintiff in the absence of a showing that it knew of the letter and relied upon it to its detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Plaintiff argues in effect that defendant is estopped from extending coverage to plaintiff in view of the following facts: The city\u2019s contract with Malan, pursuant to city ordinance, in article 21, forbade Malan or any subcontractor <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from starting work on the O\u2019Hare project \u201cuntil he has obtained and paid for insurance required by\u201d Malan; the subcontracts required each subcontractor to carry insurance up to a certain limit; and defendant knew of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">We see no merit in this contention, because if it were sustained the result would be in conflict with the facts of the case: defendant would be required to* provide coverage for all contractors, whether or not they had adequate outside insurance, when, in fact, if they already carried sufficient insurance, as Cupples did, they were not obliged to participate in the package program; and Malan would be obligated to guarantee plaintiff\u2019s premium payments to defendant, when in fact it had refused to do so with respect to plaintiff\u2019s sub-subcontract with Cupples.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">United Pacific Ins. Co. v. Meyer, 305 F.2d 107 (9th Cir. 1962), relied on by plaintiff does not support the contention. There the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the insurance company \u201c \u2018bound and committed itself and warranted that it had provided * * * insurance\u2019 which would protect subcontractors.\u201d 305 F.2d at 109. The general contractor\u2019s performance bond, obtained pursuant to his obligation to insure himself and his subcontractors, covered \u201call operations\u201d under the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>contractor\u2019s contract with the State of Idaho. In the case before us the district court found that \u201cneither the defendant nor Ostheimer warranted * * * that they would insure the risks under the sub-subcontract.\u201d Only the subcontractors \u201cdesignated\u201d were covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In Jeske v. General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., 1 Wis.2d 70, 83 N.W.2d 167 (1957), the court found the insurance company was estopped from denying liability, but only after it had found that the policies should be reformed. The case is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">For the reasons given the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">.
