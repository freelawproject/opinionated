The negligence caused plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccerebral concussion, contusion to the soft parts of the neck, and post concussion shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">Three years before the occurrence plaintiff was hospitalized and treated six months for a \u201cpsycho neurotic reaction, depressive reaction.\u201d She was discharged, \u201cTreatment completed, not mentally ill.\u201d After her discharge from the hospital she worked steadily to support, herself and her children. She was given increased responsibilities by her employers and periodic pay raises, and during this period of employment she sought medical attention only on two occasions, once for a minor ear infection, and once for a wrenched ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">The injuries inflicted by the government were a substantial factor in arousing plaintiff\u2019s dormant \u201cpsycho neurotic * * * depressive reaction.\u201d She suffered pain for more than two years and wore a neck brace for more than six months. She was hospitalized three times following the accident and was unable to return to work for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">There is no evidence that plaintiff received \u201cgratification\u201d from the pain and suffering.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The finding to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>effect is clearly erroneous. The evidence was that she was \u201cripe\u201d for the reaction she experienced as a result of these injuries; that the injuries \u201cfed\u201d her problems and were the \u201cprecipitating cause\u201d for the way she handled her anxieties \u201cthrough summitization or putting the anxiety \u2014 attaching it to organ systems or the neuromuscular system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We take this evidence to mean that the superimposition of physical injuries upon her psychic problem increased her anxieties to such an extent that she could no longer keep them under control, and as a result she underwent a more extreme reaction than would normally follow. Her marked hypochondriasis or inclination to. refer anxieties to physical sources does not warrant the inference that she received \u201cenjoyment\u201d or \u201cgratification\u201d from the pain caused by her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The effect of the finding that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cgratification\u201d should be balanced against the pain and suffering to provide only nominal damages is to apply a rule that where one inflicts an actionable injury and arouses the victim\u2019s dormant mental illness, as a result of which the victim\u2019s real pain and suffering somehow feeds the victim\u2019s psychic problem, a balance should be struck between the real pain and suffering and the \u201cgratification\u201d to the victim\u2019s psyche to arrive at a net quantity of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u25a0 We think the secondary effect of plaintiff\u2019s injuries did not lessen the obligation of the court to allow, and the government to pay, reasonable damages for plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering. Ill. Jury Pattern Instructions 30.03, Watkins v. Town of Cicero, 312 Ill.App. 380, 37 N. E.2d 785 (1941). The secondary effect did not diminish the damage to plaintiff. If that effect is plaintiff\u2019s \u201csummitization\u201d of the pain and suffering it is of no concern to the tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\"> The government argues in support of the court\u2019s ruling that there are some elements of pain, real enough to the victim, which are the natural and probable consequences, of defendant\u2019s negligence, but which are nevertheless not compensable in law because of the plaintiff\u2019s peculiar psychological makeup. On the contrary, the tort-feasor takes the victim as he finds him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Until the sciences of law, psychiatry and psychology co-develop to a stage at which there is a fuller understanding of human pain and suffering,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we think it unwise to formulate a rule of damages which reduces the compensation for an injured plaintiff to a \u201cnet,\u201d after crediting the tort-feasor with a secondary effect of the injury due plaintiff\u2019s psychic weakness, aroused by the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The court allowed $3,536.20 for medical expenses, $7,685.00 for lost earnings, and the disputed $100.00 for pain and suffering, which is admittedly an element of damages. We hold the $100.00 was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">In this non-jury case we consider the unchallenged findings of the district court sufficient to enable us to order an increased allowance for plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering. Wajdak v. United States, 170 F.2d 908 (5th Cir. 1948), Lukmanis v. United States, 208 F.2d 260 (2d Cir. 1953), 6 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b659.05 at 3755 (2d ed. 1953), 14 Cyclopedia of Fed.Proc. \u00a7 68.09 at 388 (1952). See also 5 Am.Jur.2d, Appeal and Error, \u00a7 946 (1962). The Court found that plaintiff received \u201cmedical attention from * * * doctors, including specialists, on the occasion of three extended periods of hospitalization and a rehabilitation course aimed at both a cure of her physical ails and her mental problem.\u201d She was \u201cwholly and totally\u201d unable to return to her employment for about two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>during which she suffered pain. We think a fair allowance for pain and suffering would increase this judgment from $11,321.20 to $18,500.00. See Goertz v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 19 Ill.App.2d 261, 153 N.E.2d 486 (1958) (concurring opinion).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"apg-dedup-0\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with direction to enter judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $18,500.00.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-15\">. $100 was awarded for pain and suffering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-16\">.

There is a consequent need for scientific illumination of all facets of these vexatious problems to insure just compensation for the claimant while at the same time protecting the defendant against extortionate verdicts.\u201d Smith, Problems of Proof in Psychic Injury Oases, 14 Syracuse L.Rev. 586, 592 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"atr-dedup-1\">.
