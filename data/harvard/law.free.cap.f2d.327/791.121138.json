Apart, from certain rulings which, if erroneous,, were in defendant\u2019s favor, only two matters possibly warrant mention. The first: is defendant\u2019s contention that as a citizen returning from abroad he could not,, in the absence of reasonable grounds-for suspicion, be searched by customs-inspectors at the airport after he had passed through immigration, although, coneededly, he could have been if the order of procedure were reversed and the-customs enclosure had been located so&gt; as to be encountered before immigration. No authority can be found for such an arbitrary requirement. Passengers are subject to several examinations-before being permitted to enter the country and no reason has been suggested' why, assuming all are accomplished with-reasonable promptness, they must be-done in any particular order. This is not a case where defendant had received unconditional consent to enter the country. There is nothing to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\"> Secondly, the defendant objects: to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the* jury that the phrase \u201cunless the defendant explains the possession [of the narcotic] to the satisfaction of the jury\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> encompasses any reason the jury might find satisfactory even though it had nothing to do with a fulfilment of the requirements of the narcotics laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The-statute has no such meaning. Yee Hem v. United States, 1925, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904; United States v. Moe Liss, 2 Cir., 1939, 105 F.2d 144; United States v. Feinberg, 7 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 425, cert. den. 315 U.S. 801, 62 S.Ct. 626, 86 L.Ed. 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-19\">Judgment will be entered affirming; the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\">. The full portion of the statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-16\">\u201cWhenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-21\">. The defendant contended that the fact that he had lawfully acquired the narcotic abroad might be felt by the jury to be a satisfactory reason for in.troducing.it into-this country.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
