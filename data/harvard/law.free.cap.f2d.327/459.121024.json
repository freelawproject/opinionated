The theory of Lessig\u2019s ease was that during this period Tidewater violated the antitrust laws (1) by fixing the prices at which its dealers resold gasoline, and (2) by imposing upon its dealers a system of exclusive dealing and tying arrangemenTs\u201cm''tEe_ purcTiiise of petroleum \"products, batteries,, and those automotive accessories _which were sold or sponsored by Tidewater, and that Lessig was injured thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\n<em>Resale Price Maintenance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Akxc\">A. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amv\">Lessig offered evidence of the following circumstances in support of his allegation that Tidewater conspired, or created a combination, to control the price at which its dealers resold gasoline.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Tidewater required its dealers to purchase their estimated total requirements of gasoline from Tidewater at prices \u201cposted by seller at the time and place of delivery.\u201d \u2019 It steadily increased the wholesale or tank-wagon price charged dealers during the relevant period, though the retail price dropped on several occasions. When the retail price went down, Tidewater extended \u201cdealer-aid\u201d in the form of a rebate from the tank-wagon price. When retail prices went up, the rebate was diminished or withdrawn. Payment of \u201cdealer-aid\u201d was conditioned upon adherence by the dealer to resale prices stipulated by Tidewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-20\">By maintaining, or increasing, the wholesale price when the retail price declined, Tidewater brought pressure upon dealers to accept \u201cdealer-aid\u201d and the accompanying condition requiring resale price maintenance. In addition, Tidewater\u2019s representatives checked the prices at which dealers sold their gasoline, told dealers the price changes they were to make, changed prices posted on their pumps, placed price signs on the station premises reflecting the new price, and threatened to terminate and terminated dealers\u2019 leases and contracts if dealers\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] did not comply with suggested price <em>changes. </em>Lessig was given notice ofj termination of his lease and contract three days after he refused to reduce his resale -price when Tidewater\u2019s district sales manager told him it was two cents too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-21\">From this evidence the jury could conclude that Tidewater entered into agreements with its dealers fixing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>resale prices, thus contracting and conspiring in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or, alternatively, that Tidewater secured dealer adherence to resale prices by a coercive scheme not limited to refusals to deal announced in advance, thus creating a combination in violation of Section l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">B. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of damage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The evidence supporting Lessig\u2019s claim of injury prior to the termination of his lease and contract from Tidewater\u2019s resale price-fixing activities was not strong. However, the jury could readily infer that Tidewater terminated its business relationship with Lessig because he failed to adhere to the resale price-fixing scheme. Cancellation of Lessig\u2019s lease and dealer contract in such circumstances would be unlawful, though in exercise of a right expressly granted Tidewater by the lease and contract<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lessig could claim compensation for the resulting loss, including reasonably anticipated future profits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and there was evidence from which the jury could find that such loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">C. <em>Alleged error in instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARVd\">Tidewater makes the threshold contention that review of many of Lessig\u2019s numerous claims of error is barred by Lessig\u2019s failure properly to present his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>objections at trial. This may be true of some specifications, but that we need not decide. Lessig did properly present and preserve an objection to what we believe was reversible error in instructing the jury as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"> Lessig tendered to the court a proposed instruction concerning his right to recover reasonably anticipated future profits lost as a result of the cancellation of his lease and contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The instruction was not given, and Lessig made timely objection. The omission was error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The error was prejudicial since the jury was instructed in detail as to Lessig\u2019s right to recover profits lost during his occupancy of the station, and therefore might have concluded that he could recover only on this theory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such a misconception could have led to the verdict adverse to Lessig, for while Lessig\u2019s proof of causal connection between the alleged violation and the lease cancellation was substantial and direct, his proof of loss of profits from Tidewater\u2019s conduct during his occupancy of the station was, as we have said, relatively meager and tenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Reversal is thus required,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and we consider only those remaining assignments of error pertinent to a new trial and ignore Lessig\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other procedural obstacles which would ordinarily preclude review of some of the matters discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">Lessig argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that Tidewater\u2019s conduct relating to resale price maintenance violated the Sherman Act as a matter of law. The instruction was properly refused. Tidewater did not concede that \u201cdealer-aid\u201d was conditioned on dealer adherence to its stipulated resale prices. Its officials testified that \u201cdealer-aid\u201d was given whenever the prevailing retail price in a particular area fell below the level at which Tidewater\u2019s dealers could pay the posted wholesale price and retain.a fair margin of profit; and they insisted that each dealer, though receiving the rebate, was nonetheless free to meet the prevailing retail price or not as he saw fit. The jury was entitled to accept this explanation, and reject the contrary evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>We agree with Lessig, however, that the instructions given did not adequately inform the jury of the theory underlying the price-fixing aspect of his case. They did not clearly state in terms of the specific facts of the case:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (1) that Lessig need not prove an express agreement to maintain resale prices, but was entitled to prevail, assuming injury, if he established tacit agreements by circumstantial evidence; and (2) that Tidewater could not lawfully go beyond refusals to deal, announced in advance, to secure adherence to resale prices, .and Lessig was entitled to prevail, assuming injury, if he established that Tidewater exceeded this limitation in the respects indicated by Lessig\u2019s evidence, outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The instructions on this phase of the case were objectionable in another respect. Lessig testified in detail regarding a conversation with Tidewater\u2019s district sales manager immediately preceding receipt by Lessig of notice of the cancellation of his lease and contract. With apparent reference to this conversation, the court instructed the jury \u201cthat it was not unlawful for Tidewater to tell Mr. Lessig that his retail prices were so high that a loss df sales and customers was likely.\u201d T[iis was one of several instructions which isolated particular incidents from the total course of Tidewater\u2019s conduct and pronounced each lawful. These instructions were no doubt accurate, so far as they went. However, as the Supreme Court recently stated, \u201c[i]n cases such as this, plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each. \u2018 * * * [T]he character and effect of a conspiracy [or combination] are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole. * * * \u2019 \u201d; and \u201cacts which are in themselves legal lose that character when they become constituent elements of an unlawful scheme.\u201d Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide <em>&amp; </em>Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 707, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1410, 1415, 8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AILG\">We have said that it would be reversible error to instruct the jury that particular acts, alleged to be part of a conspiracy, were lawful, without adding the express qualification, \u201cin the absence of conspiracy\u201d (Fox West Coast Theatres Corp. v. Paradise Theatre Bldg. Corp., 264 F.2d 602, 606 (9th Cir. 1958)), and it is at least clear that an instruction that a component element of an allegedly illegal course of conduct is lawful should be accompanied by a substance of the admonitions which we have quoted from Continental Ore Co.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>D. <em>Alleged error in exclusion of evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">No substantial error occurred in the exclusion of evidence relating to resale price maintenance. Most of the excluded material was cumulative or only remotely relevant, and the discretion of the trial court in dealing with it was accordingly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>Exclusive Dealing and Tying Arrangements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Lessig offered evidence of the following circumstances in support of his algation that Tidewater imposed upon its dealers a system of exclusive dealing and . tying arrangements applicable to petroleum products, and to tires, batteries, and automotive accessories (TBA) whi ch Tidewater sold or sponsored.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a3u-dedup-0\">Tidewater\u2019s service station(ie\u00e1jig) were renewable annually, and were subject to cancellation _at six-month intervals on-thirty days\u2019 notice. Each dealer contract ended automatically upon terminar tion of.\"that dealer\u2019s lease. The dealer was required bv his contract to purch3.se from Tidewater \u201chis total requirements\" o\u2018f gasoline, motor oils and greases, regularly manufactured and sold by\u201d Tidewater, to an amount specified in the contract; and the amount specified in each dealer contract was the estimated full requirements of that dealer\u2019s station. When the servicestation lease and dealer contract were exec\u00fated Tidewater\u2019s representatives t.o|d the, dealer that he was to purchase iVom Tidewater his reqfprgrqents of petroleum products and TBA items which it sponsored or sold. Tidewater\u2019s representatives accompanied salesmen of sponsored merchandise while the latter secured orders from dealers. Tidewater\u2019s representatives inspected dealers\u2019 stations for competing merchandise, required that it be returned, and threatened nonrenewal of the offending dealer\u2019s lease. Credit card sales of non-sponsored merchandise were charged back to the dealer if the customer failed to pay. New dealers were required to purchase from outgoing dealers only inventory purchased from Tidewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">the / i^P The record disclosed the disproportionate' size and economic strength of parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There was evidence that Tidewater imposed exclusive dealing and ty-wishes* to provide Tidewater with noncompetitive acces\u2019s to the portion of the irtarket which the dealers\u2019 stations represented. Dealers testified that they feared to buy competing brands of oil ancH sponsored TBA items even when requested by customers and even though the cost to dealers v/as less, and that when they purchased competing merchandise they hid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Evidence was offered that Tidewater \u2014 &gt; entered into leases and dealer contracts. containing provisions similar to those described, with about 2,700 service station operators in eight western states. Some of the practices described admitted \u2014 ly were followed with respect to all Tidewater dealers, and the others appeared to be of quite general application. Thus, the jury could conclude that the restrictive provisions and practices affected a substantial portion of Tidewater\u2019s sales') to its dealers of about 310 million gallons ( of gasoline annually (about five per cent of the gasoline sPld through dealers in the area), and four to five million dollars worth of TBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">From this evidence the jury could conclude- that Tidewater sold petroleum; products and sponsored TBA to its deal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>i ers upon conditions and understandings <em>\\ </em>\u2014express and tacit, oral and written\u2014 that they not deal in commodities sold by [jgpmpetitors of Tidewater. The only ' serious question is whether the jury could falso conclude that these conditions and * ................. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 - - \u2014\u2022 understandings might lessen competition substantially or tend to create a monopoly in a line of commerce, as required by <em>[the </em>Clavton Act-</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We think Standard<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and Rich-field Oil<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> reauire^JiolALur that, the jury cquld so conclude from such relevant, factors, common to those cases and this, as <em>t ? </em>\u2014 - <em>\u2019 </em>the following: the limited number of [\"desirable station sites and the substanI tial investment required to acquire and | develop \"them ; the Iqjge number of stations to which eorhpetitive access was denied; thedarge volume of gasoline and SiA retailed by those stations, and the istantial share which these sales ren;ented of total sales of gasoline in the stern states; the fact that^the restricf=\u00bbtive condition was imposed not only upon \\ the sale of Tidewater\u2019s own petroleum | products,, but also upon the sale of TBA Bs produced and sold by others; the parked C (imparity in the bargaining power of the parties; and evidence that the restricy-tive condition was imposed for the very \\ purpose or eliminating competition for 1 dealer patronage.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">As Tidewater points out, the percentage of service stations in thlT market affected bv its conduct was not establishetrin the pT~Qs\u00b0nt as it was Sta^~ard. However, the percentage of sales of gasoline in the - area made through Tidewater stations was shown (about 5-per cent as .compared with. 6.7 per cent in Standard), and- yyouldr-seem to xeflectthe impact of the restrictive arrangements more accurately than would the percentage of retail outlets affected.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">Tidewater also points out that the record did not disclose total sales m themwestem states of any of th\u00e9 TEA items involved, and hence the share sold through its stations could not be deter-' mined. In^Standard such information! was available as to some TBA items. 1 However, knowledge .of the share of the\"'' market foreclosed is .not invariably required to determine whether exclusive\" dealing arrangements violate Section 3 of the Clayton Act. The test remains, /\u00abwhether the jury can find from all the ( circumstances that the effect of the par- \\ ticular arrangements \u201cmay be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create /a monopoly in any line of commerce11; 7and, as the Clayton Act tying clause cases ^demonstrate, thisjmav appear from facts other than the proportion of total commerce in the relevant market which is subject to restraint,.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>**</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">In Standard the proportion of \u2019 total sales of automotive accessories affected was not shown, and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>was that Standswilg gaUH nf tiras and \u2022hat+PT-iPfi \u201c^STT-o nmmv, eg to oifhpr nf tfiese nrndnets. e.yeeeded 2#. \u00f3f the total sales in the Western area\u201d (337 U.S. at 296-297, 69 S.Ct. at 1053-1054, 93 L.Ed. 1371). Clearly, the Court\u2019s conclusion that competition might...he. lessened substantially did not rest, upon the nrooor: tion foreclosed of totafacommerce in these products. The (fprobabik basis for the . Court\u2019s concTusi&lt;mr\u00e9qualIy applicable to the present case, was that dependence upon Standard- for petroleum supplies and station leases so restricted dealer freedom of choice that arrangements recmirlng dealers to-jnnrchase TBA from Standard, in their anti-competitive effect. \u201cshpgld-perhAps,\u201d as Justice Frankfurter said, \u201cbe considered, as a. matter of classification. tving rather t^flh rpfl11,\u2018T-\u00b0ments agreements.\u201d 337 U.S. at 305 n. 8, 69 S.Ct. at 1058, 93 L.Ed. 1371.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aex-dedup-0\">We are also satisfied that ' other grounds of distinction suggested by Tidewater between this case and Standard do not justify a different result.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Arm0\">As an independent theory of violation, applicable to TBA, Lessig contended thafj Tidewater leased its service stations and sold its petroleum products on the condition that its dealers purchase the TBA which it sponsored or sold.</p>\n<p id=\"AWW\">Of course, if a substantial*^ volume of TBA were involved. Tidewater possessed coercive economic power over its dealers because of its role as a lessor of service stations and distributor <em>61 </em>petroleum products, such tying arrangements would violate Section 3 of the Clayton Act: they would violate Section-1 of the Sherman Act as well if both-of these conditions were present<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The/ quantum of power over the tying product prerequisite to.Sherman Act violation is' simply \u2018\u2018sufficient economic power to impose an appreciable restraint on free competition in the tied product * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Northern Pac. Ry. v.

Loew\u2019s Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 45, 83 S.Ct. 97, 102, 9 L.Ed.2d 11 (1962). For this reason, and because power to monopolize need not be demonstrated, it is \u201cseldom * * * necessary m a tie-in sale case to embark upon a full-scale factual inquiry into the scope of the relevant market for the tying product and into the corollary problem of the seller\u2019s percentage share in that'market.\u201d 371 U.S. at 45 n. 4, 83 S.Ct. at 102, 9 L.Ed.2d 11. Indeed, the requisite control of the tying product may be inferred from the seller\u2019s success in imposing a tying condition upon a~~SUDstantial amount of commerce in the tied product, at, least in the absence of some other explanation for the existence of the restraints.<footnotemark>2<em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the present case there was evidence from which the jury could infer that the alleged tying arrangements were imposed as a matter of general practice, and therefore affected t.ha \u2014 snb&amp;tantial volume of TBA sold by Tidewater\u2019s dealers. The jury could also find that Tidewater possessed the economic power requisite to Sherman Act violation from the fact that it successfully imposed tying conditions upon a substantial volume-of TBA sales, and from the following ci.renmstances. Tidewater could cancel dealer contracts on short notice^ and ae-eline to renew them upon expiration.. The consequences of termination\" were-disproportionately grave to the , dealer. Tidewater could substitute one dealer for another readily or onera.te the station tor-itself. The dealer was economically bound to his station and to Tidewater's petroleum products-; they were to him (mimifil The good will of his business attached to them: moreover, he was bound by contract to purchase his requirements of petroleum products from Tidewater; and even if he were free to shift, a change would involve substantial expense,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and the dealer\u2019s economic resources were usually limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">We are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of exclusive dealing and tying arrangements violative of the antitrust laws to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>B. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of damage</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ari\">Tidewater argues that even so there was insufficient proof of damage to justify submission to the jury of this phase of Lessig\u2019s case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">Lessig did not contend that the alleged exclusive dealing and tying' arrangements led to the cancellation of his <em>lease; </em>and we agree with Tidewater that there is little evidence that Lessig was damaged prior to the termination of his le\u00e1se by the requirement that he purchase petroleum products exclusively from Tidewater.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> However, there was evidence that the prices which Lessig paid for sponsored TBA during his occupancy of the station were higher than those at which such items were available from other sources. Evidence that a merchant has been required to pay more for goods which he resells is sufficient to establish, prima facie, that he has been damaged;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> tested by common experience, such proof is adequate to \u201cestablish with reasonable probability\u201d that profits on resale were less. Flintkote Co. v. Lysfjord, 246 F.2d 368, 392 (9th Cir. 1957).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"art-dedup-0\">Tidewater argues that higher cost of sponsored TBA would not necessarily mean lower dealer profits because competitive TBA might not be equally salable and its purchase, even at lower prices, might lead to diminished profits through fewer sales, lower resale price, and narrowed margins. Under Tidewater\u2019s hypothesis, the only wholly satisfactory evidence of damage would be a record of sales of both competitive and sponsored brands of TBA at Lessig\u2019s service station during the same period, Since, <em>arguendo, </em>Tidewater\u2019s illegal activity made the production of such evidenee impossible by preventing Lessig from dealing in competitive TBA, Tidewater cannot complain that the preferred proof was not produced.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6W\">As to the amount of damage, the evidence showed how much more some items of sponsored TBA cost than com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>petitive brands and the quantity of the former Lessig purchased,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and there was nothing in the record to support Tidewater\u2019s suggestion that competitive TEA might have been less salable or more costly to sell. This was \u201crelevant data\u201d from which the jury could have made \u201ca just and reasonable estimate\u201d of damage. Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 264, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">C. <em>Alleged error in instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Relying upon Standard, Lessig requested the court to instruct the jury that if it found Tidewater\u2019s dealer contracts imposed an exclusive dealing requirement<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> with respect to petroleum products, \u201cand -this practice affected a substantial amount of commerce, you should find that defendant has violated the antitrust laws.\u201d The instruction-was properly refused. As Tidewater points out, more appeared in Standard than that \u2022fee offending contracts affected a substantial amount of commerce in petroleum products.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We agree with Lessig, however, that the iurv was not sufficiently advised that illegal tying arrangements might be found in tacit conditions or understandings inferred from all the circumstances of the case. Tidewater points to the use of the adjectives \u201cexpress or implied\u201d in the pertinent instructions, but an adequate explanation of the concept of tacit conditions or understandings established circumstantially cannot be conveyed by a phrase. The danger of confusion was increased by language repeatedly emphasizing the necessity for an agreement.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The court\u2019s instructions conditioned recovery unon a finding that Lessig entered into an exclusive dealing or tving arrangement, ydfh Tidewater. , But Lessig\u2019s charge was broader;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> he*also all\u00e9ged that Tidewater sought to irnnose these arrangements unoi/^al^ its dealers. If Lessig proved damage to himself from such a course of conduct \u2014 for example,, by cancellation of his lease and dealer contract because he refused to become-dealing..and tying arrangements \u2014 we see-no reason why he could not recover. He clearly could if the arrangements violated the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Doubt has been raised that proximate cause can be shown where-^nly-^he^Iavton Act is offended-, but webe\u00edieve the distinction untenable. Lessig\u2019s allegation that Tidewater established a system of restrictive arrangements is essential to his Clayton Act case-because an exclusive dealing and\"tying arrangement with Lessig alone could not have had the probable effect upon commerce reouired to make nut a violation. Since it is the entire system of conditions and understandings which violate-the Clayton Act, injury to a dealer resulting from Tidewater\u2019s efforts to estahlish and maintain that system is injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cby reason of\u201d conduct forbidden by the Act.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The court instructed the jury that there was no evidence from which it could find that Tidewater's conduct might \u201ctend to create a monopoly\u201d in TBA, leaving t.n t.bp jury only the question of whether it might \u201csubstantially lessen competition.\u201d In the context of this case the distinction is scarcely clear; it was not taken in Standard or Richfield, and we can find no reason to take it here. The Clayton Act\u2019s prohibition of agreements which \u201ctend to create a monopoly\u201d is violated though \u201cthe tendency is a creeping one rather than one that proceeds at full gallop; nor does the law await arrival at the goal before condemning the direction of the movement.\u201d International Salt Co. v.

We think the instruction went too far. If the evidence established that Tidewater followed the course of conduct deseribed and that Tidewater\u2019s dealers thereafter purchased from it their requirements of sponsored TBA items, an inference of tacit agreement would be virtually compelled. The instruction thus might preclude the jury from finding tacit agreement from circumstances which would justify such a finding.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ahh-dedup-1\">Lessig\u2019s remaining objections to instructions relating to TBA tying and exclusive dealing arrangements seem to us inconsequential, unlikely to arise again, or clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">D. <em>Alleged error in exclusion of evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\"> One of Lessig\u2019s contentions concerning the exclusion of evidence relating to this phase of the case merits comment. Lessig complains that he was not permitted to state his opinion as to the profit which he lost as a result of Tid\u00e9w\u00e1ter\u2019s alleged conduct. ' Such opinion testimony is. admissible,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> but only if based upon facts which rationally support it.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The offer of proof was simply that it was Lessig\u2019s opinion, based upon his experience and knowledge, that but for Tidewater\u2019s restrictive practices his earnings would have approximated seven hundred dollars a month, or about four hundred dollars per month more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>lie in fact averaged. There was no offer to show how his estimate was made, The testimony was inadmissible, absent this foundation, and it was excluded upon that express ground. .

Tidewater argues that the omission of the requested instruction was unimportant since the jury was given general instructions that \u201cthe purpose of the law of damages is to place a party in as good a position as lie would have enjoyed but for the wrong done,\u201d and the calculation \u201cshould include all damages suffered by the plaintiff because of lost profits\u201d; and because the jury was told that it might base its award on the testimony of the expert witnesses, which related in part to loss suffered as a result of the cancellation.

The trial here under review used up nine days of the time of a judge and jury and the staff of the court. The jury brought in a verdict for the defendant. I think it is practically impossible that another jury on a retrial would reach a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The plaintiff, who had had some experience operating different service stations which sold Shell, Standard and Richfield gaspline, i\u00f1 May of 1955 leased from The defendant Tidewater an old s\u00e9r'vice station, on condition that the defendant \u2022 would modernize_J;ha_slatipii. The defendant did modernize it, at a cost to it of $29.000. The plainiff has no criticism of the station,. The plaintiff\u2019s' lease was dated November 15, 1955. It provided that it was subject to termination at the end of the first or any subsequent six months\u2019 period by either party. At the time of the execution of the lease the parties entered into \"a \u201cdealer contract.\u201d This contract was for the ppriod November 15, 1955, to November 14,. 19557 with a right~m the defendant to extend it to November 14, 1960. The contract provided however, that it should terminate if the plain tiff\u2019a lease terminated. In the dealer contract the defend*-', dnt agreed to sell the plaintiff his requirements of gasoline, motor oils and greases manufactured bv the defendant. . so long as the contract was in force. __,</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s lease provided for a rent of 567.34 a. rrmatti. plus one cent for each gallon of gasoline delivered to the station. The $67.34 was, of course, insignificant 'in relation to the investment which the defendant had made in the station. If the defendant was to get a respectable return on its investment, it would have to get it out of the gallonage provision of the lease. Before the modernization of the station in the autumn of 1955, the station had been, since January 1, 1954, taking just under 10,000 gallons per month. In the first month after modernization, it took 12,500 gallons. Both Tidewater and Lessig had hoped that the gallonage, after modernization, would increase to 20,000. But it did not increase .substantially (hiring the 27 months following. up_to April. 1958\u2018, when the defendant terminated the lease. The defendant\u2019s profit for the entire year 1958, before taxes, was $30.38. For the year 1957 the comparable figure was SfiiXL The per-month gallonage in the first three months of 1958 was somewhat less than the gallonage in November, 1955, the first full month after the modernization.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Tidewater was not making any money out of the station and, of course, neither was Lessig. His profits averaged 8284.38 per month, which was $80 per month less than he began to earn, working for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the defendant\u2019s station. another man, immediately after' he left</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Postponing, for the time being, any legal problems, and looking at the economics of the operation of the station during Ihe period of the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy, it is obvious that the situation was intolerable. The owner was making substantially nothing and the operator, although he worked long hours and had the use of the owner\u2019s large capital investment, was making a meager living. If there was a reasonable hope that a more efficient operator might develop more business, that would be good for the owner. Was the owner at liberty to make a change? As we have seen, thg_Iqase was tpvmipahlp at the end of any six months\u2019 period by either party, and the dealer contract terminated automatically with termination of the lease. As we have seen, Tidewater did terminate the lease in April, 1958. Under the new operator, the gallonage increased signift-cantly and regularly, to 15,000 gallons in the remaining months of 1958, almost 16,000 gallons in 1959. over 17,000 gallons in 1960 and 1961, and in several months of the latter three years it exceeded 20,000 gallons.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Turning from the economic to the legal questions, the plaintiff complains that the defendant, in its dealings with him, violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and section 3 of the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thereby made itself liable to him, under section 4 of the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the damages which the defendant caused him, multiplied by three.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">So far as concerns section 1 of the Sherman Act, the plaintiff would spell out of certain remarks and remonstrances of the defendant\u2019s agents a contract with him to fix the price at which he could resell gasoline which the defendant had sold to him. The defendant, hoping that the plaintiff would sell enough gasoline so that the defendant might make more than $30.38 or $907 profit, before taxes, in a year, on a very large capital investment, found the plaintiff charging several cents more per gallon than his adjacent competitors and, naturally, not selling much gasoline. The defendant\u2019s agents thought this was not a wise way to do business, which it obviously was not, and told the plaintiff so. In all common sense, does the Sherman Act forbid a man, just because he is engaged in business, from speaking the obvious truth. when the unwise and obstinate conduct of which he speaks is lifting money out of his pocket? The plaintiff testified, repeatedly, that he paid no attention to the suggestions of the defendant\u2019s agents that he reduce his prices, and that he fixed his own prices. Since he fixed his own prices, he could not have been damaged by the defendant\u2019s suggestions that he reduce prices, even if it were possible to conjure a contract out of a rejected suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The plaintiff says that the defendant violated section 3 of the Clayton Act, and thereby became liable to him under section 4 of that act, by requiring him to buy his tires, batteries and accessories (TBA) from the defendant or from those enterprises with which the defendant had arrangements under which the defendant would make ax profit from-' their sales. There waff nothing in the iealer\u2019s contract between the plaintiff and the defendant which provided for any such tying. There is evidence that the defendant\u2019s salesmen of its own 'TBA solicited sales to the plaintiff. ..and tEaF the defendant\u2019s agents introduced to the plaintiff the salesmen of other- en'tefprises with which the defendant had arrangements under which the defendant would make a profit if the TBA were sold to the operators of the defendant\u2019s stations. As to whether there was a \u201ccondition, agreement or understanding\u201d arising by implication out of' the conduct or conversation of the parties, restricting the plaintiff as to where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>might purchase his TBA, again, as in the case of the pricing of the gasoline, actions sneak louder than implications. !Prom the beginning of his lease in 1955, Lessig bought from many other sellers than Tidewater or Tidewater-sponsored sellers, TBA of types which were in direcFcompetition with those sold or sponsored-by Tidewater.\" There is no evi^ d\u00e9nce of any occasion on which the plaintiff even acted as if he felt any inhibition about buying his TBA where he pleased. There is, in the plaintiff\u2019s argument, the fantastic suggestion that Tidewater\u2019s refusal to pay Lessig for TBA bought from sellers with which Tidewater had no connection and sold to customers on Tidewater\u2019s credit cards was some sort of a violation of the antitrust laws. v\"</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The court recognizes that most of the plaintiff\u2019s numerous complaints about instructions are unfounded, because the plaintiff made no objection to the ones given, or the content of the ones which the plaintiff says should have been, but were not, given was adequately covered by instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The court finds however, that there was one instruction requested by the plaintiff and not given by the court as to which the plaintiff\u2019s claim of prejudicial error has merit. In the suit the plaintiff claimed, as we know, that he suffered loss during the period of his lease and dealer contract as a result of the defendant\u2019s alleged practice of dictating the price at which he had to resell his gasoline. The court says, \u201cThe evidence supporting Lessig\u2019s claim of injury from Tidewater\u2019s resale price-fixing activities prior to the termination of his lease and contract was not strong.\u201d That is an understatement. Such evidence, it seems to me, was non-existent. But the court goes on to say, \u201cHowever, the jury could readily infer that Tidewater terminated its business relationship with Lessig because he failed to adhere to the resale price fixing scheme. * * * Lessig could claim compensation for the resulting loss, including reasonably anticipated future profits, and there was evidence from which the jury could find that such a loss occurred.\u201d Then the court goes on to hold that an instruction, requested by the plaintiff and not given, relating to future profits not realized because of the cancellation of his lease and contract, should have been given, an,d that the court\u2019s failure to give it was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In my opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction was correctly refused. Since it is crucial to the court\u2019s decision, I quote it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">\u201cA plaintiff whose lease and product agreements have been cancelled as a result of conduct in violation of the antitrust laws is entitled to be awarded as damages the loss ref profits and values resulting from the cancellations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201cIf you find that Paul Lessig had! developed net income and profits at the service station at 22nd and Irving Street, San Francisco during the period May, 1955 to May 15, 1958, and there was reasonable likelihood that such net earnings and profits would have continued in the future you may award as damages the value of such future profits as of the date of cancellation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The first paragraph is a statement of law. The second paragraph is a peremptory statement, not conditioned upon any finding by the jury that the defendant had violated the law stated in the first paragraph, but flatly telling the jury that if it found that the plaintiff had had net earnings during the period of the lease and would have had net earnings if the-lease had not been cancelled, it should award the plaintiff those future potential net earnings. The plaintiff had, in several of his requests, sought to get the court to give peremptory instructions-such as \u201cTidewater has unlawfully controlled retail prices of dealers.\u201d If the' requested instruction here under discussion had been given, the plaintiff would! have, by indirection, succeeded in getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>what had been properly denied him in dealing with his other requests. The giving of this instruction would, I think, have been prejudicial error if the verdict had gone against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I comment further on the requested instruction which I have quoted above. It would have given the jury no guide whatever as to how far into the future they were to project their award of damages. The plaintiff had, during the period of his lease, averaged $284.33 per month of earnings from the station. This was a meager living; it was $80 less per month than he immediately began to earn working for another man after he left the station. Was he to get $284.33 per month, multiplied by his expectancy of earning capacity as shown by reliable tables, trebled by the Clayton Act, and with or without deductions for other earnings which he might be expected to receive, and a discount for prepayment of a lifetime, or some period less than a lifetime, of earnings ? It was the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility to state some objective less remote than the sky by which the jury should measure his damages if it concluded that his rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I suggest, with deference to the court, that the jury could hardly have been misled into thinking that it could not award damages, if any, resulting from the illegal cancellation of the lease, if it found that there had been an illegal cancellation. The court, in its instructions, several times stated the usual general rule as to the measure of damages in a law-suit, including the loss of profits. The court instructed the jury, \u201cYou may specifically base your award of damages -\u00bb * on the testimony of expert witnesses.\u201d There were only two expert witnesses. The entire testimony of one of them related to the alleged losses of the plaintiff resulting from the cancellation of the lease, and the testimony of the other expert, so far as it related to damages, was with regard to Lessig\u2019s earnings after the lease was cancelled. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued emphatically to the jury that the plaintiff should be awarded damages based upon lost future earnings resulting from the cancellation of the lease. It is fair to plaintiff\u2019s counsel to recognize that he specifically disclaimed any right to project damages \u201cin perpetuity\u201d and asked the jury only for future damages down to November 14, 1960. I think the trial judge was correct in not, of his own motion and as a work of supererogation, prescribing to the jury a rule for measuring future damages. He apparently assumed that, if the jury found that the plaintiff was entitled to such damages, it would measure them by a rule of common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The task of a trial court in threading its way through the inti'icacies of an antitrust suit is difficult and troublesome. The generalities of the statutes, the variations in the language and the conclusions in the reported decisions add to the difficulties. When the trial court has patiently and intelligently moderated the trial, and a jury has passed upon the evidence, I think it is a mistake for an appellate court to yield to counsel\u2019s urging to find some departure from perfection in this complex human proceeding. I think the judgment was right and I would affirm it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"b530-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The petition for rehearing and the motion of amici curiae for leave to file a statement in support thereof are denied.
