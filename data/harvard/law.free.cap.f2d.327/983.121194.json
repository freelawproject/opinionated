It is a matter within the sound discretion of the Trial Judge. Holder v. United States, 150 U.S. 91, 92, 14 S.Ct. 10, 37 L.Ed. 1010; United States v. Brooks, 303 F.2d 851, 853, C.A. 6th, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 889, 83 S.Ct. 184, 9 L.Ed.2d 122; Easley v. United States, 261 F.2d 276, C.A. 5th; United States v. Schaefer, 299 F.2d 625, 631, C.A. 7th, cert. denied, 370 U.S. 917, 82 S.Ct. 1553, 8 L.Ed.2d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"A88f\">It does not appear that the violation of the rule was wilful or with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>knowledge or consent of Government counsel. The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was strong. We find no abuse of the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion in permitting the witness to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
