Section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), provides, \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive * * Within the principles laid down in the O\u2019Brient case, it is clear that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings.
