The government here challenges that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">As set forth in its Constitution and ByLaws, the purpose of the Long Beach Junior Chamber of Commerce is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-13\">\u201cto provide the younger business and professional men of the City of Long Beach a medium for training in citizenship and Chamber of Commerce work, to promote and publicize the civic, industrial, recreational, and educational activities of the community, to secure and disseminate accurate information relating thereto, to oppose legislation unfavorable thereto, and to promote and support legislation favorable thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-15\">\u201cThe organization shall be nonpartisan in all respects and shall not at any time endorse any candidate or individual for public office; and it shall be the policy of this organization to refrain from endorsing or opposing any and all definitely partisan measures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">The activities of the taxpayer have included the following: \u201cBoys Junior Olympics\u201d, an annual boys track meet; \u201cWings Over the World\u201d, an activity designed to publicize aviation; a Christmas Tree Lighting Contest; \u201cOperation Phone Santa\u201d, where members of the organization take calls from children to Santa Claus; \u201cMy True Security\u201d, an essay contest; good citizenship awards; the \u201cMiss Welcome to Long Beach Contest\u201d, where a girl to welcome beauty contestants to Long Beach for the Miss Universe Contest is selected; \u201cChristmas Cheer Clearing House\u201d, where food and gifts are gathered and distributed to needy families during the Christmas season ; social surveys in the area requested by the City of Long Beach and other governmental agencies; programs to combat juvenile delinquency such as having the Wink Martindale Television Show held at the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium for several weeks, and publicizing same in Long Beach schools; and sponsorship of shows in which Duke Ellington, Fred Waring, Spade Cooley, and others appeared. No profit, commission, or bonus has inured to the benefit of any member of the Long Beach Junior Chamber of Commerce from these activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">The statute in question here reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-18\">\u201c\u00a7 4231. Imposition of tax</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aob-dedup-0\">\u201cThere is hereby imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-19\">\u201c(1) General.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-20\">\u201c(A) Single admission.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-21\">\u201cA tax of 1 cent for each 10 cents or major fraction thereof of the amount in excess of $1 paid for admission to any place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaAf\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 4233.

(3) Certain musical or dramatic performances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALCl\">^ \u201cAny admissions to musical or dramatic performances conducted by a civic or community membership association if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the benefit of any stockholders or members of such association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU70\">The performance on which the government claims that the admissions tax was described as follows in the trial court\u2019s proper was findings of fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ8q\">\u201cOn January 29, and 30, and February 1, 2 and 3 of 1959 the plaintiff sponsored at the Long Beach California Municipal Auditorium an American version of the Oberam-mergau Passion Play. The perform-anee was presented by a professional theatrical group, Consolidated Concerts Corporation, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York, for a consideration of $7,500. The net proceeds, if any, after payment of this consideration and other necessary expenses would go to the Long Beach Junior Chamber of Commerce \u2018Youth Activities Fund\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">The government contends that \u201cthe term \u2018civic or community membership association\u2019 as used in Section 4233 (a) (3) has reference only to those nonprofit membership associations which are organized and operated primarily for the purpose of conducting musical or dramatic performances for the cultural benefit of the members of the association, such as civic music associations whose members pay annual dues for the right to attend a senf <em>f </em>cor|ce.rtjs; \u201c requires a rather tortuous twisting of the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words to reach result contended for by the gov. ernment, and our conclusion is that it says no such thing. The term \u201ccivic or community\u201d contemplates an association formed for purposes beneficial to the cornmunity as a whole; one in which members of the community cooperate for cornmunity ends.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taxpayer\u2019s purposes and prior activities indicate that it is precisely the type of association described in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"apb-dedup-2\">The several exemptions from the admissions tax for non-profit musical and dramatic productions contained in section 4233 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicate that Congress intended to encourage such productions by eliminating the economic burden of the admissions tax on them. In view of this policy, there is no reason to engraft onto the statute a limitation denying the exemption to a civic or community membership association formed for general purposes which also engages in musical or dramatic productions. The \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test urged by the government would deny the exemption to those associations which are most public in nature and limit its benefits to those associations whose activities are more oriented toward benefiting their members, an&lt;^ no^ community as a whole,</p>\n<p id=\"abz-dedup-1\">We find nothing in the legislative his-tory which would justify ignoring the clear and unambiguous language of the section, even assuming we would be free to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQW6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aop-dedup-0\">.
