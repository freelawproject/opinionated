We held that the contract in issue contemplated a scheme of distribution along the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-23\">1. Shipment by publisher to Kable\u2019s wholesaler; then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-24\">2. Debit of Kable\u2019s account of <em>5f </em>per magazine shipped; then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-25\">3. (a) Either sale by wholesaler to retailer to public, in which case Kable\u2019s duty to pay <em>5&lt;j\u00a1 </em>per magazine becomes absolute,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-26\">(b) Or failure to sell within contractual period followed by return to Kable by wholesaler,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-27\">(c) Or return to Kable within contractual period and reshipment to second wholesaler, in which case step 3 begins again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-28\">If the event delineated in 3(b) occurs, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-29\">4. (a) Either return by Kable to publisher, in which, case Kable\u2019s - right to a credit becomes absolute,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>(b) Or destruction by Kable when permitted by the contract as a substitute for return, in which case Kable\u2019s right to a credit becomes absolute. 289 F.2d 632, 636 (2 Cir. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We also held that Kable\u2019s accounts were not conclusive and that \u201cthe publishers, in spite of their prior tacit assent, may attack the accounts by evidence of errors therein, but have the burden of showing in what manner the accounts are incorrect.\u201d 289 F.2d 632. Accordingly, we remanded the cases for a new trial to give the parties an opportunity to present their proof in the light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On the second trial the trial court has taken and carefully analyzed the evidence relating to the transactions in issue in accordance with our views of the distribution scheme contemplated by the contracts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Separating the various statements into two groups, those covering the period prior to February 1, 1958, and those thereafter, the trial court found as to the pre-February 1, 1958 statements that the unsold magazines had been destroyed or disposed of as contemplated by the contracts and that \u201cThe plaintiffs have wholly failed to carry their burden of showing that any final statement submitted prior to February 1, 1958, was false or erroneous in any respect.\u201d This conclusion was reached after meticulous consideration of the testimony of many witnesses and an appraisal of their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">As to the period subsequent to February 1,1958, embracing some thirty-four statements, the trial court held that no proper objection had been made to these statements and that \u201cthere is not a shred of evidence that Four Star was misled by anything in the final statements submitted after February 1, 1958.\u201d The conclusion that \u201cFour Star is bound by the accounts\u201d is fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">For a complete exposition of the facts upon which the district court decision and judgment are based, reference is made to the trial court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion reported in 224 F.Supp. 108 (S.D.N.Y.1963). The amounts of the counterclaims against Four Star and Ajax are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">. Both Four Star and Ajax filed notices of appeal. However, plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 brief states that it is \u201climited to the Four Star action because there was <em>no admitted, </em>error in the Ajax accounts, since Ajax had authorized the destruction by Kable of all of its returns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
