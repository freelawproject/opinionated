As a result of his accumulation of 576 days \u201cgood time,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161, and 90 days \u201cmeritorious\u201d time, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4162, he was released subject to supervision on February 17, 1962. On April 2, 1963, he was recommitted to prison as a parole violator. Subsequently, relator filed an \u201capplication for writ of mandamus\u201d in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, claiming that he was not on parole status or subject to supervision at the time he was recommitted. Treating the application as for a writ of habeas corpus, Chief Judge Anderson denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-24\">Relator\u2019s contentions are without merit. The language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 is clear that \u201ca prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed as if released on parole * * To avoid the clear meaning of the statute, relator attempts to treat his three consecutive terms individually, rather than in the aggregate, and to compute his \u201cgood time\u201d allowance accordingly. The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ute is clear that this is not the proper procedure. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161. Similarly, relator argues that his first term \u201cended\u201d at the completion of two years less \u201cgood time\u201d thus far accumulated, and that he commenced to serve his second term at this point; he contends, in effect, that he \u201celected\u201d to spend the time deducted from his first sentence behind prison walls. While the argument is ingenious, we find such an \u201celection\" clearly viola-tive of the statutory scheme. Thus in Brown v. Kearney, 302 F.2d 22 (5th Cir. 1962), a similar contention was found \u201ccompletely repugnant to the basic concept and philosophy of the mandatory release, which is the effectuation of an actual end to imprisonment, conditioned on good conduct during the parole period.\u201d There, as here, under relator\u2019s theory, \u201che would be subject to supervision as a parolee and as a prisoner at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The judgment is affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
