Two days prior to embarkation, the troop requested and was given permission to give a final dress rehearsal at the U. S. Navy Receiving Station in Brooklyn, New York, which was attended by naval personnel. About 6:00 P.M. on the evening in question the entire troop arrived at the station\u2019s auditorium. An officer escorted them by the stage to the dressing rooms, took them to dinner and returned them to the performing area. The show started about 8:15 P.M. and appellant began her routine about 8:45. During her number, after thirty or more spins of acrobatic tap dancing, she fell and was injured. The suit was brought to recover damages from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346) because of alleged negligence of the United States-in not affording her a safe area on which to dance. The government denies any claim of negligence and asserts voluntary assumption of risk and contributory negligence. After trial without a jury, the-court found for the defendant, and entered judgment dismissing the complaint on-the merits. This appeal is taken from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The claim of negligence is based on-the admitted fact that the stage floor had just been waxed earlier on the day of the performance and such a condition, was dangerous for acrobatic tap dancers.. Whether appellant be considered a licensee or invitee the United States was-not negligent. There is no evidence that anyone at the base knew that appellant was to perform as an acrobatic tap dancer or could reasonably have known that appellant would do a dance which required' an unwaxed floor. Even more important,, it is clear from the record that appellant was the one who knew that such a floor-was dangerous, saw the condition of the-floor two hours before the show, started,, did not ask anyone in authority to change the condition, did not refuse to do her act under these conditions and did not use-the type of dancing shoes used by other-acrobatic tap dancers who performed oin waxed floors. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
