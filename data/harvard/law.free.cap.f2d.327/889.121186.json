The statute says \u201cno such final decree [for absolute divorce] shall become absolute and take effect until the expiration of six months after its date.\u201d This court in Oliver v. Oliver, 87 U.S.App.D. C. 334, 336, 185 F.2d 429, 431 (1950), pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-13\">\u201cThis contemplates a provisional decree of divorce only, which cannot mature and become effective until lapse of the intervening time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">We held in Wesley v. Brown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that death of one of the parties during the six-month period following a divorce decree abated the action. Again, in Dillard v. Dillard,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> discussing the underlying policy of our law, we said the District of Columbia statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-19\">\u201cadopts and clearly expresses the broad policy of postponing for six months, <em>and for all purposes, </em>the effective date of any decree of absolute divorce granted in the District of Columbia.\u201d' (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-20\">It is our view that the District Court, Tamm, J., clearly discerned and applied the law as interpreted by repeated decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-21\">Other contentions advanced on brief and in argument have been sufficiently treated in the opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the District Judge. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b942-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-14\">. 90 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 196 F.2d 859 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-15\">. 107 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 218, 275 F.2d 878, 882 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-16\">. In re Hanson\u2019s Estate, 210 F.Supp. 377 (D.C.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b942-23\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqWgX\">(concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-24\">I agree that our holding in Wesley v. Brown, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 196 F.2d 859 (1952), was binding on the district court and requires an affirmance with respect to the construction of D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-421 (1961).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the holding in Wesley v. Brown seems ill-considered since its construction of the statute went far beyond the congressional purpose and here would allow a spouse, who should certainly be considered divorced for these purposes, to take as the lawful surviving spouse as though no divorce had occurred, simply because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>\u2022six month waiting period had a few more days to run. That paradoxical result was neither sound nor necessary under a statute meant only to deter hasty divorces \u2022and hasty remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Sophus D. Hanson died domiciled in Washington, D. C., on January 10, 1960, leaving $5 to his divorced' wife, Anne Baker Bein Hanson, the appellee, and the \u25a0entire residue to a daughter of his prior marriage. Six months lacking 12 days before his death, Hanson had been granted a decree of absolute divorce from ap-pellee but pursuant to Section 16-421 that decree provided that it could not become effective until six months from the date of its entry. Appellee had sought the divorce but it was denied her and granted to Hanson on grounds of desertion. The court denied appellee any alimony or a share of Hanson\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Arbitrary results are often a necessary concomitant of statutes which provide for the determination of legal rights with respect to a fixed period of time, but invariably the seemingly arbitrary result serves the statutory end. See, e. g., United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960). Here the purpose of the statute is fully effectuated when it prevents remarriage within six months after the decree; it should have no other consequence. Some jurisdictions accomplish this same objective by a statute which simply and directly prohibits remarriage within a certain period, without more. See, e. g., Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-118 (1960); W.Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 4722 (1961). I would treat Section 16-421 as if it so provided and confine its operation to its intended purpose by precluding either spouse from sharing in the estate of the other who dies <em>after </em>the final decree has actually been entered but during the six month period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To grant to the spouse in these circumstances the same rights as an <em>undivorced </em>spouse, to me tends not to enhance or strengthen but rather to debase the marital relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">In reaching its holding in Wesley v. Brown, supra, I suggest with all deference, that this court did not give full and adequate consideration to the basic problem involved. The very brief opinion tells us little except that Oliver v. Oliver, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 334,185 F.2d 429 (1950), \u201cis * * * dispositive.\u201d The <em>Oliver </em>case held void a foreign remarriage contracted within six months after the entry of the local decree. In reaching that result in the Oliver case this court considered the legislative history of Section 16-421 and noted that \u201cother statements by members of the [House] Committee clearly indicate that the provision was intended as a barrier to hasty and fraudulent divorces.\u201d 87 U.S.App.D.C. at 337, 185 F.2d at 432.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Our examination of a statute should be a search for meaning. Clearly, the meaning and purpose of Congress was, as its records show, to prevent \u201ceasy divorce <em>and </em>hasty remarriage of divorced persons.\u201d 87 U.S.App.D.C. at 338, 185 F.2d at 433. (Emphasis added.) That purpose is not served in the slightest by permitting a \u201cdivorced\u201d spouse the same inheritance rights as a <em>surviving </em>spouse simply because the six month period, which was intended only to prohibit remarriage, has twelve days to run. As I see it, the congressional purpose and the underlying public policy is fully satisfied without the illogical and incongruous result we now feel compelled to reach here. Except for the restraint on remarriage during the six month waiting period, the parties should be regarded for all other purposes as divorced persons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>ited purpose of the statute was recognized in Steele v. Steele, 65 F.Supp. 329, 332 (D.D.C.1946), in which the divorce decree was viewed as severing the marital bond immediately upon its entry so as to allow the divorced wife to sue the divorced husband in tort for acts which occurred within the six month period before the decree was final. Had the court considered the parties married after the entry of the divorce decree, the one spouse could not have sued the other in tort. In Tillinghast v. Tillinghast, 58 App.D.C. 107, 110, 25 F.2d 531, 534 (1928), this court, construing Section 983a of the D.C.Code in effect in 1928, with essentially the same language as is found in Section 16-421, held that facts- \u2014 the death of one party\u2014 arising after a decree (in that case for annulment) but before the expiration of the interlocutory period for taking an appeal operated to make the decree final in order to avoid illegitimacy of offspring of the remarriage of one party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>It is not without significance that we have long treated the date of the <em>entry </em>of a divorce decree as fixing the time for appeal as from a final order. See, <em>e. g., </em>Roberts v. Roberts, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 382, 222 F.2d 408 (1955) (decree entered April 26,1954; notice of appeal filed May 11, 1954); Lort v. Lort, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 118, 198 F.2d 598, 34 A.L.R.2d 951 (1952) (decree entered May 9, 1951; notice of appeal filed June 8, 1951). See also H.R. Rep. No. 1532, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">In the <em>Oliver, Tillinghast </em>and <em>Steele </em>cases dealing with this statutory language prior to the Wesley holding, the courts have carefully confined the impact of the statute to its objective of deterring hasty divorce and hasty remarriage. Only in the <em>Wesley </em>case was the statute given effect beyond its intended purpose. My view that the <em>Wesley </em>holding was not as carefully considered as the earlier cases and perhaps not as carefully as the subject merited is buttressed by the fact that neither the <em>Steele </em>nor the <em>Tilling-hast </em>cases, supra, were cited. Indeed, an examination of our records discloses that the briefs in the <em>Wesley </em>case failed to bring these cases to this court\u2019s notice. Nor was any reference made to the fact that we had long considered divorce decrees final for appeal purposes when entered, rather than six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">We ought not strain, as I think was done in the <em>Wesley </em>case, to construe a statute to produce an anomalous and unreasonable result. The <em>Tillinghast </em>opinion, in drawing away from the literal language of the D.C.Code provision reminded that \u201cit is well-settled law that, where a strict construction of a statute leads to injustice, absurdity, and incongruity, the court will look to the purpose and the spirit of the statute in declaring its effect.\u201d 58 App.D.C. at 109, 25 F.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">I suggest we should re-examine our <em>Wesley </em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>holding in light of this principle of statutory construction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-25\">. The D.C.Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-26\">\u201cNo final decree annulling or dissolving a marriage shall be effective to annul or dissolve the marriage until the expiration of the time allowed for taking an appeal, nor until the final disposition of any appeal taken, and every final decree shall expressly so recite. Every decree for absolute divorce shall contain the date thereof and no such final decree shall be absolute and take effect until the expiration of six months after its date.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-10\">.

Brown, 97 F.Supp. 237 (D.D.C.1950) (dictum). <em>But see </em>Fleisch-hauer v. Hazen, 80 F.Supp. 74, 69 Wash. L.Rep. 221 (D.D.C.1941), in which the district court awarded pension payments to decedent\u2019s first wife, although the husband had died subsequent to entry of an \u201cabsolute decree\u201d but prior to expiration of the six months; the court cited no cases nor the statute and may have been influenced by the fact that the other claimant was a purported second wife who asserted the validity of a Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>divorce, obtained by deceased from Ms first wife, wMch the court found void because secured by \u201cthe fraud practiced on [the] court by the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Oklahoma and Kansas have adopted identical statutory provisions, similar to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-421, declaring that divorce decrees shall not take effect until six months after the decree is entered; see Kan.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 60-1514 (1949); Okla.Stat., tit. 12 \u00a7 1280 (1961). The supreme courts of both states for over sixty years and without exception have applied these provisions only to a remarriage context, reasoning that because \u201cthe sole purpose of the statutory provision * * * is to prevent the parties from remarrying within that period * * *. For all other purposes the decree takes effect the same as any other judgment.\u201d First Nat. Bank of Elk City v. Springfield Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 104 Kan. 278, 280, 178 P. 413, 414 (1919).

See, <em>e. g., </em>Morris v. Propst, 98 Colo. 213, 55 P.2d 944, 104 A.L.R. 650 (1936); Chase v. Webster, 168 Mass. 228, 46 N.E. 705 (1897). These cases-, are collected and digested at 104 A.L.R. 654-63 (1936); 158 A.L.R. 1205-209-(1945); 2 A.L.R. Blue Book Supp.Dec. 705 (1952); 3 A.L.R. Blue Book Supp.Dec. 651 (1958); 1963 A.L.R. Blue Book Supp. Dec. 498. <em>But cf. </em>In re Harper\u2019s Estate, supra. Significantly, the statutes involved in these cases provide for initial' conditional-type divorce decrees, sometimes denominated interlocutory, sometimes nisi, which the House Report accompanying D.C.Code \u00a7 16-421 as an amendment specifically noted it was eliminating : \u201cThis bill makes no provision for an interlocutory decree [as did the then present law] * * H.Rep.

The majority opinion cites dictum from Dillard v.

Indeed, the court in <em>Dillard </em>specifically noted that the issue in the <em>Oliver </em>case \u201crelated only to remarriage,\u201d 107 U.S.App.D.C. at 219, 275 F.2d at 883, and that the <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Wesley </em>cases \u201cprovide [d] no guidance in the instant <em>[Dillard] </em>case arising under a Virginia statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b945-19\">. Both parties now before us apparently assumed that the <em>Wesley </em>holding was binding on this issue and therefore argued the case on other grounds; they did not brief or argue the central point which I urge in this opinion. In that posture the District Judge had no occasion to deal extensively with this issue as he did with other points in Ms exhaustive opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
