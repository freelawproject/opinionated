Walen, Fla., 71 So.2d 732); and that the dangerous condition caused Mrs. Wilkerson to slip and fall on the floor, resulting in the personal injuries and damages for which she was awarded recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">We are of the opinion the court properly refused to instruct the jury that the amount of the recovery was not subject to federal or state income taxes and that the trial in other respects was free from prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
