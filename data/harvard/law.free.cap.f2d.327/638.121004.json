Portland Trader, </em>for damage to cargo which occurred when the vessel ran aground on Tubbataha Reef in the Sulu Sea, Republic of the Philippines, January 5, 1961. The primary contention of libelant was that the vessel was unseaworthy by reason of its not being equipped with either radar or loran.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> District Judge John F. Kilkenny, in a detailed opinion, 213 F.Supp. 352 (D.Or.1962), found that the vessel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>seaworthy and that the sole cause of the accident was negligent navigation by the master. We think that Judge Kilkenny in his opinion correctly set forth the salient facts, analyzed the issues, and applied the law, and accordingly adopt that opinion as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-17\">. Libellant also contended that respondent was negligent in its instructions to the master after it received notification of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
