The trial court declared in its judgment that Robert Ruiz, the injured party, was an insured under the policy issued by Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company (Atlantic Mutual) and he was not an insured under a policy issued by American States Insurance Company (American States). Atlantic Mutual and Ruiz both appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">In its appeal, Atlantic Mutual asserts that Ruiz is not an insured under its policy but he is an insured under American States\u2019 policy. In his appeal, Ruiz maintains that he is an insured under both policies and each insurer has an obligation to pay its prorated share.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">A. <em>Stipulated Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The parties submitted the case for court trial on the following stipulated facts. On October 7, 1997, Cristobol Tavares, who was driving a Toyota Camry, struck the pickup truck driven by Ruiz and then struck a van owned by Group Manufacturing Services, Inc. of California (Group Manufacturing). Ruiz, who was uninjured at this point, exited his employer\u2019s truck and \u201cwalked approximately 200 feet to where the Group Manufacturing van had stopped, to inquire about the driver\u2019s condition, to learn what had happened, and to exchange driver\u2019s license/insurance information.\u201d It was Ruiz\u2019s intention to return to the truck after obtaining documentation from the van\u2019s occupants and \u201cwait for the police to arrive as he had been trained to do by his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>\u201cRuiz determined that the right front passenger of the Group Manufacturing van had been injured. He walked around to the passenger side door, opened the door and assisted the passenger out of the van.\u201d \u201cAs he was approximately one foot from the passenger door, attempting to talk with the driver, he was struck by an underinsured motorist, Alma Ogana,\u201d who was driving a minivan. Ruiz never entered Group Manufacturing\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">As a result of being struck by Ogana, Ruiz suffered \u201ca compression burst fracture at LI, tom ligaments and meniscus in his left knee, a fracture of his left tibia, a fracture of his right tibial plateau, and abdominal trauma as well as post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">At the time of the initial collision, \u201cRuiz was driving a vehicle owned by his employer, Fast UnderCar, and he was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Fast UnderCar.\u201d Ruiz sought and recovered workers compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">American States had issued a commercial auto policy to Fast Pro, Inc., and Fast UnderCar, Inc., as the named insured. Atlantic Mutual had insured Group Manufacturing under a business auto policy. Both policies provided $1 million in underinsured motorists (UIM) benefits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were in effect at the time of the accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The \u201cCalifornia Uninsured Motorist Coverage\u2014Bodily Injury\u201d endorsement, which is contained in both policies at issue, provides coverage as follows: \u201cWe will pay all sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 The damages must result from \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by the \u2018insured\u2019 caused by an \u2018accident.\u2019 The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined, as relevant, to include \u201c[y]ou\u201d or \u201c[a]nyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 . . . .\u201d \u201cOccupying\u201d is further defined to mean \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">\u201cOn July 21, 1998, Mr. Ruiz and his wife filed a personal injury lawsuit against the other drivers\u201d and \u201crecovered a total of $65,000 in policy limits from the other drivers . . . .\u201d \u201cRuiz made a claim for UIM benefits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>Atlantic Mutual and American States, demanding a total of $1 million in damages.\u201d Both insurers denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">B. <em>Statement of Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The trial court determined that Ruiz was not \u201coccupying\u201d his employer\u2019s pickup truck and, therefore, was not covered under the UM provisions of American States\u2019 policy. The court noted that the injury occurred \u201capproximately 200 feet from this vehicle\u201d and Ruiz was \u201cnot engaged in \u2018performance of acts \u201cphysically and directly related to the car\u201d or its use\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">As to the Group Manufacturing vehicle, the court indicated that it was important to consider \u201cthe fact that Defendant Ruiz, who despite being approximately one foot from this vehicle at the time of his injury, was never an occupant of this vehicle, had no intention of occupying it, had only minimal contact with the vehicle (opening the passenger door), and was totally unknown to either Group Manufacturing, Inc., its insurance carrier, Atlantic Mutual, or the driver and its passenger.\u201d Nevertheless, the court concluded that Ruiz was an insured under the UM provisions of Atlantic Mutual\u2019s policy. Its conclusion was predicated upon \u201clocation of the Group Manufacturing, Inc., vehicle (and how it came to be so located),\u201d the fact that Ruiz was placed in harm\u2019s way because he was \u201cassisting someone from \u2018getting out\u2019 of the insured vehicle,\u201d \u201cthe public policy of affording coverage to the injured,\u201d and the rule requiring ambiguities to be resolved in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">C <em>Meaning of \u201cOccupying\u201d and \u201cUpon\u201d in Defining \u201cInsured\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">1. <em>Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM Endorsement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">To be entitled to coverage under Atlantic Mutual\u2019s endorsement for uninsured motorist coverage, Ruiz had to qualify as an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the UM coverage provisions. As mentioned, the term \u201cinsured\u201d included \u201c[a]nyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d and \u201coccupying\u201d was further defined to \u201cmean[] in, upon, getting in, on, out, or off.\u201d The question in this case is whether Ruiz was \u201cupon\u201d Group Manufacturing\u2019s van when he was struck by the underinsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">Atlantic Mutual argues that the trial court improperly disregarded the plain meaning of the policy in finding UM coverage for Ruiz because \u201cRuiz is a stranger to the Atlantic Mutual policy\u201d and he never occupied or intended to enter or occupy the vehicle it insured. It maintains that Ruiz was not an \u201cinsured\u201d because \u201cphysical proximity\u201d to Group Manufacturing\u2019s van was not enough and because he was not a \u201cpermissive user\u201d of the van. Atlantic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>Mutual refers us to two Virginia cases, which adopted a narrow construction of the term \u201cupon\u201d and required some immediate connection related to \u201coccupying\u201d the insured vehicle. (See <em>Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bristow </em>(1966) 207 Va. 381 [150 S.E.2d 125, 126-128] [Samaritan injured while looking under the hood at the motor of a stalled vehicle not \u201cupon\u201d the insured vehicle because \u201c[h]is touching of the vehicle was merely incidental to his kindly act as a Good Samaritan\u201d]; <em>Edwards v.

Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1115 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568].) \u201cWhen interpreting a policy provision, we must give its terms their \u2018 \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\u201d \u2019 <em>(AIU Ins., </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253], quoting Civ.

Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\u201cA policy provision is ambiguous <em>only </em>if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole. (See <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 868 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265] (Foster-Gardner).) The court may then \u2018invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist (i.e., the insurer) in order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage.\u2019 <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 37 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048].)\u201d <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\u201cThe mere fact that a word or phrase in a policy may have multiple meanings does not create an ambiguity. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) \u201c[A] word with a broad meaning or multiple meanings may be used for that very reason\u2014its breadth\u2014to achieve a broad purpose.\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) \u201cThe proper question is whether the word is ambiguous in the context of <em>this </em>policy and the circumstances of <em>this </em>case. [Citation.] The provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins.

Consequently, we cannot simply look to its ordinary and popular sense and must turn to the dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\u201cUpon\u201d in modem usage is the equivalent of \u201con.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (10th ed. 2001) p. 1294 (Webster\u2019s); American Heritage College Diet. (3d ed. 1998) p. 1482 (American Heritage); Compact Edition of the Oxford English Diet. (1971) vol. II, p. 3564 (Oxford Dictionary).) \u201cUpon\u201d is defined by Oxford Dictionary in regard to physical position (as opposed to usages involving immaterial or figurative relationships not relevant here) to mean: \u201cOf local position outside of, but in contact with or close to, a surface.\u201d (Oxford Diet., <em>supra, </em>vol. II, p. 3564.) \u201cOn\u201d is similarly defined by Oxford Dictionary: \u201cOf local position outside of, but close to or near, any surface.\u201d (Oxford Diet., <em>supra, </em>vol. I, p. 1987.) This general definition includes \u201c[i]n proximity to; close to, beside, near, by, at; on the bank of (a river or lake), on the coast of (the sea).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 1988.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Webster\u2019s similarly defines \u201con\u201d to express physical location as follows: \u201cla\u2014used as a function word to indicate position in contact with and supported by the top surface of . . . b\u2014used as a function word to indicate position in or in contact with an outer surface . . . c\u2014used as a function word to indicate position in close proximity with &lt;a village the sea&gt; &lt;stay <em>on </em>your opponent&gt; . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>p. 809.) American Heritage defines \u201con\u201d in terms of physical position as follows: \u201cla. Used to indicate position above and supported by or in contact with: <em>The vase is on the table, </em>b. Used to indicate contact with or extent over (a surface) regardless of position: <em>a picture on the wall. </em>c. Used to indicate location at or along: a town on the border, d. Used to indicate proximity: <em>a town on the border, </em>e. Used to indicate attachment to or suspension from: <em>beads on a string.\u201d </em>(American Heritage, <em>supra, </em>p. 953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM policy as a whole does not clarify whether under the present circumstances \u201cupon\u201d is intended to convey the narrower sense of contact with a surface or a broader meaning of close physical proximity. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>addition the policy does not explicitly answer whether, if the broader meaning is intended, some kind of greater connection to the insured vehicle is required beyond mere physical proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">A few California cases have considered the meaning of \u201cupon\u201d as used in automobile insurance policies. In <em>Christoffer v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d Supp. 979 [267 P.2d 887] (Christoffer), the question was whether a man who was using the vehicle with permission was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of the medical payments provision when he was struck by another car while he was touching the left rear wheel, either taking it off or putting it on.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at pp. Supp. 979-980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The reviewing court in <em>Christoffer </em>believed that the term \u201cupon\u201d was unambiguous and \u201cshould be given the meaning ordinarily accepted in everyday speech.\u201d <em>(Christoffer, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d at p. Supp. 981.) The court reasoned: \u201cSince there are no exceptions, exclusions, restrictions, or qualifications contained within the policy as to how or in what manner the assured was to be upon the automobile (such as standing upon, sitting upon, kneeling upon, pushing upon, pulling upon, riding upon, resting upon, etc.), we conclude that respondent was \u2018upon the automobile\u2019 as the term is employed in the policy, just as a fly is said to be \u2018upon the wall\u2019 or \u2018upon the ceiling,\u2019 or a painter is said to be \u2018upon the wall,\u2019 a person to be \u2018upon a raft\u2019 although only supported by the hand, or as a baseball player (the runner) is said to be upon the base if any portion of his body is in contact with the bag. Everyday speech refutes the statement that the word \u2018upon\u2019 is confined to the meaning of \u2018on top of.\u2019 The dog is \u2018upon the leash\u2019; the man is \u2018upon the rope.\u2019 It is this meaning of the word \u2018upon\u2019 which we believe the parties had in mind in the preparation of Coverage \u2018C\u2019 of the contract. It is the meaning set forth by Webster\u2019s wherein the position of contact is against the supporting surface rather than above it, or position of contiguity wherein contact and support is from elsewhere than beneath.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. Supp. 982-983.) The <em>Christoffer </em>court affirmed the judgment for the injured party based upon the dictionary meaning of \u201cupon.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. Supp. 982-984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In <em>Cocking </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 965 [86 Cal.Rptr. 193] <em>(Cocking), </em>an uninsured motorist struck an individual, who had been driving an insured Volkswagen with the owner\u2019s permission, had exited the vehicle, and was standing one to four feet behind the vehicle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>preparation to putting on tire chains. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 967.) The applicable automobile policy provided UM coverage and, similar to Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM endorsement, defined \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201c \u2018. . . any other person while occupying an insured automobile\u2019 and in turn defined the term \u2018occupying\u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018. . . in or upon or entering into or alighting from.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court concluded that the injured driver had not been occupying the insured vehicle at the time of the accident since \u201cat the time he was struck, had been outside the car for approximately two minutes and was standing some one to four feet from it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The <em>Cocking </em>appellate court first considered <em>Christoffer, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d Supp. 979. <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 968.) The appellate court agreed with Christoffer\u2019s conclusion but not with \u201cits rationale suggesting that in every instance there must be a physical contact between the injured person and the car he is using.\u201d <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 969.) The appellate court observed that \u201cthe dictionary definition of the word \u2018upon\u2019 includes \u2018in or into close proximity.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Intemat. Diet.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It pointed out that an Illinois court had concluded that \u201cupon,\u201d as used in a medical payments provision, had \u201cconnoted some physical relationship enlarging the area defined by the words \u2018entering or alighting\u2019 and the word \u2018in.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">However, the <em>Cocking </em>court believed dictionary definitions alone were not determinative because the policy language had to be \u201cread and interpreted in the light of the purpose of the uninsured motorist statute, the provisions of which are a part of the instant insurance policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 969.) The court stated that there was \u201cample and significant authority holding that the purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is to give monetary protection to persons who, while lawfully using highways themselves, suffer grave injury through the negligent use of those highways by others. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The appellate court declared that \u201c[s]uch [policy] language has been interpreted to mean that coverage is extended to the person seeking recovery under the policy where he was using the vehicle, either as the named insured or with the latter\u2019s permission or consent, express or implied, and where he was in such a position in relation thereto as to be injured in its use. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at pp. 969-970.) The <em>Cocking </em>court stated: \u201cIn determining whether the person was in such a position in relation to the vehicle as to be injured in its use, consideration must be given, not only to what the person was doing upon injury, but also to his purpose and intent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The appellate court found coverage applying this standard: \u201c[I]t is undisputed that plaintiff was using the insured\u2019s Volkswagen permissively. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>the agreed facts it is also evident that plaintiff was performing an act physically and directly related to the car. Since plaintiff was traveling under highway conditions requiring tire chains, his acts of stopping the vehicle to put chains on, and of undoing the bag containing the chains while in close proximity to the car, clearly suggest his intent to place those chains on the car\u2019s tires. Accordingly, we hold that plaintiff\u2019s position preparatory to placing the chains on the tires of the car put him in the requisite physical relationship to the car. His injury while in that position, therefore, occurred while he was \u2018using\u2019 the car and while he was \u2018upon\u2019 the Volkswagen within the meaning of the policy and [Insurance Code] section 11580.2.\u201d <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at pp. 970-971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In placing its judicial construction upon the term \u201cupon,\u201d the <em>Cocking </em>court relied on a number of out-of-state cases considering medical payment provisions that required the injury to arise out of the <em>use </em>of the car, or related the term \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d to <em>use </em>of the car by the named insured or a permissive user. However, the express policy definitions of \u201cinsured\u201d or \u201coccupying\u201d under consideration in <em>Cocking, </em>which are similar to those at issue here, did not specifically require an individual to be \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle or be a \u201cpermissive user\u201d of the insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We agree with <em>Cocking </em>insofar as it interpreted the word \u201cupon\u201d in the light of the public policy underlying the uninsured motorist statute \u201cto provide compensation for those injured by the use of automobiles and through no fault of their own . . . .\u201d <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 969.) We agree that \u201cupon\u201d must be construed to mean something more than the other words used to define \u201coccupying\u201d since otherwise the word \u201cupon\u201d is rendered superfluous and every part of the policy is not given effect.

We also agree with its conclusion that \u201cupon\u201d means more than direct physical contact with the insured vehicle given the remedial purpose of the uninsured motorist coverage law.

It provides in part: \u201cNo policy of bodily injury liability insurance covering liability <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle . . . </em>shall be issued or delivered in this state to the owner or operator of a motor vehicle . . . unless the policy contains, or has added to it by endorsement, a provision with coverage limits at least equal to the limits specified in subdivision (m) and in no case less than the financial responsibility requirements specified in Section 16056 of the Vehicle Code insuring the insured ... for all sums within the limits that he . . . shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (\u00a7 11580.2, subd.

(b).) The statutory definition of \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of UM coverage does not include any requirement that the person be using or have permission to use the insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Atlantic Mutual also refers us to a number of inapposite cases for its claim that an individual \u201cmust have permission to be in, on or near the vehicle before claiming entitlement to UIM benefits from that other vehicle\u2019s insurer.\u201d The cited cases concern altogether different coverage questions arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>from various policy provisions not at issue here. They do not concern the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d for purposes of defining \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The import of \u201cupon\u201d was also considered in another California case, <em>Utah Home Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 14 Cal.App.3d 50 [91 Cal.Rptr. 781] <em>(Utah Home), </em>which involved a question of UM coverage under two separate policies. The issue was whether an exemption in the injured individual\u2019s own automobile policy eliminated UM coverage under that policy because there was similar UM coverage under the policy issued to the owner of the other vehicle involved in the accident. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53.) The pertinent policy provision stated: \u201c \u2018(c) The insurance coverage provided for in this section does not apply: (1) . . . (2) To bodily injury of the insured while in or upon or while entering into or alighting from an automobile other than the described automobile if the owner thereof has insurance similar to that provided in this section.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52.) This policy language tracked section 11580.2, subdivision (c)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The primary purpose of the exemption provided by section 11580.2, subdivision (c)(2), is to prevent double recovery by the injured insured where otherwise there might be UM coverage under more than one policy. (See <em>Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Wolf </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 811, 817 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 584].) Both 11580.2, subdivision (c), and 11580.2, subdivision (b), which defines \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of UM coverage, use the same language to describe an insured\u2019s position in relation to the insured vehicle: \u201cin or upon or entering into or alighting from.\u201d Not only is it the general \u201crule that a word or phrase will be given the same meaning each time it appears in a statute\u201d <em>(Steketee </em>v. <em>Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 46, 53 [210 Cal.Rptr. 781, 694 P.2d 1153]), but the exemption\u2019s purpose implies that the phrases have the same meaning. Like subdivision (b), subdivision (c)(2) of section 11580.2 does not use the word \u201coccupying\u201d to describe the insured\u2019s physical relationship to an insured vehicle <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In <em>Utah Home, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d 50, the injured individual was struck by an uninsured motorist as he was standing in the street with his hands on the windowsill of a parked Cadillac and conversing with his friend who was in the Cadillac\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 51-52.) Moments before, the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>man had parked his vehicle at the curb two vehicles behind his friend\u2019s Cadillac, gotten out, and walked over to the Cadillac. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The injured individual was flattened against the Cadillac by an unidentified car that did not stop. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52.) The injured party\u2019s insurer successfully sought a declaratory judgment that the UM coverage under its policy did not apply to the injuries sustained as a result of the accident and that such loss was covered by the policy issued to the driver of the Cadillac. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The appellate court in <em>Utah Home </em>ostensibly accepted <em>Cooking\u2019s </em>conclusions that \u201cupon\u201d included \u201cin or into close proximity\u201d and that the injured individual must have been permissively using the insured vehicle. <em>(Utah Home, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d at p. 54.) The court in <em>Utah Home </em>stated: \u201cThere remains the more difficult question whether [the injured man\u2019s] conversation with [his friend] in the precise position above described constituted a use of [his friend\u2019s] car with the latter\u2019s permission.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court very loosely applied the considerations of \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpermission\u201d advanced by <em>Cocking </em>and articulated an \u201cessential factor\u201d test. It reasoned: \u201c[The injured man] would not have been in the path of the \u2018phantom\u2019 car if [his friend] had not been seated in his parked Cadillac. Since the Cadillac was the essential factor that placed the parties in their respective positions at the time of the accident, [the injured man] was \u2018using\u2019 and \u2018upon\u2019 the car within the meaning of the policy and [Insurance Code] section 11580.2[, subdivision (c)(2)].\u201d <em>(Utah Home, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><em>Utah Home </em>did not suggest that an individual who was physically \u201cupon\u201d an insured vehicle was also required to have intent to enter or occupy the insured vehicle to be \u201cupon\u201d a vehicle within the meaning of section 11580.2; it implied the opposite. We agree with the result in <em>Utah Home </em>and the court\u2019s focus on the closeness of the connection between the individual\u2019s position and the insured vehicle and its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM endorsement does not indicate that \u201cupon\u201d requires a person to have the intent to get into or occupy the insured vehicle. The Virginia cases cited by appellant are unpersuasive insofar as they require an injured individual to be performing \u201can act immediately related to occupancy of the vehicle\u201d to be considered \u201cupon\u201d it. <em>(Edwards v. Government Employees Ins. Co., supra, </em>500 S.E.2d at p. 822; see also <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bristow, supra, </em>150 S.E.2d at p. 128.) California cases have construed \u201cupon\u201d more broadly. Also, significantly, \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of UM coverage is not statutorily defined in reference to \u201coccupying\u201d a vehicle. (\u00a7 11580.2, subd.

We cannot construe the meaning of \u201cupon\u201d under Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM endorsement more narrowly than the Insurance Code merely because the endorsement uses \u201coccupying\u201d as shorthand for \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The purpose of uninsured motorist coverage is \u201c \u2018to protect one lawfully using the highway by assuring him of payment of a minimum amount of an award to him for bodily injury caused by the actionable fault of another driver.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hartford Fire Ins.

Cancilla </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1310 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 302].) The meaning of \u201cupon\u201d must be understood with this in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In this case, Ruiz was positioned immediately adjacent to Group Manufacturing\u2019s van for reasons essentially related to the insured vehicle and its use on the highway. When struck by die underinsured vehicle, Ruiz was attempting to speak to the van\u2019s driver regarding the multivehicle accident that had just occurred and had just helped an injured passenger exit. In light of the principle that ambiguities in a policy are generally construed against the insurer <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1115) and the underlying public purpose of the uninsured motorist statute, we conclude that under the stipulated facts Ruiz, who was standing only about a foot from Group Manufacturing\u2019s van, was \u201cupon\u201d the van and qualified as an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of Atlantic Mutual\u2019s UM coverage provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">2. <em>American States\u2019 UM Endorsement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Appellant Atlantic Mutual argues that Ruiz qualifies as an \u201cinsured\u201d under American States\u2019 UM endorsement because Ruiz was \u201coccupying\u201d his employer\u2019s truck at the time of the accident. The argument is essentially that it is expected that Ruiz, as a driver involved in a multivehicle accident, would leave the vehicle and walk to another vehicle to check on the driver and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>\u201cexchange legally mandated information\u201d and coverage should not arbitrarily turn on the distance that happens to exists between the vehicles after they have come to a stop. Atlantic Mutual maintains that \u201cthe litmus test for coverage\u201d \u201cis not physical distance\u201d but \u201cthe claimaint\u2019s <em>intention with respect to the covered auto </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Appellant Ruiz first claims that he is an \u201cinsured\u201d under American States\u2019 UM endorsement because he is a truck driver for his employer, Fast UnderCar, and, therefore, qualifies as \u201cyou.\u201d Ruiz argues that \u201cin light of\u2019 the exclusion in the UM endorsement for \u201c[a]nyone using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person is entitled to do so,\u201d he <em>\u201cas a driver for Fast Under Car [sic], </em>plainly fits the definition of \u2018You\u2019 under the policy.\u201d He also contends that he fit the statutory definition of \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201cany other person while in or upon or entering into or alighting from an insured motor vehicle\u201d (\u00a7 11580.2, subd. (b)) because he was permissively using his employer\u2019s truck and had only gotten out for the purpose of exchanging information with the driver of Group Manufacturing\u2019s van as required by law. Ruiz submits that California does not apply \u201ca narrow, \u2018tape measure\u2019 standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The stipulated facts show that the American States policy was issued to Fast Pro, Inc., and Fast UnderCar, Inc., not Ruiz. As American States points out, its policy stated that \u201c \u2018[throughout this policy the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations\u2019 \u201d and its declaration page provided that the named insureds are Fast Pro, Inc. and Fast UnderCar, Inc. Here, \u201cyou\u201d is explicitly defined. Where insurance policy language is clear and explicit, it governs. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The cases cited by Atlantic Mutual and Ruiz do not support their position that \u201cRuiz\u201d was \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d the Fast UnderCar truck. <em>National Indemnity Co. v. Farmers Home Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 102 [157 Cal.Rptr. 98], cited by both appellants, had nothing to do with the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d in relationship to a definition of \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of UM coverage. In <em>National Indemnity, </em>the automobile liability policy at issue provided coverage for damages that the insureds became legally obligated to pay because of \u201c \u2018bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the [insured vehicle.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 105.) The issue was whether bodily injury sustained by a minor passenger who was hit by a car after exiting the insured vehicle arose \u201cout of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the vehicle where it was alleged that the driver negligently supervised and controlled the child during unloading. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 106-109.) <em>National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number><em>Indemnity </em>does not stand for the proposition that physical distance is irrelevant to the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d for purposes of determining whether an individual qualifies as an \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Neither <em>Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 965, cited by both appellants, nor <em>Wolf v. American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. </em>(1954) 2 Ill.App.2d 124 [118 N.E.2d 777], cited by Ruiz, indicates physical distance is never a determinative factor in evaluating whether an individual is \u201cupon\u201d an insured vehicle. Neither opinion addressed how close is close enough because both individuals were standing relatively close to the insured vehicle. The injured individual in <em>Cocking </em>was standing only one to four feet behind the insured vehicle. <em>(Cocking, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 967.) The injured individual in <em>Wolf </em>was standing two or three feet in front of his car. (Wolf v. <em>American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa., supra, </em>118 N.E.2d at pp. 777-778.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">California cases recognize that \u201cupon\u201d connotes close physical proximity, regardless of intent to return to the vehicle after temporarily leaving it or intent to proceed directly to the vehicle and occupy it. In <em>Mullins v. Mayflower Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 416 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 635], a mother filed a declaratory relief action against an insurer to determine whether she could recover underinsured motorist benefits for a vehicular accident in which her son was killed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 417.) Her son was struck by a drunk driver while he and other young men were walking along the highway shoulder to find a telephone after the insured vehicle in which they had been riding had pulled off the highway due to a flat tire. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 418.) At that time, the young men were about 50 feet down the highway from the car. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage extended to \u201ca person occupying an insured auto\u201d and \u201coccupying\u201d was defined in the policy as \u201c \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The appellate court in <em>Mullins </em>reasoned that the son\u2019s death \u201cdid not result from his being in close proximity to the insured vehicle nor from his performance of acts \u2018 \u201cphysically and directly related to the car\u201d or its use.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mullins, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 420.) It observed that the son \u201cand the other young men had temporarily abandoned the vehicle and their intent was to seek a telephone some distance away. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It concluded: \u201cAppellant\u2019s test of allowing recovery to anyone who was injured before the person arrived safely at his or her destination strains both any reasonable interpretation of the definition of \u2018occupying\u2019 in the policy and existing legal precedent in uninsured and underinsured motorist cases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">In another California case, a court held that a woman, who was struck by an uninsured motorist while she was crossing an intersection on her way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>the insured vehicle, \u201cwas not a \u2018person [injured] while in or entering into or alighting from an insured motor vehicle.\u2019 (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(Menchaca v. Farmers Insurance Exchange </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 117, 129 [130 Cal.Rptr. 607].) Relying on the principles enunciated in Cocking, the court stated that \u201calthough in the present case [the injured woman] testified that she <em>intended </em>to proceed directly to her car from the movie theater, her injuries did not result from her being in close proximity to the car or from her performance of acts \u2018physically and directly related to the car\u2019 or its use. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">In this case, as a result of the initial accident, Ruiz temporarily abandoned his employer\u2019s truck and intended to exchange information with the driver of Group Manufacturing\u2019s van before returning to the truck. The fact that he had good reason to leave the immediate vicinity of the truck does not support judicial expansion of the term \u201cupon\u201d beyond its commonsensical meaning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">At some distance, an individual who exits a vehicle is no longer \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle in even a physical sense. Ruiz was approximately 200 feet, about two-thirds of a football field, away from the truck at the time he was struck by the underinsured motorist. Such a distance in no way qualifies as close proximity to the Fast UnderCar truck and a contrary conclusion would strain the meaning of the word \u201cupon.\u201d \u201cWords used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning which a layman would ordinarily attach to them.
