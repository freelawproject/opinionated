J.</author>\n<p id=\"amr-dedup-0\">Defendant and petitioner D\u2019Orsay International Partners (D\u2019Orsay) seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to enter an order releasing a mechanic\u2019s lien filed by plaintiff and real party in interest Jeffrey C. Stone doing business as Summit Builders (Summit) without requiring D\u2019Orsay to post a release bond in lieu of the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The trial court granted D\u2019Orsay\u2019s motion for release of the mechanic\u2019s lien but conditioned the order upon the posting of a statutory bond in the amount of $1.27 million, one and a half times the amount of the lien. We conclude the trial court\u2019s ruling was error and that it should have released the lien outright. For a mechanic\u2019s lien to attach, there must be \u201cactual visible work on the land or the delivery of construction materials thereto.\u201d <em>(Walker v. Lytton Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 152, 157 [84 Cal.Rptr. 521] (hereafter, <em>Walker).) </em>Here, that precondition to the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien was not met. Therefore, we grant D\u2019Orsay\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">D\u2019Orsay is the successor to Long Beach Plaza Associates (LBPA), a California general partnership, and the record titleholder to certain real property in Long Beach. LBPA was formed for the purpose of constructing a new 176-room hotel/retail development complex, including onsite subterranean parking (the project).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In April 2001, D\u2019Orsay entered into an agreement with Summit, a licensed general contractor, for construction of the project. In the next two years, Summit provided approximately $850,000 in design related services, both by performing design and planning services, and by hiring design professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">However, construction never commenced. A prerequisite to the start of construction was the securing of adequate financing. D\u2019Orsay attempted to obtain financing, without success. No building permit was issued for the project. No building materials were delivered to the project site. No actual visible construction or other work was conducted at the project site by Summit or by anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">On May 5, 2003, Summit recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien with the county registrar-recorder in the amount of $846,434.26 against D\u2019Orsay\u2019s real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">On August 1, 2003, Summit filed suit in the superior court, alleging various causes of action including breach of contract and seeking foreclosure of its mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>On February 18, 2004, D\u2019Orsay filed a motion for release of the mechanic\u2019s lien. D\u2019Orsay contended good cause existed for removal of the mechanic\u2019s lien in that in order to assert a mechanic\u2019s lien, a claimant must have made a direct, permanent contribution to a work of improvement, and because Summit never improved the subject property, as a matter of law Summit had no basis for maintaining the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In opposition, Summit argued, inter alia, a lien for design services is specifically authorized under Civil Code section 3081.2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it is immaterial that design services are performed by a licensed contractor, rather than by a design professional such as an architect, engineer or land surveyor.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Summit also contended that its lien was proper irrespective of the lack of work on the ground because an owner cannot defeat a lien by refusing to go ahead with construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">On March 16, 2004, the matter came on for hearing and was taken under submission. Later that day, the trial court issued a minute order stating \u201c[D\u2019Orsay\u2019s] Motion for Release of Lien is granted upon the posting of a bond in the amount of $1,270,000.00.\u201d The ruling does not set forth the trial court\u2019s rationale for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On April 12, 2004, D\u2019Orsay filed the instant petition for writ of mandate, seeking an order directing Summit\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien be released outright, without requiring the posting of a bond. This court issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">D\u2019Orsay contends contractors providing design services are not entitled to assert mechanics\u2019 liens in the absence of actual commencement of construction and the doctrine of owner prevention of completion is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Summit asserts it was entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien; no actual contribution of labor or materials to the site was necessary in order for Summit to assert a lien for various services it rendered pursuant to the contract, namely, project design and management and obtaining permits and bonds; and the statutory scheme authorizing design professionals\u2019 liens (\u00a7 3081.1 et seq.) applies equally to a contractor such as Summit, which furnished design/planning services and hired design professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">1. <em>The lien filed by Summit was a mechanic\u2019s lien, not a design professional\u2019s lien. Therefore, Summit\u2019s reliance on the design professional\u2019s lien law, which authorizes the filing of a design lien despite the lack of commencement of construction, to allow the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien despite the lack of commencement of construction, is misplaced.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">a. <em>The statutory scheme authorizing design professionals\u2019 liens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In 1990, the Legislature added a new chapter 8 to title 14 of the Civil Code providing for design professionals\u2019 liens. The newly created lien is not a mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The chapter is denominated \u201cDesign Professionals\u2019 Liens,\u201d and constitutes \u201cthe exclusive lien remedy for design professionals <em>in cases where no actual construction of the planned work of improvement is commenced prior to recordation of the notice of lien </em>. . . .\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 1615, \u00a7 2, p. 7788, italics added.) The design professional\u2019s lien remedy is separate and distinct and \u201cdoes not affect the ability of a design professional to obtain a mechanic\u2019s lien pursuant to Title 15\u201d (\u00a7 3081.6), provided the claimant can meet the criteria for a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">With respect to the circumstances giving rise to a design professional\u2019s hen, section 3081.2 states in pertinent part: \u201cA design professional shall, from the date of recordation pursuant to Section 3081.3, have a lien upon the real property for which the work of improvement is planned to be constructed, <em>notwithstanding the absence of commencement of actual construction of the planned work of improvement, </em>if the landowner contracted for the design professional\u2019s services and is also the owner of the real property at the time of recordation of the lien.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The term \u201cdesign professional\u201d is defined in section 3081.1, which states: \u201cFor purposes of this chapter, \u2018design professional\u2019 means any certificated architect, registered professional engineer, or licensed land surveyor who furnishes services pursuant to a written contract with a landowner for the design, engineering, or planning of a work of improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>b. <em>Summit\u2019s reliance on the design professional\u2019s lien statutes is misplaced because Summit did not file a design professional\u2019s lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Summit did not purport to file a design professional\u2019s lien. Rather, Summit filed a mechanic\u2019s lien. Further, Summit acknowledges that no work has commenced at the project site. However, Summit relies on the design professional\u2019s lien statutes, which enable design professionals to obtain a lien <em>\u201cnotwithstanding the absence of commencement of actual construction of the planned work of improvement\u201d </em>(\u00a7 3081.2, italics added), to argue that \u201cCalifornia public policy\u201d supports the protection of design/planning work. Summit asserts it is entitled to no less protection under the mechanic\u2019s hen law (\u00a7 3110) than any design professional would be entitled under the design professional\u2019s lien law (\u00a7 3081.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Summit\u2019s effort to import design professional\u2019s lien principles into the mechanic\u2019s lien law is unavailing. The lien in issue is a mechanic\u2019s lien and therefore must be scrutinized pursuant to the criteria applicable to mechanics\u2019 liens. That analysis follows.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">2. <em>Because work on the ground did not commence, Summit could not assert a mechanic\u2019s lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">a. <em>The pertinent mechanic\u2019s lien statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Section 3110 sets forth the persons entitled to the protection of a mechanic\u2019s lien, stating: \u201cMechanics, materialmen, contractors, subcontractors, lessors of equipment, artisans, architects, registered engineers, licensed land surveyors, machinists, builders, teamsters, and draymen, and all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon or bestowing skill or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>necessary services on, or furnishing materials or leasing equipment to be used or consumed in or furnishing appliances, teams, or power contributing to a work of improvement shall have a lien <em>upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished materials </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">b. <em>The requirement of commencement of construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The \u201cgeneral rule is that [a mechanic\u2019s lien] does not attach unless and until <em>construction </em>has been undertaken by the doing of actual visible work on the land or the delivery of construction materials thereto.\u201d <em>(Walker, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 156-157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u201cThe rationale for the ground-work requirement is twofold. First, under section 3128 of the California Civil Code, a mechanic\u2019s lien attaches to the work of improvement and the land on which it is situated; if no work of improvement has commenced, there is nothing upon which the lien can attach. [Citation.] Second, actual visible work on the land notifies potential lenders that mechanic\u2019s liens have arisen. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Morrell </em>(Bankr. N.D.Cal. 1984) 42 B.R. 973, 976 (hereafter, <em>Morrell).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">c. <em>Morrell adopts a rule that against an owner who prevents commencement of construction, no actual or visible work is necessary for an architect to attach a mechanic\u2019s lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The <em>Morrell </em>court was confronted with an issue as to whether an architectural firm had a valid mechanic\u2019s lien when, due to the fault of the owner, no construction ever commenced on the property against which the lien was asserted. <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at pp. 974\u2014975.) <em>Morrell </em>acknowledged California\u2019s general rule that a mechanic\u2019s lien attaches upon commencement of work on the ground <em>(id., </em>at p. 976), but it found a 1915 Minnesota case, <em>Lamoreaux </em>v. <em>Andersch </em>(1915) 128 Minn. 261 [150 N.W. 908] (hereafter, <em>Lamoreaux), </em>was analogous. <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at p. 977.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">In <em>Lamoreaux, </em>an architect drew up plans for an improvement, but the owners of the property refused to proceed with the construction and repudiated the architect\u2019s contract. The <em>Lamoreaux </em>court concluded it would be inequitable to permit the owner to defeat the architect\u2019s right to a lien. <em>Lamoreaux </em>explained, \u201c[I]t is rather hard on those who have performed labor or furnished material in reliance upon the lien statute if the owner can defeat their liens by refusing to go on with the building.\u201d <em>(Lamoreaux, supra, </em>150 N.W. at p. 911.) <em>Lamoreaux </em>therefore held that an architect who has completed lienable work may attach a lien as against the interest of the owner of the property, even if there has been no work on the ground. <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at p. 977.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>Morrell </em>noted that several California courts had considered <em>Lamoreaux, </em>but, due to differing factual situations, none had explicitly adopted or rejected that decision. <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at pp. 977-978, discussing <em>Nolte v. Smith </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 140, 148-149 [11 Cal.Rptr. 261]; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Filice </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 613, 620-621 [60 Cal.Rptr. 832]; <em>Tracy Price Associates v. Hebard </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 778, 786-787 [72 Cal.Rptr. 600]; <em>Walker, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 157.) <em>Morrell </em>found \u201cCalifornia precedents do not maintain that for a lien to be enforceable against the interest of an owner, actual work on the ground must begin. Rather, they only hold that commencement of construction is a condition precedent to giving a mechanic\u2019s lien priority over subsequent liens and encumbrances. In the present case, there is no question of priorities; appellee seeks a lien only against the interest of appellant, successor in interest to debtor. Application of <em>Lamoreaux </em>is therefore appropriate in this case.\u201d <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at p. 978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><em>Morrell </em>concluded: \u201cIt would be manifestly unjust to deny an architect a lien because the person with whom the architect contracted has prevented the work that raises the lien. Architects have little or no control over the construction of their designs; they can do nothing themselves to begin work on the ground to make their liens valid. Consequently, this court adopts the holding of <em>Lamoreaux, </em>and rules that as against an owner who prevents commencement of a work of improvement, no actual or visible work on the ground is necessary for an architect to attach a mechanic\u2019s lien if the lienable work is completed.\u201d <em>(Morrell, supra, </em>42 B.R. at p. 979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">d. <em>Morrell is superseded by statute; owner prevention exception to mechanic\u2019s lien requirement of commencement of construction is no longer operative.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In 1990, six years after <em>Morrell </em>was decided, the Legislature enacted the design professional\u2019s lien law. The key provision for our purposes is section 3081.2, which states: \u201cA design professional shall, from the date of recordation pursuant to Section 3081.3, have a lien upon the real property for which the work of improvement is planned to be constructed, <em>notwithstanding the absence of commencement of actual construction of the planned work of improvement, </em>if the landowner contracted for the design professional\u2019s services and is also the owner of the real property at the time of recordation of the lien.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In adopting the design professional\u2019s lien law, the Legislature declared its intent as follows: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature to establish the exclusive lien remedy for design professionals in cases where no actual construction of the planned work of improvement is commenced prior to recordation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>notice of lien, <em>and to thereby disapprove and supplant any lien remedy provided by the court decision of In re Morrell (D.C. 1984) 42 Bankrupt-cyRep. 973\u201d </em>(Stats. 1990, ch. 1615, \u00a7 2, p. 7788, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Thus, the Legislature rejected <em>Morrell\u2019s </em>holding that as against an owner who prevents commencement of construction, no actual or visible work on the ground is necessary for an architect to attach a mechanic\u2019s lien. Instead, the Legislature established the remedy of a design professional\u2019s lien, to enable a design professional to assert a lien \u201cnotwithstanding the absence of commencement of actual construction of the planned work of improvement ____\u201d (\u00a7 3081.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In creating the remedy of the design professional\u2019s lien, the Legislature lessened the burden of a design professional by eliminating <em>Morrell\u2019s </em>requirement that some conduct on the part of the owner prevented the commencement of construction. At the same time, the Legislature eliminated <em>Morrell\u2019s </em>\u201cowner prevention\u201d exception to the general rule that a mechanic\u2019s lien cannot attach until there is actual visible work on the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In sum, the rule remains that for a mechanic\u2019s lien to attach, there must be \u201cactual visible work on the land or the delivery of construction materials thereto.\u201d <em>(Walker, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">e. <em>Because construction did not commence, D\u2019Orsay is entitled to release of Summit\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Here, it is undisputed that no actual visible work was commenced at the project site and no materials were delivered to the site. As a consequence, Summit was not entitled to assert a mechanic\u2019s lien against D\u2019Orsay\u2019s real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In an attempt to avoid the mechanic\u2019s lien requirement of commencement of actual visible work on the land, Summit asserts that D\u2019Orsay \u201ccould not or would not allow Summit to complete the work.\u201d That exception, which was given credence by <em>Morrell, </em>was disapproved and supplanted by the design professional\u2019s lien law, as explained above. (Stats. 1990, ch. 1615, \u00a7 2, p. 7788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">For these reasons, D\u2019Orsay was entitled to an unconditional grant of its motion to release Summit\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">The order to show cause is discharged. The petition for writ of mandate is granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>vacate its order granting D\u2019Orsay\u2019s motion for release of Summit\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on the condition that D\u2019Orsay post a bond of $1,270,000, and to enter a new and different order granting D\u2019Orsay\u2019s motion to release the mechanic\u2019s lien outright without requiring the posting of a bond. D\u2019Orsay is awarded its costs in this proceeding. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 56.4(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Croskey, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 26, 2005. George, C. J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-11\">All further statutory references are to the Civil Code, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The mechanic\u2019s lien law is contained in title 15 of the Civil Code (\u00a7 3109 et seq.), while design professionals\u2019 liens are provided for in title 14 thereof (\u00a7\u00a7 3081.1-3081.10 inclusive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In enacting the design professional\u2019s lien law, the Legislature sought to protect architects, registered engineers and land surveyors (\u00a7 3081.1), professionals whose services are performed in anticipation of and in preparation for actual construction. Summit contends, and it is arguable, the rationale supporting design professional\u2019s lien rights applies equally to <em>contractors </em>that perform design/planning services and/or hire design professionals to do such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">However, a leading treatise rejects such an interpretation and reads the design professional\u2019s lien statutes literally, stating: \u201cThe design professionals lien is available only to certified architects, registered professional engineers, and licensed land surveyors who furnish their services pursuant to a written contract with a landowner. . . . [J] . . . HD The law, although it grants lien rights, . . , applies only to certified architects and registered engineers and licensed land surveyors <em>(thereby excluding, for example, a contractor with a design-build contract).\u201d </em>(Acret, California Construction Law Manual (5th ed.) \u00a7 6.52, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Because the lien presented for our consideration is a mechanic\u2019s lien, not a design professional\u2019s lien, we do not have occasion to pass upon whether a <em>contractor </em>performing design services or employing design professionals may assert a design professional\u2019s lien. That question will have to wait for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
