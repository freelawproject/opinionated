We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Joseph Goyette died in 2001. He had no spouse or children when he died. He was survived by his cousins, sisters Joanne Ramos, Eleanor Harkey, and Kathryn Ramey. Over the years, Harkey and her sisters lived next door to Goyette. Harkey lived there until the date of Goyette\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Goyette\u2019s holographic will states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cI wish to leave to James Hayward Fifty percent of my money and Fifty percent of my money to my neighbor and friend Vi York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cI wish to leave James Hayward the lot across the street from my home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u201cI wish to leave Vi York my home and the lots around it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">At the time of his death, Goyette\u2019s estate (appraised at $742,196.85) was comprised of the following assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">\u2014Retirement savings accounts,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_u\">checking and savings accounts, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">certificates of deposit $231,480.92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">\u2014Money market account $81,878.64</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">\u2014Fidelity U.S. Government Reserves Fund $9,576.14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ai-dedup-0\">\u2014United States treasury bills $304,183.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"am-dedup-0\">\u2014Unites States savings bonds $25,627.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMR\">\u2014Real property $78,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIe\">-\u2014Miscellaneous personal property $10,950.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">The court appointed Goyette\u2019s cousin, Joanne Ramos, as the administrator of his estate. In her \u201cFirst &amp; Final Report of Administration; Petition for Final Distribution; Allowance of Statutory Attorney\u2019s and Administrator\u2019s Compensation,\u201d Ramos sought permission to distribute all of the above assets and the miscellaneous personal property located on the real property to James Hayward and Vivian York.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Subsequently, Ramos filed a petition for instructions from the court as to what assets constituted \u201c \u2018money\u2019. . . distributable to Vivian York and James Hayward and what assets, if any, are \u2018residue\u2019 distributable to the heirs\u201d under the law of intestacy. Ramos eventually withdrew that initial petition for instructions but later filed a second petition for instructions requesting that the court determine which of Goyette\u2019s assets constituted \u201cmy money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">York and Hayward argued \u201cmy money\u201d meant all of Goyette\u2019s wealth. In response, Harkey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argued \u201cmy money\u201d referred only to \u201cfunds (or medium of exchange, i.e. cash or cash equivalents).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On October 29, 2003, the trial court concluded that the following assets constituted \u201cmy money\u201d and were distributable to York and Hayward: (a) the retirement savings accounts; (b) checking and savings accounts; (c) certificates of deposit; (c) the money market account; (d) the Fidelity U.S. Government Reserves Fund; (e) the United States treasury bills; and (f) the United States savings bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u201cA will must be construed according to the intention of the testator as expressed therein, and this intention must be given effect if possible. Each case depends on its own particular facts and precedents are of small value.\u201d <em>(Estate of Stadler </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 709, 711 [2 Cal.Rptr. 515].) Stated another way, \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe paramount rule in the construction of wills, to which all other rules must yield, is that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator as expressed therein, and this intention must be given effect as far as possible.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Verdisson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1135 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 363].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Probate Code section 21122 guides the interpretation of wills: \u201cThe words of an instrument are to be given their ordinary and grammatical meaning unless the intention to use them in another sense is clear and their intended meaning can be ascertained. Technical words are not necessary to give effect to a disposition in an instrument. Technical words are to be considered as having been used in their technical sense unless (a) the context clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>indicates a contrary intention or (b) it satisfactorily appears that the instrument was drawn solely by the transferor and that the transferor was unacquainted with the technical sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s construction of a will, we are free to independently interpret the instrument as a matter of law <em>unless </em>the trial court\u2019s interpretation turned upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence or required resolution of a conflict in the evidence. [Citations.] \u2018The possibility that conflicting inferences can be drawn from uncontroverted evidence does not relieve the appellate court of its duty independently to interpret the instrument; it is only when the issue turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence, or requires resolution of a conflict in that evidence, that the trial court[\u2019s] determination is binding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Verdisson, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1135-1136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>\u201cMy Money\u201d Meant Goyette\u2019s Financial Assets</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Harkey argues the trial court erred in its ruling because \u201cthe term \u2018money\u2019 as used in Goyette\u2019s will includes only cash and bank accounts; it does not include investments.\u201d We reject this argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\n<em>Case Law Concerning \u201cMoney\u201d Shows That Term, Standing Alone, Is Ambiguous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Several California cases have addressed the issue of what a testator means when he or she uses the term \u201cmoney\u201d in a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">In <em>Estate of Stadler, </em>the testatrix left specific bequests to several beneficiaries and concluded her will with the phrase, \u201cDivide the rest between Hoemers &amp; Chas Fischer (money left over when Settled.[)]\u201d <em>(Estate of Stadler, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.2d at p. 711.) The question was whether the phrase \u201cmoney left over when Settled\u201d included the testatrix\u2019s real property, which was otherwise not mentioned in the will. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court stated, \u201c \u2018The word \u201cmoney\u201d used in wills is essentially ambiguous. [Citation.] In a bequest it means money and money only, unless there is in the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>will something to indicate that the testator intended a more extended meaning. [Citation.] When used in a will it has no fixed or technical meaning, but is a term of flexible scope having either a restricted or a wide meaning according to the signification which the testator intended to give the word, and may be used to mean cash only, personal property, or even wealth\u2014that is, property of any kind that may be converted into cash. [Citations.] Where the context of a will discloses the intent of the testator to attribute to the word \u201cmoney\u201d a specific meaning which is more comprehensive than the meaning ordinarily given to it, that meaning will be adopted and may comprehend any class of property defined by the context. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 712.) The court concluded the testatrix used the term \u201cmoney\u201d in its most flexible sense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 713.) The court concluded that it was doubtful the testator understood the distinction between different types of property and that because she made a will it evidenced her intention not to die intestate. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 712-713.) Further, the fact that the will was silent about bonds and a promissory note she owned was an indication she did not distinguish between \u201cmoney\u201d and other types of property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Similarly, in <em>Estate of Whitney </em>(1958) 162 Cal.App.2d 860, 862-863 [329 P.2d 104], the court attempted to determine the testator\u2019s intent in the will that directed the executor to \u201csee that money from the estate be tythed to the amount of twenty-five per cent and given\u201d to three named charities. The cash in the testatrix\u2019s estate at the time was $138.98, while the entire estate was worth $21,014.98. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.) The court concluded \u201cmoney\u201d meant the sum total value of the estate, and not merely the cash in the testatrix\u2019s bank accounts at the time of her death. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 867-868.) The court concluded the will reflected that the testatrix knew what her assets were based on her description of those items in her other bequests. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 865.) Further, the use of the terms \u201cmoney <em>from </em>[the] estate\u201d and \u201ctythed,\u201d and the use of a residuary clause that left the residue to her grandson, evidenced her desire to include the total value of the estate in determining the amount to provide to the three charities. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 865-866, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">A more restrictive meaning of the term \u201cmoney\u201d was applied in <em>Estate of Boyle </em>(1934) 2 Cal.App.2d 234, 236 [37 P.2d 841], where the court concluded that \u00e1 bequest of \u201c \u2018 \u201c[A]ll other money I may die possessed of after all my bills are paid\u201d \u2019 \u201d did not include corporate stock in the testatrix\u2019s estate. The court stated, \u201cThere is no doubt that the word \u2018money\u2019 when taken in its ordinary and grammatical sense does not include corporate stocks. Thompson on Wills, section 215 says, \u2018In its usual and ordinary acceptance it means, gold, silver, or paper money used as a circulating medium of exchange, and does not embrace notes, bonds, evidence of debt, or other personal or real estate, and this popular and well understood meaning should be given to the word when used in a will, unless from a consideration of the entire instrument it was intended by the testator to have a broader meaning to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>include notes, bonds and other securities.\u2019 Also in 18 Ruling Case Law, at page 1270, we find the following: \u2018Where there is nothing in a will calling for a construction of the word \u201cmoney\u201d in any other than its popular and legal meaning it will be confined to gold and silver and other circulating medium of the country, whether in the personal possession of the testator or deposited in the bank.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Similarly, in <em>Estate of Verdisson, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at page 1131, the court examined a will, which stated, \u201c \u20181) I leave my properties to Edwin Nowak. [][] 2) I leave my money to Lawrence Kesselring. [][] 3) I leave my pets to Mr. Wardaman [Vardanian] and $20,000.00 to take care of them upon my death.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.) In this instance, the court ascertained that \u201cmoney\u201d did not include the testatrix\u2019s interest in an open-ended federally regulated investment company. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1139.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Other Relevant Canons of Construction of Wills Support the Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Given the inherent ambiguity of the term \u201cmoney,\u201d we must turn to other rules of construction to assist us in determining what Goyette meant in his will. The fact that he made a will raises the presumption that he intended to dispose of all of his property. <em>(Estate of O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 531.) Further, as stated in <em>Estate of O\u2019Connell, </em>at pages 531-532, \u201cOnce the testamentary scheme or general intention [of a will] is discovered, the meaning of particular words and phrases is to be subordinated to this scheme, plan or dominant purpose . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Here, we ascertain from the will\u2019s face a general scheme to benefit York and Hayward. The will names these two beneficiaries only and singles them out to receive all of Goyette\u2019s real property, and his \u201cmoney.\u201d In line with this general scheme, it makes sense that his use of the term \u201cmy money\u201d includes all of Goyette\u2019s financial assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Goyette\u2019s will also shows Goyette\u2019s lack of legal sophistication. His bequests of his real property do not identify that real property in any technical or legal sense. He bequeathed \u201cthe lot across the street from [his] home\u201d and \u201c[his] home and the lots around it.\u201d Like the court in <em>Estate of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Stadler, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.2d at pages 712-713, we conclude this lack of legal sophistication supports the conclusion that Goyette used the term \u201cmy money\u201d in its most flexible sense to include all of his financial assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">This interpretation is also consistent with the rule that prefers a construction of a term of a will that avoids complete or partial intestacy. <em>(Estate of Verdisson, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1137.) It is the strongly favored policy of the law that wills be construed in a manner that avoids intestacy. To this end, Probate Code section 21120 provides, \u201cThe words of an instrument are to receive an interpretation that will give every expression some effect, rather than one that will render any of the expressions inoperative. Preference is to be given to an interpretation of an instrument that will prevent intestacy or failure of a transfer, rather than one that will result in an intestacy or failure of a transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Here, if we were to construe \u201cmy money\u201d to mean only Goyette\u2019s bank accounts and not the other financial assets, the treasury bills, money market account, and savings bonds, then almost 50 percent of his estate would pass to the cousins through the law of intestacy. Under the construction placed on the term \u201cmy money\u201d by the trial court, less than 1 percent of the estate\u2019s assets will pass in that manner. Given the preference for an interpretation that avoids intestacy, we find no error in the court\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Harkey argues the presumption against intestacy does not apply where the testator clearly intended that partial intestacy result, citing <em>Estate of Verdis-son, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at page 1137, footnote 4. As explained by <em>Estate of Beldon </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 108, 112 [77 P.2d 1052], \u201cA court\u2019s inquiry in construing a will is limited to ascertaining what the testator meant by the language which was used. If he used language which results in intestacy, and there can be no doubt about the meaning of the language which was used, the court must hold that intestacy was intended. A testator has the right to make a will which does not dispose of all of his property but leaves a residue to pass to his heirs under the law of succession. Such a will is not the usual one but when the language which leads to that result is clear the will must be given effect accordingly.\u201d Here, we find nothing in his will that constitutes a clear expression of Goyette\u2019s intent that his financial assets pass by intestate succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Given the ambiguity in the term \u201cmy money,\u201d the readily apparent scheme in the will to benefit Hayward and York, and the preference against the estate passing through intestacy whenever possible, we conclude the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>court correctly concluded the term \u201cmy money\u201d included all of Goyette\u2019s financial assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>The Prior Wills Were Not Properly Before the Trial Court</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The judgment is affirmed.

As a result, she presented legal authorities, but did not present an argument to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-13\">We are troubled by Harkey\u2019s arguments that \u201cmoney\u201d does not include <em>\u201cstocks, </em>bonds, and other investments\u201d or <em>\u201cstocks </em>and other securities\u201d or \u201cstocks.\u201d Goyette\u2019s estate is devoid of any stocks. Thus, we find Harkey\u2019s argument that \u201cmoney\u201d does not include <em>stocks </em>is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We find other cases cited by Harkey discussing what the term \u201ccash\u201d means in a will bequest to be unhelpful here. (See, e.g., <em>Estate of Chamberlain </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 16, 20 [115 P.2d 235] [cash does not include savings bonds]; <em>Estate of O\u2019Connell </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 526 [105 Cal.Rptr. 590] [cash includes a certificate of deposit].) The relevant term in Goyette\u2019s will is \u201cmy money,\u201d not \u201ccash.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Hayward and York do not argue \u201cmy money\u201d includes the other items of personal property; therefore, we express no opinion as to whether those assets would also be included in this bequest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
