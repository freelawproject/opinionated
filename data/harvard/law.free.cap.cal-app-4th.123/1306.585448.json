(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">On appeal, defendant claims the trial court erred by instructing the jury that \u201cmasturbation\u201d may be accomplished through clothing, without touching bare skin. Defendant also challenges the SVPA\u2019s definition of \u201cmental disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">L BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">In September of 1990, defendant was sentenced to prison for two counts of committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a).) The two victims were brothers Raul and Gerardo S.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Raul was 11 or 12 years old at the time of the incidents; Gerardo was nine years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The charges stemmed from an incident on June 15, 1990. Defendant had driven to the boys\u2019 house and asked to take them to a party. Instead, he took them to his apartment. According to Raul, who was \u201ca little embarrassed,\u201d defendant grabbed Raul\u2019s penis over his clothing. However, according to Gerardo, defendant had touched the bare skin of Raul\u2019s penis. Gerardo stated that defendant then did the same thing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Defendant was released from prison in May of 1993. About a year later, in June of 1994, defendant approached 15-year-old Mark. Defendant asked Mark to come work at his beauty salon. When Mark complained of back pain, defendant gave Mark a massage. Mark was naked, and during the massage defendant touched Mark\u2019s penis and testicles. As a result of this incident, defendant was arrested and his parole was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">In 2000, defendant was arrested for failure to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">On December 3, 2001, the District Attorney of Santa Clara County filed a petition to commit defendant under the SVPA. On March 11, 2002, the trial court found probable cause to believe that defendant was likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his release from custody. On May 23, 2003, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>probable cause finding and reopen the probable cause hearing. On June 25, 2003, the trial court held a further probable cause hearing and set the matter for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">At trial, Dr. Douglas Korpi, a clinical psychologist, testified. Dr. Korpi had assessed defendant in November of 2001. He diagnosed defendant as suffering from paraphilia, a sexual disorder, with a particular interest in male children.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Dr. Jack Vognsen, another psychologist, had also assessed defendant and concluded that he suffered from paraphilia \u201cwith an attraction to having sex with children or nonconsenting adolescents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Joseph testified about an uncharged incident that occurred in 1990, when he was 19 years old. Joseph had only recently come forward to report the incident. He had woken up in the middle of the night to find defendant orally copulating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Defendant testified at trial. He denied touching Raul or Gerardo on the penis. He had pleaded no contest to the charges pursuant to advice from his attorney. Defendant also denied touching Mark\u2019s penis. He claimed that Mark was fully dressed during the massage. Finally, defendant denied having any sexual contact with Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Dr. Robert Hal\u00f3n, a psychologist, testified for the defense. He did not believe that defendant suffered from a mental disorder that caused volitional impairment and serious difficulty controlling his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The jury found defendant to be a sexually violent predator. The trial court committed him to the Department of Mental Health for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">n. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"acf-dedup-0\">A. <em>Definition of Masturbation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600, subdivision (a)(1) defines the term \u201c \u2018sexually violent predator\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines the term \u201c \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe following acts when committed by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, and that are committed on, before, or after the effective date of this article and result in a conviction or a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, as provided in subdivision (a): a felony violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261, paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 262, Section 264.1, subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 288, or subdivision (a) of Section 289 of the Penal Code, or sodomy or oral copulation in violation of Section 286 or 288a of the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Section 6600.1 provides; \u201c(a) If the victim of an underlying offense that is specified in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 is a child under the age of 14 and the offending act or acts involved substantial sexual conduct, the offense shall constitute a \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 for purposes of Section 6600. [][] (b) \u2018Substantial sexual conduct\u2019 means penetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by the penis of the other or by any foreign object, oral copulation, or masturbation of either the victim or the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">During trial, the People submitted a motion to instruct the jury that \u201cmasturbation\u201d as used in section 6600.l\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d includes genital touching that is accomplished over the victim\u2019s clothing. Defendant submitted opposition to the motion, arguing that \u201cmasturbation\u201d must involve touching of bare skin. Defendant also brought a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no evidence he touched any of the victims\u2019 bare skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, explaining: \u201cI reviewed the cases cited by both sides on the issue. I do not believe that the term \u2018masturbation,\u2019 as used for these purposes, is limited to skin to skin contact. I think that would fly in the face of the purpose of the law, and the reason why we have this law.\u201d The trial court further stated that it would come up with an appropriate jury instruction by the end of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The trial court ultimately defined masturbation as follows: \u201cMasturbation means any touching or contact, however slight, of the genitals of either the victim or the offender, with the requisite specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual desires of either party, [f] To constitute masturbation, it is not necessary that the bare skin be touched. The touching may be through the clothing of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>Defendant contends the above instruction was erroneous because it permitted the jury to find that his prior offenses involved \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d based on evidence that he touched the minors\u2019 genitals through their clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In <em>People v. Chambless </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 773, 783 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 444], the court concluded that \u201cthe definition of masturbation under the Act encompasses any touching or contact, however slight, of the genitals of either the victim or the offender, with the requisite intent . . . .\u201d The <em>Chambless </em>court did not consider whether such touching had to involve contact with the victim or offender\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In <em>People v. Whitlock </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 456, 463 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 389], the court considered the exact issue presented in the instant case and concluded that \u201c[n]either <em>Chambless </em>nor the SVPA requires the touching or contact of bare skin. <em>Chambless </em>repeatedly refers to masturbation as <em>any </em>genital touching. [Citation.] The focus is not on the amount of the contact but rather whether genital contact was made. [Citation.] Whether the genital touching occurs over clothing is not determinative. Masturbation as it is defined in <em>Chambless </em>and is commonly understood can occur under clothing and over clothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The court in <em>Whitlock </em>further found that a \u201cskin-to-skin requirement would be contrary to the \u2018Legislature\u2019s express intent to provide additional protection under the [SVPA] for underage children from those \u201cpredispose[d] ... to the commission of criminal sexual acts.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] Children are particularly vulnerable to sex offenders. Requiring skin-to-skin contact for qualifying prior convictions would not advance the Legislature\u2019s purpose of protecting children.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitlock, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Defendant argues that <em>Whitlock </em>was wrongly decided. He points out that in every other published case involving issues relating to \u201csubstantial sexual conduct,\u201d there was evidence of skin-to-skin touching. However, \u201c[t]he lack of case law on this point may simply indicate that the question has not come up before in this particular context.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitlock, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Defendant contends that the Legislature could have specified that \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d includes masturbation accomplished through the clothing of the victim or offender. He notes that in 1992, 1993, and 1994, the Legislature considered, but rejected, amendments to Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (b) to include such a definition. However, the Legisla-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>hire\u2019s failure to pass the proposed amendments is not determinative of whether the term \u201cmasturbation\u201d included touching accomplished through clothing. The Legislature may have rejected the proposed statutory amendments for any number of reasons. \u201cIn construing statutes, it is generally more fruitful to examine what the Legislature has done than what it has not done. [Citation.] \u2018[Legislative inaction is a weak reed upon which to lean . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 59, 77 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 233, 851 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We agree with the court in <em>Whitlock </em>that the term \u201cmasturbation\u201d includes any touching or contact of the genitals of either the victim or the offender, <em>whether over or under clothing, </em>with the requisite intent. Skin-to-skin contact is not required. We also agree with the <em>Whitlock </em>court\u2019s observation that a \u201cskin-to-skin requirement would be contrary to the \u2018Legislature\u2019s express intent to provide additional protection under the [SVPA] for underage children from those \u201cpredispose[d] ... to the commission of criminal sexual acts.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Whitlock, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury when it told the jury that \u201c[t]o constitute masturbation, it is not necessary that the bare skin be touched. The touching may be through the clothing of the child.\u201d Moreover, the record contains evidence that defendant <em>did </em>touch the skin of each victim\u2019s penis. Although Raul denied that skin-to-skin contact occurred, his brother Gerardo asserted that defendant did touch both of them on the skin. The evidence showed that Raul was embarrassed when making the report. Dr. Korpi testified that it is common for a victim to be reluctant to provide such \u201clurid details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Defendant presents an alternative argument: that the SVPA\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because it fails to define \u201cmasturbation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">\u201c[A] law that is \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 not only fails to provide adequate notice to those who must observe its strictures, but also \u2018impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to police [officers], judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1090, 1116 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d <em>211, </em>929 P.2d 596], quoting <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294].) However, a \u201cstatute will not be held void for vagueness \u2018if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language or if its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People ex rel. Gallo, </em>at p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In <em>People v. Chambless, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at page 784, the court noted that there was no \u201clegal definition for the term \u2018masturbation.\u2019 Rather, such word appears to have been used simply in its commonly understood meaning to describe the touching of one\u2019s own or another\u2019s private parts without quantitative requirement for purposes of defining conduct that was lewd or sexually motivated.\u201d The court farther noted that \u201cthe word \u2018masturbation is defined in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (Third College ed. 1988) page 833 as a manipulation of \u201cone\u2019s own genitals, or the genitals of (another) for sexual gratification.\u201d \u2019 The American Heritage Dictionary (new college ed. 1981) at page 805 defines masturbation as \u2018[e]xcitation of the genital organs ... by means other than sexual intercourse.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Defendant takes issue with the <em>Chambless </em>court\u2019s conclusion that there is a \u201ccommonly understood meaning\u201d for the term \u201cmasturbation.\u201d He cites to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1986) 21 MJ. 353, a United States Military Court decision that lists several additional definitions of the term. That court stated: \u201c[M]asturbation is defined as \u2018 [s]elf-stimulation of the genital organs for purposes of sexual pleasure.\u2019 II R. Goldenson, Ph.D., <em>The Encyclopedia of Human Behavior: Psychology, Psychiatry, and Mental Health </em>754 (1970). It is also defined as \u2018the induction of erection and the obtaining of sexual satisfaction, in either sex, from manual or other artificial mechanical stimulation of the genitals.\u2019 H. English &amp; A. English, <em>A Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms </em>306 (1958). In <em>Commonwealth v. Gary, </em>193 Pa.Super. 111, 163 A.2d 696, 697 (1960), the definition of masturbation from <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>(2d ed.), was quoted as follows: \u2018to perform masturbation of (self or passive subject); to practice sexual self-gratification; production of an orgasm by excitation of the genital organs, as by manipulation or friction, without heterosexual intercourse.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v. Ramirez, supra, </em>21 M.J. at pp. 354-355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Defendant claims that \u201cthe use of terms like \u2018manipulation\u2019 and \u2018excitation\u2019 \u201d in the dictionary definitions \u201ctend[s] to suggest that something more than slight touching over clothing is contemplated.\u201d We disagree. Words such as \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cexcitation\u201d do not provide the basis for including a quantitative element to the amount of touching that would constitute masturbation. Moreover, since the instruction in this case told the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>the touching had to be done with the \u201crequisite specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual desires of either party,\u201d the component of manipulation or excitation was acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The definitions of the term \u201cmasturbation\u201d cited in the above cases are similar to one another and support the <em>Chambless </em>court\u2019s conclusion that there <em>is </em>a commonly understood meaning of the term. None of the above definitions limit masturbation to skin-to-skin touching and in no way do these definitions indicate that masturbation does not include a slight touching accomplished over the clothing. Given the common understanding of the term \u201cmasturbation\u201d to include any genital touching, even through clothing, we decline to find that the SVPA\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">B. <em>Definition of \u201cMental Disorder\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Defendant contends the SVPA violates his right to equal protection as guaranteed by the federal constitution (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.) because the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cmental disorder\u201d is more broad than the definition of \u201cmental disorder\u201d contained in the Mentally Disordered Offenders (MDO) Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">In order to be committed under the SVPA, a person must have \u201ca diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).) A \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d is defined as including \u201ca congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">In order to be committed under the MDO Act, a person must have \u201ca severe mental disorder that is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2962, subd. (a).) A \u201csevere mental disorder\u201d is defined as \u201can illness or disease or condition that substantially impairs the person\u2019s thought, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or which grossly impairs behavior, or that demonstrates evidence of an acute brain syndrome for which prompt remission, in absence of treatment, is unlikely.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The MDO Act specifies that the term \u201csevere mental disorder\u201d \u201cdoes not include a personality or adjustment disorder, epilepsy, mental retardation or other developmental disabilities, or addiction to or abuse of intoxicating substances.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>In <em>People v. Hubbart </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1202 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 490], we rejected the claim that the different standards create an equal protection violation: \u201c[B]oth the SVPA and the MDO law require that the person suffer from a mental disorder rendering them dangerous beyond their control. While phrased differently, the two schemes set forth similar standards for the mental disorder necessary for commitment. The two schemes do not treat the committed person differently for purposes of defining the requisite mental disorder. We conclude the SVPA does not violate equal protection in this respect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1218-1219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Defendant recognizes that this court and others have rejected his argument, and he explains that he raises it here simply to preserve the argument for further review in the federal courts. We note that the Ninth Circuit recently addressed this issue in a habeas proceeding and reached the same conclusion as we did, finding no equal protection violation. <em>(Hubbart v. Knapp </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 379 F.3d 773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">HI. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Premo, Acting P.

Chambless </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 773 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 444] <em>(Chambless). </em>I agree with the majority that \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d includes masturbation accomplished through clothing. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600.1, subd. (a).) I write separately because <em>Chambless </em>presents a difficult definitional problem. In my view, the adoption of the phrase \u201cany touching or contact, however slight, of the genitals\u201d <em>(Chambless, supra, </em>at p. 783) suggests a doubtful minimum standard of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct.\u201d The <em>Chambless </em>definition would permit finding \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d in simple misdemeanor lewd conduct, the elements of which include \u201cthe touching of genitals.\u201d (CALJIC No. 16.400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>I do not believe that invoking this standard from <em>Chambless </em>is necessary in light of the strong evidence of substantial sexual conduct in this case. Clearly, the conduct of the defendant here, however defined, was abhorrent. But, we must mean what we say and must assume that the Legislature does so as well. To apply the standard \u201cany touching . . . , however slight,\u201d contradicts the Legislature\u2019s requirement of <em>\u201csubstantial </em>sexual conduct.\u201d An appellate court\u2019s role in statutory construction is a conservative one. Our function in construing a statute is simply \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) The Legislature has set the standard at \u201csubstantial\u201d; it should not be transmuted to \u201cslight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 2005.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
