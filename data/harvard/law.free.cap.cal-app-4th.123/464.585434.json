Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a finding that he kidnapped the victim and \u201cthe movement of the victim substantially increased the risk of harm\u201d beyond that inherent in the underlying crime (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a) &amp; (d)(2)). He was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life. The trial court also imposed a $200 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd.

He further contends the court committed prejudicial misconduct by instructing on facts not in evidence, \u201cwhich implied a judgment about [the victim\u2019s] credibility and situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As we shall discuss, appellate courts should independently review a trial court\u2019s determination that a witness is unavailable due to then existing mental illness or infirmity or because crime-induced mental trauma renders the witness unable to testify without suffering substantial trauma. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subds. (a)(3), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence that supports the judgment. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].) The following summary is based on this appellate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">On September 17, 2002, 13-year-old Daveon, and his 9-year-old brother Dijon, were playing at Centinela Park in Inglewood. Daveon had cerebral palsy and learning deficiencies, which necessitated a special program and tutoring at school. Appellant sat down on the bench with Daveon and began talking to him. Daveon then went over and asked Dijon if he wanted to go with appellant in the car. After giving a negative response, Dijon played with other children. A few minutes later, he looked around but did not see his brother or appellant and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Dijon told their mother that a male stranger had taken Daveon from the park. When he subsequently returned to the park with his mother and police, he saw Daveon, who appeared to be scared, walking into the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Inglewood Police Officer Salmon spoke with Daveon, who was \u201csad, depressed\u201d and initially refused to tell the officer where he had been. Daveon was \u201c[v]ery emotional, upset,\u201d and \u201calmost embarrassed about what he was saying.\u201d Although reluctant to speak at first, after repeated questions, Daveon finally related what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Daveon explained that while he and his brother were at the park, appellant approached and asked him to look at pictures of a nude African-American female. He left with appellant in his car, because he was scared. Appellant drove to a parking area and pulled into a stall, which was about three-quarters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>to a mile away from the park. After placing the seats flat, appellant sodomized him 10 to 20 times until appellant climaxed. Afterwards, he dropped off Daveon in the vicinity of the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">During the sexual assault examination, Daveon related to the nurse that earlier at the park, an African-American male wanted to show him pictures of a naked woman; he went with the male in his vehicle, and the male sodomized him. The multiple tears outside his anus and bleeding three inches inside his anus were basically consistent with Daveon\u2019s description of the sexual assault. Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on swabs taken from Daveon\u2019s scrotum, penis, and pubic hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Daveon\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reflects that after appellant showed him pictures of a naked woman, he offered to take Daveon to see the woman. Daveon put his ball and scooter in the back seat and got in the front seat before appellant drove off. Eventually, appellant drove to an alley and parked the car. Daveon, who was scared, pulled down his pants and shorts at appellant\u2019s directive. Appellant put lotion on his penis and sodomized him for about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Appellant drove back to the park but dropped Daveon at the comer away from where Daveon said he saw his mother. Daveon told the police there, and later the nurse, what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">On another day, he told his mother, who was driving, that he saw appellant in the left turn lane. Daveon\u2019s testimony in this regard was corroborated by his mother, who wrote down and gave police the car license, and by Dijon.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Appellant was driving the same car when arrested. A small bottle of lotion was recovered from a front shirt pocket. In the car trunk, the police found Daveon\u2019s basketball and scooter, which the boys had taken to the park with them. A backpack, which contained five photographs of naked African-American females in various poses, was recovered from the passenger compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Appellant\u2019s testimony basically was that his encounter with Daveon was consensual and nonsexual. While he was jogging, Daveon, after several attempts, flagged him down twice and asked appellant to buy him something to drink and red shoelaces. After taking Daveon to three stores, appellant decided to return to the park but he had to urinate first and stopped the car in an alley. As he began to urinate into a bottle, he saw Daveon viewing pictures of a naked female, which had been under a towel on the seat. He denied telling Daveon he would take him to the woman\u2019s house and introduce him to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>When Daveon pulled down his pants and masturbated, appellant also began to masturbate. After ejaculating, appellant wiped himself with napkins, which he put on the towel. Daveon took the napkins and rubbed the ejaculate \u201con his behind.\u201d Appellant told him not to do that. Daveon then wiped himself with the napkins. Appellant denied Daveon touched him or that he ever touched Daveon. He also denied telling Daveon to take down his pants or threatening him.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">1. <em>Unavailability of Witness Finding Not Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error in finding Daveon was unavailable as a witness to testify at trial. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has established that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is a fundamental right, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 85 S.Ct. 1065.) The California Constitution now provides a specific guarantee of the right to confrontation: \u2018The defendant in a criminal cause has the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against the defendant.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) A similar guarantee is codified in section 686, subdivision 3, of the Penal Code, which provides that in a criminal action the defendant is entitled \u2018to produce witnesses on his behalf and to be confronted with the witnesses against him, in the presence of the court ....\u2019\u201d <em>(People v. Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 515 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">A traditional exception to this confrontation requirement exists where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at a prior judicial proceeding against the same defendant at which time the witness was subject to cross-examination by that defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stritzinger, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">a. <em>The Witness Unavailability Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">In a pretrial motion, the People sought a ruling that Daveon\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony could be admitted at trial, because Daveon was unavailable as a witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 240, 1290, 1291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>At the hearing, Dr. Buford Gibson, a psychiatrist, testified that he had been treating Daveon for about a year regarding his continuing problems arising from his abduction and sexual molestation. He diagnosed Daveon as suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome and explained: \u201cIt\u2019s a major disorder that may occur after some life-threatening or horrifying incident occurs to an individual and they react with severe stress syndromes that are persistent and can be disabling. It\u2019s characterized by having recurrent, intrusive thoughts, flare-ups of anxiety, flashbacks to the event and things of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">He opined that Daveon was \u201ceducationally challenged.\u201d He estimated Daveon\u2019s I.Q. to be around 65 (a normal I.Q. would be \u201ccloser to 100\u201d) and that he was developmentally four or five years behind his chronological age. He explained that he had to arrange for a home tutor, which was in lieu of his special education program at school, because of Daveon\u2019s emotional state arising from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Dr. Gibson opined that it would be \u201cdamaging to his emotional state at this current time\u201d for Daveon to testify at trial. Daveon had suffered from nightmares based on the incident. A few days earlier, Daveon informed him that he did not want to return to court, because he already had talked about the incident and was afraid his nightmares \u201cwould come back\u201d and \u201cwould impact his behavior.\u201d The doctor specifically opined that if Daveon were to testify and relive the event, the nightmares would recur and affect his course of recovery, and that his recovery would suffer a setback.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">During cross-examination, Dr. Gibson reaffirmed that requiring Daveon to testify at trial would be detrimental to his \u201cmental status in his recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In granting the motion, the court found \u201cthe likelihood that being forced to engage in having to testify in front of a jury would substantially be likely to result in an increased level of harm to [Daveon] and would further aggravate an already serious psychological problem that he\u2019s suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">b. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u201cWe traditionally review findings of fact under a deferential standard of substantial evidence, and findings of law under a de novo standard. <em>(People v. Cromer </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 889, 893-894 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 15 P.3d 243] [(Cromer)].) Mixed questions of law and fact, such as whether a given factual basis ... is adequate . . . may be subject to deferential or de novo review. (Cromer, at p. 894.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 432, 442 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 678, 84 P.3d 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In <em>Cromer, </em>the question was whether the prosecution had proven due diligence in locating a missing witness whose preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury pursuant to Evidence Code section 240(a)(5). <em>Cromer </em>held the standard of review was de novo (independent) and disapproved <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1207 [268 Cal.Rptr. 686] to the extent it \u201ccontained] language inconsistent with this conclusion . . . .\u201d <em>(Cromer, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 901, fn 3 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 15 P.3d 243.) <em>Turner </em>applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing whether the trial court properly found the witness to be unavailable under subdivisions (a)(3) and (c) of Evidence Code section 240, which are the same subdivisions at issue here. <em>(Turner, supra, </em>at pp. 1212-1214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The holding in <em>Cromer, </em>that a trial court\u2019s due diligence determination is subject to independent review, is consistent with the usual practice in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision of a mixed question of fact and law that implicates the constitutional right to confront a witness at trial. <em>(Cromer, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 901.) This case presents the question whether the prosecution proved the absent witness was unavailable due to a mental condition. There is no basis on which to distinguish <em>Cromer, </em>like the review of a trial court\u2019s finding under section 240, subdivision (a)(5) analyzed in <em>Cromer, </em>the review of a finding under section 240, subdivisions (a)(3) and (c) may guide law enforcement authorities, unify precedent, and stabilize the law. (24 Cal.4th at p. 901.) Accordingly, we will independently review the trial court\u2019s ruling here that Daveon was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">c. <em>Burden to Show Then Existing Mental Illness or Infirmity or Risk of Substantial Trauma to Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The People have the burden of proving by competent evidence that the witness is unavailable before a witness\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony may be admitted at trial. <em>(People v. Stritzinger, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 516; <em>People v. Williams </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 40, 51 [155 Cal.Rptr. 414].) This burden of proof is met by showing the unavailability of the witness through a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In <em>People v. Gomez </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 225 [103 Cal.Rptr. 80], the court concluded that where the unavailability of a declarant is based on a claim of an incapacitating mental condition which exists at the time of trial, \u201cthe illness or infirmity must be of comparative severity; it must exist to such a degree as to render the witness\u2019s attendance, or his testifying, <em>relatively impossible </em>and not merely inconvenient.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 230, italics added.) In the context of mental illness or infirmity, the phrase \u201crelatively impossible\u201d to testify does not mean it is impossible to elicit the testimony due to insanity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>coma or other total inability to communicate. Rather, the phrase includes the relative impossibility of eliciting testimony without risk of inflicting substantial trauma on the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In <em>Gomez, </em>the defendant was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18 (\u00a7 261.5). <em>(People v. Gomez, supra, 26 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 227.) The victim had just turned 15 years old before the crime and was admitted to Camarillo State Hospital about a month later. Two psychiatrists testified regarding her availability as a witness. Dr. Martin, her treating physician, testified \u201cshe was very vulnerable to stress; she had a tendency to psychomotor seizures which were difficult to diagnose and treat; she had shown significant improvement although such was rather \u2018delicate and tedious\u2019; in his opinion there was a \u2018strong possibility\u2019 that it would be detrimental to her welfare to appear in court. While under his care at the hospital, she had \u2018become rather hysterical with minimal provocation.\u2019 He concluded she would become \u2018very vulnerable and regressing backwards and wipe out the improvement that she\u2019s shown . . . and ... as her physician, I don\u2019t want to risk that happening.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Dr. Rieger, who had reviewed the victim\u2019s records and whose duty was \u201cto decide whether a child should be admitted to the hospital,\u201d opined that \u201ccoming to court and testifying \u2018is a very traumatic experience to a child\u2019 such as this one. He concluded she would be \u2018definitely affected\u2019 by it and he \u2018would strongly recommend against it\u2019; he was \u2018greatly concerned that it would grossly affect the child\u2019s present and possibly future health, mental health .... I would be very concerned over the consequences which might ensue from her appearing here under such stress or conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gomez, supra, 26 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">When viewed in context, the reference to \u201crelatively impossible and not merely inconvenient\u201d to testify thus pertains to the severity (or degree) of trauma which might be inflicted on the child if she were to testify. In other words, where substantial trauma would ensue from the declarant testifying, it is \u201crelatively impossible\u201d for him or her to testify, and thus, the declarant is unavailable as a witness based on \u201cmental illness or infirmity.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(3); see <em>People v. Stritzinger, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 518 [the determination whether a witness is unavailable due to mental illness or infirmity \u201cgenerally calls for expert opinion, with supporting reasons, as to the likely effect of the court appearance on the physical or mental health of the witness\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 54 [distinguishing <em>Gomez </em>based on absence of \u201ccredible evidence ... to support a finding that, if required to testify, [the witness] would suffer any <em>substantial impairment </em>to her mental or physical health,\u201d italics added].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Twelve years after the decision in <em>People v. Gomez, </em>the Legislature amended Evidence Code section 240 to add crime-induced physical and mental trauma under the new subdivision (c) as a reason why a declarant may be unavailable as a witness. (Stats. 1984, ch. 401, \u00a7 1, p. 1751.) \u201cExpert testimony which establishes that physical or mental trauma resulting from an alleged crime has caused harm to a witness of sufficient severity that the witness is . . . unable to testify without suffering <em>substantial trauma </em>may constitute a sufficient showing of unavailability pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). As used in this section, the term \u2018expert\u2019 means a physician and surgeon, including a psychiatrist . . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">d. <em>Substantial Trauma Renders Daveon Unavailable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Initially, we conclude substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings that requiring Daveon to testify at trial would \u201csubstantially be likely to result in an increased level of harm to [him] and would further aggravate an already serious psychological problem that he\u2019s suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Dr. Gibson was not simply a forensic psychiatrist offering expert trial testimony. He was Daveon\u2019s treating physician and had treated Daveon for a year. He was intimately familiar with Daveon\u2019s mental and emotional condition. He explained that Daveon suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome, a \u201cmajor disorder,\u201d which manifests in recurrent flashbacks of the incident, among other symptoms, and involves \u201csevere stress syndromes that are persistent and can be disabling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">He opined that for Daveon to testify at trial would be \u201cdamaging to his emotional state at this current time.\u201d He explained that Daveon\u2019s nightmares would return and set back his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We independently conclude that Daveon was \u201cunavailable as a witness\u201d because of mental illness or infirmity and because he was \u201cunable to testify without suffering substantial trauma.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subds. (a)(3) &amp; (c).) The trial court therefore properly allowed Daveon\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">2. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Comments Properly </em>Neutral<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The judgment is affirmed. The superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment to reflect $200 as the amount of the restitution fine and the parole revocation fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Hastings, Acting P. J., Curry, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 10, 2004, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 19, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\">All further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-14\"><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In lieu of Daveon testifying at trial, his preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
