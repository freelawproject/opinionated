Plaintiffs, recipients of these demand letters, filed their complaint against DIRECTV, alleging that the conduct of mailing the demand letters was an unfair business practice (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 (the UCL)), a violation of plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights, and extortion. The trial court granted the special motion of DIRECTV to strike (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16) plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and awarded DIRECTV attorney fees. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Plaintiffs contend Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, subdivision (b) protects their UCL claim <em>from </em>dismissal under the anti-SLAPP procedure. In the published portion of this opinion (parts I &amp; II), we hold: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim was not brought in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and therefore is not entitled to protection under section 425.17, subdivision (b) from the anti-SLAPP special motion to strike; (2) with respect to the merits of the anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court did not err in granting DIRECTV\u2019s motion to strike and dismissing the complaint; (3) DIRECTV\u2019s demand letters are absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion (part HI), we hold: (4) the court did not abuse its discretion in fixing the attorney fee award. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ASF\">1. <em>DIRECTV.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">DIRECTV provides satellite television programming by subscription or on a pay-per-view basis to millions of households nationwide. To secure its system and prevent unauthorized reception of its programs, DIRECTV electronically scrambles, or encrypts, its satellite transmissions. DIRECTV also investigates and prosecutes \u201chackers\u201d and \u201cpirates,\u201d i.e., those who circumvent the encryption to obtain unauthorized use of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">With the aim of protecting its business interests, DIRECTV obtained several writs of seizure authorizing the United States Marshal to seize and impound products and business records from designers, manufacturers, and distributors of equipment used to decrypt and misappropriate DIRECTV\u2019s satellite signal. During the seizures, DIRECTV obtained customer lists identifying individuals who purchased decryption devices in response to advertising aimed at DIRECTV\u2019s subscribers. The devices enable users to steal DIRECTV\u2019s programming.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">DIRECTV then sent demand letters to thousands of customers thus identified, explaining that use of illegal signal-theft equipment to gain access to DIRECTV\u2019s programming violated federal law (the Communications Act, 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 605 et seq. &amp; the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521), and seeking cooperation of the letters\u2019 recipients to stop the pirating. The letters provided the recipients with an opportunity to resolve the matter by way of settlement before commencement of suit. Thereafter, DIRECTV filed federal lawsuits nationwide against more than 600 people who purchased the pirating devices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">2. <em>The class action lawsuit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Plaintiffs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are recipients of DIRECTV\u2019s demand letters. To solicit plaintiffs for this case, counsel searched Internet sites promoting satellite television piracy. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against DIRECTV<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleges three causes of action; (1) violation of the UCL, (2) interference with civil rights (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1), and (3) extortion and duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The operative complaint alleges \u201cthe demands constitute extortion.\u201d The complaint also alleges the following; none of the pieces of electronic equipment triggering the demand letters is contraband or illegal. \u201cAt most, they are pieces of hardware that have many innocent uses, but which under certain circumstances and if certain other conditions are met, <em>could </em>(in knowledgeable hands) be used to receive unauthorized satellite transmissions.\u201d (Original italics.) DIRECTV sent demand letters to every name found on customer lists without first ascertaining whether the letter recipients actually possessed the hardware and used it in some improper fashion. The purpose of the demand letters was to intimidate and coerce the recipients into forfeiting the equipment and to extort money. Many of the statements contained in the demand letters were false, misleading, or deceptive. For example, the letter repeatedly implies that, unless the recipient settled, DIRECTV would seek monetary damages and \u201cthe recipient could face civil and criminal prosecution.\u201d The demand letters also contained \u201c[a] list of demands which . . . must be met in timely fashion\u201d or DIRECTV threatened to \u201c \u2018initiate legal proceedings^]\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018abandon its attempts to negotiate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>The complaint further alleges that a secondary demand letter was sent to some of the plaintiffs several weeks or months later. The second letter reiterated the accusations of piracy and stated that, unless the recipient contacted the sender within days, a lawsuit would be filed based on a draft complaint that was enclosed with the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the conduct of sending the demand letters (1) violated the UCL, (2) interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of their civil right to be from personal insult, defamation, and injury to their personal relations (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1), and (3) constituted extortion and duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">3. <em>The special motion to strike pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">DIRECTV filed its special motion to strike the complaint in its entirety pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, commonly referred to as the anti-SLAPP statute. DIRECTV asserted first that the complaint arose from DIRECTV\u2019s demand letter, which letter was sent in anticipation of litigation and was thus an exercise of DIRECTV\u2019s constitutional right to petition to seek redress of grievances protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. (\u00a7 425.16.) Second, DIRECTV asserted, plaintiffs could not carry their burden to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their lawsuit because DIRECTV\u2019s demand letter was immune from liability under the litigation privilege. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Plaintiffs opposed the special motion to strike by addressing only the second prong of the two-part test under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. They presented evidence in an attempt to show a prima facie case with respect to all three causes of action. On the issue of DIRECTV\u2019s affirmative defense of the litigation privilege, plaintiffs asserted they had evidence to create a triable issue about its applicability. In particular, they attempted to show that (1) not all of the devices are used for illegal purposes; (2) the records that DIRECTV seized did not indicate how the devices would be used; (3) many demand letters were sent after the statute of limitations had run; and (4) the only judgments DIRECTV had obtained so far in their federal litigation on the demand letters across the United States were default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">DIRECTV responded by submitting, through a request for judicial notice, excerpts from <em>DIRECTV, Inc. </em>v. <em>Derek E. Trone, et al. </em>(Case No. CV 02-05194 PA (RCx)), in which the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted DIRECTV\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment against a manufacturer and seller of signal theft devices in violation of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(4)). The court in <em>Tron\u00e9 </em>ruled, while the electronic devices might be used for lawful purposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>that the issue under the Communications Act is \u201cwhether [the defendant] knew, or had reason to know, that the devices were \u2018primarily of assistance\u2019 in the unauthorized decryption of direct-to-home satellite system.\u201d (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(4).) DIRECTV also submitted a copy of the writ to the United States Marshal to seize \u201cAny and all devices . . . and [a]ny other hardware device designed or intended for the purpose of circumventing DIRECTV\u2019s conditional access system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">4. <em>The trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The trial court granted DIRECTV\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16.) The court found that all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose from the demand letters, which \u201c[t]he parties agree . . . constitute protected communications\u201d in furtherance of DIRECTV\u2019s right of petition under the United States and California Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The burden then shifted to plaintiffs to show a probability that they would prevail on their claims. The trial court found that DIRECTV\u2019s demand letters were absolutely protected by the litigation privilege (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b)) because the letters were sent in good faith, serious contemplation of litigation. After sending the demand letters, the court noted, DIRECTV filed more than 600 lawsuits. Accordingly, the trial court granted DIRECTV\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">After the court awarded DIRECTV attorney fees in the amount of $97,222.10, plaintiffs\u2019 appeals ensued. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (j).)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">I. <em>The newly enacted exception to the anti-SLAPP motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.17).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the newly enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17 applies to the present case. Hence, even if their entire complaint were previously vulnerable to a motion to strike under section 425.16, their UCL cause of action is now immune to that procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>By way of background, the anti-SLAPP statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16) subjects certain claims\u2014those which arise from acts in furtherance of the federal and state constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue\u2014to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) The anti-SLAPP statute is designed to encourage participation in matters of public significance through the valid exercise of the constitutional rights and to prevent the chilling of such participation by the abuse of the judicial process. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Based on its finding that there had been a \u201cdisturbing abuse of Section 425.16,\u201d the Legislature enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, to limit application of section 425.16 to specified types of actions. (\u00a7 425.17, subd. (a).) According to the sponsor of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, Senator Sheila Kuehl, the same types of businesses who used the SLAPP action were inappropriately using the anti-SLAPP motion against their public-interest adversaries. Hence, the Legislature expressly designed subdivision (b) of section 425.17 to prevent the use of the anti-SLAPP device against \u201cspecified <em>public interest </em>actions,\u201d among others. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 515 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 27, 2003, p. 2.) Subdivision (b) of section 425.17 makes the anti-SLAPP procedure inapplicable to \u201cany action brought <em>solely in the public interest </em>or <em>on behalf of the general public. . . </em>.\u201d (\u00a7 425.17, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">However, \u201cnot all public interest or class actions [are intended to be] automatically exempt from the anti-SLAPP law.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>on Sen. Bill No. 515 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) p. 13.) Three conditions must exist to invoke the protections of subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In particular, subdivision (b) of section 425.17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, states: \u201cSection 425.16 does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public <em>if all of the following conditions </em>exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201c(1) The plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member. A claim for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201c(2) The action, if successful, would enforce an important right affecting the public interest, and would confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, on the general public or a large class of persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201c(3) Private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s stake in the matter.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The Legislature \u201csharply defined\u201d the public-interest exception of subdivision (b) of section 425.17 by reference to the three \u201cfactors corresponding to the state\u2019s private attorney general statute\u201d so that subdivision (b) \u201cparallels the existing exception for actions by the attorney general and public prosecutors.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 515, <em>supra, </em>as amended June 27, 2003, pp. 11-12.) The three conditions of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, subdivision (b)(1) through (3) mirror the three elements for determining the eligibility for a fee award under the private attorney general doctrine as codified in section 1021.5. (See <em>Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 934-935 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200] [establishing three elemental criteria for fees under the private attorney general doctrine codified in \u00a7 1021.5].)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The second and third elements of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, subdivision (b) are absent here. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 action does not fall within the new exception to the anti-SLAPP procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">With respect to the second element, there is no question but that plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim, if successful, would not \u201cenforce an important right affecting the public interest.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.17, subd. (b)(2).) Based on the allegations of the complaint, plaintiffs want to enjoin DIRECTV from sending this particular demand letter concerning this specific electronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>device to users of this device. They are not seeking to assert some general right not to receive demand letters or notices. Nor do they seek a declaration about demand letters in general. Notwithstanding the number of the recipients of the letters rank in the thousands, there is no public interest principle being vindicated by this action. <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City </em>Council, <em>supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 939-940.) Regardless of the outcome of this lawsuit, properly worded demand letters will remain a standard practice designed to avoid the necessity of legal action. <em>(Fuhrman </em>v. <em>California Satellite Systems </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 408, 420-421 [225 Cal.Rptr. 140, 231 Cal.Rptr. 113] [well-established legal practice to communicate promptly with potential adversaries, setting out the claims on them, urging settlement, and warning of alternative of judicial action]; <em>Larmour v. Campanale </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 566, 568 [158 Cal.Rptr. 143] [same]; <em>Lerette </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Organization, Inc. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 573, 577 [131 Cal.Rptr. 592] [same].) In fact, sometimes notices are required by statute. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 364 [90-day letter required before filing medical malpractice claim]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 910 et seq. [notice requirements under Tort Claims Act].) Therefore, if plaintiff\u2019s UCL claim were successful, it would establish no ringing declaration of the rights of all pirating-device purchasers, nor would it lead to a wholesale change in the practice of sending demand letters. <em>(Family Planning Specialists Medical Group, Inc. v. Powers </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1561, 1569 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 667], quoting from <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 167 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306] [no enforcement of public right where the plaintiffs enforced solely their own interests].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">More important, the third element, the so-called necessity and financial burden factor (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.17, subd. (b)(3)), is absent in this case. It has been said about this element that \u201cthe less direct or concrete a personal interest someone has, the more likely he or she will satisfy the element and be eligible for fees under the statute. Thus, in practice, the necessity and financial burden element of section 1021.5 tends to be analyzed like golf is scored: the lower the better.\u201d <em>(Hammond v. Agran </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 122 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 646].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Courts first focus on what sort of financial stake the plaintiff had in the outcome <em>(Hammon v. Agran, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 126), i.e., what the plaintiff hoped to gain financially from the litigation in comparison to what it cost. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.) Although there is some disagreement among the cases, the appropriate interest can be both pecuniary and nonpecuniary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 122-123.) The relevant inquiry is whether \u201cthe 1 \u201ccost of the [plaintiffs\u2019] legal victory transcends [their] personal interest.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125, quoting from <em>Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 941.) Justice Sills succinctly distilled the cases: \u201c[t]he [plaintiffs\u2019] objective in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>litigation must go beyond\u2014\u2018transcend\u2019\u2014those things that concretely, specifically and significantly affect the litigant ... to affect the broader world or \u2018general public\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Hammon v. Agran, supra, </em>at p. 127, citing <em>Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 516 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Here, plaintiffs cannot satisfy the \u201cnecessity and financial burden\u201d factor of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, subdivision (b)(3). Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim is entirely personal to them. Plaintiffs seek an accounting to them and restitution to them of moneys they paid to DIRECTV. Given plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim enforces no important public interest, the benefits that would be conferred on plaintiffs, if they were victorious in this lawsuit, far transcend any conceivable benefit to the general public. Plaintiffs\u2019 personal stake in this lawsuit\u2014namely, not receiving these letters from DIRECTV about these devices\u2014far exceeds the effect that this lawsuit could possibly have on the public at large. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>San Francisco Bd. of Permit Appeals </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 961, 964 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 565]; <em>Planned Parenthood v. City of Santa Maria </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 685, 691 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 391].)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Our conclusion that plaintiffs in this case cannot avail themselves of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17\u2019s protection from DIRECTV\u2019S special motion to strike comports with the stated purpose behind section 425.17, subdivision (b). The anti-SLAPP statute excepts from its sweep actions filed by public prosecutors, and so the amendment was designed to \u201c \u2018provide a parallel protection when people are acting only in the public interest as private attorneys general, <em>and are not seeking any special relief for them</em>selves\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 515, <em>supra, </em>as amended July 27, 2003, p. 12, italics added.) Suits <em>\u201cmotivated by personal gain are not exempted from the anti-SLAPP motion. </em>This is necessary . . . because there are some abusive uses of the unfair competition law that should be subject to the SLAPP motion .... [C]ases that are motivated by personal gain . . . would not be covered by the exemption.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Because this lawsuit is not designed to confer a benefit upon anyone other than plaintiffs, it is only motivated by personal gain. Thus, as it only benefits plaintiffs, this UCL action is not covered by section 425.17\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In arguing that Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, subdivision (b) applies to this case precluding DIRECTV from striking the UCL cause of action, plaintiffs assert that the sheer number of demand letter recipients, and hence the massive size of the alleged class of plaintiffs, demonstrates that the complaint was brought in the public interest. Even if, by virtue of the size of the alleged class, success of the lawsuit might affect \u201ca large class of persons\u201d under the second element of section 425.17, subdivision (b), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>benefit it would confer would not be legally significant. Moreover, plaintiffs cannot meet the third element (\u00a7 425.17, subd. (b)(3)), and all three factors must be met for the exception to apply. (\u00a7 425.17, subd. (b).) No matter how they characterize their complaint, plaintiffs\u2019 stake is personal to them as recipients of this particular demand letter. They do <em>not </em>seek to protect the public\u2019s right to use these devices or to be free of demand letters. We are unconvinced by plaintiffs\u2019 portrayal of themselves as the public-interest David against the corporate Goliath. The complaint\u2019s prayer exposes this cause of action as motivated by personal gain. This lawsuit is not protected from the anti-SLAPP statute by section 425.17.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">To summarize, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17 does not apply to this UCL claim because plaintiffs cannot demonstrate the second and third factors of subdivision (b). Because section 425.17, subdivision (b) does not protect plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim, the trial court correctly entertained DIRECTV\u2019S special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">II. <em>The anti-SLAPP motion and the standard of appellate review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Having established that plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim is not protected by the exception of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17, we turn to the merits of DIRECTV\u2019S special motion to strike the complaint. (\u00a7 425.16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">1. <em>The purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute and the burdens of proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">As noted, the anti-SLAPP statute subjects a cause of action arising from an act taken in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of success on the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1) set forth <em>ante, </em>at fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 subdivision (b)(1) involves a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one \u201carising from\u201d protected activity, namely that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>were taken \u201cin furtherance of the [defendant]\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) \u201c \u2018If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In evaluating the special motion to strike and opposition, \u201c[t]he court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, the court\u2019s responsibility is to accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to <em>determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law. </em>[Citations.] The trial court merely determines whether a prima facie showing has been made that would warrant the claim going forward. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. v.

Lawyers Title Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 212.) Neither in their opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion, nor on appeal, do plaintiffs argue that DIRECTV failed to make this necessary showing. Effectively, therefore, plaintiffs have conceded that their lawsuit \u201carises from\u201d DIRECTV\u2019S \u201cfree speech or petitioning activity\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), with the result that their claims are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. Indeed, plaintiffs cannot successfully argue that their complaint does not arise from DIRECTV\u2019S constitutionally protected right to petition for redress of grievances. The entire lawsuit is premised on DIRECTV\u2019s demand letter, sent in advance of, or to avoid, litigation to vindicate its right not to have its programming pirated.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Turning then to the second prong, because the lawsuit was subject to scrutiny under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, the burden shifted to plaintiffs to establish a prima facie probability of prevailing in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>DIRECTV argued, and the trial court agreed, that plaintiffs could not make this showing because the demand letters, which serve as the sole basis for the lawsuit, were absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).

The privilege has been broadly applied to demand letters and other prelitigation communications by attorneys. <em>(Rubin, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at pp. 1193-1194; <em>Knoell </em>v. <em>Petrovich </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 164, 169 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">\u201c[A] prelitigation statement is protected by the litigation privilege of section 47, subdivision (b) when the statement is made in connection with a proposed litigation that is \u2018contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, if the statement is made with a good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation, then the statement is sufficiently connected to litigation and will be protected by the litigation privilege. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If it applies, the privilege is absolute. <em>(Rubin v. Green, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at pp. 1202-1203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the litigation privilege applies here because there is a triable issue about whether DIRECTV sent the demand letters \u201c \u2018with the good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation.\u2019 \u201d They argue DIRECTV knew it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>never possibly sue all of the letter recipients. (1) The sheer number of demand letters sent, (2) the fact that four named plaintiffs who refused to settle have not been sued, and (3) the fact that DIRECTV sued only about 5 percent of the letter recipients, plaintiffs argue, all raise the inference that DIRECTV was not acting in serious contemplation of litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Apart from the fact that DIRECTV has initiated numerous lawsuits, which gives rise to the inference of connectedness, we conclude DIRECTV need not have filed lawsuits against every single letter recipient to be entitled to the privilege. The court credited DIRECTV\u2019s assertion it has already filed 600 such lawsuits, and DIRECTV represented to the trial court that it had filed thousands of suits. \u201c[A]ccess to the courts is not an end in itself but only one means to achieve satisfaction .... If this can be obtained without resort to the courts\u2014even without the filing of a lawsuit\u2014it is incumbent upon the attorney to pursue such a course of action first [typically by a demand letter].\u201d <em>(Lerette v. Dean Witter Organization, Inc., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d at p. 577.) Any number of letter recipients may have settled with DIRECTV, or called DIRECTV explaining that they had either not purchased the devices, or had not engaged in illegal activity. To hold that DIRECTV must sue every recipient to invoke the privilege would defeat a purpose of the demand letter, namely to avoid litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Equally unavailing is plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that DIRECTV\u2019s demand letter was not sent in good faith and in serious consideration of litigation because DIRECTV knew it did not have a legally viable claim. The success of its <em>Tron\u00e9 </em>action (Case No. CV 02-05194 PA (RCx)), along with the existence of numerous lawsuits DIRECTV brought across the country (see, e.g., <em>DirecTV, Inc. v. EQ Stuff, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2002) 207 F.Supp.2d 1077, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>1084; <em>Directv, Inc. v. Perez </em>(N.D.Ill. 2003) 279 F.Supp.2d 962; <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Kaas </em>(N.D. Iowa 2003) 294 F.Supp.2d 1044) evinces DIRECTV\u2019S belief that it had a legally viable claim under federal law. Nor may plaintiffs avoid the litigation privilege by arguing that the statements were published to coerce a settlement. <em>(Rothman v. Jackson </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1148 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 284] [demand letters directed toward settlement of anticipated lawsuit are \u201cin furtherance of litigation\u201d and thus protected].) More important, \u201ccommunications made in connection with litigation do not necessarily fall outside the privilege merely because they are, or are alleged to be, fraudulent, perjurious, unethical, or even illegal\u201d assuming they are logically related to litigation. <em>(Kashian v. Harriman </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 920 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 576].)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Nor do we agree with plaintiffs that <em>Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d 408 (disapproved on other ground <em>Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 219), compels a different result. In <em>Fuhrman, </em>a satellite television company sent approximately 8,700 demand letters as part of its antipiracy campaign, triggering the plaintiffs\u2019 class action lawsuit alleging extortion and fraud, among other things. In reversing the sustaining of the defendant\u2019s demur to the complaint, <em>Fuhrman </em>held that whether the letters were sent in good faith and serious contemplation of litigation under the Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2) privilege, was a factual question that could not be decided on demurrer. <em>(Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems, supra, </em>at p. 422.) While similar to this case, <em>Fuhrman </em>differs in one crucial respect: The decision in that case was based on a demurrer where factual determinations are not permissible. Here, however, the trial court <em>must consider facts so as to make a determination whether plaintiffs can establish a prima facie probability of prevailing on their claims. </em>(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1); <em>HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 212.) Thus, while the court does not weigh evidence, it must determine whether plaintiffs have demonstrated evidence which, <em>if credited, </em>would justify their prevailing at trial. The court also considers DIRECTV\u2019s evidence to determine if it has defeated that submitted by plaintiffs as a matter of law. <em>(HMS Capital, Inc., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 212.) Here, defendant has demonstrated that it sent the demand letters, citing statutory authority (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2511(l)(a) &amp; 2520(b); 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a) &amp; (b)); and it has filed lawsuits against thousands of defendants so far. Thus, DIRECTV demonstrated a logical relation between its demand letters and the lawsuits. At best plaintiffs have demonstrated a dispute about the applicability of the privilege, whereas DIRECTV has defeated plaintiffs\u2019 evidence. Because plaintiffs cannot show prima facie their probability of prevailing on the merits, as a matter of law, the trial court properly concluded that the litigation privilege applied. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Likewise inapposite is <em>Drum v. Bleau, Fox &amp; </em>Associates (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1009 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 602]. <em>Drum </em>involves an anti-SLAPP motion to strike a claim of abuse of process, for which an element is the defendant\u2019s \u201culterior motive\u201d in commencing the underlying action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1019.) \u201c \u2018Ulterior motive\u2019 is <em>a state of mind, </em>which, like other states of mind, can seldom be proved by direct evidence. It must be inferred from objective or external circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1021, italics added.) By contrast, it is now well established that the litigation privilege applies without regard to \u201cmotives, morals, ethics or intent.\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 220.) The litigation privilege is simply a test of connectedness or logical relationship to litigation. <em>(Aronson v. Kinsella, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In short, plaintiffs\u2019 showing <em>failed to demonstrate prima facie </em>that they could overcome the litigation privilege. By contrast, DIRECTV demonstrated that the privilege does apply. The trial court properly ruled that the demand letters are absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b). As a matter of law, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate prima the second prong of the analysis under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There remains plaintiffs\u2019 repeated assertion that we should reverse the judgment to afford plaintiffs additional discovery. Once a special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is filed, discovery is stayed until notice of entry of the order on the motion (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (g)), unless \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d a request for specified discovery is made. <em>(Ibid.; Mattel, Inc. v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1189-1190 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 794].) \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion as to the trial court\u2019s decision whether a plaintiff has complied with the requirements of section 425.16, subdivision (g) to merit discovery prior to a hearing on the motion to strike.

Plaintiffs argue they sought to obtain \u201c \u2018business records\u2019 \u201d to determine whether the recipients of the demand letters intercepted signals illegally and to establish whether the letters contained deceptive or misleading statements. However, the litigation privilege renders any such evidence irrelevant to the court\u2019s determination. <em>(Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 218 [listing numerous cases in which fraudulent communications or perjured testimony were held privileged].) Otherwise, plaintiffs did not demonstrate any other facts they expected to uncover in their discovery that would negate the privilege.

(Stats. 2003, ch. 338, \u00a7 1.) DIRECTV argues that section 425.17 does not govern this case because it cannot be applied retrospectively. However, it is now settled that section 425.17 can be applied to an order that was entered before the effective date of the new statute. <em>(Brenton v. Metabolife International, Inc. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 679, 687, 689-691 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 702]; <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>U-Haul International, Inc. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 686]; <em>Physicians Com. for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number><em>Responsible Medicine v.

As the statute constitutes a change in procedure only\u2014i.e., it regulates the conduct of ongoing litigation and does not impose new, additional, or different liabilities on past conduct\u2014Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17 works in the future. Hence, applying the new statute to a trial court judgment that predated its effectiveness does not raise retrospectivity concerns. <em>(Brenton, supra, </em>at pp. 687-691.) As the reviewing court, we impose the law that is in force when our decision is rendered. <em>(Tyson, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 125.) Thus, we must determine whether, as a question of law, plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim falls within the ambit of subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.17. If so, that section would defeat DIRECTV\u2019S effort to strike that cause of action under section 425.16, notwithstanding the lawsuit had already been filed and the trial court\u2019s order had already been entered. <em>(Tyson, supra, </em>at p. 128.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\">The anti-SLAPP statute establishes that a \u201ccause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (Code Civ.

We decline to infer a <em>lack </em>of connectedness from the default judgments. A defendant\u2019s failure to appear does not render DIRECTV\u2019s contemplation of litigation any less serious. We also decline to infer a lack of connectedness from the filing of 600 lawsuits, given that each one of the suits subjects DIRECTV to a malicious prosecution action if it is not seriously brought. Our view is only bolstered by DIRECTV\u2019s representation it has now filed approximately 23,400 additional lawsuits. Moreover, as Moreno\u2019s declaration was made on the declarant\u2019s information and belief, it may not be considered. <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 212.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">By this we do not mean to create a mathematical formula for determining the number of lawsuits that must be filed in comparison to the number of demand letters sent, in order to invoke the litigation privilege.
