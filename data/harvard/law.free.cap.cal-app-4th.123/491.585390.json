J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARY\">Petitioner, D. W.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was ordered incarcerated pursuant to Penal Code section 1332<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a result of being adjudged an uncooperative material witness. D. W. argues she was illegally deprived of her liberty because she was denied counsel and the proper hearings required by the statute. D. W. also contends she was improperly found in contempt pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1209, subdivision (a)(9). We conclude both claims have merit. Petition granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">iH \u00edj\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Because D. W. raises two distinct procedural issues, we will first discuss her arguments with respect to section 1332. We will discuss her Code of Civil Procedure section 1209 argument anon.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">\n<em>Section 1332</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Steven Robert Miller was a defendant in a \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law case charged with first degree robbery, first degree burglary, the unlawful taking of a vehicle, and 10 prior strikes. At the time Miller committed the offenses, the prosecution believed he was involved in a relationship with D. W. She was, therefore, considered to be a material witness to Miller\u2019s participation in the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>In March 2001, Miller\u2019s case was set ready for jury trial. In anticipation of calling D. W. as a prosecution witness, she was subpoenaed to appear in court. According to the prosecution, when D. W. failed to appear, the case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The prosecution refiled the complaint against Miller, and on August 17, 2001, D. W. was personally served with a subpoena to appear on August 24, 2001. When D. W. failed to appear on August 24, the prosecution dismissed the case against Miller for a second time. The court issued a bench warrant for D. W.\u2019s failure to appear and set bail at $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On December 25, 2002, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department served the bench warrant on D. W. at her home in Long Beach. D. W. was placed in custody, and on December 31, 2002, transported to the Orange County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">On Friday, January 3, 2003, D. W. appeared before Judge Ronald Kreber without counsel. Judge Kreber recalled the bench warrant and advised D. W. her bail was set at $10,000. During her appearance, the following colloquy took place between D. W. and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201c[The court]: Are you going to be able to make bail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201c[D. W.]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201c[The court]: How long have you been in custody now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201c[D. W.]: Since Christmas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201c[The court]: Have you been to Judge Briseno\u2019s court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">\u201c[D. W.]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">\u201c[The court]: I think we ought to have her up there on January 6th where Mr. Miller\u2019s case is set.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Miller\u2019s jury trial was scheduled to begin January 27, 2003, in Judge Francisco R Briseno\u2019s court. On Monday, January 6, 2003, the prosecution filed a \u201cpetition for . . . section 1332 commitment\u201d with a supporting declaration under penalty of perjury by the deputy district attorney assigned to prosecute Miller. The declaration recited the charges against Miller including the allegation of 10 prior strikes. It explained D. W. was a material witness because Miller confessed his involvement in the offenses to her and because she saw Miller driving the victim\u2019s stolen vehicle. The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>also declared that for the past three years, Miller\u2019s case was \u201crepeatedly either continued or dismissed due to the People\u2019s inability to secure the presence of [D. W.] as a witness.\u201d According to the prosecutor, D. W. failed to appear in March and August of 2001 \u201cas directed by a properly served subpoena\u201d and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest. The prosecutor stated, \u201c[I]t is my belief based on the totality of the facts and procedural background relating to this case that even if . . . [D. W.] is ordered by the court to return on the jury trial date, she would ignore such court order in order to avoid having to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On the same date the petition and declaration were filed, D. W. appeared before Judge Briseno without counsel. The court noted it was \u201cacting under 1332 subsection [szc] (c)\u201d and stated \u201cthat when a witness is declared to be a material witness, that within\u2014which was done in Department [5] I believe on Friday\u2014that within two days another court review that determination and make its own findings about whether the witness is a material witness, whether that witness needs to post bail.\u201d The court took judicial notice of the dismissals in the prior proceedings due to D. W.\u2019s failure to appear. It stated, \u201c|i]t\u2019s the court\u2019s assessment based on the declarations [sz'c] submitted by the deputy district attorney .... [f] ... [1] [who] filed a declaration as to why [D. W] ... is a material witness on this matter, and the court\u2019s read and considered that and makes the determination that the witness ... is a material witness and that but for her presence, the People would not be able to proceed. And I\u2019m going to make that determination. [][] Also make the determination that the witness needs to post a surety or bond. The present one that has been set is $10,000. [][] I\u2019m going to vacate that and set bail in the amount of $50,000 in view of the nature of the charge and the necessity for having the witness available for trial. [][] [D. W.], you don\u2019t have an attorney, and I\u2019m concerned that I not put you in a position of making any statements that may be detrimental to you. And I\u2019m trying to state what\u2019s going on in direct and simple terms so you understand why you\u2019re in custody and why the court is ordering the bail or surety requirement as it pertains to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Ten days later, on January 16, 2003, Judge Briseno conducted a second hearing and again, D. W. was not represented by counsel. However, Miller\u2019s counsel was present at the hearing and requested counsel be appointed to represent D. W. to protect her constitutional and due process rights citing <em>In re Francisco M. </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1061 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 794] <em>(Francisco M.). </em>The court noted this case had \u201can extraordinary background\u201d and had a history of being dismissed because D. W. failed to appear in court. In response to counsel\u2019s request the court appoint counsel for D. W., the court commented, \u201c[w]hether this person is entitled to counsel for other reasons not associated with the fact that she\u2019s in custody after being classified as a material witness is a separate issue that will arise on\u2014when the case goes to trial.\u201d When counsel reiterated D. W.\u2019s need for counsel to enforce her right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to a review of the proceedings by a separate judge within two days, the court stated, \u201c[t]he first review was by Judge Kreber. I did the review two days thereafter, and then the code requires that after you do the two-day review, there be another review at the end of ten days. [K] And so there were\u2014there have, in fact, been two separate judges make a determination about whether the witness is material and needs to post bond.\u201d The court denied counsel\u2019s request to appoint counsel for D. W. \u201cgiven the background of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On January 28, 2003, two deputy public defenders appeared before Judge Richard W. Stanford, Jr., asking the court to appoint the public defender\u2019s office to represent D. W. on the section 1332 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The attorneys complained that at the hearings before Judge Briseno, D. W. did not speak, did not have the opportunity to speak, did not receive any documents, and was not appointed counsel to rebut the prosecution\u2019s contentions she was a material witness and would not appear to testify. The matter was trailed to the following day at which time counsel from the public defender\u2019s office alleged the previous hearings were illegal because D. W. was not afforded counsel. The public defender sought a new hearing at which D. W. would have the opportunity to argue for less restrictive means of confinement such as through electronic monitoring or some other arrangement. The court took a brief recess to read <em>Francisco M. </em>and held the prior proceedings complied with the statute and there were \u201cno procedural, statutory, constitutional or fairness defects in the prior proceedings of the court regarding the decision to hold the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The public defender noted <em>Francisco M. </em>holds the witness is entitled to a review every 10 days, and it was beyond the 10 days since D. W.\u2019s last appearance before Judge Briseno on January 16, 2003. Counsel asked that the hearing constitute \u201cthe actual first hearing\u201d challenging the court\u2019s finding she is a material witness in addition to the initial detention. Counsel also cited the lack of proper service and failure to provide her with sufficient notice to appear in court, and opportunity \u201cto put forward her side of the story in terms of her ability and desire to come and testify.\u201d The court declined to do so and limited the hearing to changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The public defender informed the court D. W. had been a California resident for 40 years. She had lived in Long Beach for 10 years and at her current residence for the past four years. The public defender explained D. W. was \u201con S.S.I. and her disability is that she has A.I.D.S. and . . . she\u2019s currently undergoing treatment once a month at . . . Long Beach Memorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Hospital . . . .\u201d Counsel also argued D. W. had significant ties to the community, which included family members in the area and the need for ongoing medical treatment at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. Counsel further claimed, for the first time, now that she had the benefit of counsel, D. W. understood the significance of a subpoena and the requirement to testify and asked the court to consider the least restrictive means so D. W. could continue living in the community and receive her medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found \u201cthe only change of circumstances alleged in essence is that she, now that she has counsel, is more aware of the significance of a subpoena, a warrant, incarceration, and compunctions to testify,\u201d and she\u2019s more likely to appear because counsel has talked to her. As such, the court did not find there was a \u201csignificant or substantial change in circumstances, and that the prior orders of the court should remain in effect. She can, if she posts an undertaking, be released. But other less restrictive methods of insuring her appearance previously were considered and decided upon; and there\u2019s no change. And so the order is to remain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On January 31, 2003, while Miller\u2019s trial was in progress, D. W. filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking her immediate release on the basis she was denied counsel and an unrestricted section 1332 hearing. She also alleged she was not properly held in civil contempt pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1209. This court ordered D. W.\u2019s immediate release from custody and issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Article I, section 10 of the California Constitution guarantees \u201c[witnesses may not be unreasonably detained.\u201d This constitutional protection is balanced against \u201c \u2018[t]he duty [of all citizens] to disclose knowledge of [a] crime ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Francisco M., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1064.) This duty is considered to be \u201c \u2018so vital that one known to be an innocent may be detained, in the absence of bail, as a material witness. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">To enforce this duty, section 1332 allows for the incarceration of a person determined to be a material witness to secure his or her presence at trial. Section 1332 states, \u201c(a) [W]hen the court is satisfied, by proof on oath, that there is good cause to believe that any material witness for the prosecution or defense, whether the witness is an adult or a minor, will not appear and testify unless security is required, at any proceeding in connection with any criminal prosecution ... the court may order the witness to enter into a written undertaking to the effect that he or she will appear and testify at the time and place ordered by the court or that he or she will forfeit an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>amount the court deems proper. [][] (b) If the witness required to enter into an undertaking to appear and testify, either with or without sureties, refuses compliance with the order for that purpose, the court may commit the witness, if an adult, to the custody of the sheriff . . . until the witness complies or is legally discharged, [f] (c) When a person is committed pursuant to this section, he or she is entitled to an automatic review of the order requiring a written undertaking and the order committing the person, by a judge or magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense other than the one who issued the order. This review shall be held not later than two days from the time of the original order of commitment, [f] (d) If it is determined that the witness must remain in custody, the witness is entitled to a review of that order after 10 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cThe unique posture of the material witness\u201d requires special attention to ensure that the procedures leading to the incarceration of a witness are fair and comply with \u201cprocedural safeguards allowing the interests of the witness to be heard in conjunction with the interests of the state.\u201d <em>(Francisco M., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) The opportunity for the witness to be heard has its roots in the federal and state Constitutions, which provide a person may not be deprived of his or her liberty without due process of law. (U.S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7; see <em>Francisco M., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1071-1072.) And because there is a risk of loss of physical liberty, the due process requirement of a meaningful opportunity to be heard cannot be met unless counsel is appointed. <em>(Iraheta v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1503 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">By its terms, section 1332, subdivision (a), contemplates an initial hearing on \u201cproof on oath, that there is good cause to believe\u201d the witness is material, and will not appear and testify unless security is required. <em>Francisco M. </em>explains that during this initial hearing \u201cthe witness should have counsel... to controvert the allegations seeking his detention, and to be heard on all relevant issues, including whether he will agree to return if released and whether other alternatives to incarceration in lieu of security are feasible and adequate. On all relevant issues he is entitled to present evidence on his behalf.\u201d <em>(Francisco M., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Because the witness may be unfamiliar with the judicial system, representation by counsel is essential to challenge the allegations seeking the witness\u2019s detention. For example, because of the witness\u2019s unfamiliarity with the facts of the case and the Evidence Code, counsel would be in a better position to argue whether the witness\u2019s testimony is in fact material and otherwise likely to be admissible. It is unlikely the witness would have any knowledge as to what constitutes proper service of a subpoena or how to challenge the validity of service. Counsel would be able to pose a challenge to the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of service if it was appropriate. Also, counsel is generally far more capable of articulating the reasons why the witness may have previously failed tri respond to a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Here, it is alleged D. W. suffers from a potentially terminal illness and receives medical treatment on a regular basis. D. W.\u2019s medical condition may explain why she failed to appear at one or both of her scheduled appearances. Not being conversant with the criminal justice system, D. W. may not have been aware of the less restrictive means of detention to ensure her appearance in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is clear both Judge Briseno and Judge Stanford believed Judge Kreber conducted the initial hearing, considered the relevant evidence, and based on \u201cproof on oath\u201d made a finding \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to believe D. W. was a material witness and would not appear and testify unless security was required. However, it is apparent from the minute order and the transcript of the hearing Judge Kreber did none of those things. Neither the minute order nor the transcript of D. W.\u2019s appearance before Judge Kreber indicate there was: (1) a declaration or testimony on \u201cproof on oath\u201d; (2) good cause presented to the court attesting to the fact D. W. was a material witness; (3) evidence she would not appear and testify as required; or (4) any indication a petition had been filed asking the court to detain D. W. pursuant to section 1332. In fact, the minute order of D. W.\u2019s appearance before Judge Kreber clearly reflects the court simply recalled the outstanding warrant and transferred the matter to Judge Briseno\u2019s court for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Consequently, D. W. was never afforded an opportunity to challenge the allegations requiring her incarceration as provided in section 1332, subdivision (a). Therefore, the subsequent \u201creview\u201d proceedings pursuant to section 1332, subdivision (c), before Judges Briseno and Stanford, were meaningless. We conclude D. W. was illegally deprived of her liberty because she was denied counsel and was never provided the proper hearings required by section 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\n<em>Section 1209</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">At the conclusion of the section 1332 proceeding, Judge Stanford allowed the prosecution to call D. W. as a witness under Evidence Code section 402 to determine if she would invoke the marital privilege and refuse to testify if called as a witness at the trial. The public defender elicited testimony from D. W. to establish a valid marriage and a basis for D. W. to invoke the marital privilege, but the court ruled the marital privilege did not apply. Then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>court decided it would be beneficial to \u201cfind out what. . . [D. W.] would say if she was called in front of the jury . . . [to] see what the responses are going to be.\u201d During this hearing, out of the presence of the jury, counsel asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege on D. W.\u2019s behalf. The court ruled D. W. had no Fifth Amendment privilege and ordered D. W. to answer the prosecution\u2019s questions. D. W. repeatedly refused to answer. Because the court had refused to sustain either of her claims of privilege, the prosecution asked she be found in civil contempt. The court obliged. The minute order reflects the following: \u201cPeople ask the Court to order the witness to answer the questions or she will be held in [c]ontempt. [][] Court orders the witness to answer the questions. [][] People request the Court to find the witness in contempt of Court. [][]... [f] Court finds witness refuses to answer the questions as stated on the record, [f] Court so orders as requested by the People, [f] Witness is ordered remanded into custody to appear on [February 4, 2003], 9:00 a.m.\u201d D. W. was remanded and was in custody until January 31, 2003, when this court ordered her immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The court failed to cite statutory authority for its judgment of contempt, but we presume it was Code of Civil Procedure section 1209, subdivision (a)(9). That provision provides, in part, that contempts of the authority of the court include \u201crefusing to be sworn or answer as a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cContempt committed in the immediate view and presence of the court . . . may be treated summarily. All that is required is that an order be made reciting the facts, adjudging the person guilty and prescribing the punishment.\u201d <em>[Hjowever, that such an order is valid only if it recites facts with sufficient particularity to demonstrate on its face that petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted a legal contempt. </em>[Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Littlefield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 122, 138 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 851 P.2d 42], quoting <em>In re Buckley </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 237, 247 [110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201].) We conclude the January 29, 2003, contempt order was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The court\u2019s order fails to recite sufficient details for a reviewing court to reach its own conclusion as to whether D. W.\u2019s conduct was contemptuous. Rather than recite with specificity the exchange, the court summarized by simply stating D. W. refused to answer the questions. The order only generally describes the conduct and does not state the underlying facts such as D. W.\u2019s invocations of privilege, the court\u2019s rulings on the claimed privileges, or the appearance and participation of counsel. <em>(Boysaw v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 215, 221 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 999 P.2d 748].) Also absent from the order is a statement as to the exact punishment the court imposed. This failure created an ambiguity as to whether the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>intended to impose a punitive contempt or a coercive contempt. If the contempt was the later, D. W. was entitled to know what she was required to do to earn her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In reviewing a civil contempt order, the appellate court does not presume the order to be correct. Rather, because of the summary nature of civil contempt, all presumptions are drawn against the validity of the contempt order. <em>(In re Rosen </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 71, 74 [106 Cal.Rptr. 757].) Practically speaking, as the phrase goes, this places the burden on the court to \u201cdot all the \u2018i\u2019s\u2019 and cross all the \u2018t\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d Because civil contempt is generally the last arrow in the judicial quiver, it is not a routine and familiar exercise for most courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the rare occasion when a court is called upon to invoke its contempt authority, the court is well advised to stop and refresh its recollection as to the intricacies of the requirements placed on the judge. Otherwise, the order may not fare well under the appellate microscope.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is granted. The matter is remanded to the superior court with directions to vacate its January 29, 2003, order committing D. W. to custody pursuant to section 1332 and its order on the same date adjudging her in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Moore, J., and Fybel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Out of respect for petitioner\u2019s privacy due to her illness (discussed, <em>post, </em>p. 496), we only use her initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-15\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Although the court never formally ruled on the public defender\u2019s request to be appointed, counsel from the public defender\u2019s office appeared on behalf of D. W. at this hearing and continued to appear on her behalf throughout the prosecution\u2019s Evidence Code section 402 motion and at the time of the contempt ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">We in no way mean to encourage contempt proceedings under the old adage \u201cpractice makes perfect.\u201d We commend our trial bench for the judgment, skill, and good sense it demonstrates in effectively controlling even the most difficult proceedings without having to resort to contempt proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
