Frightened, Pointer kept her distance from him as she opened the living room curtains in the hope a neighbor might see and call the police. He kept breaking things. Twice she dialed 911, but twice she hung up, fearing things would get much worse if he knew she had called. He left before the police arrived. She told a police officer that the only thing he had not broken in the house was his own stereo and that everything else in the house belonged to her. A couple of hours later, alerted by a neighbor to \u201cincredible pounding, very, very loud noise\u201d from the house, police officers found Wallace inside the house breaking things again. Only after he challenged three armed and uniformed officers to fight, did they subdue him with a taser and arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">At trial, an expert witness testified to over $9,000 of damage to the house and to over $6,000 of damage to the furniture and furnishings. A jury found Wallace guilty of felony vandalism and of two misdemeanors\u2014being under the influence and resisting, delaying, or obstructing an officer (\u201cresisting\u201d)\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and found two assault with a deadly weapon priors true as both serious felony priors and prison term priors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1), 245, subd. (a)(1), 594, subd. (b)(1), 667.5, subd. (b), 1192.7, subd. (c); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sentenced him to a 25-year-to-life term for felony vandalism, a consecutive term of one year on each of his two prison term priors, and time served on each of his two misdemeanors.

(a)-(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Wallace argues that as a matter of law he cannot be guilty of vandalizing either community property or his spouse\u2019s separate property inside the marital home. In the published portion of our opinion, we will reject his argument and embrace the emerging rule imposing criminal liability on a spouse for intentionally causing harm to property in which the other spouse has an interest, whether the property is individual or marital, whether the harm occurs outside or inside the marital home. In the nonpublished portion of our opinion, we will address his numerous other arguments and grant relief as to two. In the first, the evidence showed, and the prosecutor argued, that Wallace committed two acts of resisting, but the record shows neither an explicit election by the prosecutor nor a unanimity instruction by the court, so we will order the resisting conviction stricken from the judgment. In the second, the court miscalculated Wallace\u2019s presentence custody credit and failed to award him the presentence conduct credit to which he was entitled, so we will modify the judgment accordingly. Otherwise we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">1. <em>Scope of Vandalism Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The question before us is whether a spouse can be guilty of vandalizing community property and the other spouse\u2019s separate property inside the marital home. Wallace asks us to answer that question in the negative on the basis of \u201cthe common law rule that a person\u2019s home is his or her castle\u201d and the language in the vandalism statute (\u00a7 594) that a vandal can deface, damage, or destroy only property that is \u201cnot his or her own.\u201d The Attorney General asks us to answer that question in the affirmative, arguing that vandalism is not a crime that threatens property rights only in a particular place, that the criminal law protects each owner\u2019s interest in community property against nonconsensual damage by the other, and that Pointer\u2019s separate property suffered most of the harm anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In <em>People v. Kahanic </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 461 [241 Cal.Rptr. 722] <em>(Kahanic), </em>we held that the vandalism statute applies to community property on the rationale that the \u201cessence of the crime is in the physical acts against the ownership interest of another, even though that ownership is less than exclusive.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 466.) Citing <em>Kahanic, </em>a proposed vandalism instruction from the Judicial Council\u2019s Task Force on Jury Instructions requires proof that the accused \u201cdid not own the property\u201d or \u201cowned the property with someone else.\u201d (See Cal. Jud. Council, Task Force on Jury Instructions, Criminal Jury Instructions (July 5, 2004 Draft) Inst. No. 1995, pp. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">However, Wallace argues that with the vandalism in <em>Kahanic </em>occurring outside the marital home the case is inapposite to the issue here whether \u201cthe common law rule that a person\u2019s home is his or her castle\u201d precludes criminal liability for vandalizing property in one\u2019s own home. He analogizes that issue to the question whether a person can burglarize his or her own home and notes the California Supreme Court relied on the common law rule to hold that the burglary statute applies only to \u201ca person who has no right to be in the building.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gauze </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 709, 714 [125 Cal.Rptr. 773, 542 P.2d 1365].) Emphasizing that \u201cburglary and the lesser related offenses of trespass and vandalism <em>are </em>\u2018closely related\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Farrow </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1606, 1625-1626 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 844], citing <em>People v. Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303], overruled by <em>People </em>v. <em>Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 112-113, 136 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073]), he argues that as one can neither burgle nor trespass in one\u2019s own home, neither can one vandalize property in one\u2019s own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Wallace\u2019s argument ignores three key differences between vandalism, on the one hand, and burglary and trespass, on the other. First, one can commit vandalism anywhere (see \u00a7 594),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but one can commit burglary and trespass only by entering into a specific place (see \u00a7\u00a7 459,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 602). Second, one cannot commit vandalism without defacing, damaging, or destroying property (see \u00a7 594), but one can commit burglary and trespass without harming any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>property at all (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 602<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>). Third, the harm that vandalism by a spouse necessarily inflicts to community property or to the other spouse\u2019s separate property ousts the other spouse of his or her ownership interest in a way that neither burglary nor trespass necessarily does. Together, those differences foil Wallace\u2019s endeavor to broaden to vandalism the rule that applies to burglary and trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Instead, on the question before us, we broaden our holding in <em>Kahanic </em>to embrace the emerging rule imposing criminal liability on a spouse for intentionally causing harm to property in which the other spouse has an interest, whether the property is individual or marital, whether the harm occurs outside or inside the marital home. <em>(Kahanic, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 466; see, e.g., <em>Jackson v. United States </em>(D.C. 2003) 819 A.2d 963, 964-967 <em>(Jackson) </em>[spouse criminally liable for harm to marital property at marital home under statute prohibiting harm to property \u201cnot his or her own\u201d]; <em>State v.

L.Rev. 641, 651 [\u201c[W]hen a husband destroys property that he owns jointly with his wife, not only does he destroy his property, which he may have a right to destroy, but he simultaneously destroys his wife\u2019s undivided one hundred percent interest in the property, which he does not have a right to destroy.\u201d]; cf. Carpenter, <em>Of the Enemy Within, The Castle Doctrine, and Self-Defense </em>(2003) 86 Marq. L.Rev. 653, 693 [\u201cThe innocent cohabitant still has an identifiable interest in the protection that the sanctuary might offer and should not be denied its safe harbor because someone else may share in its possession. [Fn. omitted]\u201d].)  Accordingly, we answer in the affirmative the question before us and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>hold that a spouse can be guilty of vandalizing community property and the other spouse\u2019s separate property inside the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Finally, on the premise that the Family Code confers on each spouse \u201cabsolute power of disposition\u201d of community personal property until service of a reciprocal temporary restraining order to the contrary (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1100, 2040, subd. (a)(2)), Wallace argues that as he and Pointer were not engaging in family law litigation, but rather were cohabiting as husband and wife, he cannot as a matter of law be guilty of vandalizing community personal property. Case law from other states applies the emerging rule to spouses cohabiting and presumably not engaging in family law litigation at the time of the vandalism (see, e.g., <em>State v. Superior Court, supra, </em>936 P.2d at p. 559; <em>Coria, supra, </em>48 P.3d at p. 981; <em>Ginn </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>553 S.E.2d at p. 840; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sevelin, supra, </em>554 N.W.2d at p. 522) as well as to spouses no longer cohabiting and either estranged or contemplating, if not actually engaging, in family law litigation at the time of the vandalism (see, e.g., <em>Jackson, supra, </em>819 A.2d at p. 964; <em>State v. Zeien, supra, </em>505 N.W.2d at p. 498; <em>Hughes v. State, supra, </em>56 P.3d at p. 1089; <em>People v. Schneider, supra, </em>487 N.E.2d at pp. 379-380.) Wallace articulates, and we perceive, no sound reason in public policy or the law for the astounding notion that the criminal law should afford protection to some spouses but not to others. We decline to so limit our holding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">2.-10.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The resisting conviction is ordered stricken from the judgment, which is modified to show 269 days of presentence custody credit, 134 days of presentence conduct credit, and 403 total days of presentence credit. The matter is remanded with directions to the court to issue and forward to the appropriate persons an abstract of judgment amended accordingly. Wallace has no right to be present at those proceedings. (See <em>People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 407-408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].) Otherwise the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Levy, Acting P.

Even were we to consider his argument, we would not grant relief. \u201cAs generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited <em>and </em>in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
