As a matter of public policy, we conclude that such a suit cannot be maintained. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing this case after sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Appellant Richard McBride was romantically involved with respondent Garianne Dashiell, then known as Garianne Boughton.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At some time during 1996, presumably in the fall, McBride moved to Chile. In December 1996, however, Boughton contacted him in Chile and informed him that she was pregnant with a child that she represented was his. Based on this representation, McBride returned to the United States and took a teaching job in order to support Boughton and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The child, a girl, was apparently bom on or about May 26, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the month of May 1997, McBride and Boughton orally agreed that McBride would support Boughton for a year so that she could stay home and take care of the child. In June 1998, when the child was about a year old, Boughton began working again, and McBride resigned his job in order to become the child\u2019s full-time caregiver. It is not entirely clear from the complaint, but McBride and Boughton apparently lived together in the Los Angeles area during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In December 1998, Boughton moved out of McBride\u2019s house, and told him, as alleged in the complaint, \u201cthat she would soon stop paying the bills, and that he would have to return to work.\u201d The child was not yet ready to adapt to day care, however, so McBride continued to act as her full-time caregiver for about another five or six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In May 1999, when the child was about two years old, McBride went back to work, taking a position as a flight attendant. In June 1999, McBride and Boughton agreed orally that McBride would have custody of the child 10 days each month. Nevertheless, in September 1999, Boughton told McBride that she was moving to San Francisco, evidently with the child, and that he would be able to see the child only two weekends a month. In October 1999, McBride filed a paternity proceeding seeking custody of the child, who was by then almost two and one-half years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In connection with the paternity proceeding, genetic tests were done, and the testing service reported that McBride was \u201cexcluded as the biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>father of the child . . . .\u201d McBride learned the results of the genetic tests in December 1999. Evidently, he then abandoned his efforts to seek custody of the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">On December 31, 2001, McBride filed the instant action seeking money damages against Boughton and Dashiell, who he alleges is the child\u2019s biological father. His original complaint alleged causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation and for unjust enrichment, as well as a common count for money had and received. After respondents\u2019 demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, McBride filed a first and then a second amended complaint. Each of the amended complaints omitted the tort causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation that had been included in the original complaint, pleading only unjust enrichment and a common count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Respondents demurred to both of McBride\u2019s amended complaints. The trial court sustained the demurrer to the second amended complaint, granting McBride leave to amend only for the limited purpose of stating a cause of action against Boughton for breach of contract. McBride did not file another amended complaint within the time allowed, so the trial court entered a judgment dismissing the action. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. We also consider matters which may be judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>noticed. Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context, and ignoring erroneous or confusing labels if the complaint pleads facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief. <em>(Richelle L., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 266; see also <em>Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38-39 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513]; <em>Moore v. Regents of University of California </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125 [271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479].) In short, our task is to determine whether the pleaded facts state a cause of action on any available legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">McBride\u2019s second amended complaint includes two causes of action. The first is captioned as one for unjust enrichment. After incorporating the factual allegations summarized above, this cause of action avers that respondents were unjustly enriched by McBride\u2019s having paid for the care and support of Boughton and the child, because respondents \u201cwere legally responsible for the monies paid out by [McBride], and would have had to incur those expenses if [McBride] had not done so.\u201d The premise of this claim is that McBride\u2019s expenditures for the support of the child unjustly enriched respondents, as the child\u2019s biological parents, because McBride was not the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">McBride\u2019s second cause of action is in the form of a common count for money had and received, alleging that respondents \u201cbecame indebted to [McBride] for money paid, laid out and expended to or for defendants at defendants\u2019 special instance and request.\u201d This cause of action also alleges that Boughton promised in writing to repay the money McBride spent to care for her and the child, and failed and refiised to make any payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The trial court sustained respondents\u2019 general demurrer to both of McBride\u2019s causes of action. In a written order, the court reasoned that \u201call purported causes of action as to [respondents] are precluded by applicable public policy,\u201d citing <em>Nagy v. Nagy </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262 [258 Cal.Rptr. 787] <em>(Nagy).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">To the extent that McBride\u2019s second cause of action was an attempt to plead a cause of action for breach of an express written contract, the trial court sustained a special demurrer for lack of particularity, but granted McBride leave to amend. As already noted, McBride failed to do so. \u201cWhen a plaintiff elects not to amend after the court sustains a demurrer with leave to amend, we assume the complaint states as strong a case as possible, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>we will affirm the judgment if the unamended complaint is objectionable on any ground raised by the demurrer. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gutkin v. University of Southern California </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 967, 981 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 115], citing <em>Soliz </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 577, 585 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 184].) The record does not make clear whether McBride even intended to plead a cause of action for breach of an express contract, but on appeal, he does not argue that the trial court erred in sustaining the special demurrer. Thus, we deem McBride\u2019s contract claim, like his tort claims, to have been abandoned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In sustaining respondents\u2019 general demurrer, the trial court relied on <em>Nagy, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 1262. In <em>Nagy, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s estranged wife revealed during a deposition in their dissolution proceeding that the couple\u2019s child was not the plaintiff\u2019s biological offspring. The court held that the former husband\u2019s action against his former wife for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred because, among other reasons, it would be contrary to public policy to allow a putative father to recover damages \u201cfor developing a close relationship with a child misrepresented to be his.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1269.) The <em>Nagy </em>court placed the plaintiff\u2019s claims in the same category as \u201c \u2018betrayal, brutal words, and heartless disregard of the feelings of others[, which] are beyond any effective legal remedy and any practical administration of law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Prior to the decision in <em>Nagy, </em>this division reached a similar result in <em>Richard P. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1089 [249 Cal.Rptr. 246] <em>(Richard P). </em>In <em>Richard P, </em>the plaintiff was a married man, Gerald, who had separated from his wife. After the separation, the wife\u2019s lover, Richard, established that he was the biological father of the couple\u2019s children. Gerald then sued Richard, alleging that Richard had previously misrepresented to him that the children were biologically Gerald\u2019s, and had thereby induced Gerald to support them and develop a relationship with them. We held that Gerald\u2019s tort claims seeking damages for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, on the basis of misrepresentations as to paternity, were barred by public policy <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1093-1096), reasoning that \u201cthe innocent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>children here may suffer significant harm from having their family involved in litigation such as this[,] and . . . this is exactly the type of lawsuit which, if allowed to proceed, might result in more social damage than will occur if the courts decline to intervene.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1094.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Richard P. </em>is not dispositive of the present case, however. As McBride\u2019s brief in the present case correctly points out, in a footnote in <em>Richard P, </em>we expressly declined to \u201cforeclose the possibility that a man in [McBride]\u2019s position might be able to recover actual out of pocket costs incurred in supporting another man\u2019s child[] on an equitable theory for reimbursement, such as unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>(Richard P., </em>supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1096, fn. 3.) We expressly noted that the issue was not before us, and that we were not required to decide it. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Citing the <em>Richard P. </em>footnote, McBride contends that <em>Nagy </em>is distinguishable because of the nature of <em>the </em>damages he is seeking, i.e., not general damages for the emotional impact of Boughton\u2019s conduct, but rather, reimbursement for the out-of-pocket expenses he incurred in contributing to the child\u2019s support\u2014a relatively ascertainable and quantifiable form of damages that was not involved in <em>Nagy, </em>because the plaintiff in that case had waived any right to sue for them. <em>(Nagy, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 1269.) Thus, this case calls upon us to decide the question we noted, but left open, in <em>Richard P.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Whether respondents\u2019 demurrer to McBride\u2019s second amended complaint was properly sustained depends, however, not on the nature of the damages McBride seeks, but rather on the viability of the causes of action he has attempted to plead. The first cause of action is labeled as one for \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however, or even a remedy, but rather \u201c \u2018 \u201ca general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies\u201d \u2019. . . . [Citation.] It is synonymous with restitution. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Melchior </em>v. <em>New Line Productions, Inc. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 347].) Unjust enrichment has also been characterized as describing \u201c \u2018the result of a failure to make restitution ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 198, fn. 15, quoting <em>Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774] <em>(Lauriedale).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">In reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a general demurrer, we ignore \u201c[ejrroneous or confusing labels ... if the complaint pleads facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief. [Citation].\u201d <em>(Saunders </em>v. <em>Cariss </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 905, 908 [274 Cal.Rptr. 186]; accord, <em>Richelle L., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 266.) Thus, we must look to the actual gravamen of McBride\u2019s complaint to determine what cause of action, if any, he stated, or could have stated if given leave to amend. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>accordance with this principle, we construe McBride\u2019s purported cause of action for unjust enrichment as an attempt to plead a cause of action giving rise to a right to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">There are several potential bases for a cause of action seeking restitution. For example, restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud or is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason. (See generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, \u00a7\u00a7 148-150, pp. 218-220; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 118, pp. 137-138, 142-144.) Alternatively, restitution may be awarded where the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or similar conduct. In such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to seek restitution on a quasi-contract theory (an election referred to at common law as \u201cwaiving the tort and suing in assumpsit\u201d). (See, e.g., <em>Murrish </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1209 [224 Cal.Rptr. 308] [election to waive tort and sue in assumpsit is a fiction that broadens remedies available to plaintiff, but does not create a contract where none existed]; see generally 55 Cal.Jur.3d (May 2004) Restitution and Constructive Contracts, \u00a7 21.) In such cases, where appropriate, the law will imply a contract (or rather, a quasi-contract),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without regard to the parties\u2019 intent, in order to avoid unjust enrichment. (See generally 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, \u00a7\u00a791, 95-96, 99-110, 116, pp. 122-123, 125-126, 128-136, 140-141; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 160, pp. 229-230; see also 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 517, pp. 607-608 [discussing use of common count to seek quasi-contractual restitution in lieu of tort damages].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In the present case, neither McBride\u2019s complaint nor his briefs on appeal makes clear upon which of these theories his unjust enrichment claim is based. It clearly is not based on the existence of a contract that is unenforceable, however, because McBride has abandoned any claim that he and Boughton had an express contract. Thus, the only possible premise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>McBride\u2019s cause of action for unjust enrichment is that he is entitled to restitution from Boughton on a quasi-contract or assumpsit theory based on her tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Under the law of restitution, \u201c[a]n individual is required to make restitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another. [Citations.] A person is enriched if the person receives a benefit at another\u2019s expense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(First Nationwide Savings v. Perry </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 173] <em>(First </em>Nationwide).) However, \u201c[t]he fact that one person benefits another is not, by itself, sufficient to require restitution. The person receiving the benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances are such that, as between the two individuals, it is <em>unjust </em>for the person to retain it. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1663, italics in original; see also <em>California Medical Assn. </em>v. <em>Aetna U.S. Healthcare of California, Inc. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 151, 172 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 109]; <em>Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 881]; Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 1, com. c, p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In keeping with the doctrine\u2019s focus on the <em>unjust </em>nature of the enrichment, \u201c[i]t is well settled that restitution will be denied where application of the doctrine would involve a violation or frustration of the law or opposition to public policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lauriedale, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p. 1449.) Thus, \u201c[d]etermining whether it is unjust for a person to retain a benefit may involve policy considerations. For example, if a person receives a benefit because of another\u2019s mistake, policy may dictate that the person making the mistake assume the risk of the error.\u201d <em>(First Nationwide Savings v. Perry, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1663.) Moreover, a person otherwise entitled to restitution may lose that entitlement if \u201crestitution would seriously impair the protection intended to be afforded by common law or by statute to persons in the position of the transferee or of the beneficiary, or to other persons.\u201d (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 62, p. 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that two of the most fundamental public policies of this state\u2014the enforcement of parents\u2019 obligations to support their children, and the protection of children\u2019s interest in the stability of their family relationships (see, e.g., <em>In re Jesusa V. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 588, 614, fn. 8 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 205, 85 P.3d 2]; <em>County of Orange </em>v. <em>Leslie B. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 976, 980 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 797])\u2014 preclude us from requiring Boughton to make restitution to McBride based on his claim of unjust enrichment. Under circumstances such as those presented here, if we granted the former putative father the right to restitution from the child\u2019s biological parents, who retain responsibility for its support, we would give priority to the former putative father\u2019s desire to be made financially whole, to the potential detriment of the child\u2019s ongoing needs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>(Cf. Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 62, com. a, pp. 241-242 [situations in which restitution should not be ordered for public policy reasons include those where \u201cthe transferee is under the special protection of the law, a protection which would be weakened if restitution were permitted . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">More importantly, at least from the child\u2019s perspective, by <em>declining </em>to recognize an unjust enrichment claim, we create a ^incentive for an unmarried man to form a parental bond with a child if the bond is likely to be severed upon the child\u2019s proving to be another man\u2019s genetic offspring. The potential emotional and psychic costs to the child of such a rupture are far more significant than any financial injury a grown man might suffer from mistakenly supporting another man\u2019s child for a temporary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">These considerations were similarly of paramount importance in <em>Susan H. v. Jack S. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1435 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 120], in which the court applied the conclusive presumption of husband\u2019s paternity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to reject a mother\u2019s paternity suit against a third party, despite proof that her husband was not the child\u2019s biological father. In doing so, the court supported its holding by relying on the child\u2019s interest in preserving the \u201cpalpable and formative familial relationship\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1443, fn. 5) established between the child and the mother\u2019s estranged husband, who had played a parental role for the first four years of the child\u2019s life: \u201cThe state has an \u2018interest in preserving and protecting the developed parent-child and sibling relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.\u2019 [Citation.] This interest is served notwithstanding termination of the mother\u2019s marital relationship with the presumed father. \u2018 \u201c[I]n the case of an older child [over two years of age] the familial relationship between the child and the man purporting to be the child\u2019s father is considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity. A man who has lived with a child, treating it as his son or daughter, has developed a relationship with the child that should not be lightly dissolved and upon which liability for continued responsibility to the child might be predicated. This social relationship is much more important, to the child at least, than a biological relationship of actual paternity ....\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1442-1443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Nebraska Supreme Court also made precisely this point in rejecting a similar unjust enrichment claim for past child support in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Heller </em>(2002) 264 Neb. 934 [653 N.W.2d 475]. In the words of that court, an \u201cassumpsit claim that seeks to recover for the creation of a parent-child relationship has the effect of saying T wish you had never been bom\u2019 to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>child who, before the revelation of biological fatherhood, was under the impression that he or she had a father who loved him or her. [Citation.] We decline to allow a party to use a[n] . . . assumpsit claim as a means for sending or reinforcing this message.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Moreover, our holding\u2014that it is not unjust enrichment for a mother to retain child support she has received\u2014serves an important public policy by sending the message to unmarried putative fathers that they should verify their paternity at an early stage if there is any doubt about the matter. Significantly, the Legislature has sent the same message to married men by providing a statutory incentive for them to resolve promptly any doubts they may have as to the paternity of their wives\u2019 children. Under the applicable statutory scheme, if a married man fails to request paternity testing within two years of the birth of a child to his wife, and he is neither infertile nor impotent, he will be conclusively presumed to be the child\u2019s father, with all the concomitant responsibilities as well as rights. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7540, 7541; see <em>In re Marriage of Freeman </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1444\u20141452 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 439] [requiring husband to pay child support even though child was determined to be offspring of wife\u2019s lover, where biological tests were not done within two years of child\u2019s birth; rejecting constitutional challenge to statute making presumption of husband\u2019s paternity conclusive after two years]; see also <em>Rodney F. </em>v. <em>Karen M. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 233, 239-240 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 399] [declining to allow married woman\u2019s lover to challenge husband\u2019s paternity; rejecting constitutional challenge to conclusive presumption].)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In addition, we note that determining whether Boughton was <em>unjustly </em>enriched would involve inquiring into the very subjects which <em>Nagy, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 1262, and <em>Richard P., supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d 1089, held public policy requires courts to avoid. Issues of this type would include, but not be limited to: (1) the extent to which McBride\u2019s expenditures exclusively benefited the child, rather than Boughton personally, and if so, the effect of that fact on the equities of McBride\u2019s restitution claim against Boughton and Dashiell; (2) if restitution is owed, whether its amount should be reduced by the value of any benefit, emotional or financial,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that McBride received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>his relationship with the child; and (3) how, if at all, the equities of McBride\u2019s restitution claim may be affected by his decision to end his relationship with the child rather than pursuing any rights he may have had under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Because of the lurking presence of issues such as these, we concur with the <em>Richard R </em>court\u2019s concern that the \u201cinnocent child[] here may suffer significant harm from having [her] family involved in litigation . . . which, if allowed to proceed, might result in more social damage than will occur if the courts decline to intervene.\u201d <em>(Richard P., supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1094.) We recognize that <em>Richard P. </em>declined to consider whether this rationale would extend to a suit seeking only restitution for support paid rather than emotional distress damages, because the issue was not presented in that case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1096, fn. 3.) Having now considered it, in a case in which it is squarely presented, we have concluded that the type of harm to the child about which <em>Richard P. </em>expressed concern is as likely to be realized here as it was in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In short, for much the same public policy reasons on which <em>Nagy </em>and <em>Richard P. </em>relied in declining to authorize a tort claim for the loss of a purported father\u2019s relationship with a child, we likewise decline to authorize a restitution remedy for support payments based on facts such as those pleaded in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to McBride\u2019s cause of action alleging unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we have given due consideration to the opinion by Division One of this court in <em>Dunkin v. Boskey, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 171 <em>(Dunkin). </em>In <em>Dunkin, </em>our colleagues followed <em>Nagy </em>and <em>Richard P. </em>in disallowing damages for emotional distress based on the plaintiff\u2019s loss of a parental relationship with his nonbiological child. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 193-195.) They went on to hold, however, that the plaintiff <em>could </em>recover his \u201creadily ascertainable economic loss [i.e., the cost of supporting the child] under an unjust enrichment theory. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Dunkin </em>involved an express written contract between an infertile man (Dunkin) and a woman (Boskey), both unmarried, which granted Dunkin parental rights to a child that Boskey planned to conceive through artificial insemination from an anonymous donor. <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 178-179.) When the child was about two years old, the pair became estranged, and Boskey moved away and refused to allow Dunkin to visit the child. Dunkin\u2019s suit to establish paternity and custody was dismissed for lack of standing. He then sued Boskey for breach of their contract. Boskey argued that the agreement was void and unenforceable as against public policy, and her demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On appeal, the court held that Dunkin and Boskey\u2019s contract did not \u201cso offend[] public policy as to require us to find it illegal or invalid.\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 189; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 192.) Thus, although the contract could not \u201cgrant parental rights to [Dunkin] that the law otherwise expressly denies to him, infringe upon the authority of the court to provide for the appropriate custody and support of the child, or abridge the rights of the child, as between [Dunkin] and [Boskey] it is binding. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Turning to the issue of remedies, the court held that \u201c[t]he preclusion of [Dunkin\u2019s] claim for general damages for emotional harm on public policy grounds does not operate to deny him recovery of special damages for readily ascertainable economic loss under an unjust enrichment theory. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 195.) In so holding, the court noted that \u201c[a] contract unenforceable in its entirety for public policy reasons may still be enforced in part under compelling circumstances where the lawful and unlawful portions of the agreement may be separated. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 196.) In the case before it, the <em>Dunkin </em>court reasoned, public policy only precluded enforcement of the contract by certain remedies\u2014i.e., specific performance or damages for emotional harm\u2014and that the relevant public policy considerations would not be contravened by an award of compensation for Dunkin\u2019s economic loss. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Although <em>Dunkin </em>was decided in July 2000, well over a year before McBride filed his complaint in this case, the parties did not cite or discuss it either in the trial court or in their briefs on appeal. We accordingly requested supplemental letter briefs. Not surprisingly, McBride\u2019s supplemental briefs contend that <em>Dunkin </em>supports his position. Respondents\u2019 supplemental brief, on the other hand, argues that <em>Dunkin </em>is distinguishable. For the reasons we will explain, we concur in respondents\u2019 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The fact that McBride\u2019s claim is one for quasi-contractual restitution, arising from Boughton\u2019s alleged misrepresentations about his paternity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sharply distinguishes the present case from <em>Dunkin. </em>In fact, from a public policy prospective, <em>Dunkin </em>presented the converse concern from that existing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The <em>Dunkin </em>court recognized the possibility that requiring the defendant in that case to reimburse the plaintiff could \u201cindirectly compromise the funds presently available to her for support.\u201d On the facts of the case before it, however, the court concluded that \u201cthe equities . . . and public policy considerations still fall in [the plaintiff]\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 197.) The equities favored the plaintiff in <em>Dunkin </em>because he had voluntarily agreed to assume a support responsibility that he would not otherwise have had, in exchange for the opportunity to enjoy a parental relationship that was later unilaterally severed by the child\u2019s mother, in breach of her agreement. In this case, by contrast, McBride supported the child in the belief that he was her biological father (thus making it his legal responsibility to do so), without taking any steps to ascertain whether or not this was actually the case. On these facts, we believe the equities fall in the <em>child\u2019s </em>favor, and her interest in respondents\u2019 continuing ability to support her trumps McBride\u2019s interest in obtaining restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Moreover, in <em>Dunkin, </em>the plaintiff was aware from the start that the child he agreed to support would <em>not </em>be biologically his, and his claim against the child\u2019s mother was not based on any misrepresentation to the contrary by her. Rather, his claim was based on the mother\u2019s breach of an express contractual promise to treat him as the child\u2019s father. Here, in contrast, McBride alleges that he agreed to support the child merely because Boughton told him that it <em>was </em>biologically his, and having found out that this was untrue, he is now asking the court to imply a quasi-contract giving rise to a right of restitution in his favor. For the reasons of public policy that we have already discussed, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">McBride\u2019s second amended complaint also includes a second cause of action framed as a common count for money had and received. A common count is not a specific cause of action, however; rather, it is a simplified form of pleading normally used to aver the existence of various forms of monetary indebtedness, including that arising from an alleged duty to make restitution under an assumpsit theory. (See <em>Zumbrun v. University of Southern California </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1, 14\u201415 [101 Cal.Rptr. 499]; see generally 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 514\u2014518, 522(1), pp. 603-609, 612.) When a common count is used as an alternative way of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action is demurrable. (See <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Zerin </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 459-460 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 707]; <em>Zumbrun v. University of Southern California, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>25 Cal.App.3d at p. 14; see 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Pleading, \u00a7 529, pp. 616-617.) Thus, in the present case, McBride\u2019s common count must stand or fall with his first cause of action, and we therefore uphold its dismissal for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">McBride doubtless acted within his legal rights in relinquishing his paternal role when the child he had voluntarily cared for and supported proved not to be his biological offspring, and her biological father wished to assume responsibility for her. The effect of our holding in this case, however, is that if a man\u2019s willingness to parent his nonmarital partner\u2019s child is conditioned on its being his biological offspring, he proceeds at his own risk in failing to verify his paternity at an early stage in the child\u2019s life. A child does not come with a money-back guarantee of paternity. If it proves to be genetically unrelated to its putative father, our holding means that he will not be able to enlist the aid of the courts in seeking reimbursement from the child\u2019s biological parents for the contributions he has made to its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Kline, P. J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\u201cBecause this appeal is from a pretrial ruling sustaining demurrers without leave to amend, our recitation of the facts assumes the truth of all facts properly pleaded by the plaintiff-appellant [citations], and likewise accepts as true all facts that may be implied or inferred from those [he] expressly alleges.

Before filing their brief on this appeal, respondents moved to augment the record with their requests for judicial notice, as well as the documents of which they requested notice be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Neither our record nor the motion to augment reflects whether McBride opposed respondents\u2019 requests for judicial notice in the trial court, or whether they were granted. Nonetheless, McBride did not oppose respondents\u2019 motion to augment the record in this court, and we hereby grant it. (See <em>Hansen v. Hansen </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 618, 621 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 688] [granting unopposed motion to augment appellate record with documents filed in related judicial proceeding].)

This allegation was not included in the second amended complaint, which was the operative pleading at the time judgment was entered. We are not sure why this allegation was omitted.

One out-of-state case has been cited to us by the parties, but it is of limited relevance; in <em>Inez M. v.
