David B. petitions for relief from an order of the juvenile court which concluded his three-year-old daughter, Susan, could not be safely released to his custody at the conclusion of the reunification period, and set the matter for a permanency planning hearing\u2014at which time his parental rights will likely be terminated. This is always a drastic remedy, reluctantly adopted. Here we conclude it was chosen too quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Although David had no contact with Susan from the time she was five months old and her mother disappeared with her, until she was a year and a half old and taken into custody by the Orange County Social Services Agency (SSA), he immediately demonstrated a commitment to her when he was notified of her plight by SSA. During his 18 months of reunification, he did virtually everything SSA requested of him, and then some. He even requested anger management classes on his own initiative, to avoid any possibility he might subject his daughter to the type of violence that had marred his own childhood. It is undisputed by everyone that he loves his daughter and has shown consistent dedication to her welfare and their reunification. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>what David did not do is move out of the residence he shared with his sister and her husband and establish a separate residence for himself and Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">And what SSA did not do is tell him that such a move would be required to obtain custody. Nor did it offer David any assistance in obtaining alternative housing at any time during the final six months of the reunification period. Instead, SSA focused on minor quibbles concerning David\u2019s parenting abilities, his illiteracy, and the concern that Susan had not sufficiently \u201cbonded\u201d with him during his 18 months of steady visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Although the trial court properly rejected some of SSA\u2019s concerns about David, it did agree with SSA\u2019s assessment that David lacked an understanding of \u201cbasic [parenting] concepts,\u201d because he asked too many questions about matters the court assumed every reasonable parent would instinctively know. It also agreed that the fact David\u2019s brother-in-law had once committed an act of domestic violence involving his own daughter meant that Susan could not be released to reside with David in that home. After David conceded he did not, at that time, have any other home to offer Susan, the court concluded it could not safely release Susan into David\u2019s custody and set the case for a permanency planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We conclude the order cannot stand. There is no support in the record for the conclusion David lacks basic parenting abilities in any sense that would indicate danger to Susan. The fact he asked a lot of questions to ensure that his care of Susan was appropriate and to learn from the experiences of others, should be lauded, not derided. Moreover, David\u2019s responses to the questions posed to him during the hearing demonstrated a high degree of attention to and awareness of Susan\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">As for the concern about releasing Susan to reside in the same home as David\u2019s brother-in-law, we are not convinced that the brother-in-law\u2019s one confrontation with his own teenage daughter, more than three years ago, indicates any general tendency toward child abuse, and therefore a significant danger to Susan. Nor does the record suggest the court independently reached that conclusion. Instead, according to the court\u2019s own explanation, it apparently \u201cdeferred\u201d to SSA\u2019s judgment on the issue. That was improper: Because SSA specifically had the burden of <em>proving </em>the contention, it was entitled to no such deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">But even if the court had independently concluded that the brother-in-law represented a potential danger to Susan\u2019s safety, that determination would not automatically demonstrate Susan could not safely reside in the same home with him. The court should have considered less drastic alternatives, such as an order allowing Susan to reside in the home, but placing restrictions on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>interaction with the brother-in-law. With Susan expected to be in daycare during David\u2019s working hours, and both David and his sister also residing in the home, there is little reason to fear that Susan would ever have to be left alone in the care of David\u2019s brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Moreover, if SSA believed that Susan should not be allowed to reside in the same household as the brother-in-law, then it should have given David a clear warning that his ability to take custody of Susan might actually be contingent upon finding some <em>other </em>place to live, and it should have done so at a time when David still had sufficient opportunity to act upon the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">But the record here reveals no such warning, and no substantial assistance in resolving the perceived problem. Instead, it demonstrates that SSA focused its attention on lesser or even irrelevant concerns (such as the perception that Susan had not \u201cbonded\u201d with David), and relegated the housing issue to secondary status\u2014something to be addressed if David ultimately measured up in the other ways it deemed important. It simply failed to focus on the one issue\u2014housing\u2014that is arguably determinative in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Loath as we are to second-guess the trial court, there is simply no basis for this result. We consequently reverse the order and remand the case with instructions that the court reconsider its determination that David\u2019s brother-in-law presents a substantial danger to Susan\u2019s safety, applying its own independent judgment, and indulging no presumptions in favor of SSA\u2019s contentions; and if the court concludes Susan cannot be returned to David\u2019s custody at that time, issue a new order reflecting that the services provided to David during the final six-month reunification period were inadequate, and requiring SSA to offer additional reunification services. If, after the provision of such services, David is still unable to provide Susan with a suitable residence, the court may reissue the order terminating services and schedule the permanency hearing, or make any other order appropriate to the circumstances at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed. David had some contact with Susan for the first five months of her life, before Susan\u2019s mother disappeared with her. After that, David was unable to locate them. In August of 2002, when Susan was two, she was taken into custody due to her mother\u2019s substance abuse and mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">After Susan was taken into custody, her mother was unwilling to identify Susan\u2019s father. Susan\u2019s maternal grandmother eventually identified David as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the father, and he was contacted by SSA. At that time, David was unemployed and had no fixed residence. He was spending several days a week at his sister\u2019s home, and the rest with his then girlfriend. David reported to SSA that he had suffered from substance abuse in the past, beginning when he was 14 years of age. However, in 1996 he had entered the Phoenix House substance abuse program. Although that proved ultimately ineffective for David, he subsequently entered another facility, the Roque Center, for a 120-day inpatient program, followed up by six months in a sober-living home. He had been drug-free for 20 months when SSA first contacted him about Susan. He voluntarily submitted to drug testing several times per week prior to the dispositional hearing, and never submitted a positive test.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">David did not immediately seek custody of Susan, and explained to the social worker that he felt he needed to establish a steady income, stable housing, and a relationship with Susan before assuming her care, as he was unsure of his ability to handle it. He did, however, immediately seek visitation and a chance to reunify with her. He also asked to take an anger management class, as he wanted to be sure Susan was never exposed to the violence which had marred his own childhood. According to the SSA report prepared in connection with the jurisdictional hearing, David\u2019s \u201cservice objectives\u201d included \u201c[s]how that you know age appropriate behavior for your child\u201d; \u201c[o]btain and maintain a stable and suitable residence for yourself and your child\u201d; \u201c[hjave and keep a legal source of income\u201d; \u201c[b]e nurturing and supportive when you visit your child\u201d; \u201c[o]btain resources to meet the needs of your child and to provide a safe home\u201d; \u201c[mjaintain relationship with your child by following the conditions of the visitation plan\u201d; \u201c[djevelop positive support systems with friends and family\u201d; and \u201c[s]tay free from illegal drugs and show your ability to live free from drug dependency.\u201d David\u2019s proposed reunification plan required counseling, an \u201cage appropriate\u201d parenting class, a drug/alcohol treatment program, and drug testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The dispositional hearing took place in December of 2002. Although the petition alleged several counts and detailed substantial facts evidencing improper behavior by Susan\u2019s mother, as well as substance abuse and mental health issues which adversely affected her ability to parent, it alleged very little as to David\u2014only that he \u201cknew or reasonably should have known\u201d that Susan\u2019s mother was unable to properly care for the child due to substance abuse and mental illness. The petition was modified to strike the actual knowledge allegation, and David submitted on the allegation that he \u201creasonably should have known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">During his first six-month reunification period, David complied with his service plan. He enrolled in a substance abuse program, a parenting class and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>an anger management class. He tested regularly for drugs, visited steadily (and in increasing amounts as SSA allowed) with Susan, and participated in 19 sessions of therapy with her, without missing a single one. He also obtained employment doing cleanup in a bakery. He consistently expressed his desire to reunify with Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In connection with the six-month hearing, SSA reported to the court that David was making slow and steady progress, but needed additional work. It expressed its concerns that he had been unable to find suitable employment because of his illiteracy and an arrest record related to his past drug use, and that he had not fully utilized referrals designed to address his illiteracy. SSA also noted in its report that David was attempting to obtain a suitable residence which would allow for the presence of the child. In a separate \u201cCase Plan Update\u201d report, SSA described David\u2019s progress toward his objective of \u201cobtaining] and maintaining] a suitable residence for [him]self and [Susan]\u201d by noting that David was residing with his sister, and that while the home was physically adequate, his brother-in-law\u2019s \u201crecent history of domestic violence . . . would make placement of the child unsuitable at this time.\u201d It does not state whether that specific concern was discussed with David, or if so, what was said. It does, however, by its clear language, suggest the home might be suitable at a future time.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The six-month hearing was held in May of 2003. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court determined that continued supervision was required and Susan could not be returned to the custody of either parent. It increased David\u2019s visitation to three hours of unmonitored visitation two times per week, and set the matter for an interim review in July and a 12-month review in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For the interim review in July, SSA reported that David was working seven days a week cleaning Barnes and Noble bookstores on a split shift. He had been spending increased amounts of time at his girlfriend\u2019s home and had taken Susan there for visitations. When he was told that his girlfriend\u2019s home had not been approved for visitation, he agreed not to take her there anymore. The report also noted that the instability of his living situation, splitting time between residing with his sister and his girlfriend, was the \u201cmost significant obstacle\u201d to placing Susan with him. It did not discuss the suitability of either home as a permanent option.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In connection with the 12-month review, SSA reported that David was continuing to work at his custodial job, but had apparently terminated his relationship with the girlfriend and was now living full time with his sister and her family. The report also explained, in a separate \u201crelative placement\u201d section, that in August of 2003, David\u2019s sister and brother-in-law met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>the social worker to inquire about possibly placing Susan in their home. The report then merely notes \u201c[The brother-in-law] was not able to be cleared due to arrests within the past 3 years.\u201d It does not state that David was present during the meeting or was informed about SSA\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">SSA\u2019s report also notes, in a later section, that David \u201cbelieves that housing remains his main obstacle to reunification with the child\u201d and that \u201che has considered a number of possible housing options for himself and the child.\u201d In the \u201cservice objectives\u201d portion of the report, it notes that David \u201ccontinues to struggle with acquiring adequate housing for himself and his child\u201d and \u201ccontinues to strive for adequate financial and housing resources.\u201d The report then notes that \u201c[o]n August 14, 2003, the [social worker] provided an extensive listing of housing resources in Orange County to the child\u2019s father to assist with locating housing.\u201d The social worker later acknowledged he did not review the referrals orally with David, despite the fact he knew David to be illiterate. Instead, he relied upon David\u2019s statement that his sister would read them to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">SSA\u2019s report reflects that its own primary concern was not David\u2019s housing situation, but instead its worries about his ability to be \u201cnurturing and supportive\u201d with Susan. SSA identified that as \u201cthe area which is currently of greatest concern for [David].\u201d The report did not actually describe any problems with David\u2019s conduct, but only with Susan\u2019s perceived lack of attachment to him: \u201cThe child has demonstrated a clear and observable reluctance to participate in visitation with the father. The caretaker has reported that the child\u2019s actions prior to visitation have alternated between refusal to go and happiness. This area remains an area of growth and improvement for [David].\u201d The report then stated David was to receive \u201cin-home parenting assistance specifically focused on working on attachment and bonding, facilitating positive parent-child interactions.\u201d The social worker later explained that he had gone to extreme lengths to arrange the in-home parenting assistance\u2014as he put it \u201cI had to plead a little\u201d\u2014because it was generally not offered until after a child is placed in the parent\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The 12-month hearing took place in September of 2003. The court concluded continued supervision was necessary, that there was a substantial probability Susan would be returned to the custody of her parent within the next six months. It ordered additional reunification services. The 18-month review hearing was scheduled for February of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">SSA\u2019s report for the 18-month review describes David\u2019s progress, noting he was \u201cgenerally compliant with the Court ordered case plan,\u201d but had not successfully complied with it \u201cin that he has not acquired adequate resources to provide [for] himself and the child.\u201d It explains that \u201c[t]o his credit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>[David\u2019s] parenting skills have improved during the course of the current dependency action. Furthermore, [David] has demonstrated a consistent commitment to reunification efforts on behalf of his daughter. However, while [David\u2019s] parenting skills have improved, [he] has not successfully demonstrated a successful ability to provide daily, around-the-clock care for the child.\u201d The report went on to explain that David had left his custodial job after his hours were cut. He subsequently worked a temporary job in a warehouse for a couple of months and was seeking additional employment. The report stated that David had been dropped from his in-home parenting program after he missed two of the nine sessions due to work conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The report additionally explained David had progressed to 12 hours of unmonitored visitation per week, and had asked for an overnight visit on Christmas Eve. In connection with that request, on December 21, 2003, the social worker conducted a scheduled home visit to the residence David shared with his sister and her family. The social worker concluded the home was deficient for an overnight visit in several respects, including a lack of basic supplies, such as a crib or high chair; accessible containers of makeup in the room belonging to David\u2019s teenage niece; the presence of some cleaning supplies under a sink; and a lack of child safety devices preventing access to dangerous items. David was refused permission for the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The report also reflected SSA\u2019s thoughts on placing Susan with a relative. In addition to reiterating that David\u2019s sister and brother-in-law had inquired, it also stated that a maternal aunt by marriage had been enjoying unmonitored visitation with Susan since January of 2004. The aunt had expressed an interest in adopting Susan and was considered \u201can active placement consideration.\u201d According to the report, David had expressed concerns about this aunt\u2019s adoption of Susan, but at one point indicated \u201ca willingness\u201d to allow the adoption as long as he would be allowed to maintain contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Finally, the report stated its assessment of David: \u201cTo his credit, the child\u2019s father has progressed slowly and steadily in his ability to care for and nurture the child. The child\u2019s father has demonstrated a consistent commitment and dedication to reunification efforts with his daughter. The father\u2019s progress is noteworthy; however, [he] has not demonstrated the ability to provide for the ongoing emotional or physical needs of the child. While [David] is aware of his need for improved literacy and job skills, he has not taken any observable steps to improve the likelihood of obtaining adequate resources for himself and his daughter. [David] has been sporadically employed throughout the life of this case. [He] indicates that he is living with his sister in Westminster, California.\u201d Based upon all of that information, SSA concluded David was not in a position to have Susan placed with him, and recommended termination of reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Other than the social worker\u2019s visit to assess David\u2019s residence (which he continued to share with his sister and her family) for overnight visitation, the 18-month report did not reflect any effort to address the issue of David\u2019s housing situation during the six-month reporting period. Instead, it merely reiterated the fact that David had been given a list of housing resources back in August of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The 18-month hearing commenced in February of 2004. The social worker who prepared SSA\u2019s reports testified. He stated he had been assigned to the case in September of 2002, essentially at its inception. He acknowledged that David had complied in nearly every respect with his reunification plan, and agreed that David had demonstrated an unfailing commitment to Susan and was \u201cmaking steady progress\u201d in his parenting abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">When asked about David\u2019s residence, the social worker first stated he was not even clear where it was. \u201cThe father has reported that he is living with his sister. I have some conflicting information about that. So I don\u2019t\u2014to be honest with you, I don\u2019t know that I have a solid answer about where he is staying.\u201d When asked if he had ever visited the sister\u2019s residence, the social worker described his inspection of the premises after David had requested permission for Susan to have overnight visitation with him. Although the social worker denied permission for the overnight visitation, for the reasons stated in his report\u2014lack of safety equipment and basic gear necessary for the care of a toddler\u2014he nonetheless continued to allow Susan to visit the home for 12-hour unmonitored visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The social worker stated he did discuss with David the reasons why he concluded the residence was physically inappropriate for Susan to visit overnight, but he never followed up to determine whether David had cured the problems identified. As he explained, \u201cI was never asked\u2014the father never said that he had taken care of them. I did understand from a recent contact with the father that he had been advised to get those things in preparation for the return of the child. But I never heard anyone tell me that those concerns had been addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The social worker also stated he had concerns about the sister\u2019s residence because of her husband\u2019s history of arrests for alcohol-related offenses as recently as 2001, and one incident of physical violence involving a child in 2001. He acknowledged that he had no facts about any of the incidents, however, and conceded it \u201cwould be helpful\u201d to have that information. He also acknowledged he had been provided with documentation demonstrating that the husband had completed a six-month alcohol treatment program. Nonetheless, the social worker stated his opinion that the husband\u2019s past history was of sufficient concern that Susan should not be released into the same home where he resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The social worker also stated he considered David\u2019s ability to adequately parent Susan to be \u201can unanswered question,\u201d and said he had not been able to assess the issue sufficiently because of the limited, and unmonitored, visitation David had enjoyed. As he explained: \u201cI have not said that he doesn\u2019t have the ability. What I\u2019m saying is we have not been able to assess\u2014we have not had the opportunity to assess his ability to parent the child.\u201d When asked about his concern that David tended to call the foster parents and seek guidance whenever a problem arose, the social worker acknowledged that \u201c[ijt\u2019s not a regular thing\u201d and agreed that \u201c[sjeeking advice is always a positive thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">David also testified. He described his experience in parenting class, explaining that the class taught parents about the different stages of childhood. Unfortunately, the class to which he was referred covered only five year olds through teenagers, which was not immediately relevant to the father of a two year old. So he \u201ctook the teacher aside and asked her, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve got... a two-year old. What should I do?\u2019 \u201d She advised him to \u201clisten to the child, and watch what she does and watch every movement she does. And pick up what she\u2019s doing a learn from it.\u201d He also learned \u201cto be there for [Susan], and love her and try to teach her what I know to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">He described his visits with Susan, stating \u201cwe play with toys. I take her places, take her to the park. I just try to be the best father I can for what I know.\u201d David stated that he changed Susan\u2019s diapers several times during each 12-hour visit. When asked what foods he feeds her during visits, he replied \u201capples, bananas, french fries, . . . milk, . . . chicken, potatoes, her vegetables.\u201d He explained that Susan had teeth and could chew things well, and was then learning to feed herself with a baby fork. He also noted that when she was younger, Susan had a tendency to \u201cshov[e] food in her mouth,\u201d so they had to teach her to eat slowly, and take smaller bites.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">David also stated that if he were given custody of Susan, he could transport her to places she needed to be either by bus or in his sister\u2019s car. He stated that he had a license, his sister\u2019s car was insured, and he had a car seat for Susan. Additionally, David explained that after the social worker visited his home to assess it for an overnight, he made all the changes requested: \u201cI got the plug safety put in the plugs. I got the\u2014it\u2019s like a high [cjhair, but a booster chair with a highchair tray on it to sit on the chair. I got an\u2014it\u2019s not a crib, but it\u2019s a toddler bed with the rails on the side of it for her. I got new sheets for her. . . . We bought locks for the cupboard doors. We did that. And basically we did everything he told us to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">David acknowledged he had established no plans for Susan\u2019s medical care, because he had no family doctor and no insurance. He stated that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>asked the foster mother about Susan\u2019s medical care, and was told she \u201chas services from the county.\u201d He assumed that if he needed help, he could call Susan\u2019s foster mother, or ask his sister. Otherwise, he had not given it much thought, \u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t in my care 24-7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">David was asked where he would \u201cbuy the supplies\u201d he needed for Susan, David replied: \u201cI buy diapers at Walmart. I buy food at the grocery store. I feed her the same food that I would eat. HQ . . . HQ Because she\u2019s at the age where she don\u2019t need baby food or anything. I would buy\u2014I got sippy cups for her. I\u2019m teaching her how to drink out of a regular cup. And I am on the verge of trying to potty-train her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">When asked if he knew what her \u201cteething situation\u201d was, David responded: \u201cRight now she has her back molars. [][]... [|] There\u2014on Sunday they were bothering her. [f] . . . HD And I usually keep Tylenol. But I couldn\u2019t find the Tylenol. So I called the foster parent, and she\u2014. .. HQ ... I called the foster parent Linda and they said if she is not running a high fever, it\u2019s not\u2014they usually [just] watch her closely.\u201d David went on to explain that after talking to the foster mother, he did not give Susan any Tylenol, but just \u201cchecked her\u2014had her open her mouth, and I touched it to make sure it wasn\u2019t hurting her and it wasn\u2019t. I was doing the things that basically what I know.\u201d David then said that if he needed to take Susan to a dentist, he would go to the one his sister uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">David stated that his current employment was working for a roofer, but because of the slow winter season, he had also been working for temporary agencies. He explained that his hours as a roofer were generally from seven in the morning to five in the evening, and that he usually had weekends off. He had arranged for Susan to have child care during his work hours from his aunt, whom he described as having been previously \u201capproved because she used to take care of my cousins.\u201d This aunt lives about a half-mile from David\u2019s residence, and he explained that either the aunt would pick Susan up, or David and his sister would transport her there.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">David was then asked a hypothetical question about what he would do if Susan suddenly developed a fever while in his care. He responded: \u201cIt depends how high it was. Say 103,1 would take her to the emergency room. HO . . . HQ And get a\u2014get the doctor\u2019s opinion what I should do.\u201d When asked what emergency room he would go to, he replied \u201cprobably Huntington Beach Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">David was also asked about his brother-in-law. He stated that he had known him about 20 years, since he and David\u2019s sister were in the ninth grade. David stated that he did not know any of the details of his brother-in-law\u2019s record, and considered it not his business. When asked whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>should be concerned about the people who might be living with his child, David responded \u201cSince you brought that up, I know my brother-in-law and he is not a violent person. H] . . . [j[] When he is around my daughter, my daughter loves him. I mean, she really loves him. And he is really good with my daughter, good with his kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">At that point in the hearing, the court adjourned for the day. The following day, the court suspended the hearing pursuant to a stipulated order that Susan would begin one-night-per-weekend overnight visits with David as soon as SSA could approve the home. After four weeks of one-night-per-weekend visits, the schedule would be increased to two nights per week until the hearing reconvened in April. Additionally, SSA was to reinstitute in-home parenting services for David, and apply for a waiver to allow Susan to be in the same home as David\u2019s brother-in-law and report to the court about the result of the application as well as the circumstances of the brother-in-law\u2019s record. The court specified that pending receipt of the waiver, the brother-in-law\u2019s status would not be a bar to the overnight visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Toward the end of the two-month break, SSA reported to the court that its recommendation was unchanged. The report stated that the social worker had made a visit to David\u2019s home in March, and had observed that he had made all the changes previously requested and as testified to by David in the earlier part of the hearing. Nonetheless, the social worker noted additional problems, including a stained carpet, pet odor, and debris in the back and side yard which made them unsuitable for a child\u2019s play area. He requested additional changes, and when he returned a few days later, those changes had also been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Susan began one night per week overnight visits on March 13. In early April, the foster mother reported that Susan seemed \u201cexhausted\u201d and \u201cout of sorts\u201d after overnight visits with David. Nonetheless, the overnights progressed to a two-night extended stay on Easter weekend, April 9, 2004. The social worker made an unannounced visit to witness Susan\u2019s transfer from the foster parent to David on that Easter weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">During that transition, Susan was heard to say \u201cNo more Daddy.\u201d The social worker asked David if he had a driver\u2019s license and David said \u201cI think so.\u201d However, when the social worker examined it, it proved to be expired, to David\u2019s apparent surprise. The social worker further observed that David was driving a vehicle with what he considered to be \u201cobviously deficient. . . tread in the middle third of the tire[s].\u201d The social worker then told David not to drive Susan around during the upcoming weekend, but then released them to go on their way. When David returned Susan at the end of the weekend, the social worker was once again present. David\u2019s sister was driving the car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Susan was reported to be sleepy, but in good condition, with only a \u201csomewhat sunburned\u201d face. David explained that Susan had been given sunscreen, but had spent a great deal of time playing outside with other relatives during the Easter holiday.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The report also noted that SSA had received a letter from the brother-in-law on April 12, explaining the circumstances of his domestic violence incident. The letter explained that in May of 2001, the spouses had an argument which included pushing. He was arrested for domestic violence and willful cruelty to a child. He pleaded guilty to the domestic violence and served 90 days in jail. The child cruelty charge was dropped. He completed a 52-week anger management/domestic violence class, and a 34-week alcohol/drug intervention course. He was also separated from his family for 12 weeks due to a mandatory restraining order put into place while his wife completed a \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">An arrest report concerning the domestic violence charge added more detail to the alleged incident. The brother-in-law was described as \u201cvery intoxicated.\u201d His daughter, then age 14, was interviewed. She stated that she had returned home at 11:15 in the evening and was confronted by her father. They argued and he squeezed her arm. When she pulled away, he grabbed both arms. She again pulled away and told him to leave her alone. He attempted to pick her up and put her over his shoulder. She began hitting him in the face and tried to get away. He wrestled her to the ground and grabbed her around the throat with both hands, choking her. After several seconds, he let her go and went inside the house. His wife was interviewed and stated that he had been drinking alcohol all day and was very drunk. They were arguing and he started pushing her around. He yelled at her and pushed her out the door. When she tried to come back inside, he pushed her in the chest, causing her to fall down. He then locked the door and would not let her inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Although the brother-in-law\u2019s criminal record confirms his statement that the child cruelty charge made against him was dropped, the Child Abuse Registry does include a substantiated child abuse report based upon the incident, and the family received \u201cvoluntary Family Maintenance, Non Court services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Otherwise, the brother-in-law\u2019s record included one count of possession of a controlled substance for sale in 1992, two arrests for alcohol-related conduct in 1995 and 2002, and a conviction for intoxication, disorderly conduct and misdemeanor assault in 1999. Based upon that record, SSA refused to approve a waiver allowing Susan to reside in the same home with the brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The report also noted the social worker had made an unscheduled visit to David\u2019s residence on April 18, 2004. He and Susan had been resting, and David reported having a headache which he attributed to the after-effects of a car accident he had suffered 10 years before. The social worker observed David and Susan for an hour, but noted that Susan spent most of the hour interacting with him rather than David. David was observed disciplining Susan, and explained she \u201cdoes stuff just to aggravate me.\u201d When he disciplined Susan, David would sit her on the couch and \u201cspeak in a firm tone.\u201d But David was also observed \u201ctickling [Susan] playful[ly],\u201d and he stated that he enjoyed having Susan with him and that they had been having a good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Final v, report stated that David had received five weeks of in-home parenting services, although they had taken place at a time when Susan was not present, and thus \u201coffer very little insight into the parenting skills and ability of [David] [as had been anticipated and desired.]\u201d SSA had received a report from someone identified as a \u201cChild Abuse Prevention Center in-home parenting aide,\u201d who visited with David on two occasions over a five-day period. She stated David had expressed reluctance to take Susan to public places, because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t sit still.\u201d The aide also noted that she had given David some referrals to assist him in obtaining better employment, but felt he was moving very slowly in following up. The aide was concerned about David\u2019s lack of progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In its final assessment of David, SSA stated: \u201cThe expanded visitation with the child\u2019s father is reported by the father to be a positive experience for him. However, the child\u2019s reaction has been less positive and of increasing concern to the undersigned. [!]... [f] During the course of this supervision, the undersigned has repeatedly observed the child\u2019s father to express a consistent desire to reunify with the child and to strive toward that end. However, the child\u2019s father has also struggled with his ability to overcome his own difficult childhood experiences and his lack of experience as a parent, to develop the ability to provide basic nurturing and care for the child. It is clear to the undersigned that the child\u2019s father loves his daughter very much. However, it is both the observation and the opinion of the undersigned <em>after more than twenty months of services and increasing visitation between the child and the father, the child appears to be tolerating contact with her father. </em>[][]... [f] The father is to be commended for his efforts. There is no question that he has worked long and hard to reunify with the child. Nonetheless, <em>the child\u2019s father does not appear to be capable of making sound decisions or of establishing the nurturing and loving relationship so vital during a child\u2019s early development. </em>Additionally, the child\u2019s father is unable to adequately provide for the child\u2019s basic needs and is completely dependent upon the generosity of the paternal aunt for housing and other resources.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>When the hearing recommenced on April 26, 2004, the social worker once again took the stand to explain SSA\u2019s conclusion that Susan could not be safely placed in David\u2019s custody. The first concern he articulated was the perception that Susan had not bonded to David. He stated that in his opinion, the lack of a bond put Susan at risk because \u201clack of attachment and . . . reciprocal connectedness could be an indicator and precursor [of] . . . physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, you name it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The social worker then acknowledged that while David had actually demonstrated an ability to handle his anger, and thus it was not an issue \u201cin the short term, immediate future,\u201d he nonetheless believed the issue \u201cis definitely on the horizon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The social worker also stated that he did not believe David could provide round-the-clock care for Susan without assistance, based upon the numerous questions he asked about basic issues during the periods Susan was in his care. He explained, \u201cit\u2019s not so much that he is seeking help, it\u2019s the kind of help, the basic fundamental stuff that parents\u2014that we would expect someone to grasp, at this point, after parenting and after all this time interacting with the child\u2014what to do for naps, what to do for food, what to do to interact with the child, how to discipline the child without scaring the child, how to\u2014all those things that I don\u2019t see happening in this case without a lot of support.\u201d The social worker was also concerned that David failed to recognize potential dangers, such as Susan\u2019s access to dangerous chemicals, or debris in the yard, until specifically advised by someone else. In the social worker\u2019s opinion, David simply needed too much guidance, and had demonstrated \u201ca pattern of either poor judgment or lack of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The social worker also stated that SSA would not sign a waiver to allow Susan to reside in the home with David\u2019s brother-in-law, due to his domestic violence and criminal history. He explained he had concerns about the cleanliness of the home, although he acknowledged that the home was at that point in an acceptable state. He nonetheless was concerned that it could \u201ceasily return\u201d to being \u201cunfit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">When asked if he had spoken to David about living someplace else with Susan, the social worker referenced only the conversation he had with David back in August of 2003: \u201cNot recently, but we have explored that, previously, and I gave him every housing resource that I have in Orange County. And we talked <em>about\u2014this was several months ago now. </em>We have explored those options, and nothing has ever come of them that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The social worker never ran through hypothetical scenarios with David to assess his ability to handle difficult situations with Susan. He made no effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to do so until one week prior to the continuation of the 18-month hearing, but David called to inform him he could not make the scheduled meeting. David stated he would attempt to make up the meeting the next day, but was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">When the court asked the social worker whether he had ever spoken with David about whether he would be able to arrange child care and other aspects of Susan\u2019s care if he got a place of his own, the social worker replied: \u201cWe have talked about child care, briefly, and\u2014but we have never even gotten that far. So I don\u2019t believe so, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">At the resumed hearing, David testified he had obtained a 90-day extension on his driver\u2019s license, and that if he were unsuccessful in passing the test for a renewal, he would make arrangements for Susan\u2019s transportation with others or through public transportation. He testified that he had family support to assist him in his care of Susan; in addition to his sister and brother-in-law, he mentioned his aunt, uncle, grandmother, and a cousin and her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">He also testified that he did not believe his brother-in-law to be any danger to Susan, but if he were told that he could not leave Susan alone with him, he would follow that rule. He agreed that exposure to domestic violence would be harmful to Susan, and stated that if any future incidence of such violence were to occur in his sister\u2019s home, he would find another place for himself and Susan to live. David explained that he had grown up in an abusive household, with a \u201cvery violent\u201d father, and stated \u201cfrom the way I was raised, I will not ever hit my child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">He denied having contacted Susan\u2019s foster mother for advice as much as the social worker testified, but acknowledged that he had done so on several occasions, because \u201cshe knows my daughter better than I do.\u201d He also explained how he had learned from the foster mother\u2019s answers, and gave examples of how he applied the strategies she suggested when similar problems arose on later occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">David explained that he had begun looking into alternative housing arrangements, but had identified only a program which required him to have a full-time job. If he were given custody of Susan, he also intended to apply for aid from the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program, but explained that he could not do so until he had documentation such as Susan\u2019s medical records and birth certificate. He acknowledged that if he were not living with his sister and her husband, he could not support Susan \u201cright now.\u201d The court asked him \u201cif I was inclined to return the child to you today and told you you couldn\u2019t five with your sister and brother-in-law, you would kind of be at a loss; right?\u201d He agreed: \u201cThink so, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The court then issued an order terminating reunification services and scheduling the case for permanency planning hearing. It explained: \u201cFather has done 18 months of services. Father has done basically everything the court has asked father to do, with one exception. And that is, father has not prepared himself for the return of this child. And because father has not done that, the court finds that there is continued risk to the child, [ft] Father has not gotten himself a job. Father has not\u2014has not gotten himself an apartment to take care of this child. Father has not looked into medical care for this child. Father has not looked into medical insurance for this child. Father has not prepared himself for the child physically being returned to father, [ft] Father argues through his counsel that the court should return [the child] to father because father was [living] with the sister and brother-in-law, and that they can help father take care of this child. They went to social services and were not able to obtain a waiver. . . . [ft] <em>If the court thought for a minute that social services was abusing its discretion, the court would [disregard social services recommendation]. However, the court believes that social services has legitimate reasons for not placing this child, </em>[ft] The report indicates that this home has many needs and those needs are such that it would place the child at risk if those needs were not met. . . . <em>That\u2019s the physical needs of the home, </em>[ft] Social services also has concerns that <em>the sister and </em>brother-in-law have unresolved drug and alcohol and domestic violence problems. . . . [ft] . . . The report indicates that the last incident was about 18 months ago. However, the court has heard <em>no evidence in this matter that those problems have been resolved. . . . </em>This court would not order the child placed at that residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The court also gave a second reason for denying custody to David: \u201cThe court has no question that the father loves this child. The court has no question that Father had a good time with this child on the visits, [ft] The court has great concern, from the evidence, that father does not understand the very basic needs of this child. While the child is on visitation with father, the father calls the social worker and foster parents to get information on things that would seem to the court to be instinctive in raising a child, to be very basic in raising a child, [ft] The child doesn\u2019t like peas. So you give the child carrots. You don\u2019t need to call the social worker or the foster parents to know that. That\u2019s just something a parent knows, [ft] Father says the child won\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s a two-year old. Two-year olds never sit still. You follow a two-year old around, keeping them from falling down. That\u2019s what you do as a parent, [ft] And father doesn\u2019t understand those very basic concepts.\u201d Based upon these concerns, the court concluded Susan could not be released to David\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>David filed a petition for extraordinary relief with this court, arguing primarily that there was insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion that placing Susan in David\u2019s custody would create a substantial risk of detriment to her safety and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">After our own review of the record, we requested the parties provide additional briefing addressing the following issues: (1) whether SSA ever informed David that it had deemed the residence he shared with his sister and brother-in-law to be inadequate for Susan to reside in; (2) whether SSA offered or provided David with reasonable services to address what it perceived to be his lack of an adequate residence; (3) whether the court actually placed the burden on SSA to prove that releasing Susan to David\u2019s custody at the residence he shared with his sister and brother-in-law would create a substantial risk to her safety and well-being; and (4) whether the court abused its discretion in refusing to place Susan in David\u2019s home with reasonable restrictions and/or monitoring designed to mitigate any perceived danger from David\u2019s brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Initially, we note the trial court correctly disregarded SSA\u2019s assertions regarding David\u2019s illiteracy and Susan\u2019s purported lack of a significant bond with him. As the court explained, a parent\u2019s ability to read has no demonstrated correlation to his or her parenting skills or dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As for the issue of whether Susan felt bonded to David, this is simply not the relevant inquiry at this juncture. Until services are terminated, reunification is the goal and David is entitled to every presumption in favor of having Susan released to his custody. \u201cFamily preservation, with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services, is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced. [Citation.] Reunification services implement \u2018the law\u2019s strong preference for maintaining the family relationships if at all possible.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Elizabeth R. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1774, 1787 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 200].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The preference for maintaining family relationships does not depend upon David\u2019s ability to make Susan feel bonded to him, especially when he has never had the opportunity to parent her on a day-to-day basis. The issue at this point is whether placing Susan in her father\u2019s care represents some danger to her physical or emotional well-being. The existence of a parental bond takes on independent significance only after the reunification effort is terminated and the case is sent to the permanency planning stage. In that context, the strength of a parent-child bond is significant, because a strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>enough bond may be sufficient to overcome the statutory preference for adoption over other permanent placement options. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">But we are not there yet. At this point in the proceedings, the burden is entirely on SSA, not David. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 308 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826], \u201cAt the dispositional hearing, and at each review hearing prior to permanency planning, there is a statutory presumption that the child will be returned to parental custody. ... At 6-, 12-, and 18-month review hearings the juvenile court must return the child to the custody of the parent unless it determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that return of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being.\u201d (See also <em>In re Jasmon O. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 398, 420 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 878 P.2d 1297].) Consequently, review hearings represent one of the \u201c[significant safeguards . . . built into the current dependency scheme.\u201d <em>(In re Marilyn H., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">What SSA was required to establish was that releasing Susan to David\u2019s custody would \u201ccreate a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.22, subd. (a).) That standard, while vaguely worded to be sure, must be construed as a fairly high one. It cannot mean merely that the parent in question is less than ideal, did not benefit from the reunification services as much as we might have hoped, or seems less capable than an available foster parent or other family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We do not get ideal parents in the dependency system. But the fact of the matter is that we do not get ideal parents anywhere. Even Ozzie and Harriet weren\u2019t really Ozzie and Harriet. Ideal parents are a rare\u2014if not imaginary\u2014 breed. Some of us get luckier than others when it comes to parents, and most who work in this system are able to look back and realize how fortunate they were. But the State of California is not in the business of evaluating parents and redistributing their offspring based upon perceived merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The parents who come through the dependency system are more in need of help than most. If we are lucky, they are parents who can learn to overcome the problems which landed their children in the system, and who can demonstrate the dedication and ability to provide for their children\u2019s needs in an appropriate manner. They will not turn into superstars, and they will not win the lottery and move into a beachfront condo two blocks from a perfect school.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>This is a hard fact to accept. We are dealing, after all, with children, and the dedicated people who work so hard to help these families are understandably desirous of providing those children with the best possible circumstances in which to grow up. But there are times when we have to take a step back and make sure that we are not losing sight of our mandate. We are looking for passing grades here, not straight A\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In this case, the court concluded that Susan would be at risk in David\u2019s custody based in large part on the fact that David consulted frequently with both the foster mother and the social worker during the times he was caring for Susan, thus demonstrating his own inability to deal with the everyday issues of parenting. But the example given by the court (i.e., \u201c[t]he child doesn\u2019t like peas. So you give the child carrots. You don\u2019t need to call the social worker for the foster parents to know that. That\u2019s just something a parent knows\u201d) indicates the court was focused on details, rather than the essential question of whether Susan\u2019s safety, protection, physical or emotional well-being would be placed at substantial risk in David\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">When we are considering whether to deprive a parent of custody, we are concerned only about his or her grasp of the important parenting concepts\u2014things such as a child\u2019s need for security, adequate nutrition and shelter, freedom from violence, proper sanitation, healthcare, and education. Whether a child\u2019s preference for carrots over peas should be indulged is not a significant issue, and certainly not one that should ever play into a custody determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The other issues mentioned by the court, i.e., David\u2019s mentioning that Susan \u201cwon\u2019t sit still\u201d and \u201cdoes things to aggravate him\u201d are likewise insignificant. We cannot think of any parent (or caretaker) of a two year old who would not complain about those things. There is a reason the age is called \u201cthe terrible twos.\u201d The more salient issue is whether David reacts inappropriately to Susan\u2019s behavior, and there is no evidence he ever did.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Further, we are seriously disturbed by any suggestion that David\u2019s tendency to ask for assistance in caring for Susan should be counted against him. He is a new father, inexperienced in dealing with a small child, and apparently far more afraid of making a mistake than of appearing stupid. And to that we say hallelujah. There are no new parents who have all the answers, and it is David\u2019s willingness to seek assistance when he is unsure of himself that perhaps best demonstrates his parental fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>In fact, the types of questions David posed, about how to deal with Susan when she acted out, what sorts of foods she preferred, and whether she should be given Tylenol for teething pain, frankly demonstrate an appropriate concern about significant issues. And David\u2019s explanation for turning to Susan\u2019s foster mother makes perfect sense: \u201cShe knows my daughter better than I do . . . and she gave me right things to do.\u201d David has not had custody of his child since her birth, and consequently this comment shows admirable insight into the limitations of their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Of course, asking for assistance could evidence a problem if the types of questions posed revealed a troubling mindset. For example, we would certainly agree there was a problem if the record indicated David had queried: \u201cWhat is the proper progression of discipline\u2014do I hold Susan\u2019s hand over an open flame only after a \u2018time-out\u2019 has proved unsuccessful?\u201d Or if he had wondered: \u201cWhich is better to calm her down, bourbon or gin?\u201d But David asked no such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We might also agree there was a problem if the parent\u2019s questions simply revealed an intractable unwillingness to provide appropriate care: \u201cCan you tell me why I have to keep changing the diaper when she is just going to dirty it again?\u201d Or \u201cIf I don\u2019t need a car seat, why should she?\u201d Indeed, as we have indicated, most troubling might be if David asked no questions at all. But David acknowledged his ignorance, and his questions invariably revealed a desire to provide better care, not lesser care.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Significantly, although the burden of proof was on SSA, even the social worker acknowledged he could not say David lacked sufficient parenting skills at the beginning of the 18-month hearing. He flatly stated \u201cwe haven\u2019t completed that assessment. [][] I don\u2019t think I can answer that. . . .\u201d The only thing that changed between that point and the conclusion of the hearing is a two-month break during which David was allowed overnight visits with Susan. Those went well, with the only problem reported being that Susan was tired and somewhat out of sorts afterward. Of course, the disruption in her routine would be more than sufficient to account for that result, and it is difficult to see how it could be said to evidence a lack of parenting skills on David\u2019s part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The social worker did explain that he had hoped the in-home service provider who worked with David during the two-month break would be able to add some insight on the issue of David\u2019s parenting skills, but acknowledged that had not worked out, since the services were offered at a time when Susan was not actually present (hardly David\u2019s fault). Thus, it appears there was no additional evidence developed in the gap between the first and second parts of the hearing which would justify a downgrade of David\u2019s parenting skills from \u201cunknown\u201d to insufficient. We consequently conclude SSA failed to sustain its burden on that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In short, SSA found flaws. It did not find anything which would overcome the presumption in favor of reunification by indicating Susan\u2019s return would create a substantial risk of detriment to her physical or emotional well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The court\u2019s other basis for denying David custody was that he was simply unprepared to take over Susan\u2019s custody. The court mentioned several things, including that David had not arranged for Susan\u2019s medical care or for insurance. We note that many lower-income parents cannot afford insurance and may not have regular relationships with private physicians. We cannot agree that would preclude them from retaining custody of their children. What is far more significant is that David did have a plan for how he would handle any significant and unexpected medical problems Susan might have\u2014 i.e., the hospital emergency room\u2014and that once David had custody of Susan, it would be a small matter to identify a local clinic where she could receive more routine care. Since there was no indication Susan needed to see a physician imminently, it seems unduly harsh to penalize David for\u2014in effect\u2014not having already scheduled her next checkup.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The court was also concerned that David had not gotten himself a steady job. We agree that a parent needs to have adequate resources to provide for his child, but again we must point out that the bar cannot be set too high. We cannot separate parents and their children merely because they are poor. There was no evidence David was unwilling to work, and indeed the record reflects he worked fairly steadily, albeit at several different jobs, throughout the pendency of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>What we find significant about David\u2019s job history is that he has found and maintained work even while maintaining a regular visitation schedule, attending classes, making testing appointments, and meeting with social workers. The record also reflected that David had substantial family support, not the least of which came from his sister and her husband. There was evidence that David did have sufficient resources to provide for Susan as long as they were permitted to remain in his sister\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Which brings us to perhaps the crux of this case. It was clear from the evidence that David did make preparations to have Susan returned to his custody\u2014in the home he shared with his sister and her family. He had baby-proofed it and obtained a bed, a booster seat, and the other supplies needed for a toddler. In fact, he did everything the social worker asked of him\u2014to prepare <em>that </em>home for Susan. And contrary to the court\u2019s statement, there was no evidence the home itself was physically insufficient. The social worker merely stated that \u201cwhile it\u2019s in order at this time, I believe it could easily return [to an unclean state.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In fact, the record reflects that the only real problem with placing Susan in David\u2019s current home was his brother-in-law\u2019s troubled history. And while the record also reflects SSA had reached the conclusion it would oppose such a placement fairly early in the case\u2014at least as early as August of 2003, which was prior to the 12-month hearing\u2014there is no evidence that David was ever informed of that specific concern. Instead, the record states that the social worker merely gave David some generic advice concerning the need for housing, along with a list of referrals, <em>also prior to the 12-month hearing, </em>and then never discussed the issue with him again. That was insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Of course, we recognize that \u201c[Reunification services need not be perfect. <em>(Elijah R. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 965, 969 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 311].) But they should be tailored to the specific needs of the particular family. <em>(Steve J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 798, 810 [41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 731].)\u201d <em>(In re Alvin R. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 962, 972 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 210].) As this court has previously explained, \u201cto make the requisite findings, the record should show that the supervising agency identified the problems leading to the loss of custody, offered services designed to remedy those problems, maintained reasonable contact with the parents during the course of the service plan, and made reasonable efforts to assist the parents in areas where compliance proved difficult (such as helping to provide transportation and offering more intensive rehabilitation services where others have failed).\u201d <em>(In re Riva M. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 403, 414 [286 Cal.Rptr. 592], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In response to our inquiry concerning the adequacy of services provided by SSA to address its concerns about David\u2019s housing situation, SSA requested that we: (1) consider a declaration from the social worker as a supplement to the evidence admitted at trial; (2) recognize that it would be unduly burdensome for SSA to document all of the services it provides; and (3) join the trial court in <em>assuming </em>that \u201ccertain non-statutory, but routine conversations and advisements . . . have been given.\u201d SSA then assured us that \u201cthe juvenile court <em>had no reason not to believe that reasonable efforts had been exercised </em>to timely advise [David] of the things he needed to do to effect Susan\u2019s return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">However, that assurance sounds suspiciously like an implicit assertion that the juvenile court was entitled to assume the services were reasonable, unless someone proved otherwise. That is not the standard. Instead, the law \u201crequires \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that such services have been offered to the parents. Under this burden of proof, \u2018evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt. It must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Monica C. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 296, 306 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Moreover, neither we nor the juvenile court can rely upon factual assumptions\u2014gleaned from SSA\u2019s \u201cregular supervisorial practices\u201d to establish clear and convincing evidence. SSA is not a machine; it is a team which includes numerous individual caseworkers\u2014each of whom is expected to give individual attention to the needs of each case. The fact that most social workers do things a certain way does not establish clear and convincing evidence that even those social workers <em>always </em>act that way\u2014let alone that another social worker necessarily did so in connection with the case at issue. If SSA wishes the court to consider certain actions of the social worker as evidence in a particular case, then SSA must introduce <em>evidence </em>that those actions took place in that case. The court cannot merely assume it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Of course, we are mindful of the basic requirement that we indulge all inferences in favor of the factual conclusions reached by the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>(In re Katrina C. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 540, 547 [247 Cal.Rptr. 784].) But those conclusions must be based upon substantial <em>evidence </em>which appears in the record, not upon the court\u2019s own unarticulated assumptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, there was no evidence which would have allowed the court to conclude SSA had provided David with sufficient assistance to reasonably address its concerns about his housing. The social worker himself testified at the 18-month hearing that he had last discussed the issue with David prior to the 12-month hearing, when he gave David a list of housing referrals. He conceded that he never followed up to see what David had done with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The only time the social worker paid attention to David\u2019s housing during the final six months of reunification was in December of 2003. The social worker responded to David\u2019s request to have overnight visits with Susan in the residence, but focused solely on the physical problems that then existed in the home, and apparently gave no indication he considered the residence unsuitable for other reasons. He never even paid attention to the fact that David was correcting the problems he had identified, and was thus perhaps unaware that David was proceeding with preparations for Susan to live there. Indeed, at the commencement of the 18-month hearing, the social worker indicated he wasn\u2019t even sure if David was residing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">What the social worker was paying attention to instead was his perception that Susan was not \u201cbonding\u201d to David. Although he admitted he was not a bonding expert, he nonetheless explained that in his view, such a bond is \u201cessential\u201d for a child of Susan\u2019s age, because a \u201clack of attachment and bonding and appropriate attachment or reciprocal connectedness could be an indicator and precursor to . . . physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, you name it.\u201d Given that opinion, we can see why he went to extraordinary lengths to address that particular concern, including \u201cpleading\u201d for in-home services to assist in fostering the bonding process. That was admirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">But however well meaning, the social worker ended up focusing on the wrong thing. The problem in this case was housing, and it was made short shrift of. David did everything else asked of him to obtain custody of Susan, and there is frankly no reason to presume that if he had been told living with his sister was not an option, he would not have done something about that too. We recognize, of course, that the trial court asked David if he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>able to support Susan \u201cright now\u201d if he were not living with his sister, and he conceded he could not. But that in no way demonstrates he could not have made arrangements to do so <em>over time, </em>if he had only been told it would be necessary, and been given reasonable assistance. Giving someone a list of housing resources and never again discussing with him that he <em>must </em>find a new housing resource, then telling him what he needs to do with his existing resource is obtain a high chair, child bed, and baby-proof the cabinets when all the while you consider the resource unacceptable is not only inadequate but counterproductive.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We are confident there are programs to assist those willing workers with criminal records, such as David, to find reasonable work. And even if he could not locate a better job, there are also programs designed to help with subsidized housing and food, and other assistance. These may be the very referrals already offered to David. But if they were offered at a time when he was under the impression that he had the option to remain with his sister, it is perhaps understandable that he did not jump on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Clearly, David already had a lot on his plate, and he might well have preferred to retain his current employment (however inadequate for the long run) and remain in his sister\u2019s home, with family, while he made the transition into his new role as a full-time dad. Indeed, we might have agreed that was the wisest course, had it been available to him. However, in the view of SSA, it was not, and David deserved to know that. We consequently conclude the services offered to David were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In any event, even without all the other problems, we would be compelled to reverse the order in this case. The record reflects, quite clearly, that the court deferred to SSA\u2019s \u201cdiscretion\u201d in determining that Susan could not be returned to David\u2019s custody while he continued to reside in the same household with this brother-in-law. That was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">This was not a determination under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 361.3 and 361.4, concerning placement of a dependent child with nonparental relatives. In that case, the Legislature has given SSA the express authority to veto the placement under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was instead a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>in which SSA had the express burden of proving to the court that the conclusions it had reached were correct. In that situation, SSA\u2019s conclusions are merely the starting point, not the ending point, of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We do not deprive parents of their children\u2019s custody merely because SSA asks us to. We do not schedule dependency cases for permanency planning hearings which will almost certainly terminate the parent-child relationship forever, merely because SSA asks us to. We do not presume that SSA\u2019s judgments about the propriety of returning children to their parents\u2019 custody are correct, even if we have previously found them to be correct in other cases. The final, and actual, judgment on the issue belongs to the court, not to SSA. And that judgment must be exercised independently, and in accordance with the proper standards of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Finally, even if the court had properly determined, based upon its own independent evaluation of the circumstances, that David\u2019s brother-in-law posed an unreasonable risk to Susan, we would conclude there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that danger could not have been addressed through less drastic means. No one was suggesting Susan be left to live with David\u2019s brother-in-law alone, and there was no evidence she would ever have to be left alone with him for even a short period of time. David testified he had arranged for Susan to be at daycare while he worked, and otherwise it appeared that both he and his sister would be available to provide for her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Both SSA and Susan\u2019s counsel assert there would be no guarantee that David would comply with a court order preventing him from leaving Susan alone with the brother-in-law, but he swore under oath that he would, and the record demonstrates he complied with every other order imposed upon him. That is pretty strong evidence in his favor. If an absolute guarantee of safety were required, we have a difficult time envisioning a case in which the court could properly return a child to parental custody. Even the mythical perfect parent cannot <em>guarantee </em>anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>In fine, this is one of those rare instances in which we are convinced the dependency system failed in its support for and evaluation of a parent. We are reassured by the effort expended on behalf of David and Susan\u2014by SSA, the attorneys, and the court\u2014but convinced their endeavors were misdirected and led to premature abandonment of this relationship. The difficult decision to permanently separate a two year old and her father requires more than was evident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Consequently, the petition for extraordinary relief is granted. The juvenile court is ordered to reconsider its determination that David\u2019s brother-in-law presents a substantial danger to Susan\u2019s safety, applying its own independent judgment, and indulging no presumptions in favor of SSA\u2019s contentions; and if the court concludes Susan cannot be returned to David\u2019s custody at that time, issue a new order reflecting that the services provided to David during the final six-month reunification period were inadequate, and requiring SSA to offer additional reunification services. If, after the provision of such services, David is still unable to provide Susan with a suitable residence, the court may reissue the order terminating services and schedule the permanency hearing, or make any other order appropriate to the circumstances at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Rylaarsdam, Acting R J., and Moore, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Moreover, despite the trial court\u2019s expressed certainty, reasonable minds can differ, and have, over whether a child\u2019s finicky eating habits should be accommodated or resisted. In other words, \u201cevery parent\u201d does not \u201cknow\u201d the same answer to that problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Granted, there was one incident during the two-month break which did demonstrate poor judgment on David\u2019s part. It was the fact that he arrived to pick up Susan for an overnight visit in a car with insufficient tire tread and at a time when his driver\u2019s license had expired. But it is not clear how that incident reflected on David\u2019s parenting skills specifically. Driving with an expired license is illegal, no question, and we certainly do not condone it. However, it is not necessarily unsafe. There was no evidence David was not a competent driver. And the problems involved in judging parental adequacy by automobile maintenance seem to require little discussion. In any event, we could not conclude the tire tread presented a significant danger, because the social worker acknowledged that after he discovered the problem, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>nonetheless allowed David to take Susan with him. As he explained \u201cIt was Easter weekend, and I didn\u2019t\u2014I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to not allow him to have his visit for that weekend. HD I did instruct him very clearly that he was not to be driving the child beyond the return trip home. And so when I showed up again, unannounced, on the following Sunday, April 11, he wasn\u2019t driving.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Likewise, the court was mistaken in implying that David\u2019s sister might have a history that presented an obstacle to the placement. To the contrary, the social worker expressly agreed that it was fine for Susan to be around her, and made clear that the perceived problem was caused solely by her husband. And the court was also incorrect in stating there was no evidence that the husband\u2019s problems had been addressed. The evidence actually showed he had completed substantial domestic violence training, as well as a lengthy substance abuse program. The family had also received family maintenance services. Both the wife and the daughter whom he was accused of abusing were still living in the home with him, without apparent further incident. Why are we requiring people to attend these classes and programs if we don\u2019t believe that <em>sometimes </em>they work?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Frankly, the assertion that the juvenile court can draw assumptions about SSA\u2019s conduct based upon its own familiarity with SSA\u2019s conduct in other cases, sounds like an implicit contention that the court can act as its own expert witness. But of course, even if that were true, the court would still be required, as all expert witnesses are, to state its opinions on the record, and provide a sufficient foundation for them. Alternatively, SSA might be suggesting the court could be taking <em>judicial notice </em>of SSA\u2019s usual and ordinary practices. However, \u201c[\u00a1judicial notice may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or required by law.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 450.)
