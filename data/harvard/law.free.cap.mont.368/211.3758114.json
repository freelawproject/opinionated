Goheen (Goheen) from representing Appellee Terance Patrick Perry (Terance) in this proceeding. We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err by denying Karen\u2019s motion to</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\n<em>disqualify Goheen as counsel for Terance pursuant to Rule 1.20 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">\u00b63 <em>2.

Did the District Court err by permitting Goheen to testify at the disqualification hearing?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">\u00b65 <em>4. Did the District Court err by relying on privileged communications between Goheen and Karen?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">\u00b66 <em>5. </em>Was <em>Karen denied due process when the District Court relied on documents and sworn testimony not subject to cross examination?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">\u00b67 <em>6. Did the District Court err by determining that Karen abused the rules of disqualification?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">\u00b68 On December 4,2009, Terance filed for dissolution of his marriage to Karen in Missoula County. Karen subsequently filed a dissolution proceeding in Massachusetts, which was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Terance is a partner of the law firm of Datsopoulos, MacDonald &amp; Lind, P.C. in Missoula. Terance was represented by three different attorneys before filing a notice of withdrawal and substitution of counsel on January 24, 2011, naming himself as counsel of record. On February 25, 2011, Terance filed a subsequent substitution of counsel naming Goheen as his counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">\u00b69 In January 2008, before any dissolution proceedings were filed, Karen contacted Goheen\u2019s office in Hamilton seeking legal advice concerning the potential filing of a dissolution action. Karen spoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>with Goheen\u2019s assistant, Kailah Van Note (Van Note), and later Goheen herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b610 Karen filed a motion to disqualify Goheen and an application for a preliminary injunction on March 1, 2011. Terance opposed the motion and filed two office memorandums and affidavits from Goheen and Van Note regarding their telephone conversations with Karen. A disqualification hearing was held on November 7, 2011. Two days before the hearing, Karen filed a motion to strike the office memorandums and affidavits as privileged, asserting that the documents \u201cincluded information which is harmful to [Karen].\u201d The District Court took the motion under advisement, granted the parties\u2019 motion to seal the documents from public access, limited Goheen\u2019s testimony about the documents, and did not permit Karen to cross-examine Goheen about the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b611 At the hearing, Karen testified that she provided personal information about herself and Terance during one telephone conversation with Van Note and two telephone conversations with Goheen. Karen said the conversations with Goheen lasted 45 minutes and 3 minutes, respectively. She said that she gave information about the marriage, including domestic abuse<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and finances, and that she asked for legal advice on her \u201cposition,\u201d which she described as: \u201c[w]here I wanted to end up. If I could end up at a certain place. What would happen if I stayed here. What happen if I left here. Goals of settlement. My weaknesses and fears.\u201d Karen testified that she identified individuals who were present during domestic disputes. She said Goheen quoted her a \u201cridiculously enormous\u201d retainer, but conceded that she was never sent a retainer agreement and that Goheen had \u201cdenied representation.\u201d Karen admitted awareness of some sort of conflict between Goheen and Datsopoulos, MacDonald &amp; Lind. Karen testified that she thought the information she gave to Goheen\u2019s office would be confidential. When asked by her counsel why she believed she had an attorney-client confidential relationship with Goheen in 2008, Karen said \u201c[b]ecause it was promised to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b612 When asked \u201c[h]ow does Gail Goheen\u2019s representation of your husband now, in this dissolution of marriage that he brought three years later, harm you,\u201d Karen responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[Psychologically, it\u2019s like getting beat up again by him. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t trust anybody. There\u2019s nobody I can turn to. He took away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>everything and everybody I could trust. And now he\u2019s done it again with somebody who I confided in, who\u2019s now on the opposite side of the table. And it -1 - I\u2019m betrayed again. It\u2019s another form of abuse and control...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">When asked \u201c[i]s there anything in the communications [from Goheen], even within the brief of the attachments, that you feel have already harmed you,\u201d Karen responded, \u2018Yeah ... I\u2019ve been called a liar. I\u2019ve been discredited already.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b613 Overruling Karen\u2019s objections that Goheen \u201ccan\u2019t testify to attorney-client communications and that she cannot be an advocate and material witness,\u201d the District Court permitted Goheen to offer testimony about the length of the telephone conversations, her office procedures, and background information established in the court file. Goheen testified without another attorney questioning her. Goheen admitted to having one conversation with Karen in January 2008, which she said lasted less than 12 minutes because the time entry information on the record was left blank and it is her office policy that time information is left blank when a conversation lasts 12 minutes or less. Goheen denied having a second conversation with Karen. Explaining her office procedures for new clients, Goheen stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">Whenever I meet with a client, Your Honor, I don\u2019t do it over the phone, in the sense of getting information. I sit down and I meet with the client for a half a day, usually, is my first meeting with a client on a divorce action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">It\u2019s at that time that I go over everything I can think of, in terms of - at least broadly, in terms of the scope of the case, what the assets may be, the liabilities may be, whether there are children, what the nature of the relationship is with the party. All details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">I\u2019m not interested in it, information, in terms of any details prior to that time. And my policy is that I never give anybody a retainer quote until I get all that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">So I can state unequivocably [sic] that I would not have given a retainer quote to Karen Perry, or any other client under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Goheen said she was aware that Karen\u2019s husband was an attorney at Datsopoulos, MacDonald &amp; Lind and that she does not represent someone against an attorney in Ravalli or Missoula County when the opposing attorney is from a firm that she regularly faces in divorce cases. Goheen said she did not remember the details of a conversation with Karen, relying on the office memorandums created from her and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Van Note\u2019s conversations with Karen. Goheen said that a 45 minute telephone conversation did not occur, and that her telephone records indicate she made a two or three minute telephone call to refuse the case and refer Karen to someone else. Goheen said she was notified by Karen\u2019s current attorney that Karen had contacted Goheen\u2019s office in September 2009 and in January 2010 but that her telephone records revealed only two telephone conversations with Karen in January 2008. Van Note also testified about Goheen\u2019s office procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b614 Throughout the hearing, Goheen referred to, and Karen repeatedly objected to, the office notes, memorandums, and the related affidavits, which were the subject of Karen\u2019s motion to strike. After the hearing, the District Court issued an order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Before issuing its ruling, the Court requests that Ms. Goheen submit a sealed copy of the \u201cNote\u201d from her office discussed at the hearing, along with any other relevant materials generated by Ms. Goheen or her staff pertaining to [Karen\u2019s] communications with Ms. Goheen and/or her office, for in camera review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">After receiving this information, the District Court denied Karen\u2019s motion to disqualify and application for a preliminary injunction. The court kept the documents sealed from public access. It found that no attorney-client relationship existed between Karen and Goheen, commenting that it was \u201chard to believe that, as a seasoned paralegal, Karen \u2018reasonably believed\u2019 she had an attorney-client relationship with Ms. Goheen.\u201d The District Court reasoned that Karen\u2019s motion to disqualify was \u201ca tactic designed to delay resolution of this case and force hardship and increased litigation expenses upon Terance,\u201d and \u201cdisqualification of Ms. Goheen would be unjust and unreasonably harsh in this case.\u201d Karen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b615 \u201cA district court\u2019s denial of a motion to disqualify is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle </em>Bank, 2012 MT 15, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635 (citing <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002). An abuse of discretion occurs if the district court acted \u201carbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded] the bounds of reason, in view of all the circumstances, ignoring recognized principles resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 27. \u201cThe existence of an attorney-client relationship is generally a question of fact.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). District courts have broad discretion to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>admissibility of evidence, including oral testimony, and we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650; <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 173, 103 P.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b616 \u201cWhile the denial of a temporary or permanent injunction is reviewed for \u2018manifest abuse of discretion,\u2019 deference is not applied to the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, which are reviewed de novo to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>City of Whitefish v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Flathead Co., </em>2008 MT 436, \u00b6 7, 347 Mont. 490, 199 P.3d 201; <em>Jefferson Co. v. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2011 MT 265, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 311, 264 P.3d 715). \u201cUltimately, it is this Court\u2019s \u2018constitutional mandate to fashion and interpret the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Ki-utzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>In re Rules of Prof. Conduct, </em>2000 MT 110, \u00b6 9, 299 Mont. 321, 2 P.3d 806).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b617 <em>1. Did the District Court err hy denying Karen\u2019s motion to disqualify Goheen as counsel for Terance pursuant to Rule 1.20 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b618 Karen claims that the District Court erred by not disqualifying Goheen because an implied attorney-client relationship was formed between Karen and Goheen when Karen gave Goheen information that was \u201cconfidential\u201d in nature, citing <em>Krutzfeldt </em>and <em>Pro-Hand Services Trust v. Monthei, </em>2002 MT 134, 310 Mont. 165, 49 P.3d 56. Terance argues that the District Court correctly found that there was \u201cnothing disclosed by Karen to Ms. Goheen or her staff \u2018that could be significantly harmful\u2019 to Karen in this matter\u201d to warrant disqualification under Rule 1.20 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct. Karen replies that she is \u201cpsychologically harmed\u201d by the fact that Terance has hired Goheen and \u201c[t]he district court did not properly address the correct standard or pertinent issue relative to Rule 1.20(c) with respect to the harm to <em>Karen </em>in determining Goheen\u2019s conflict of interest.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b619 We have not yet addressed a lawyer\u2019s duty to prospective clients under the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct as amended in 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We considered this relationship under prior rules in <em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>An implied attorney-client relationship may result when a prospective client divulges confidential information during a consultation with an attorney for the purpose of retaining the attorney, even if actual employment does not result.... In determining whether an implied attorney-client relationship exists, we will examine whether the alleged client reasonably believed that such relationship was formed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal citations omitted). Our ruling in <em>Pro-Hand Services </em>was based upon former Rule 1.9, entitled \u201cConflict of Interest, Former Client,\u201d requiring an analysis of whether confidential information had been exchanged. We adopted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201creasonable probability\u201d rule to determine whether confidences were disclosed. <em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Trone v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 994, 998 (9th Cir. 1980)). If confidential information was not disclosed, then an attorney-client relationship did not exist. <em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6 14. \u201cIf an attorney-client relationship was not formed, there is no conflict of interest,\u201d <em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6 13, and an attorney could then represent a client in a matter that was adverse to the former prospective client.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b620 In 2004, Rule 1.20, entitled \u201cDuties to Prospective Clients\u201d was adopted. Rule 1.20 defines and addresses a lawyer\u2019s relationship with a prospective client. It provides in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">(a) A person who consults with or has had consultations with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">(b) Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has had consultations with a prospective client shall not use or reveal information learned in the consultation(s), except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">(c) A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">(d) Representation is permissible if both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>writing, or: (1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and (2) written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">M. R. Pro. C. 1.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b621 Instead of determining whether an attorney-client relationship was created by disclosure of confidential information, Rule 1.20 creates duties to the prospective client \u201c[e]ven when no client-lawyer relationship ensues.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. 1.20(b). Generally, and subject to exceptions discussed herein, a lawyer may not \u201cuse or reveal information learned in the consultation(s)\u201d with a prospective client. M. R. Pro. C. 1.20(b). Pertinent to the present issue, Rule 1.20 also prohibits a lawyer from representing a party with \u201cinterests materially adverse\u201d to the prospective client in the same or substantially related proceeding \u201cif the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. 1.20(c). Thus, Rule 1.20 does not merely consider whether information was divulged by the prospective client but whether such information could be significantly harmful to that person in that or a related matter. Rule 1.18 of the American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rules of Professional Conduct (Model Rules) is nearly identical to Montana Rule 1.20. The Committee Comments to Model Rule 1.18 state \u201cthe lawyer is not prohibited from representing a client with interests adverse to those of the prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter unless the lawyer has received from the prospective client information that could be significantly harmful if used in the matter.\u201d Model R. Prof. Conduct 1.18 cmt. 6 (ABA 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\">\u00b622 Our recent holding in <em>Krutzfeldt </em>dealt with the distinction between current and former clients. Hoskins, an attorney representing the Krutzfeldts, joined the Crowley Fleck firm, which represented a party opposing the Krutzfeldts. Crowley argued that the Krutzfeldts necessarily became Hoskins\u2019 former clients, and were no longer current clients, when Hoskins joined Crowley. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 20. We rejected this argument and concluded that Hoskins did not withdraw from representing the Krutzfeldts, that Krutzfeldts were current clients when Hoskins joined Crowley, and a concurrent conflict of interest existed among Hoskins, Krutzfeldts, and Crowley. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">\u00b623 The rule enforced in <em>Krutzfeldt </em>applied to current clients, where the proponent of the motion to disqualify \u201cmust offer sufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>36). Rule 1.20 applies to prospective clients and prohibits representation of a party with materially adverse interests in the same or substantially related proceeding if the prospective client divulged information to the lawyer that could be significantly harmful to the prospective client in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b624 Karen is a \u201cprospective client\u201d as defined by Rule 1.20(a) (\u201cA person who consults with or has had consultations with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.\u201d). Karen called Goheen\u2019s office more than once and spoke with Van Note and Goheen concerning representation. The question here does not depend on whether an attorney-client relationship was established or whether Karen reasonably believed such a relationship was formed, as in <em>Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Rather, under Rule 1.20, the question is whether the information conveyed in Karen\u2019s conversations could be significantly harmful to Karen in this dissolution proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">\u00b625  After hearing the testimony, the District Court found that the information conveyed by Karen to Goheen was not harmful to Karen. The court found that Goheen\u2019s office documentation of Karen\u2019s phone calls and the testimony of Goheen and Van Note were credible and that \u201cthere was nothing disclosed by Karen to Ms. Goheen or her staff \u2018that could be significantly harmful\u2019 to Karen in this matter.\u201d Karen claims a personal or psychological victimization by Goheen\u2019s representation of Terance. While we do not minimize the significance of such an effect, Rule 1.20 requires that the lawyer receive \u201cinformation\u201d that is \u201csignificantly harmful\u201d to Karen in the proceeding. M. R. Pro. C. 1.20(c). Karen did not establish that any information she divulged to Goheen in the telephone calls several years earlier could have any impact on the proceeding, particularly since, as discussed below, Goheen was not associated as counsel until three years into the proceeding, by which time substantially more information had been disclosed than the information Karen claims to have shared during those phone calls. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Karen\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>to disqualify under Rule 1.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b626 <em>2. Did Goheen violate her duty to Karen under Rule 1.9 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b627 Karen claims that Goheen violated Rule 1.9 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, which Karen labels the \u201cduty of loyalty,\u201d by representing Terance. Karen\u2019s argument under Rule 1.9, entitled \u201cDuties to Former Clients,\u201d is premised upon her assumption that an implied attorney-client relationship was established between her and Goheen, making Karen a \u201cformer client.\u201d However, as noted above, Karen failed to establish an attorney-client relationship, and thus the portion of her argument premised thereon fails. Karen also argues that Goheen violated Rule 1.9 by using or disclosing information Karen had divulged to her. Because the provisions of Rule 1.9 regarding use of former client information are incorporated by Rule 1.20, governing the duties to prospective clients, we take up Karen\u2019s argument in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b628 Rule 1.20(b) provides that \u201ca lawyer who has had consultations with a prospective client shall not use or reveal information learned in the consultation(s), except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. 1.20(b). In turn, Rule 1.9 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: (1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or (2) reveal information relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">M. R. Pro. C. 1.9(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b629 Additionally, Rule 1.6, \u201cConfidentiality of Information,\u201d generally governs a lawyer\u2019s use of client information, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">(b) A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: (1) to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm; (2) to secure legal advice about the lawyer\u2019s compliance with these Rules; (3) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client; or (4) to comply with other law or a court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">M. R. Pro. C. 1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b630 As established under Issue 1, Karen has not demonstrated that Goheen received information that could be significantly harmful to her in this proceeding. At the disqualification hearing, the District Court first limited Goheen\u2019s testimony to information that was \u201cgenerally known.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. 1.9(c)(1). The parties had previously filed information detailing Karen\u2019s and Terance\u2019s personal information, the parties\u2019 financial situations, and Karen\u2019s affidavits alleging spousal abuse. In its order, the District Court found that \u201cany information regarding Terance\u2019s alleged abuse of Karen is now moot given what Karen herself subsequently disclosed early on in this case.\u201d The District Court permitted Goheen to testify concerning the background information in the court file, then permitted Goheen to testify as to the length of the telephone conversations with Karen, and Goheen\u2019s office procedures. It was permissible under the Rules for Goheen to use this information about her previous contact with Karen \u201cto respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client.\u201d M. R. Pro. C. 1.6(b)(3). The District Court properly limited Goheen\u2019s testimony to prevent disclosure of Karen\u2019s confidences, if any. <em>See Pro-Hand Services, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b631  Karen\u2019s allegations against Goheen are generalized and vague. Goheen\u2019s limited use of Karen\u2019s information was permitted under Rules 1.6(b) and 1.9(c), and Goheen did not violate a duty to Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">\u00b632 <em>3. Did the District Court err by permitting Goheen to testify at the disqualification </em>hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b633 In a related issue, Karen challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling that permitted Goheen to testify in any manner at the hearing. Karen claims this was error because Goheen did not qualify as a \u201cnecessary witness\u201d under Rule 3.7 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct. Ter anee responds that Goheen\u2019s testimony falls under the exceptions within Rule 3.7 because it was related to the nature of the legal services provided to Karen, M. R. Pro. C. 3.7(a)(2), and because disqualification would render a substantial hardship to Terance, M. R. Pro. C. 3.7(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b634 Rule 3.7, entitled \u201cLawyer as Witness,\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless: (1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue; (2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or (3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">M. R. Pro. C. 3.7(a). Other jurisdictions have defined the term \u201cnecessary witness\u201d in this context as a witness whose testimony is both admissible and unavailable by other means. <em>See i.e. Brown v. Spectrum Networks, Inc., </em>904 N.E.2d 576, 580-81 (Ohio 2008); <em>Sec. Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct., </em>718 P.2d 985, 988 (Ariz. 1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the advocate-witness lawyer knows she will be a necessary witness, it is her burden to establish an exception to Rule 3.7. <em>See Klupt v. Krongard, </em>728 A.2d 727, 741 (Md. 1999) (citations omitted). Committee Comments to Model Rule 3.7, which is identical to Montana Rule 3.7, explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">Paragraph (a)(2) recognizes that where the testimony concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered in the action in which the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the need for a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue. Moreover, in such a situation the judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtW\">Model R. Prof. Conduct 3.7 cmt. 3. The Model Rule Comments add: \u201cparagraph (a)(3) recognizes that a balancing is required between the interests of the client and those of the tribunal and the opposing party.\u201d Model R. Prof. Conduct 3.7 cmt. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b635  Goheen sought leave to testify concerning the nature of the legal services provided by her office and in support of her position that disqualification would work a substantial hardship for Terance. Although the District Court did not expressly find that Goheen was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>necessary witness, it impliedly did so by allowing Goheen to testify but carefully limited the scope of her testimony to subjects discussed above. We conclude that Goheen\u2019s testimony was properly taken pursuant to Rule 3.7(a)(2), permitting a lawyer\u2019s testimony relating to the nature of legal services rendered. We thus decline to address Terance\u2019s argument that Goheen\u2019s disqualification would work a hardship to Terance under Rule 3.7(a)(3). We affirm the District Court\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b636 <em>4. Did the District Court err by relying on privileged communications between Goheen and Karen?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b637 Karen argues that Goheen\u2019s office memorandum, Goheen\u2019s and Van Note\u2019s handwritten notes, and the \u201cNote\u201d that the District Court required Goheen to produce after the hearing, were confidential communications and the District Court\u2019s reliance upon them violated the attorney-client privilege, which she did not waive. Karen moved to strike this evidence shortly before the hearing. Terance responds that there was no attorney-client relationship, and, even if so, Karen waived the privilege by filing the motion to disqualify Goheen.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b638 The attorney-client privilege is one of the professional relationship privileges recognized by the statutory provisions governing evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">(1) An attorney cannot, without the consent of the client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to the attorney or the advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">(2) A client cannot, except voluntarily, be examined as to any communication made by the client to the client\u2019s attorney or the advice given to the client by the attorney in the course of the attorney\u2019s professional employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Section 26-1-803, MCA (2011). Regarding statutory privileges, Rule 503 of the Montana Rules of Evidence provides that \u201c[a] person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege if the person... voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter. This rule does not apply if the disclosure itself is privileged.\u201d M. R. Evid. 503(a). The attorney-client privilege may be impliedly waived \u201cif a party injects into ... litigation an issue that requires testimony from its attorneys or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>testimony concerning the reasonableness of its attorneys\u2019 conduct\u201d or \u201cwhere a party makes assertions in the litigation or asserts a claim that in fairness requires the examination of the protected communications.\u201d <em>Dion v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>185 F.R.D. 288, 294 (D. Mont. 1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cAn implied waiver of the attorney!-]client privilege occurs when (1) the party asserts the privilege as a result of some affirmative act, such as filing suit; (2) through this affirmative act, the asserting party puts the privileged information at issue; and (3) allowing the privilege would deny the opposing party access to information vital to its defense.\u201d <em>Dion, </em>185 F.R.D. at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b639 <em>Dion </em>involved more typical personal injury and \u201cbad faith\u201d litigation where the insurer sought to exclude communications between it and the attorney expert witness. <em>Dion, </em>185 F.R.D. at 291, 295-96. The court found that the insurer had waived the privilege by its litigation actions. <em>Dion, </em>185 F.R.D. at 295-96. Similarly, Karen\u2019s actions necessarily waived the evidentiary privilege. Karen, a former prospective client of Goheen, filed a motion to disqualify Goheen on the basis of the consultations between her and Goheen\u2019s office. As <em>Dion </em>noted, \u201cin fairness,\u201d Goheen\u2019s defense against Karen\u2019s claim required examination ofthe protected communications. <em>Dion, </em>185F.R.D. at294. \u201cThe doctrine of waiver by implication reflects the notion that the attorney-client privilege \u2018was intended as a shield, not a sword.\u2019\u201d <em>Dion, </em>185 F.R.D. at 295 (citations omitted). Thus, even if Karen had established that an implied attorney-client relationship existed, Karen\u2019s claims that privileged information was being misused and that Goheen should be disqualified put these communications at issue and waived any attorney-client privilege. Allowing Karen\u2019s invocation of the privilege to deny Goheen\u2019s use of her office\u2019s notes would eliminate \u201caccess to information vital\u201d to Goheen\u2019s defense to the motion and prevent the court from properly analyzing the claim. <em>Dion, </em>185 F.R.D. at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b640 <em>5. Was Karen denied due process when the District Court relied on documents and sworn testimony not subject to cross </em>examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b641 Karen contends that her right to due process was denied when the court took under advisement her motion to strike the documents from Goheen\u2019s office and did not permit Karen to cross-examine Goheen about the documents. The motion had been filed shortly before the hearing. Terance notes that the District Court also limited the scope of Goheen\u2019s and Van Note\u2019s testimony pending its decision on the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b642 However, Karen\u2019s brief offers no supporting law or analysis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>her state constitutional law claim. Rule 12 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that an argument section of a brief \u201ccontain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on.\u201d M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). This Court has stated it will not consider unsupported issues or arguments and \u201cis under no obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Damschen, </em>2011 MT 297, \u00b6 41, 363 Mont. 19, 265 P.3d 1245 (citing <em>Leichtfuss v.

We thus decline to consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b643 <em>6. Did the District Court err by determining that Karen abused the rules of disqualification?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b644 Karen challenges the District Court\u2019s comments that \u201c[disqualification rules can be abused by clients. Such is the case at hand,\u201d and \u201cthe Court is concerned that Karen\u2019s motion to disqualify is, in reality, a tactic designed to delay resolution of this case and force hardship and increased litigation expenses upon Terance.\u201d Karen argues that Terance has delayed and raised the cost of this proceeding by choosing Goheen to represent him, and that there is no evidence that Karen manipulated or abused the disqualification rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b645 We have reviewed Karen\u2019s claims under the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct at face value and decided them without regard to her personal motives in the litigation. Despite the District Court\u2019s comments, we believe it nonetheless likewise properly applied the Rules and reached the correct conclusions. Thus, the comments made regarding Karen\u2019s motives had no impact on the outcome of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b646 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> Terance denies the abuse allegations, the validity of which are beyond the scope of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> See Or., <em>In Re: Revising the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct </em>(Mont.
