(Overland) were not liable in strict products liability or negligence in Carter\u2019s death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by denying Stokes\u2019 motion for default judgment on liability as a sanction against Ford for withholding evidence of other incidents?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u00b64 <em>2.

Whether the District Court erred by excluding the indemnity agreement between Ford and Overland and limiting questioning about the agreement and these parties\u2019 prior adversarial position?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">\u00b67 On November 2, 2002, Peter Andrew Carter, a resident of Australia, rented a \u201c2002.5\u201d or mid-year model Ford Explorer at Overland\u2019s Bozeman airport location after flying to Montana for a work-related visit. On November 7, Carter was driving on Highway 287 near Ennis when Todd Durham (Durham) executed a left-hand turn of his vehicle in front of Carter, leading to a collision. Carter\u2019s Explorer was traveling between 76 and 83 miles per hour, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>impact caused the vehicle to roll five times across a distance of 286 feet. Although Carter\u2019s passenger survived, Carter was partially ejected and killed. Dennis Stokes, personal representative for Carter\u2019s estate, filed a wrongful death and survival claim against Ford, Overland, and Durham on November 3, 2005. The complaint alleged that the Defendants were responsible for Carter\u2019s death under strict products liability and negligence theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b68 Stokes claimed that safer alternative designs to protect the driver during rollover were \u201cboth technically and economically feasible,\u201d including a Safety Canopy System (SCS), which first became available three months before the subject Explorer was manufactured and was offered as an optional feature for 2002.5 model Explorers. SCS technology was not installed in the Explorer that Carter was driving. Overland, a Hertz Corporation licensee, purchased its fleet of vehicles from Ford.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ford claimed that Overland chose not to equip its fleet of Explorers with the optional SCS, and Stokes claimed Overland was negligent in so doing. Ford and Overland ultimately entered into an indemnity agreement and thereafter presented a united position in the litigation. Ford defended by asserting that, even without the SCS technology, the 2002.5 Explorer was a safe vehicle that exceeded all safety standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b69 Numerous pretrial motions were filed by the parties regarding discovery of evidence of other accidents, evidence regarding the standardization of SCS technology in Ford Explorers, the indemnity agreement between Ford and Overland, and the use of such evidence at trial. A ten-day jury trial was held between September 6 and 19, 2011. The jury unanimously concluded that Durham was liable in negligence and that Ford and Overland were not liable for Carter\u2019s damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court entered judgment accordingly, and Stokes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b610 Additional facts will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b611 \u201cA district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible.\u201d <em>Newman v. Lichfield, </em>2012 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>47, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272 P.3d 625 (quoting <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry., </em>2011 MT 223, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984). We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Newman, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 74, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079). Likewise, we review a district court\u2019s decision to impose discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kraft v. High Country Motors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 83, \u00b6 23, 364 Mont. 465, 276 P.3d 908. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Kraft, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by denying Stokes\u2019 motion for default judgment on liability as a sanction against Ford for withholding evidence of other </em>incidents?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b613 Stokes moved to compel discovery of \u201cother similar incident\u201d information, including evidence about cases where it was alleged that the lack of SCS and other restraint system inadequacies in Explorers and other Ford light trucks led to injuries or death to occupants in rollover accidents. On April 19, 2011, the District Court granted the motion and set discovery criteria for Ford to follow. On May 27, Ford filed a motion for partial relief from the April 19 order. Ford identified more than 1,350 cases meeting the court\u2019s criteria and argued that it would cost \u201cover $2 million with respect to the production of Ford\u2019s outside counsel files alone,\u201d involving more than 60 law firms employed by Ford. On June 29, 2011, the District Court issued an order limiting the scope of this discovery to Ford\u2019s internal case files, data already collected by Ford from outside counsel, preparation of a list of prospective cases with outside counsel, and production of files from a \u201creasonable number\u201d of cases identified by Stokes that were managed by outside counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b614 Ford thereafter produced information about other incidents to Stokes on six occasions between June and August of 2011. This discovery consisted of approximately 17 gigabytes of electronic data. On August 12, Ford filed a motion in limine regarding other incident information, requesting exclusion of \u201call references, direct or indirect, to other accidents, incidents, claims, complaints and/or lawsuits until Plaintiff lays a foundation of substantial similarity, outside the presence of the jury.\u201d On August 15, Stokes moved for default sanctions against Ford for failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>June 29 discovery order. That same day, Ford provided an additional 300 gigabytes of electronic data about other incidents. In his response to Ford\u2019s motion in limine, Stokes again requested default sanctions because Ford had produced \u201cmore than 10 times the evidence that had previously been produced less than a month before trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Af4\">\u00b615 At a hearing on August 24, the District Court addressed Stokes\u2019 motion for default sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">I know the Plaintiff would like the Court to enter judgment on liability, because the Plaintiff argues Ford has vocally disregarded the court\u2019s orders regarding discovery. I think there is no doubt there have been problems with discovery; I\u2019m not saying Ford has done the best job possible, but I think they tried, and I don\u2019t think the default sanction is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Don\u2019t let my denial of the motion-don\u2019t let that give you the idea that I\u2019m not frustrated with Ford, because I am. I\u2019m just not clear that Ford has wantonly disregarded the order of the Court or intentionally tried to slow down discovery here. I just have to believe that a company of Ford\u2019s significance, and all the litigation that it\u2019s in-that it doesn\u2019t have a more streamlined process for producing discovery. I mean, here we are dumping all this information on Plaintiffs counsel on August 15, which is about three weeks before trial. I\u2019m not happy about it; I\u2019m just not convinced that it rises to the level of default sanctions. I want to be clear that if I get the idea as this thing goes along, or if when trial starts, that Ford is playing games, this can be revisited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALy\">The District Court also denied Ford\u2019s motion in limine regarding other incidents, but directed that \u201cPlaintiff will have to lay a foundation of substantial similarity to introduce this type of evidence in the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A07\">\u00b616 Stokes did not request a continuance of the trial date, stating in his briefing, \u201cPlaintiff does not want a continuance. Plaintiff wants this matter tried. Plaintiff and several Australian witnesses have plane tickets purchased for the trial.\u201d Stokes renewed his request for sanctions at trial, stating, \u201cbecause of the late discovery from the Defendants,... we were not able to put on a substantial [other incident] case.\u201d The District Court again denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u00b617 On appeal, Stokes argues that \u201ca defendant\u2019s late disclosure of critical [other incident] evidence which prejudices a plaintiffs ability to present its case justifies entry of default judgment on liability.\u201d Stokes requests that this Court reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of sanctions, noting our statement in <em>Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6 56, 331 Mont. 231, 130 P.3d 634, that courts \u201cmust remain intent upon punishing transgressors rather than patiently encouraging their cooperation.\u201d Ford responds that the cases in which default judgment has been imposed as a sanction for withholding evidence illustrate that the non-complying parties acted willfully and in bad faith, blatantly concealed relevant information, or demonstrated a flagrant disregard of court orders and discovery rules. Ford argues the District Court properly refused Stokes\u2019 motions because it found \u201cno evidence of bad faith or non-responsiveness\u201d and that Ford \u201ccomplied fully with the court\u2019s mandates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b618 Rule 37(b)(2), M. R. Civ. P.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authbrizes a district court to sanction a party for failure to comply with a court order compelling discovery, including by dismissal of an action or by entering a judgment by default. In a case involving entry of a default judgment as a sanction, we explained that sanctions are appropriate \u201cwhere counsel or a party has acted willfully or in bad faith in failing to comply with the rules of discovery or with court orders enforcing the rules, or they have acted in flagrant disregard of those rules.\u201d <em>Kraft, </em>\u00b6 37 (citing <em>Jerome v. Pardis, </em>240 Mont. 187, 192, 783 P.2d 919, 922 (1989)). The party requesting the entry of a default judgment as a sanction for discovery abuse must show prejudice. <em>See Eisenmenger v. Ethicon, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 393, 406, 871 P.2d 1313, 1321 (1994); <em>Estate of Willson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 28, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410; <em>Anderson v. Werner Enters., Inc., </em>1998 MT 333, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 284, 972 P.2d 806 (\u201c[T]he party assigning error to the trial court\u2019s discovery rulings must show prejudice.\u201d). \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position to know ... which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court. The trial judge is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.\u201d <em>Linn v. Whitaker, </em>2007 MT 46, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 131, 152 P.3d 1282 <em>(citing Xu v. McLaughlin Research Inst., </em>2005 MT 209, \u00b6 17, 328 Mont. 232, 119 P.3d 100) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u00b619 In <em>Richardson, </em>we held that default judgment was an appropriate sanction where the defendant\u2019s \u201cwillful and bad faith conduct\u201d amounted to a \u201cblatant and systemic\u201d abuse of the discovery process that \u201cundermined the integrity of the entire proceeding.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65, 68. The defendant had knowingly \u201cconcealed the evidence ... until the eve of trial by asserting baseless objections\u201d to plaintiffs discovery requests and attempted to use the lack of knowledge created by the discovery abuses against the plaintiff. <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 23. In contrast to the situation here, the concealed evidence in <em>Richardson </em>consisted of one page of significant information concerning the other similar incidents. In <em>Estate of Willson, </em>the defendant hospital inadvertently destroyed some medical records that would have otherwise been discoverable in a medical malpractice case. <em>Willson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28. We held that the defendant did not \u201cblatantly, systemically, willfully and in bad faith violate the rules of discovery.\u201d <em>Willson, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"AOO-\">\u00b620  Here, the discovery issue was complex and the District Court narrowed the scope of discovery and issued discovery criteria on June 29, 2011. Over the course of the following six weeks, Ford produced discovery information on seven separate occasions, with the bulk of information coming on August 15, three weeks before trial. The District Court was unhappy with the process of discovery, but found that Ford had not \u201cwantonly disregarded\u201d its order or had \u201cintentionally tried to slow down discovery here.\u201d The record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that this was not the \u201cblatant and systematic\u201d discovery abuse that \u201cundermined the integrity of the entire proceeding\u201d <em>atissueinRichardson.Richardson, </em>\u00b6 65. Stokes did not seek a continuance and decided to proceed to trial. We also stated in <em>Richardson </em>that \u201cthe principle of\u2018trial on the merits\u2019 weighs against the imposition of a default judgment.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 68 (citing <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 81, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002). We cannot conclude the District Court abused its discretion in weighing the circumstances and determining not to enter a default judgment against Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b621 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by excluding Stokes\u2019 proffered evidence of other incidents?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b622 During a conference on evidentiary issues conducted outside of the jury\u2019s presence, Stokes sought the court\u2019s permission to introduce alternative \u201cother incident\u201d evidence that he had independently obtained. The evidence consisted of a compilation of summaries of more than 3,000 crashes and was offered for the purpose of establishing that Ford had actual notice of Explorer rollovers. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>compilation had been previously used in an unrelated case known as \u201cthe <em>Turley </em>case.\u201d For foundation, Stokes offered the \u201cRidenour deposition,\u201d which was a deposition taken of a Ford representative in another 2002.5 Ford Explorer rollover case, referred to as \u201cthe <em>Jones </em>case.\u201d Ford objected based on foundation, hearsay, and relevance because the materials had been prepared by a different law firm in a different case, adding \u201cthere has to be some base level showing of substantial similarity\u201d to introduce this evidence. Stokes made no offer of proof or testimony to demonstrate \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d of the evidence to Carter\u2019s case or to otherwise lay a foundation for the evidence. The District Court excluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b623 Stokes argues that \u201c[w]hile the district court did not rule [other incident] evidence was inadmissible per se, its denial of Stokes\u2019 motion for entry of default judgment on liability due to Ford\u2019s tardy disclosure forced Stokes to find alternative ways to introduce\u201d such evidence. Stokes suggests that this evidence \u201cshould have been held admissible as a minimum sanction for Ford\u2019s dilatory discovery actions.\u201d Ford responds that Stokes failed to lay a proper foundation for the evidence by an offer of proof that the case for which the case summaries were originally created, the <em>Turley </em>case, was substantially similar to this case, or that the individual cases summarized in the proposed compilation exhibit were substantially similar to this case, and Stokes likewise failed to offer any witness involved in the creation of the summarization or to demonstrate that the Ridenour deposition would serve to lay a foundation for a summarization created by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b624 Evidence of other similar instances may be admitted to show notice or knowledge of the existence of a danger or a defect. <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, \u00b6 30, 333 Mont. 186, 142 P.3d 777. \u201c[T]he test of admissibility for evidence of the accidents in a products liability case is \u2018whether the circumstances surrounding the product involved in other accidents were substantially the same or similar to the accident at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krueger v. General Motors Corp., </em>240 Mont. 266, 274, 783 P.2d 1340, 1345-46 (1989) (quoting <em>Kuiper v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>207 Mont. 37, 56, 673 P.2d 1208, 1219 (1983)). \u201cThe admission of evidence of other accidents in products liability litigation is entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Krueger, </em>240 Mont. at 275, 783 P.2d at 1346 (citing <em>Tacke v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., </em>220 Mont. 1, 9, 713 P.2d 527, 532 (1986)). \u201cAconcerted effort should be made by [the trial] court to allow the admission of evidence of only those accidents where both the product and the circumstances surrounding the accident were similar to the case at bar.\u201d <em>Preston v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>282 Mont. 200, 208, 936 P.2d 814, 818 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b625 The District Court denied Ford\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of other incidents, but properly ruled that Stokes \u201cwill have to lay a foundation of substantial similarity to introduce this type of evidence in that trial.\u201d Stokes sought to introduce such evidence in the form of the compilation summarizing 3,000 rollover cases, upon a foundation of a Ford representative\u2019s deposition in an unrelated case. After Ford\u2019s objection, Stokes made no further efforts to demonstrate that his proposed evidence satisfied the requirement of substantial similarity. On this record, we are unable to determine whether Stokes\u2019 proposed evidence was similar to Carter\u2019s accident and therefore must conclude that the trial court was within its discretion to exclude the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b626 3. <em>Whether the District Court erred by excluding evidence related to Ford\u2019s actions in making the Safety Canopy System a standard feature in some other countries in 2002 and in the United States in 2007, and by permitting Ford to present an improper \u201cconsumer-choice\u201d defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b627 Ford filed motions in limine requesting the court to preclude Stokes from discussing or introducing evidence that Ford made the SCS standard equipment in certain foreign markets in 2002, including Australia, and in vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2007. Ford argued that the evidence of standardization in these markets would be irrelevant, prejudicial, and confusing because it would require mini-trials on the reasons for the timing of market introductions and, with regard to the 2007 U.S. standardization, would constitute a subsequent remedial measure inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 407. The District Court granted the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b628 Stokes makes broadly-stated arguments that the standardization evidence should have been admitted \u201cto rebut and impeach all of Ford\u2019s consumer-based and \u2018migration of technology\u2019 arguments,\u201d to establish Ford\u2019s notice and knowledge of the need for SCS technology, and for Ford\u2019s culpability for punitive damages. Stokes argues that the 2007 U.S. standardization was not a subsequent remedial measure, but even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>if so, the evidence should have been admitted for purposes of \u201cimpeachment\u201d and \u201cfeasibility of standardization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b629 During trial, Stokes again offered the 2002 foreign country standardization evidence in an attempt to impeach the testimony of Douglas Scott, Ford\u2019s North America SUV marketing manager, who testified that the 2002.5 Explorer was the first model for which SCS technology had been made available as an option in the U.S. Scott noted that the U.S. SUV market was extremely competitive and that consumers were driven by cost-consciousness. He testified that the 2002.5 Explorer had a \u201cwell-documented, well-established record of safety\u201d even without SCS technology, explaining \u201cwe had a vehicle that exceeded all of the safety standards. It had a demonstrated record for delivering safety and was affordable, again, for our consumers.\u201d The District Court again denied admission of the evidence, reasoning that Scott\u2019s only responsibility was for North American markets and that he did not testify or have knowledge about SCS standardization in foreign markets. However, when cross-examining Michael Leigh, a research engineer in Ford\u2019s Automobile Safety Office, Stokes was permitted to ask, over Ford\u2019s objection, about the standardization of SCS technology in Australia in 2002. Leigh testified that Ford commonly introduced new technology in small markets so that the technology could be analyzed in the field prior to implementation in Ford\u2019s entire fleet, including the dominant U.S. market. This also served to ensure that \u201cthe customer[s] have a choice, do they want this new technology or not\u201d in a vehicle that Leigh testified was safe with or without SCS technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b630 Regarding the 2007 U.S. standardization, Stokes argues on appeal that this evidence was not a subsequent remedial measure governed by M. R. Evid. 407, as the District Court so ruled. However, Stokes conceded before the District Court that this evidence raised a subsequent remedial issue, and the matter was argued that way. Stokes offered the evidence to impeach what he described as Ford\u2019s \u201cconsumer demand\u201d testimony, and likewise argues on appeal that the evidence \u201ccontroverts [Ford\u2019s] position that it was waiting until consumers demanded SCS as a standard feature.\u201d However, Ford\u2019s witnesses did not offer the solitary proposition that Ford delayed employment of SCS technology until consumers demanded it. While consumer interest was one factor about which they testified, other factors such as performance of the new technology in test markets, prioritization of the feature in light of other safety features and the Explorer\u2019s high safety ratings, and affordability were also considered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Further, Ford\u2019s testimony was given with regard to its analysis at the time the 2002.5 model Explorer was introduced and SCS was first made optional, not about the U.S. standardization in 2007 that Stokes sought to introduce. We recently explained that \u201csubsequent remedial measures are admissible for impeachment purposes where the defendant goes beyond stating that the original condition was safe or adequate and attempts to make exaggerated claims that the condition was the safest possible\u201d and that such evidence must \u201cdirectly impeach a witness\u2019s testimony or other evidence offered by a defendant.\u201d <em>United Tool Rental, Inc. v.

In response to Stokes\u2019 offer, the District Court said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any impeachment here\u201d and reasoned that it was convinced that admission of the evidence \u201cwould be a violation of Rule 407.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b631 After review of the record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s rulings on the 2002 and 2007 standardization evidence as offered by Stokes did not constitute abuses of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b632 Lastly, Stokes generally argues that \u201c[t]he district court improperly permitted Ford to pursue a consumer choice defense without allowing Stokes to rebut its position.\u201d Stokes did not object to the Ford testimony that he characterizes as \u201cconsumer choice\u201d testimony, but rather offered a \u201cdelegation\u201d jury instruction in response, which provided: \u201c[a] manufacturer has a duty to design a reasonably safe product and may not delegate such duty to a dealer, user, or purchaser of the product.\u201d The District Court denied Stokes\u2019 proposed instruction in favor of other instructions. Ford responds that, unlike the cases cited by Stokes in favor of the delegation instruction, it did not place responsibility for product safety on the consumer, but that the jury was instructed to determine whether the Explorer was safe \u201cat the time of sale by the Defendant\u201d and whether the Explorer was defective pursuant to factors unrelated to consumer choice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00b633  \u201cA district court\u2019s decision pertaining to jury instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. While the district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d <em>Goles v. </em>Neumann, 2011 MT 11, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 132, 247 P.3d 1089 (citing <em>State v. </em>Christiansen, 2010 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 379, 239 P.3d 949). After a review of the instructions, we conclude the District Court did not err in fully and fairly instructing the jury regarding the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b634 <em>4. Whether the District Court erred by excluding the indemnity agreement between Ford and Overland and limiting questioning about the agreement and these parties\u2019 prior adversarial position?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b635 Ford\u2019s answer to Stokes\u2019 complaint raised an affirmative defense that \u201c[a]ll of Plaintiff s injuries were caused by the acts or omissions of third parties and/or Plaintiff and the other Defendants ....\u201d Overland raised a similar defense, stating that \u201cany damages claimed by Peter Carter, his estate and/or his heirs were caused by the wrongful and/or negligent conduct of Todd Durham, Ford and/or parties other than Overland... .\u2019\u2019Neither Ford nor Overland filed a cross-claim against the other. Later, Ford and Overland entered into an indemnity agreement, whereby they withdrew their respective affirmative defenses implicating each other. Ford initially provided legal representation for Overland after the agreement was entered, although separate counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>later appeared for Overland for the remainder of the proceedings. The parties are represented separately on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b636 Stokes sought admission of the indemnity agreement and, after extensive arguments by the parties, the District Court ultimately determined that the agreement could be addressed at trial, but would not be admitted as documentary evidence, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t want the jury to be looking at the Indemnity Agreement .... They wouldn\u2019t understand it anyway.\u201d The District Court also excluded the agreement and questioning about Ford and Overland\u2019s initial pleadings on the ground that the final pretrial order had superseded the pleadings and had not addressed this issue. Stokes asked the court if, as an alternative to admitting the agreement, it would instruct the jury on the effect of the agreement. The court indicated it would entertain a proposed instruction from Stokes, but none was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"AmS\">\u00b637 During trial, Stokes used the agreement in cross-examination of Jeffrey Ralph Heileson, Overland\u2019s representative, to demonstrate bias. Stokes\u2019 examination established the existence of the agreement and highlighted that, pursuant to the agreement, Ford had selected counsel for Overland, was paying for Overland\u2019s defense, and would pay any judgment entered against Overland. Heileson offered, however, that he had not read the entire agreement and was not aware of its details:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">Q [by Stokes\u2019 Attorney], Well, is it true that the agreement provides that if Ford and Overland West no longer have a unity of interest in the defense to this case, Ford, at its sole option, can withdraw from the defense and indemnification of Overland West?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">A [by Heileson]. If that\u2019s what it says, I guess that\u2019s true. But like I said, I didn\u2019t know that before you just said it ... it\u2019s not my charge at our company to analyze those types of documents, so I really-and no one has advised me as to what limits I may have and what I could say in my testimony or in answering any discovery questions or anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Stokes also referenced the agreement during his opening statement and his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b638 Stokes argues on appeal that the indemnity agreement was admissible as evidence of a compromise under M. R. Evid. 408, which permits admission of such evidence when offered to prove bias or prejudice of a witness. He argues that the ability to introduce the agreement itself and ask questions about the parties\u2019 original pleadings was critical to establishing witness bias, particularly with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Heileson. Ford argues that the agreement was not relevant, would have caused jury confusion, that Stokes failed to lay the necessary foundation for its admission, and that the District Court properly limited questioning to the terms of the final pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b639  Without addressing all of the parties\u2019 arguments, we simply conclude that the District Court\u2019s rulings did not constitute reversible error. The court gave Stokes considerable leeway in using the indemnity agreement. Stokes was able to establish the basic terms of the agreement and to well make the point to the jury that Ford and Overland had become allies in the suit. Further effort by Stokes to demonstrate bias on the part of Heileson would necessarily have been limited by Heileson\u2019s testimony that he hadn\u2019t read the entire agreement, had little knowledge or understanding of the agreement, and had not been advised of any restrictions upon his testimony because of the agreement. We conclude that Stokes was not prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s rulings on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> Hertz was a subsidiary of Ford in 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> The jury awarded damages to Carter\u2019s Estate from Durham in the amount of $1,409,005.
