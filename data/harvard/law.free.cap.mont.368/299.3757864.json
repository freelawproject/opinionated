Billion, Inc. (Billion). We affirm and address these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnW\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err hy concluding that Billion did not waive its argument that Thompson was exempt from overtime pay as a \u201csalesman\u201dunder 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that Thompson was not entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Montana Wage Protection Act?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AIU\">\u00b64 From March 1,2009, until July 31,2010, Thompson worked as the manager of Billion\u2019s \u201cPit Stop.\u201d The Pit Stop was the automotive services and repair facility within Billion\u2019s automotive dealership operation. During his tenure as manager of the Pit Stop, Thompson worked 819.21 hours in excess of the standard 40-hour work week, but did not receive overtime pay under his employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b65 Thompson\u2019s duties as manager of the Pit Stop required that he greet customers; inspect vehicles, tires, and alignment; write up work tickets; \u201cup sell\u201d products; show customers to the waiting room; review a \u201creport card\u201d on the vehicle with the customer and provide an estimate for additional work that may need to be done; check the car and deliver it to the waiting customer; and collect payment from the customer. Thompson also oversaw the quality of work performed by the \u201clube techs\u201d who worked on customer vehicles. Although titled a \u201cmanager,\u201d Thompson did not have the independent authority to hire, discipline or promote workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b66 Thompson was paid a base salary of $800 per month plus commission. If his combined salary and commission did not exceed $2,400.00 per month, he would receive a guaranteed salary of $2,400.00. Thompson also received an annual bonus and $1 for every \u201creport card\u201d issued. His bonus for 2009 was $2,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b67 Thompson resigned his employment on July 31, 2010. He filed a claim for overtime pay with the Department several months later, asserting that Billion owed him $17,014.99 in overtime wages. Billion responded that Thompson was not entitled to overtime because he was (1) a \u201cmanagerial\u201d or executive employee and (2) a \u201csalesperson\u201d of automobiles services, two positions that are exempt under overtime compensation laws. Thompson countered that he was not a manager because he did not direct the work of the other employees, and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>a \u201csalesperson\u201d because, in his view, the majority of his workday was spent performing \u201clube, oil, and filter tasks\u201d rather than selling products or services. After review of the information submitted by the parties, the Department\u2019s Compliance Specialist ruled in favor of Billion. Thompson requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b68 A hearing was held on May 3,2011, with both parties represented by counsel. Thompson and three Billion employees testified. Billion elicited testimony that \u201c70 percent of Thompson\u2019s job was selling,\u201d and Thompson agreed that \u201cmost of [his] time was at the counter and selling.\u201d The hearing officer found that \u201cThompson\u2019s primary duty was to sell services to Billion\u2019s Pit Stop customers\u201d and that it was \u201cclear Thompson was a salesman and service advisor for J.C. Billion.\u201d The hearing officer concluded that because Thompson was a salesman for an automotive dealership, he was not entitled to overtime pay under federal or state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b69 Thompson petitioned the District Court for judicial review. Thompson argued that the Department procedurally erred by allowing Billion to assert the \u201csalesman\u201d exemption because Billion did not timely raise the issue. The District Court held that Billion had not waived this defense. Thompson also argued the Department should have granted him relief by applying 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372(c)(1). The District Court concluded that this regulation impermissibly conflicted with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A), the federal statute it purported to interpret, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">[T]he regulation clearly provides for a more narrow definition of salesman than that found in the statute. Therefore, this Court finds that the regulation is not controlling with regard to Thompson\u2019s claim, and the hearing examiner correctly applied the statutory language in determining that Thompson is exempt from the overtime pay requirements of both the FLSA and Montana wage and hour statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b610 Thompson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b611 Whether an administrative regulation impermissibly conflicts with a statute is a question of law to be decided by the court. <em>Chevron v. Nat. Resources Ref. </em>Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 n. 9, 104 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>2778, 2781 n. 9; <em>Bona v. Gonzales, 425 </em>F.3d 663, 668 (9th Cir. 2005). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine if they are correct. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 558, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2546 (1988); <em>Talon Plumbing &amp; Heating v. Dept. of Lab. &amp; Indus., </em>2008 MT 376, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 499, 198 P.3d 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that Billion did not waive its argument that Thompson was exempt from overtime pay as a \u201csalesman\u201dunder 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b613 Thompson briefly argues the District Court erred by permitting Billion to claim that Thompson was exempt from overtime pay as a \u201csalesman.\u201d According to Thompson, Billion\u2019s failure to raise the exemption immediately prior to or during the administrative hearing \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cprejudice^]\u201d Thompson, and the defense should have been held to be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b614 In the context of judicial proceedings, an affirmative defense must be pleaded in the answer to the claim or it is waived. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c); <em>Marias Healthcare Serv. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 9, 305 Mont. 419, 28 P.3d 491. The purpose of requiring affirmative defenses to be pleaded is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance to argue why imposition of the defense would be inappropriate. <em>Blonder-Tongue Lab. v. U. of Ill. Found., </em>402 U.S. 313, 350, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 1453 (1971). Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b) enumerates certain employment positions that are exempt from overtime-pay laws. The Ninth Circuit has held that such exemptions are \u201caffirmative defensefs] that must be pleaded and proved by the defendant.\u201d Magana <em>v. Com. of the N. Mariana Islands, </em>107 F.3d 1436, 1446 (9th Cir. 1997). However, as the District Court noted, this is a function of the federal rules of civil procedure. Generally, the rules of civil procedure do not apply with equal force to administrative proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">The strict technical rules governing judicial procedure generally do not apply to administrative proceedings which are simpler, less technical, and less formal than court proceedings, but the elementary fundamental principles of judicial inquiry should be observed in administrative proceedings.... Under this general rule, for example, the validity of pleadings in administrative proceedings should not be tested by technical niceties of pleading and practice required in court trials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">73 C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 142 (2004); <em>accord U.S. v. Rasmussen, </em>222 F. Supp. 430, 438 (D. Mont. 1963) (Jameson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>J.) (\u201cAdministrative procedures need not conform to all procedural niceties that surround the judicial process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b615 The administrative process for review of wage claims is governed by rules adopted by the Department pursuant to statutory authority. Section 39-3-202, MCA; Admin. R. M. 24.16.7501, et seq. Pursuant thereto, an employer is required to file a \u201cwritten response\u201d to a wage claim, but the particular contents of that response is not addressed by the rule. Admin. R. M. 24.16.7527(2). A party who receives an adverse ruling from a compliance specialist may file a simple request for a formal hearing, which is governed by the statutes governing contested case proceedings. Admin. R. M. 24.16.7537; Section 2-4-601, et seq. Thompson has not pointed to any violation of these provisions by Billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b616 The record indicates that Thompson filed his wage claim with the Department on October 25, 2010. In its \u201cwritten response\u201d to Thompson\u2019s claim, Billion asserted that the salesman exemption applied. In reply, Thompson sent a letter refuting his classification as a \u201csalesman,\u201d stating he spent the majority of his workday performing \u201clube, oil, and filter tasks\u201d along with the other Pit Stop laborers. This prompted the Department\u2019s compliance specialist to write a letter to Billion asking for clarification regarding Thompson\u2019s day-to-day duties. Billion responded, contesting Thompson\u2019s characterization of his duties and reaffirming its position that Thompson was a \u201c\u2018salesperson\u2019 selling automobile service [sic] to our customers.\u201d This prompted another response from Thompson that \u201cJ.C. Billion cannot meet its burden to prove Thompson is an exempt \u2018salesperson\u2019\u201d because \u00a7 779.372(c)(1) defined a \u201csalesperson\u201d only as an employee selling vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b617  This correspondence demonstrates that Billion raised the \u201csalesman\u201d defense early in the proceedings and clearly put Thompson on notice of its position that it would rely on the \u201csalesman\u201d exemption, in addition to other defenses. Prior to the hearing, Thompson objected that Billion had not raised any affirmative defenses, but this objection was properly denied. Thompson was not surprised or prejudiced. The District Court did not err by denying Thompson\u2019s waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"A-l\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that Thompson was not entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Montana Wage Protection Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b619 Federal and Montana law entitles an employee, unless exempted, to receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek at a rate not less one-and-one-half times his regular rate of pay. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) (2006); \u00a7 39-3-405, MCA (2009). Federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Montana law exempt from the overtime pay requirement a \u201csalesperson\u201d engaged in \u201cselling or servicing automobiles\u201d if employed at an automotive dealership. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A); \u00a7 39-3-406(2)(d). Specifically, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) provides that overtime pay requirements do not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers!.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">This exemption from overtime pay as defined under Montana law, \u00a7 39-3-406(2)(d), is substantially the same, with the italicized words below being the only differences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">a salesperson, parts person, or mechanic <em>paid on a commission or contract basis </em>and primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, <em>mobile homes, recreational vehicles, </em>or farm implements if the salesperson, parts person, or mechanic is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling the vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers!.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b620 Four years after Congress passed 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10), the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor (Secretary) issued 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372. 35 Fed. Reg. 5395, 5396 (April 9, 1970). Section 779.372(c)(1) defined \u201csalesman\u201d to include only those employees who sold vehicles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">As used in section 13(b)(10), a salesman is an employee who is employed for the purpose of and is <em>primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for sale of the vehicles or farm implements </em>which the establishment is primarily engaged in selling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary has subsequently explained that this narrowing was premised \u201con its reading of 13(b)(10)(A) as limiting the exemption to salesman who sell vehicles and partsmen and mechanics who service vehicles.\u201d 76 Fed. Reg. 18838 (April 5, 2011). Thus, regarding employees of vehicle dealerships, Regulation \u00a7 779.372 exempts salesmen of vehicles, and partsmen and mechanics who service vehicles, from the overtime pay requirement, but not salesmen of vehicle services.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b621 Acknowledging that FLSA overtime pay exemptions are to be narrowly construed against the employer, <em>Kemp v. State Bd. of Personnel Appeals, </em>1999 MT 255, 292 Mont. 319, 989 P.2d 317, the District Court also reasoned that \u201cregulations are not controlling if they conflict with the plain wording of the statute.\u201d The court rejected application of Regulation \u00a7 779.372(c)(1) on a plain reading comparison of the regulation and the statute, and by reliance on the U.S. Circuit Court decisions in <em>Brennan v. Deel Motors, Inc., </em>475 F.2d 1095 (5th Cir. 1973) and <em>Walton v. Greenbriar Ford, Inc., </em>370 F.3d 446 (4th Cir. 2004). Those courts concluded that the regulation conflicted with the statute. The <em>Walton </em>Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">[T]he Secretary\u2019s interpretation of [the term \u201csalesman\u201d] is unreasonable, as it is an impermissibly restrictive construction of the statute. FLSA itself exempts any salesman \u201cprimarily engaged in selling <em>or servicing </em>automobiles\u201d from the overtime requirements. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) (emphasis added). However, the regulation conflicts with FLSA\u2019s statutory mandate in that it restricts the definition of \u201csalesman\u201d to those employees \u201cprimarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for <em>sales of the vehicles.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372(c)(1) (emphasis added). Because that restrictive regulatory definition of \u201csalesman\u201d unreasonably implements the congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>mandate, we reject the Secretary\u2019s interpretation in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372(c)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b622 Thompson argues the District Court erred by following <em>Walton </em>instead of the regulation. He urges us to reject <em>Walton </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s directive to defer to agency definitions, as stated in <em>Chevron v. Nat. Resources Def. Council, </em>Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984) and <em>Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, </em>551 U.S. 158, 127 S. Ct. 2339 (2007). <em>Chevron </em>was a seminal case in which the Supreme Court outlined a two-step framework for judicial review of an agency\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute. Under <em>Chevron </em>step one, a court must determine whether the statute speaks directly to the precise question at issue; if it does, the court must \u201cgive effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2781. However, if the statute is \u201cis silent or ambiguous\u201d as to the question at issue, the court proceeds to <em>Chevron </em>step two where it defers to a reasonable construction of the statute by the agency charged with its implementation. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S. Ct. at 2781-82. <em>Chevron </em>step one requires a reviewing court to \u201cemployG traditional tools of statutory construction\u201d to ascertain whether Congress answered the question at issue. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n. 9, 104 S. Ct. at 2781 n. 9<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b623  A plain, grammatical reading of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) makes clear that the term \u201csalesman\u201d encompasses a broader category of employees than those only engaged in selling vehicles. The statute exempts \u201cany salesmen, partsmen, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements[.]\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(10). The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between the words \u201cselling <em>or </em>servicing\u201d means that the exemption applies to any \u201csalesman, partsmen, or mechanic\u201d who are primarily engaged in either of these duties. The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d among \u201cautomobiles, trucks, <em>or </em>farm implements\u201d applies the exemption to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>employees selling or servicing any of these kinds of vehicles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, under a plain reading, the statute clearly exempts \u201cany salesman ... primarily engaged in servicing ... automobiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b624 Thompson\u2019s reliance on <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Long Island Care </em>is unavailing because those cases involved regulations that defined statutory terms in a way that did not conflict with the controlling statute. In other words, they are <em>Chevron </em>\u201cstep two\u201d cases. In <em>Chevron, </em>the statutory term at issue was \u201cstationary source\u201d from the Clean Air Act. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 840, 104 S. Ct. at 2780. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s definition as a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute\u201d because it did not conflict with the language of the statute and did not frustrate the objectives of Congress. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 866, 104 S. Ct. at 2793. The statutory terms at issue in <em>Long Island Care </em>were \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d and \u201ccompanion services\u201d of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). <em>Long Island Care, </em>551 U.S. at 161-62, 127 S. Ct. at 2344. The FLSA exempted employees engaged in providing in-home companion care for elderly and disabled people from minimum wage and maximum hour requirements. <em>Long Island Care, </em>551 U.S. at 161-62, 127 S. Ct. at 2344. The U.S. Department of Labor issued a regulation defining \u201cdomestic service employment\u201d to include third-party workers-those employed by agencies in the businesses of providing companion services to numerous clients. <em>Long Island Care, </em>551 U.S. at 163, 127 S. Ct. at 2345. The Supreme Court upheld this regulatory definition because it did not contradict the statutory language ofthe FLSA. <em>Long Island Care, </em>551 U.S. at 167, 127 S. Ct. at 2347. However, in this case, unlike <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Long Island Care, </em>Regulation \u00a7 779.372(c)(1) conflicts with the plain wording of 29 U.S.C. 213(b)(10)(A) by defining employees who are exempted from overtime pay as \u201csalesman\u201d more narrowly than the statute does.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b625 Billion and Thompson also argue about the effect of the Secretary\u2019s inconsistent enforcement of \u00a7 779.372(c)(1) over the past 40 years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, it is not necessary to address this concern. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>we conclude that \u00a7 213(b)(10)(A) resolves the dispute, the regulation carries no weight. Under <em>Chevron </em>step one, if a plain reading of the statute answers the question, it is not necessary to further analyze the effect of the regulation. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2781 (\u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter[.]\u201d); <em>Village of Barrington v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>636 F.3d 650, 659 (D.C.
