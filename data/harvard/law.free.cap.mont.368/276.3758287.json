We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b62 David Harris (Harris) has been employed by the Department of Corrections (DOC) for approximately 13 years, specifically as a correctional officer at the Montana State Prison (MSP) in Deer Lodge, Montana. Since November 16,2000, he has served as a member of the Special Response Team (SRT) at MSP, which he continues to do today. SRT is an elite special weapons and tactical response team (SWAT) whose members are extensively trained to respond to the prison\u2019s most dangerous crises such as inmate riots, escapes, and hostage situations. Membership is voluntary. To become a member, an applicant must qualify in physical fitness and firearms proficiency, and successfully undergo an interview process. If selected to join the team, the member must agree to fulfill the rigorous training requirements, which include attending a specialized six-day, 70-hour Primary SWAT Training and monthly 8-hour training sessions at the prison. Any SRT member who does not wish to fulfill the training requirements may resign from the team at any time. As of July 1, 2005, members of the SRT received an extra 50 cents per hour for being a team member.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b63 In 2006, Mike Mahoney (Mahoney), the Warden at MSP, decided that the prison would purchase and use X-26 tasers, manufactured by Taser International. A taser is an electric stunning device which temporarily incapacitates superficial muscles. In accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, Mahoney issued a policy requiring all individuals who wanted to be authorized to use a taser at the prison to complete taser training, which included undergoing a five-second taser exposure. The direct experience of the voluntary exposure was meant to instill in the trainee an understanding of the effects of the taser and encourage the trainee to use the taser in a safe manner. According to Mahoney, none of the training was intended \u201cto harm or injure any of the trainees in any way,\u201d and extensive safety precaustions were used during the training to avoid injury. No employees were required to use tasers at MSP, and none were subject to job loss if he or she refused to undergo the tasing training. However, the training was mandatory for all members of the voluntary SRT team.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b64 On June 28, 2006, all of the MSP wardens, which included Mahoney, the deputy warden, and the associate wardens, underwent taser training and the five-second exposure at the DOC. The lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>instructor of the training was Sergeant Kim Micu (Micu), who at the time was an employee of MSP and certified by Taser International. There is no allegation or evidence that any of the wardens received any injuries as a result of their five-second exposures.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">\u00b65 Then, on July 26, 2006, a taser training was held for the SRT at the DOC Center. Micu was the lead instructor. The training was conducted according to the Taser International training standards, and consisted of a classroom component and a five-second exposure. The classroom component of the training involved a 173-page Power Point presentation based on the training materials provided by Taser International. All of the materials from the Power Point presentation, which included slides specifically addressing the risks of taser exposure, were distributed as handouts to each trainee, including Harris. The risks of undergoing taser exposure were also disclosed in a written consent form that Harris signed prior to his five-second exposure. These risks included \u201csevere\u201d muscle contractions that \u201cmay result in injuries to muscles, tendons, ligaments, backs, joints and stress fractures.\u201d Additionally, the form advised that the nature of tasing \u201cinvolves a degree of risk that someone will get hurt or may even be killed due to physical exertion, unforeseen circumstances and individual susceptibilities.\u201d At no time did Harris or any other SRT member object to completing the training or undergoing the voluntary exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b66 Art Garrison (Garrison), a corrections officer at MSP and lieutenant in command of the SRT, in July 2006, was the first person to undergo the voluntary exposure at the July 26, 2006, training. He suffered no injury from the tasing, and afterwards he served as a spotter to the other trainees. Following Garrison\u2019s tasing, the SRT members underwent the exposure, including Harris. As a result of his five-second taser exposure, Harris claimed to have sustained injuries to his thoracic and lumbar spine. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b67 On July 23, 2009, Harris filed a complaint against the State of Montana, the DOC and several fictitious defendants (collectively \u201cAppellees\u201d). He alleged that he suffered an intentional infliction of personal injury by his fellow employee when he was tased by Micu at the July 26, 2006, training. He further raised a spoliation of evidence claim for the alleged loss or destruction of the DOC\u2019s video recording of the taser training session. Appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing the suit was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) and that there was no independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cause of action for Harris\u2019s spoliation of evidence claim. On March 6, 2012, the District Court granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Harris\u2019s claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b68 Harris timely appealed. We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u00b69 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment for Appellees on the grounds that Harris\u2019s suit is barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u00b610 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in determining that Harris does not have a cause of action for spoliation of evidence?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b611 We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the district court. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. Once the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230. Conclusory statements are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Styren Farms, Inc., </em>\u00b6 10. We farther review a question of law to determine if the district court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Palmer v. Bahm, </em>2006 MT 29, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 105, 128 P.3d 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u00b612 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment for Appellees on the grounds that Harris\u2019s suit is barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\u00b613 Harris argues on appeal that the District Court incorrectly concluded that his suit was barred by \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and thus erred in granting summary judgment against him. He contends that because Appellees intentionally and deliberately caused him to be tased, knowing it would injure him, his claim involves an \u201cintentional injury\u201d and therefore falls into the exception to the exclusive remedy provision of the WCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u00b614 Appellees counter that their actions did not create an intentional injury as defined by \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, and Harris\u2019s claims are thus subject to the exclusive remedy provision. The purpose of the training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and voluntary exposure, they contend, was to educate and train the employees to safely use a taser and to experience exposure in a controlled environment; it was not to injure anyone. Further, while they admit that they knew that the use of a taser entails a risk of harm, as clearly detailed in the Power Point presentation and in the consent form that Harris signed, they did not know for certain that Harris would be injured. Since Harris did not submit any evidence that suggested Appellees intended to harm him, nor did he present any information showing Appellees had actual knowledge that using a taser on him would cause him injury, Appellees argue the District Court correctly determined there were no issues of material fact and that summary judgment in favor of Appellees was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">\u00b615 The WCA generally provides the exclusive remedy for an employee who suffers an injury in the scope of his or her employment. Section 39-71-411, MCA. However, there is a narrow exception to this provision if an employee is \u201cintentionally injured\u201d by the employee\u2019s employer or fellow employee while performing the duties of employment. Section 39-71-413(1), MCA; <em>Wise v. CNH Am., LLC, </em>2006 MT 194, \u00b6 7, 333 Mont. 181, 142 P.3d 774. The statute defines intentional injury as an injury caused by an \u201cintentional and deliberate act that is specifically and actually intended to cause injury to the employee injured and there is actual knowledge that an injury is certain to occur.\u201d Section 39-71-413(3), MCA; <em>see Wise, </em>\u00b6 7. In other words, for a suit to fall into the exception to the exclusivity provision of the WCA, plaintiffs must allege facts or submit evidence sufficient to satisfy two required elements: (1) an intentional and deliberate act specifically and actually intended to cause injury; and (2) actual knowledge of the injury\u2019s certainty. <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>2010 MT 135, \u00b6 21, 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880; <em>see also Wise, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AR3\">\u00b616  Harris maintains that the actions of Appellees in exposing Harris to the taser \u201cwere intentional and deliberate\u201d and thus fall within the WCA exception. He asserts that although Appellees did not actually intend that he receive the injuries he did, this \u201chas no bearing on the fact that [Appellees] intentionally caused him to be subjected to the [taser],\u201d knowing there was the possibility of serious injury. The District Court was correct when it stated that Harris\u2019s argument \u201cmissed the legal mark,\u201d because a chance of injury is not the same as an employer\u2019s deliberate act to injure an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b617 We recently took the opportunity in <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>to discuss the evolution of the law relative to establishing intent for purposes of recognizing when plaintiffs are limited to the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>remedy of the WCA, and when their claim falls within its exception. While we do not think it is necessary to recite the entire history of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, again today, we will highlight what is most instructive to our analysis in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b618 In 2001, the Legislature amended \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, to its present form. 2001 Mont. Laws 1095-96. Prior to the amendments, the statute provided that an injured employee\u2019s remedy was not restricted to workers\u2019 compensation benefits if the employee\u2019s injury was caused by the \u201cintentional and malicious act or omission\u201d of the employer or fellow employee. 2001 Mont. Laws 1096. The purpose of the amendments was to remove the \u201cmalice\u201d component and allow an injured employee to recover from an employee or employer who caused an \u201cintentional injury,\u201d and to narrowly define the meaning of such an \u201cintentional injury.\u201d 2001 Mont. Laws 1095-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b619 In his brief, Harris cites to several cases that were decided before the 2001 amendments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our analyses in these cases regarding what constitutes \u201cintentional\u201d conduct in the context of the WCA\u2019s exclusivity provision remain useful to the extent they considered the proof required to show harm an employer specifically directed at an employee. None, however, provides support for Harris\u2019s arguments. In only one of these cases did we determine that the plaintiff presented sufficient allegations to support his contention that there was an intentional injury allowing exception to the exclusive remedy of the WCA; however, it is distinguishable from the present case on both the facts and the law. In <em>Lockwood v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>272 Mont. 202, 900 P.2d 314 (1995), the plaintiff alleged his employer, W.R. Grace, intentionally harmed him by allowing him to work in a vermiculite mine and mill for several years when it knew or had reason to know that extended inhalation of vermiculite and asbestos particles created a high degree of harm. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 208, 900 P.2d at 318. Lockwood worked in the mill for approximately ten years. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 204, 900 P.2d at 316. Six years after he retired, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an asbestos-specific cancer, and died shortly thereafter. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 204, 900 P.2d at 316. His widow filed a complaint against W.R. Grace; however, the district court dismissed it on the grounds that benefits under the Occupational Disease Act of Montana (MODA) were her exclusive remedy pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to \u00a7 39-72-305, <em>MCA.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 204, 900 P.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"AsO\">\u00b620 On appeal, we determined that Lockwood\u2019s allegations included an intentional harm sufficient to avoid MODA\u2019s exclusivity. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 211, 900 P.2d at 319. Specifically, his allegations include that: Grace knew its acts created a high degree of harm to Lockwood; Grace actively concealed this knowledge from Lockwood; Grace failed to provide protective equipment sufficient to avoid the danger; Grace advised Lockwood that exposure to vermiculite and asbestos was safe; and these actions proximately caused Lockwood\u2019s death. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 208, 900 P.2d at 318. Harris relies on <em>Lockwood </em>for the proposition that an \u201cintent to injure does not mean desire to injure;\u201d even if an employer did not desire for an employee to be injured, he or she could still have \u201cintended that the employee [ ] undergo the injury ....\u201d <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 210, 900 P.2d at 319. Harris argues that the fact Appellees did not desire that he be injured, just as W.R. Grace did not desire for Lockwood to receive his injuries, does not mean the intent element was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b621 <em>Lockwood </em>was decided under a different version of the \u201cintentional harm\u201d exception to exclusivity, but retains some relevancy for its focus on the employer\u2019s actual knowledge that the employee was being harmed as opposed to a \u201cmere allegation of known risk.\u201d <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 210, 900 P.2d at 319. Harris nevertheless fails to establish that the intent to injure was present in his case. Appellees submitted affidavits to the District Court in which they maintained that the intent in using a taser during the training was to train individuals in the safe and effective use of the taser at MSP, not to injure anyone. Harris submitted one personal affidavit in which he explained his understanding of the purpose and effects of the taser, and his awareness of the risks associated with the five-second exposure, but did not present any affidavits or discovery materials placing Appellees\u2019 intent at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b622  Unlike in <em>Lockwood, </em>where Grace allegedly concealed knowledge from the plaintiff that the work environment was dangerous, lied to him that it was safe, and failed to provide any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>protection against the known harm, here Appellees made the potential risks of the tasing very clear to Harris, and provided mats and spotters to protect him. Additionally, Harris\u2019s supervisors, including Mahoney, underwent the five-second exposure before Harris or any of the other SRT members. Harris therefore was not asked to do anything his supervisors were not willing to do themselves. Mahoney\u2019s policy was not meant to injure the trainees, who included himself and the other wardens, but rather to ensure that all employees at MSP who wanted to use a taser learn how to do so in a safe manner. Harris underwent the tasing at his own free will, giving full written consent to the exposure while acknowledging its potential risks. There is nothing to suggest Appellees deliberately acted with the intent to harm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b623  Harris correctly points out that an employer\u2019s intent may be inferred from facts and circumstances, and direct proof that the employer intended to cause an intentional injury is not required in order to survive a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Alexander, </em>\u00b6 26. However, as we just illustrated, Harris failed to provide any evidence from which we can infer that the intent was to harm rather than educate and train. Instead, he points to the training materials that disclosed the risks associated with tasing, and merely speculates that Appellees intended to injure Harris \u201cto some extent\u201d by using the taser on him. We have previously said that the party opposing summary judgment \u201c \u2018must set forth specific facts and cannot rely on speculative, fanciful, or conclusory statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sprunk v. First Bank Sys., </em>252 Mont. 463, 466, 830 P.2d 103, 105 (quoting <em>Simmons v. Jenkins, </em>230 Mont. 429, 432, 750 P.2d 1067, 1069 (1988)). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Harris we conclude that he did not meet his burden and that the District Court correctly determined that Harris failed to present any evidence that Appellees deliberately intended to harm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b624 We also agree with the District Court that Harris failed to identify any evidence that Appellees had actual knowledge that Harris\u2019s exposure to the taser was certain to injure him, the second requirement of \u00a7 39-71-413(3), MCA. On appeal, Harris argues that Appellees knew that shooting Harris would \u201ccause ... pain which can be stressful.\u201d He points to the materials that were presented at the training session to argue that because Appellees knew of the potential effects of being shot with a taser, they knew that he was going to \u201creceive at least some injury and knew the possibility of serious injury or even death existed.\u201d Harris additionally argues that Appellees took the precautions of placing the trainees on padded mats and providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>them with spotters for physical support because they knew he would be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">\u00b625  A risk or possibility of injury does not establish actual knowledge of the injury\u2019s certainty as required by the statute. In <em>Alexander, </em>two former employees of Bozeman Motors, Ostermiller and Alexander, filed suit against the company on the grounds that it intentionally injured them when a gas stove leaked propane into their office, causing a build-up of carbon monoxide. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-7. Ostermiller worked in the office first, and stated that after he noticed the smell of propane at work, and upon feeling ill as a result of the inhalation of the chemical, he complained to Bozeman Motors. Bozeman Motors allegedly did nothing. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 3. Not long after, Ostermiller lost consciousness while in the office. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 3. He did not return to work thereafter. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 3. Alexander began working in the office soon after Ostermiller left, and also complained to Bozeman Motors about the harmful physical symptoms he was experiencing at work. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 4. Bozeman Motors did nothing, and Alexander\u2019s health allegedly deteriorated to the point where he could no longer come to work. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The district court granted summary judgment against Ostermiller and Alexander, determining they failed to show that Bozeman Motors intentionally injured them, and their claims were thus subject to the exclusivity provision of the WCA. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b626 On appeal, we affirmed the entry of summary judgment against Ostermiller, and reversed with respect to Alexander. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 37. We concluded that Ostermiller\u2019s allegations that Bozeman Motors intentionally and deliberately exposed him to dangerous conditions in his office (contaminated air), and did not respond to his complaints that he was becoming ill, nor take any measures to address the conditions, \u201cviewed in a light most favorable to the Employees, simply do[es] not establish that Bozeman Motors had actual knowledge that requiring Ostermiller to work in this office would result in certain injury.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 22. With regard to Alexander, however, the facts led us to a different conclusion. Alexander alleged that since Bozeman Motors knew of Ostermiller\u2019s injury it had actual knowledge of the harm posed by the use of the stove in the office when it sent Alexander to work there. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 31. Further, Alexander asserted that he complained to Bozeman Motors, and that Bozeman Motors failed to warn him about the dangers posed by the stove. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 31. We determined that these allegations were sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on whether Bozeman Motors \u201cintentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>injured\u201d Alexander as defined by \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, and summary judgment was thus inappropriate. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b627 In the case at hand, like Bozeman Motors who had no actual knowledge that injury was certain to occur to Ostermiller, Appellees had no such knowledge that tasing Harris would result in certain injury. There is no evidence of any prior reports of injury during taser training, nor of any other actions on Appellees\u2019 behalf to suggest they knew with certainty that Harris\u2019s voluntary exposure would harm him. Harris\u2019s supervisors underwent the exposure prior to Harris, and no one received any injuries as a result. Further, unlike in <em>Alexander </em>where Bozeman Motors allegedly failed to warn Alexander of known dangers, Appellees were nothing but candid about the known risks of the taser.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b628 Harris cites to <em>Lockwood </em>to support his position that Appellees knew that the taser would cause him injury. He argues that like Lockwood, who was put in a situation where his employer \u201cknew that a high risk existed that he would be injured,\u201d Appellees knew that tasing Harris would cause some injury and had the potential to cause serious injury or death. Harris\u2019s reliance on <em>Lockwood </em>is misplaced. In <em>Lockwood, </em>we stated that \u201can allegation of less than actual knowledge ... is insufficient as a matter of law to serve as the basis for avoiding MODA exclusivity.\u201d <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 209, 900 P.2d at 318. We recognized the difference between situations in which a defendant knew that its acts created a high degree of <em>risk </em>to the plaintiff versus a high degree of <em>harm. </em>The former, we determined, does not constitute an intentional injury. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 209, 900 P.2d at 318. The latter, we said, \u201cdiffers significantly from a mere allegation of known risk.\u201d <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 210, 900 P.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b629 In <em>Lockwood, </em>we found sufficient support for Lockwood\u2019s allegations that Grace knew its acts created a high degree of harm to Lockwood, particularly because Grace allegedly concealed its knowledge of the harm and affirmatively advised Lockwood that exposure to the vermiculite and asbestos dust was safe. <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 210, 900 P.2d at 319. The distinction between cases in which the knowledge element is met and when it is not is \u201cthe employer\u2019s alleged knowledge that the employee is being injured, in the former, versus the employer\u2019s exposing the employee to risk of harm without certain knowledge that the employee is being or will be harmed, in the latter.\u201d <em>Lockwood, </em>272 Mont. at 210, 900 P.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b630 Here, Appellees knew that using a taser created a risk of harm to Harris and the other employees who chose to undergo the exposure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>which it fully disclosed during the training. However, there is nothing to indicate that they had certain knowledge that any of the employees would be harmed. Because an employer\u2019s knowledge that its acts pose a risk to a plaintiff is not sufficient to establish \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of an injury\u2019s certainty, as required by \u00a7 37-71-413, MCA, Harris failed to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b631  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it determined that the WCA was the exclusive remedy for Harris\u2019s injuries and that his claims did not fall within the exception set forth in \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b632 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in determining that Harris does not have a cause of action for spoliation of evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b633 Harris argues the DOC either intentionally or negligently lost or destroyed the videotape of the July 26, 2006, training, and that he therefore has a valid cause of action against Appellees for intentional or negligent spoliation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b634  The torts of intentional and negligent spoliation of evidence are not recognized in Montana as independent causes of action against a direct party. <em>See Oliver v. Stimson Lumber </em>Co., 1999 MT 328, \u00b6 32, 297 Mont. 336, 993 P.2d 11. They apply only to non-parties to the litigation. <em>Estate of Willson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 23, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410. Under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, trial judges are well-equipped to address a situation where one party alleges spoliation of evidence by another party in a lawsuit, and can even enter default when necessary. <em>Oliver, </em>\u00b6 32. Here, Harris brought the claim against a direct party in the case; no third party was alleged to have destroyed evidence. Therefore, his tort claim is not recognized in Montana. In order for the District Court to have had authority to address Harris\u2019s spoliation of evidence argument in some other way, there would have to first be a viable cause of action. <em>See Oliver, </em>\u00b6 32. Because Harris\u2019s personal injury claim against Appellees is barred by \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, the District Court correctly determined that it could not remedy his alleged spoliation of evidence assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b635 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b313-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b313-12\">JUSTICE RICE, concurring.</judges>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b637 I concur with the result reached by the Court but not with the analysis. I believe the Court\u2019s decision will foster confusion regarding the intentional injury exception to worker\u2019s compensation exclusivity.</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">\u00b638 Harris cites to several cases that were decided under prior statutory schemes governing the intentional injury exception. The Court states that the analyses regarding intentional injury in these prior-law cases \u201cremain useful\u201d regarding \u201cthe proof required to show harm an employer specifically directed at an employee.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19. About one of these, the 1995 <em>Lockwood </em>case, the Court states the holding there concerning the intention necessary to establish that an injury was intentional \u201cretains some relevancy.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The Court\u2019s overall holding is premised in large part upon its discussion and application of <em>Lockwood. See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19,20,22,28, 29. The Court concludes by reaffirming the <em>Lockwood </em>construct that \u201c[t]he distinction between cases in which the knowledge element is met and when it is not is \u2018the employer\u2019s alleged knowledge that the employee is being injured, in the former, versus the employer\u2019s exposing the employee to risk of harm without certain knowledge that the employee is being or will be harmed, in the latter.\u2019\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Lockwood). </em>After reaffirming the analysis in Lockwood, the Court distinguishes it from the present case on the ground that the employer in <em>Lockwood </em>\u201callegedly concealed knowledge from the plaintiff that the work environment was dangerous.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22.1 submit that the Court\u2019s analysis is not a precise statement of current law and will engender confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b639 The legislative amendments to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, were significant, as they were expressly intended to overturn prior court applications of the statute. <em>See </em>Ch. 229, Laws of Montana (2001) (stating the bill was introduced to redefine the standard of intentional injury in response to court decisions); <em>see also Wise v. CNH America, </em>2006 MT 194, \u00b6 11, 333 Mont. 181, 142 P.3d 774 (\u201cThe amended version of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, contains significantly different language than the version we interpreted in <em>Sherner.\u201d). </em>The \u201cintentional injury\u201d necessary to come within the exception to exclusivity is now defined as \u201can injury caused by <em>an intentional and deliberate act </em>that is specifically and actually <em>intended </em>to cause injury to the employee injured and there is <em>actual knowledge </em>that an injury is <em>certain to occur.\u201d </em>Section 39-71-413(3), MCA (emphasis added); <em>see also Alexander, </em>\u00b6 21. This is not the same definition as provided in the <em>Lockwood </em>construct of intentional injury here employed by the Court. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 29. The <em>Lockwood </em>construct determined that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>knowledge element is met\u201d by \u201cthe employer\u2019s alleged knowledge that the employee is being injured.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29 (citing <em>Lockwood). </em>The <em>Lockwood </em>construct does not incorporate the concept, now in current law, that the necessary intention for the injury is multi-layered: caused by an \u201cintentional and deliberate act\u201d that was \u201cspecifically and actually intended to cause injury,\u201d plus \u201cactual knowledge that an injury is certain to occur.\u201d In <em>Alexander, </em>we cited <em>Lockwood </em>as background but enunciated a new standard based upon the new statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">[W]e hold that deliberate and intentional conduct may be inferred from factual allegations indicating that an employer knew an employee was being harmed, failed to warn the employee of the harm, and intentionally continued to expose the employee to the harm. Additionally, as required under the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-413(3), MCA, the employee must allege and demonstrate that the employer had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the certainty of injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A59\"><em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 30. Whatever relevancy <em>Lockwood </em>and other prior-law cases have was subsumed into this statement about the new standard. It strikes me as unwise to premise an opinion primarily on the <em>Lockwood </em>construct when, at best, it addresses the new intention element only in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b640 Instead of reaffirming prior-law cases and holding that this case turns on the absence of \u201cconcealed knowledge ... that the work environment was dangerous\u201d that distinguishes this case from <em>Lockwood, </em>Opinion, \u00b6 22,1 would simply affirm the District Court by concluding that the evidence offered by Harris did not satisfy the definition of \u201cintentional injury\u201d as currently defined by statute and as applied in <em>Alexander.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b641 I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> Specifically, he cites to <em>Blythe v.
