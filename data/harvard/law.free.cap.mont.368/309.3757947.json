We affirm and address the issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing Kelly\u2019s postconviction relief petition as insufficiently pled?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b63 On February 22, 2010, Poison Police Officer William Cleveland pulled Kelly over for speeding. Officer Cleveland ultimately arrested Kelly for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). Based on his previous DUI convictions, the State charged Kelly with felony DUI and also petitioned to revoke the suspended sentence Kelly was serving for a previous DUI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b64 On November 18, 2010, Kelly appeared before the District Court to enter a guilty plea to the felony DUI charge and to admit that he had violated the terms of his suspended sentence. He pled guilty to the felony DUI charge without entering a plea bargain agreement with the State. The District Court accepted Kelly\u2019s guilty plea and also revoked Kelly\u2019s suspended sentence. At a later sentencing hearing, the State made recommendations and the District Court sentenced Kelly to the Montana State Prison for a term of 40 years with 25 years suspended for the felony DUI, and to a term of 15 years on the previous DUI for which Kelly\u2019s suspended sentence had been revoked. The court ordered these sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b65 On December 30, 2011, Kelly filed a petition for postconviction relief, asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings. He alleged that \u201cjust prior to sentencing,\u201d his court-appointed attorney told him for the first time that the State had made a more favorable plea offer before he changed his plea to guilty that would have resulted in \u201ca lesser amount of time to be served.\u201d The State responded by asking that Kelly\u2019s petition be dismissed because it failed to provide any factual support for these allegations-i.e., Kelly did not provide affidavits, record evidence, or other evidence. The District Court agreed and summarily dismissed Kelly\u2019s petition for failing to provide factual support for his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b66 Kelly appeals. Attached to Kelly\u2019s opening brief on appeal is a one-page affidavit in support of his claim. It avers, in toto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">1.1 am the appellant in the above entitled matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">2. My Counsel at the District Court level was inadequate and failed to inform me in a timely fashion of my choice of alternatives to accepting the plea he presented me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">3. After I signed the plea in its present form, I was informed by my counsel that there was a less harsh plea available but if I were to take it, I would forfeit my chance at Sentence Review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">4. Had I been informed as to the existence of a less harsh plea by my counsel I would have persued [sic] that course of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">5. If my counsel had informed me as to my legal rights upon any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>adjudication of guilt being allowed the right to sentence review, I would have persued [sic] a different course of action than I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b67 When a district court dismisses a petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law, we review that legal conclusion for correctness. <em>Herman v. State, </em>2006 MT 7, \u00b6 13, 330 Mont. 267, 127 P.3d 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b68 Kelly challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that his claim was insufficiently pled and offers that his legal resources were restricted due to his incarceration. He also argues the merits of his claim by citing to <em>Missouri v. </em>Frye, _ U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012), a recent U.S. Supreme Court case addressing ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea-bargaining stage. He states that, \u201c[i]n Frye, as in this case, the defendant was misinformed of the availability of a plea offer by his court appointed counsel, that would have resulted in doing less prison time.... Since the 2 cases are so similar, it must also stand to reason this appellant has had his 6th Amendment rights violated, and is due relief from the violation.\u201d The State argues that the District Court properly dismissed the petition on procedural grounds and asks that we not consider the affidavit attached to Kelly\u2019s brief because it was not presented to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\u00b69 We have explained that \u201c[u]nlike civil complaints, the postconviction statutes are demanding in their pleading requirements.\u201d <em>Ellenburg v. Chase, </em>2004 MT 66, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 315, 87 P.3d 473. Section 46-21-104, MCA, enumerates the mandatory contents of a petition for postconviction relief. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">(1) The petition for postconviction relief must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">(a) identify the proceeding in which the petitioner was convicted, give the date of the rendition of the final judgment complained of, and <em>clearly set forth the alleged violation or </em>violations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">(c) <em>identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Section 46-21-104, MCA (emphasis added); <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 12. We have thus explained that \u201ca petition for postconviction relief must be based on more than mere conclusory allegations. It must \u2018identify all facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, 42 P.3d 753 (quoting \u00a7 46-21-104(1)(c), MCA)). Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we have held that such claims \u201cmust be grounded upon facts which appear in or are easily deduced from the record and which go beyond the mere conclusory allegations in the defendant\u2019s affidavit.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>177 Mont. 474, 485, 582 P.2d 346, 352-53 (1978) <em>(overruled on other grounds, Fjelstad v. State Through Dept. of Highways, </em>267 Mont. 211, 220, 883 P.2d 106, 111 (1994)); <em>accord State v. Hulbert, </em>232 Mont. 115, 120, 756 P.2d 1110, 1113 (1988) (\u201ca claim of ineffective counsel must be grounded in facts found in the record, not on \u2018mere conclusory allegations.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. McColley, </em>247 Mont. 524, 527, 807 P.2d 1358, 1360 (1991); <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 117, 53 P.3d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b610 These requirements are consistent with federal precedent requiring a defendant to bring forward more evidence than a \u201cself-serving statement.\u201d <em>See Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 881 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201cTurner\u2019s self-serving statement, made years later, that [his lawyer] told him that \u2018this was not a death penalty case\u2019 is insufficient to establish that Turner was unaware of the potential of a death verdict.\u201d); <em>Cuppett v. Duckworth, </em>8 F.3d 1132, 1139 (7th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (rejecting defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim because the only evidence submitted by the defendant was a \u201cself-serving affidavit in support of this allegation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b611 The only facts offered to support the claim are contained in the short affidavit from Kelly, attached to his opening brief on appeal. Kelly\u2019s affidavit is not properly before this Court because it was not submitted to the District Court. <em>See State v. J.C, </em>2004 MT 75, \u00b6 25, 320 Mont. 411, 87 P.3d 501 (\u201cOn appeal, we consider only the district court record. ... \u2018Parties on appeal are bound by the record and may not add additional matters in briefs or appendices.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). However, even if the affidavit had been properly submitted, its conclusory statements are insufficient as a matter of law to support a postconviction claim under the precedent discussed above. From Kelly, the affidavit is self-serving, but beyond that, it falls short of identifying \u201call facts supporting the grounds for relief\u2019 and providing the necessary detail and evidence to establish the factual foundation for the claim. Section 46-21-104(1)(c), MCA. Kelly\u2019s incarceration, as he asserts, may well have hampered his efforts to marshal this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>information, but these pleading standards must nonetheless be satisfied, and, in fact, have been satisfied by other postconviction claimants who are incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b612  In <em>Frye, </em>the prosecutor sent Frye\u2019s counsel a letter offering Frye a choice between two plea bargains.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1404. The letter stated that the offers would expire in a little over a month. Frye\u2019s lawyer received the letter but never told Frye about it. Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1404. Frye eventually pled guilty without a plea agreement and was sentenced to a substantially harsher sentence than was recommended in the plea offers. Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1404-05. Frye filed postconviction relief proceedings in state court. The Missouri Court of Appeals determined that Frye\u2019s counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to inform Frye of the plea offers. <em>Frye, </em>U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1405. As a remedy, the Missouri Court deemed Frye\u2019s plea as withdrawn. Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1405. After the State of Missouri sought review, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed, holding \u201cas a general rule, defense counsel has a duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.\u201d Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1408. Applying the standards under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), the Supreme Court determined that Frye\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether Frye had been prejudiced under the second prong, noting \u201cthere is strong reason to doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have permitted the plea bargain to become final.\u2019\u2019Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1411. Unlike <em>Frye, </em>where the existence of bona fide plea offers and defense counsel\u2019s failure to communicate the offers were undisputed, there is here no record evidence of a formal plea offer or of Kelly\u2019s lawyer\u2019s failure to inform him of a plea offer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>other than Kelly\u2019s insufficient affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b613 <em>Frye </em>does not override Montana law governing pleading requirements in a postconviction proceeding. The Supreme Court clarified that states are permitted to adopt measures to \u201chelp ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims, after a later, less advantageous plea offer has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction with resulting harsh consequences.\u201d Frye, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 1409. That is precisely what the above-discussed Montana law does.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"At_h\"> The prosecutor\u2019s letter, sent on November 15, 2007, stated, in pertinent part: My recommendation is as follows: 3 and defer, on the felony with 10 days \u201cshock\u201d in the Boone County Jail; <em>OR </em>90 days to serve on an amended misdemeanor in the Boone County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">I am going to subpoena witnesses for the preliminary hearing on January 4,2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">I will need to know if Mr. Frye will be waiving to preserve the offer by noon on December 28, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-25\">Joint Appendix, <em>Missouri v.
