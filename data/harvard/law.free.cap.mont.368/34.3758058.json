BCBSMT sought to compel arbitration pursuant to an employment agreement that required arbitration of disputes. The District Court enforced the arbitration clause and transferred the matter to arbitration. Marsden appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b62 Marsden raises the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b63 <em>Whether Marsden must contest the validity of her employment contract through arbitration in the first instance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b64 BCBSMT, a Montana non-profit corporation, signed an employment agreement with Marsden, a Montana resident, on September 17, 2010. The employment agreement contained a clause to compel arbitration for any disputes regarding the employment agreement. The employment agreement provided that Marsden would work from November 8, 2010, to December 31, 2012. Marsden served for approximately one year. BCBSMT terminated her employment in December 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b65 BCBSMT alleged that it terminated Marsden because she failed to submit a timely bid on behalf of BCBSMT in response to the State of Montana\u2019s Request for Proposals. Marsden claimed that BCBSMT terminated her in retaliation for her reporting of BCBSMT\u2019s allegedly illegal practice related to the rebating of insurance commissions. BCBSMT paid Marsden $328,478.10 when it terminated her. This money represented the remaining compensation that BCBSMT believed that it owed Marsden for the balance of her two-year contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">\u00b66 Marsden brought this action in which she claims that BCBSMT violated the WDEA. Marsden concedes that she could bring a WDEA claim only if she did not have a written contract of employment for a specific term. Section 39-2-912, MCA. Marsden argued, however, that the inclusion of a provision that allowed BCBSMT to terminate her employment if termination would be in the best interest of the company nullified the two-year term in her employment agreement. Marsden claimed therefore that she had been employed at-will.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u00b67 BCBSMT argued that whether Marsden had a term contract remained disputed and should have been resolved through arbitration. The District Court compelled arbitration to allow the arbitrator to determine in the first instance whether Marsden had a term employment contract. Marsden appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s order to compel arbitration. <em>Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6 8, 299 Mont. 237, 999 P.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b69 <em>Whether Marsden must contest the validity of her employment contract through arbitration in the first instance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b610 Marsden\u2019s employment agreement included two clauses that permitted BCBSMT to terminate her employment before her two-year term expired. The first clause, 8(d), provided that BCBSMT\u2019s president and CEO could terminate Marsden if he believed that it would be in the best interest of BCBSMT. The second clause, 8(e), provided that Marsden could be terminated \u201cfor cause.\u201d The parties agree that BCBSMT terminated Marsden pursuant to 8(d), the \u201cbest interest of BCBSMT\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b611 Marsden argues that the \u201cbest interest of BCBSMT\u201d clause essentially creates a \u201cwithout cause\u201d termination provision. Marsden further argues that this clause nullifies the two-year term contract and renders her an employee-at-will. Marsden argues that as an employee without a term-contract, she should be permitted to bring her WDEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b612 To support her claim that Marsden did not have a term contract, Marsden points to the recent case <em>Brown v. Yellowstone Club Operations, LLC, </em>2011 MT 155, 361 Mont. 124, 255 P.3d 205. Brown had an employment contract for a term of three years. The contract also contained a provision that permitted the Yellowstone Club to terminate Brown \u201cwithout cause.\u201d This Court determined that the \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision \u201ctrumped\u201d the definite employment term. Brown\u2019s contract did not qualify as a \u201cwritten contract for a specific term\u201d under WDEA due to the presence of these contradictory provisions. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u00b613 BCBSMT responds that whether Marsden\u2019s employment agreement was \u201cfor a specified term\u201d remains disputed. Unlike the employment contract <em>inBrown, </em>Marsden\u2019s employment agreement did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>not have a clause that allowed termination \u201cwithout cause.\u201d BCBSMT contends that it terminated Marsden\u2019s employment because she failed to submit a timely bid on behalf of BCBSMT to the State of Montana. BCBSMT argues that this action did not constitute termination \u201cwithout cause.\u201d BCBSMT further argues that pursuant to the arbitration clause in the employment agreement, an arbitrator, rather than a court, should interpret the employment agreement to resolve this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\u00b614  We first must determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate this dispute. <em>State ex rel. Bullock v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>2009 MT 261, \u00b6 15, 352 Mont. 30, 217 P.3d 475. Arbitration involves a matter of contract. <em>Bullock, </em>\u00b6 15. A party cannot be forced to arbitrate a dispute that it has not agreed to submit to arbitration. <em>Bullock, </em>\u00b6 15. A court generally should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a matter. <em>Bullock, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Solle, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b615  Marsden\u2019s employment agreement provided that the parties would submit to arbitration \u201cany disputes\u201d arising out of \u201cany of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.\u201d The parties dispute whether Marsden had a set-term employment contract or whether she served as an employee at-will. This dispute implicates the terms or provisions of the employment agreement. The parties contracted to resolve any disputes over terms or provisions of the employment agreement through arbitration. We agree with the District Court that an arbitrator should decide, in the first instance, whether Marsden was an at-will employee or whether she had a term contract. <em>Bullock, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Solle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-29. The arbitrator\u2019s determination will resolve whether Marsden can pursue her WDEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
