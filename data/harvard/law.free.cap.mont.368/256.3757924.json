R. App. P. 15(4) and our order of July 17, 2012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfH\">\u00b62 <em>Does \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, apply to a life insurance policy owner\u2019s designation of his spouse as the beneficiary, where the parties were later divorced prior to enactment of \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, and the policyholder died after enactment of the statute ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u00b63 Our answer is \u201cyes\u201d because \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, operates at the time of the insured\u2019s death and applies to any divorce that took place during the insured\u2019s lifetime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u00b64 We summarize the undisputed facts from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s certification order. In August 1990, Brent Anderson (Brent) purchased life insurance from Thrivent Financial for Lutherans and named the following beneficiaries: first, his then-wife Lucia, second, his parents, and third, his sister. In June 1993, Brent and Lucia divorced in Arizona. Brent was awarded his life insurance policy in the divorce decree. Later that same year, in October 1993, \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, became effective in Montana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute provides that a divorce revokes \u201cany revocable disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to the individual\u2019s former spouse in a governing instrument!.]\u201d Section 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u00b65 Brent died in Montana in August 2010. He had never changed his designation of Lucia as primary beneficiary under his life insurance policy. Thrivent filed an interpleader action to determine the rightful beneficiary under Brent\u2019s policy. The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of Lucia, based in part on the fact that \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, became effective after Brent and Lucia\u2019s divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b66 When answering a certified question as permitted by M. R. App. P. 15(3), this Court\u2019s review is \u201cpurely an interpretation of the law as applied to the [pertinent] facts underlying the action.\u201d <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Feit, </em>2012 MT 147, \u00b6 6, 365 Mont. 359, 281 P.3d 225 (quoting <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Bush Hog, LLC, </em>2009 MT 349, \u00b6 4, 353 Mont. 173, 219 P.3d 1249).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b67  Our precedents establish that the interest of an insurance policy beneficiary is like that of a legatee under a will-\u201ca mere expectancy of a gift at the time of the insured\u2019s death.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Anderson, </em>2009 MT 344, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 139, 218 P.3d 1220 (quoting <em>Grimm v. Grimm, </em>157 P.2d 841, 842-43 (Cal. 1945)); <em>see also Feely v. Lacey, </em>133 Mont. 283, 297, 322 P.2d 1104, 1111 (1958). A life insurance policy owner, like a testator, may alter or revoke designations at any time until death; thus, either instrument-whether will or insurance policy-must be interpreted and applied at death in order to effectuate the transferor\u2019s final intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b68 The Official Comments to \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, support the conclusion that the life insurance policy, like a will, is not given effect until the time of death. Montana adopted the revocation-upon-divorce statute from the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) in order to \u201cunify the law of probate and nonprobate transfers.\u201d Tit. 72, ch. 2, Mont. Code Ann., <em>Annotations, </em>Official Comments at 635 (2012). The Comments indicate that the revocation statute operates at the time the \u201cgoverning instrument is given effect\u201d and the provision to the former spouse is to be treated \u201cas if the divorced individual\u2019s former spouse (and relatives of the former spouse) disclaimed the revoked provisions[.]\u201d Tit. 72, ch. 2, Mont. Code Ann., <em>Annotations, </em>Official Comments at 636 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"AzT\">\u00b69 The Comments reference two law review articles that provide \u201c[t]he theory of this section[.]\u201d <em>See </em>Tit. 72, ch. 2, Mont. Code Ann., <em>Annotations, </em>Official Comments at 636 (2012) (citing Lawrence W. Waggoner, <em>The Multiple-Marriage Society and Spousal Rights Under the Revised Uniform Probate Code, </em>76 Iowa L. Rev. 223 (1991) and John H. Langbein, <em>The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, </em>97 Harv. L. Rev. 1108 (1984)). The articles discuss the history and purpose of revocation-upon-divorce statutes and confirm that, under those statutes, life insurance is to be treated in the same manner as a will. According to Langbein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">The label aside, life insurance is functionally indistinguishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>from a will, for it satisfies the twin elements of the definition of a will. We say that a will is revocable until the death of the testator and that the interests of the devisees are ambulatory-that is, <em>nonexistent until the testator\u2019s death. </em>Unless specially restricted by contract, the life insurance beneficiary designation operates identically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">Langbein, 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1110 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b610 This commentary is consistent with the interpretation of other jurisdictions that apply the revocation-upon-divorce statute as a rule of construction at the time the governing instrument is given effect. <em>See e.g. Buchholz v. Storsve, </em>740 N.W.2d 107, 111 (S.D. 2007); <em>Stillman v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Assn. College Ret. Equities Fund, </em>343 F.3d 1311, 1317-18 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u201cRevocation-upon-divorce statutes \u2018reflect the legislative judgment that when the transferor leaves unaltered a will or trust or insurance beneficiary designation in favor of an ex-spouse, this failure to designate substitute takers more likely than not represents inattention rather than intention.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Statement of the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Probate Code Regarding the Constitutionality of Changes in Default Rules as Applied to Pre-existing Documents </em>at 3-4 (1991)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b611 Lucia argues that revoking her status as beneficiary would require impermissible retroactive application of the law. Section 1-2-109, MCA (\u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d). A statute is retroactive if it \u201ctakes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions already past.\u201d <em>Allen v. A. Richfield Co., </em>2005 MT 281, \u00b6 16, 329 Mont. 230, 124 P.3d 132 (quoting <em>Williams v. Wellman-Power Gas, Inc., </em>174 Mont. 387, 390, 571 P.2d 90, 92 (1977)); <em>see also Porter v. Galarneau, </em>275 Mont. 174, 183, 911 P.2d 1143, 1150 (1979). A statute is not given retroactive effect \u201cmerely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>275 Mont. at 183, 911 P.2d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00b612  Because \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, operates at the time of the transferor\u2019s death, the statute is not given retroactive effect when applied to a divorce predating its enactment. Prior to Brent\u2019s death, Lucia had no vested rights in the proceeds of his insurance policy. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 23. Instead, her property interest was equivalent to that of a devisee under a will-\u201cambulatory\u201d and \u201cnonexistent.\u201d Langbein, 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1110. The operation of the revocation-upon-divorce statute therefore does not \u201cimpairD vested rights\u201d and did not result in a different legal effect from that which the transaction had under the law at the time it occurred. <em>Porter, </em>275 Mont. at 183, 911 P.2d at 1148-49. The designation of Lucia as beneficiary had no legal effect before the date of Brent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b613  Lucia also points out the U.S. District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Eschler v. Eschler, </em>257 Mont. 360, 849 P.2d 196 (1993), a case decided prior to the effective date of \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, which held that the life insurance policyholder\u2019s designation of his wife as beneficiary was not revoked by subsequent divorce. There, the insured died having begun, but not completed, the necessary paperwork to change his policy beneficiary and we determined that his \u201cactions do not evidence a sufficient determination to change the beneficiary designation[.]\u201d <em>Eschler, </em>257 Mont. at 369, 849 P.2d at 202. <em>Eschler </em>does not apply here because \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, establishes the insured\u2019s intention to revoke an ex-spouse\u2019s beneficiary status and would have affected the analysis in that case. <em>Eschler, </em>moreover, is not relevant to the question certified for our review-whether the revocation-upon-divorce statute applies to a divorce that pre-dates the statute\u2019s enactment. The language of \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, and the authorities we discuss address that question and direct us to answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> Section 72-2-814, MCA, was enacted during the 1993 legislative session and became effective on October 1, 1993, because the statute did not provide a different effective date.

Codified Laws \u00a7 29A-8-101(b)(2). Although Montana\u2019s code lacks the express statutory provision, the Official Comments nonetheless suggest that the statute operates at the time the instrument is given effect-i.e., upon death.
