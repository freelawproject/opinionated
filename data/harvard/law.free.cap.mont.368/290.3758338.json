We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court comply with \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, when it amended the prior parenting plan ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in determining the best interest of the Klatt children?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b65 Shiloh and Sheila Klatt were married in Gallatin County, Montana, in 1993. Between the years of 1998 and 2002, the Klatts had a daughter and two sons: C.J.K., T.S.K. and C.S.K., respectively. In June 2006, after Sheila filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage, the Klatts entered a Marital Dissolution Agreement and Parenting Plan (June 2006 Parenting Plan), which provided in part that \u201cthe parties shall share alternate two weeks of parenting with the minor children, with all the children being together whenever possible. The parties shall each enjoy five weeks of uninterrupted parenting a year to allow for vacation time with the minor children.\u201d At that time, Sheila was a non-practicing licensed cosmetologist, who stayed at home full-time to care for the children. Shiloh worked as a self-employed certified public accountant (CPA) and agreed to pay maintenance and child support to Sheila pursuant to the parenting plan. Following entry of the parenting plan, Shiloh often took the children on extended international trips during his parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">\u00b66 On September 28, 2009, Sheila filed a motion to modify the June 2006 Parenting Plan. She stated that the Klatts had not followed the plan due to Shiloh\u2019s business activities and personal trips, which caused a significant decrease in his visitation with the children. Particularly during tax season-January through April-when Shiloh\u2019s professional activities increased, the children resided with Sheila on a full-time basis. Her motion alleged, \u201c[t]he fact that the children are and have been spending substantially less time with their father than what is allowed in the existing parenting plan constitutes a substantial change of circumstances as contemplated by \u00a7 40-4-219[,] MCA.\u201d Shiloh filed a response denying that his business and personal trips had decreased his parenting time. He alleged that Sheila remained underemployed and, as a result of her financial difficulties, the parties had agreed to increase Shiloh\u2019s work during tax season so that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>could provide additional support to the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b67 After attending mediation in January 2010, the parties stipulated to hiring Christopher Hahn, Ph.D., as Guardian ad Litem and Parenting Plan Coordinator. They stipulated that Dr. Hahn would, among other things, \u201chave some of the authority ordinarily reserved to the Court to make decisions clarifying, augmenting, implementing, adapting, and to a certain extent, interpreting and modifying the court-ordered parenting plan when the parents disagree.\u201d They agreed that Dr. Hahn would \u201cbase all decisions on the best interests of the children.\u201d The District Court\u2019s April 2,2010 order appointed Dr. Hahn as Guardian ad Litem, directed him to prepare a report of his observations of the family by June 4, 2010, and stated that the court would \u201creview the results\u201d of the Klatts\u2019 stipulation rather than mandate conformance to its terms. Dr. Hahn filed an Initial Report on June 4, 2010, stating that he had limited opportunity to observe the Klatts, particularly the interaction of the children with their father, and that he would file additional reports as he gathered information and spent more time with the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b68 On October 25, 2010, Shiloh agreed to a temporary child residency arrangement, under which the Klatt children would reside with Sheila from September 1, 2010, through May 31, 2011, but would have varying weekend visitation with Shiloh. Beginning June 1, 2011, the children would continually alternate between three weeks with Shiloh and two weeks with Sheila until August 31, 2011, when the arrangement would expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b69 On October 20, 2011, after observing the Klatt family for about one and one-half years, Dr. Hahn filed a full report. He recommended that \u201cthe parenting plan be amended to reflect the changes that were made by stipulation for the 2010/2011 school year.\u201d Dr. Hahn now had observed closely the interactions between the children and each parent, had on numerous occasions communicated individually with the Klatt children and each parent, and also had met once with the whole family. Dr. Hahn\u2019s report revealed that the Klatt children \u201cstrongly preferred\u201d residing with their mother and emphasized, \u201c[i]t is remarkable how strong, constant, and unified the opinions of the children have been throughout the duration of my term as parenting plan coordinator. They have never wavered in their basic wishes.\u201d For that reason, Dr. Hahn suggested that the \u201cwishes of the child,\u201d under \u00a7 40-4-212(l)(b), MCA, would be a \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d factor in determining the best interest of the Klatt children. According to Dr. Hahn, the children expressed frustration with Shiloh\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>provide for their basic needs and described experiences while in their father\u2019s care that caused them apprehension, fear, and anger-including an incident when Shiloh became angry while driving on the interstate highway and slammed on the brakes so hard that his vehicle, in which the children were passengers, spun 180 degrees in the roadway. Dr. Hahn concluded in summary, \u201cI believe that the children would want more time with their Dad if their basic parenting needs are better met by him, but at the present time and for the entire period of time that I have been involved with this case, the children are highly frustrated and sometimes angry about the time they have to spend with their Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b610 On December 16, 2011, Shiloh filed a motion to dismiss Dr. Hahn and rescind the contract appointing him as Guardian ad Litem. He requested that the District Court strike Dr. Hahn\u2019s October 2011 report, as it was made after the court-ordered date of June 4, 2010, and was based on \u201cfactual misstatements.\u201d Sheila filed a response on December 30, 2011, reiterating her reasons for requesting an amendment to the parenting plan and suggesting that the District Court adopt Dr. Hahn\u2019s recommendations. On January 9,2012, Shiloh filed a petition to hold Sheila in contempt under \u00a7 3-1-501(e), MCA, for failing to follow the court\u2019s orders and the June 2006 Parenting Plan. He alleged that Sheila had prevented, obstructed, or frustrated his contact with the children, in particular his communication with their thirteen-year-old daughter, C. J.K. His supporting affidavit stated that Sheila had blocked calls from Shiloh to C. J.K., would not allow C. J.K. to speak with Shiloh alone, and, in January 2012, supported C.J.K\u2019s refusal to stay with Shiloh, in disregard of the June 2006 Parenting Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b611 The District Court held a hearing on February 13,2012, in which it heard testimony from Sheila, Shiloh, Dr. Hahn and other witnesses, and questioned the parties. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court discussed on the record the \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, factors used to determine the best interest of the child. The court found the evidence did not support Shiloh\u2019s allegation that Sheila had obstructed his communication and contact with the children and stated that \u201crespect\u201d had become an issue central to the family. The court stated that mutual anger existed between the children and their father, which could adversely affect the children, and noted the incident where Shiloh \u201cslammed on the [brakes], the vehicle spun around and scared the kids badly.\u201d The court also stated that credible evidence indicated that \u201cat least from time to time, if not constantly, the children are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>frightened.\u201d Shiloh had conceded during the hearing that he had on occasion over-disciplined the children. The court agreed with Dr. Hahn that the wishes of the children and the \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, factors, including continuity and stability of care, were \u201ccogent here\u201d and expressed concern that if the historical divergence from the parenting plan continued, the children would experience a lack of structure and consistency. On February 29, 2012, the District Court ordered a new parenting plan providing that the children primarily would reside with Sheila during the school year and granting Shiloh visitation on one weekday each week and every other weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b612 We review for clear error the findings of fact underlying a district court\u2019s decision to modify a parenting plan. <em>In re Marriage of Banka, </em>2009 MT 33, \u00b6 9, 349 Mont. 193, 201 P.3d 830 (citing <em>Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 13, 333 Mont. 323, 142 P.3d 859). If its findings are not clearly erroneous, \u201cwe will reverse the district court\u2019s decision only where an abuse of discretion is clearly demonstrated.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 9, 309 Mont. 254, 46 P.3d 49). We review de novo whether a court\u2019s action conforms to statutory requirements. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b613 We have repeated on numerous occasions that the trial court\u2019s decision is to be accorded great deference because it \u201cis in a better position than this Court to resolve child custody issues.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Wilson, </em>2009 MT 203, \u00b6 15, 351 Mont. 204, 210 P.3d 170 (quoting <em>In re Marriage of McKenna, </em>2000 MT 58, \u00b6 17, 299 Mont. 13, 996 P.2d 386); <em>see also Pankratz v. Teske, </em>2002 MT 112, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 499, 48 P.3d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court comply with \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, when it amended the prior parenting plan </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b615 Shiloh contends that the District Court erred by failing to make a finding of changed circumstances as required by \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">The court may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u00b616 The District Court did not expressly discuss changed circumstances in its order, but, on the record, acknowledged the \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, requirements and noted numerous facts that had arisen since the parties entered the June 2006 Parenting Plan. Our precedents provide that, while an explicit finding is \u201cpreferable,\u201d a district court may satisfy the requirement by \u201cclearly stat[ing] the component parts of a change in circumstances finding[.]\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Burk, </em>2002 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 310 Mont. 498, 51 P.3d 1149. We have reversed the district court\u2019s custody modification order when there is \u201cno explicit indication that the court found, based on new or previously unknown facts, a change in circumstances[.]\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18,21 (remanding for entry of factual findings where the district court entered a one sentence order of modification and provided no account of the \u201cevidence relative to the statutory requirements necessary to modify an existing parenting plan\u201d); <em>see also Banka, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 11 (reversing because the district court modified the parenting plan without holding a hearing or entering written findings and the Court was \u201cunable to ascertain what essential and determining facts the District Court relied upon\u201d); <em>see also In re Marriage of Whyte, </em>2012 MT 45, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24, 364 Mont. 219, 272 P.3d 102 (reversing decision to modify where the district court did not provide account of facts arising since prior parenting plan, and prior plan was \u201cfaithfully followed over many years and work[ed] well.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b617 In contrast, a change of circumstances has been established where, as here, the evidence showed facts that had arisen since the prior parenting plan-including the parties\u2019 failure to follow the plan. <em>See e.g. Burk, </em>\u00b6 10 (father had moved the children to his parents\u2019 home when parenting plan ordered that children would reside with him at his residence); <em>In re Marriage of Robison, </em>2002 MT 207, \u00b6 34, 311 Mont. 246, 53 P.3d 1279 (the parties\u2019 actual arrangement differed from the parenting plan). Sheila points out that the parties sought the assistance of Dr. Hahn and entered a temporary parenting schedule because they agreed they had substantially deviated from the June 2006 Parenting Plan. The KLatts\u2019 stipulation confirms that Sheila and Shiloh expressly contemplated \u201cmodification of a court-ordered parenting plan through the informal process described in this Order.\u201d While the stipulation did not carry the force of a court order, it reflects the parties\u2019 agreement that the June 2006 Parenting Plan could be subject to modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b618 Sheila also notes that the District Court expressed concern during the hearing, based in part on Dr. Hahn\u2019s commentary, that, during his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>parenting time, Shiloh had tended to over-discipline the children in a fashion that was \u201cpotentially abusive.\u201d Shiloh acknowledged that he had sometimes \u201clost control of my anger,\u201d grabbed the children \u201cby the back of the neck and I\u2019ve grabbed them by the hairs of the back of their neck.\u201d The District Court referred to these and other incidents when it concluded, \u201cI understand that the children are angry. It\u2019s very apparent their father is angry, too, very angry.\u201d Sheila testified that fear and a lack of mutual respect between Shiloh and the children had recently caused an increase in the children\u2019s behavioral issues. This testimony supports the District Court\u2019s decision that a change in circumstances required re-evaluating the best interest of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">\u00b619 Shiloh also argues that the District Court applied an incorrect legal standard when it amended the June 2006 Parenting Plan. He alleges that the court failed to make any findings of fact or conclusions of law relating to \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, which governs amendment of the parenting plan, but instead relied on \u00a7 40-2-212, MCA, which lists the factors relevant to determining the \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b620 Section 40-4-219, MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">(1)... In determining the child\u2019s best interest under this section, the court may, in addition to the criteria in 40-4-212, also consider whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(a) the parents agree to the amendment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">(b) the child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with consent of the parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(c) the child is 14 years of age or older and desires the amendment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">(d) one parent has willfully and consistently:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">(i) refused to allow the child to have any contact with the other parent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">(ii) attempted to frustrate or deny contact with the child by the other parent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">(e) one parent has changed or intends to change the child\u2019s residence in a manner that significantly affects the child\u2019s contact with the other parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">(3) The court shall presume a parent is not acting in the child\u2019s best interest if the parent does any of the acts specified in subsection (l)(d)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">Contrary to Shiloh\u2019s assertion, the statutory language makes clear that, in deciding whether to modify a parenting plan, the court may rely on the factors listed in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, to determine the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b621 Shiloh argues that the District Court was required under \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, to consider the allegations in his contempt petition and supporting affidavit that Sheila had denied him contact with C. J.K. He points out that Sheila conceded during the hearing that she had blocked Shiloh\u2019s calls to C. J.K\u2019s phone and supported C. J.K\u2019s decision not to return to Shiloh\u2019s custody as required by the June 2006 Parenting Plan. He contends that \u201c[h]ad the court addressed \u00a7 40-4-219(3), it would have made a different conclusion in its determination of the best interests of the children[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b622  Section 40-4-219, MCA, provides the trial court broad discretion in evaluating which factors are relevant to the child\u2019s best interest and how much weight to give each factor-it states the court \u201cmay\u201d consider the listed criteria in addition to those provided in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. Moreover, our review of the record reveals that the District Court considered the allegations in Shiloh\u2019s contempt petition and affidavit but found them unsupported by the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Now, as I\u2019ve said that there isn\u2019t any evidence that Mother has maneuvered to try to place a wedge between Father and the children, I reiterate that; I don\u2019t see that\u2019s the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Sheila testified that she blocked Shiloh from contacting C.J.K\u2019s cell phone in response to \u201cdisrespectful\u201d text messages he sent to C.J.K., including \u2018You have no guts, you disgust me,\u201d and, \u2018You make me sick.\u201d She stated that she also let Shiloh know at that time that he could contact the home to talk with the children. The District Court\u2019s discussion on the record indicates that it considered the \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, factors, including subsection (3), and decided that they were not pertinent. We defer to its evaluation of the facts. \u201cIt is the function of the district court\u201d~not the appellate court-\u201cto resolve conflicts regarding <em>evidence.\u201d Pankratz, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cChild custody cases often present the court with difficult decisions. We must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of </em>Tummarello, 2012 MT 18, \u00b6 34, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28 (quoting In <em>re Parenting of N.S., </em>2011 MT 98, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863). The court did not clearly err in determining that \u00a7 40-4-219(3), MCA, did not apply in this case and did not abuse its discretion in relying on the factors listed in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, when deciding the best interest of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b623 <em>2. Did the District Court err in determining the best interest of the Klatt </em>children?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b624 Shiloh argues that the District Court erred in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>best interest of the children because it failed to rule on his petition for contempt. He also reiterates his earlier argument that the court did not \u201cadequately consider \u00a7 40-4-219(3)\u201d and did not deliver sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b625 Shiloh contends that the June 2006 Parenting Plan should have been enforced and that the court- was obligated to hold Sheila in contempt for violating its terms. We disagree because the District Court addressed Shiloh\u2019s concerns during the hearing. Sheila\u2019s motion to modify the June 2006 Parenting Plan was pending for nearly two and one-half years, during which time the parties participated in mediation, hired a Guardian ad Litem, and attempted to resolve the differences that had arisen since entry of the initial plan. There was substantial evidence to show that Sheila had not willfully disregarded the terms of the parenting plan and the District Court\u2019s rulings make clear that it did not agree with Shiloh\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b626  It bears emphasis that the District Court made findings as to each of the following \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, parenting factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">(a) the wishes of the child\u2019s parent or parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(b) the wishes of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(c) the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">child\u2019s parent or parents and siblings and with any other person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">who significantly affects the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">(d) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">(h) continuity of and stability of care;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">The evidence supported the District Court\u2019s findings that the children feared their father, were angered by him, felt frustrated by the lack of structure provided in his home, and desired unequivocally to be with their mother, even at times when they reported positive experiences with their father. The court was fully within its discretion when it concluded that the wishes of the children, continuity of and stability of care, and other factors weighed in favor of modifying the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">\u00b627 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-15\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
