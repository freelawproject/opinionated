In support, petitioners argue that Torres\u2019s work purchasing lands for the Colombian government prompted the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) to ascribe an anti-FARC and pro-Colombian government opinion to him. They argue that given the forty years of armed conflict between the FARC and the Colombian government, it is reasonable to assume the FARC would target Torres based on his purchase of lands for the government. They argue that the threatening telephone calls Torres received from the FARC, during which he was told to stop working on his projects or he would pay consequences, and that he was a military objective, were patterns of persecution. They further argue that the FARC has the capability to punish Torres and the Colombian government is incapable of controlling this group. Lastly, they argue that because Torres\u2019s fear of persecution exists on a countrywide basis, they cannot safely relocate to any part of Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We review the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005). Because the BIA in this case affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum is reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and must be upheld if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To reverse the IJ\u2019s findings, we must find that the record compels it. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">\u201cAn imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289 (quotations and citations omitted). An asylum applicant may not show merely that he has a political opinion, but must show that he was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201cIt is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (llth Cir.2004) (withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define persecution. We have described persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (llth Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThreats alone generally do not constitute actual persecution; only rarely, when they are so immediate and menacing as to cause significant suffering or harm in themselves, do threats per se qualify as persecution.\u201d <em>Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir. 2003) (persuasive authority). Finally, we have approved of a \u201ccountry-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in his own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (llth Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the threatening phone calls Torres received were not so severe as to constitute past persecution, and he failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. He also failed to show compelling evidence that any possible persecution would be on account of his actual or imputed political opinion as opposed to refusing to cooperate with the FARC\u2019s demands. Thus, because the IJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-16\">. In his order, the IJ also denied withholding of removal under the INA and relief under the CAT. <em>(See </em>AR at 55, 307, 317, 327). In their brief, petitioners make no argument that they qualified for withholding of removal under the INA or relief under CAT, and, accordingly, they have waived review of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief <em>on these </em>bases. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (recognizing that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
