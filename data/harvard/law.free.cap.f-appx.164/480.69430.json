Hernandez argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The erroneous application of the guidelines as mandatory is technically a <em>\u201cFan-fan </em>error.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government concedes that Hernandez preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim for appeal and that the issue is reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The Government contends that harmless error is shown by the imposition of a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence in the middle of the guidelines range. However, the Government does not carry its arduous burden of showing that the district court would not have sentenced Hernandez differently under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284-85 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>error). We therefore we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">For the first time on appeal, Hernandez contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
