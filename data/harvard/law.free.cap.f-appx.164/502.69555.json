Jones contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts that were not proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Because Carter challenges errors that occurred at sentencing, the claim may not be asserted in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Insofar as he has suggested that he is entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 based on the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because relief under the latter section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d such suggestion is unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Carter has filed several collateral challenges to his sentence, including at least two prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petitions that were dismissed for failure to satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His pro se pleadings reflect a level of sophistication that indicates that he is well aware that his current 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition comes no closer to satisfying those criteria. Carter\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. Carter is hereby WARNED that any future frivolous pleading under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging this sentence will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
