On appeal, Soto argues the district court erred at sentencing by failing to award (1) a minor-role adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, based on his status as a courier, and (2) a safety-valve reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, because his criminal history was over-represented under the Guidelines calculus. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law regarding the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cas was the case before <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], the district court must calculate the Guidelines range accurately\u201d). A defendant seeking a minor-role reduction bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in a criminal offense \u201cis heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C). Accordingly, we review that determination for only clear error. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 937. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, ... it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. We review factual determinations under the safety-valve provision for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">The parties are familiar with the relevant facts and we only summarize the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>necessary to our analysis here. During a traffic stop in Kansas, Soto consented to a search of his vehicle. Inside of a hidden compartment in Soto\u2019s car, law enforcement recovered 11 \u201cbricks\u201d of cocaine wrapped in plastic wrap and weighing 8.993 kilograms. An ongoing investigation showed that Soto was operating as part of a larger conspiracy distributing cocaine from California to Florida. Soto pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The statutory mandatory-minimum penalty for Soto\u2019s offense of conviction was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned a base offense level of 32 and recommended a 2-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), and a 1-point downward adjustment for Soto\u2019s timely notice of his intent to plead guilty, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). Thus, the probation officer assigned Soto a total offense level of 29. As for criminal history, the PSI assessed one point for Soto\u2019s 2001 conviction for possession of alcohol by a minor, for which adjudication had been withheld and Soto received a sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c). Soto was still on probation at the time he committed the instant offense, thus warranting the assessment of two more criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). With a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category II (based on three criminal history points), the recommended Guidelines range was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. After taking into consideration the 120-month mandatory-minimum for Soto\u2019s offense, the effective Guidelines range was 120 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI also stated that Soto was then serving in Kansas a term of imprisonment resulting from an offense that was relevant conduct to the instant offense. Thus, the PSI noted the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), which governs imposition of sentence on a defendant who was convicted of a crime while serving an undischarged term of imprisonment for a prior conviction constituting relevant conduct to the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Over Soto\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the recommendations of the PSI, credited Soto for ten months of time he had already served in Kansas for a conviction constituting \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d and accordingly imposed a 110-month term of imprisonment. The court recognized the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory nature of the Guidelines and stated that, \u201c[ajfter considering the advisory sentencing guidelines and all the factors identified in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) through (7),] the sentence imposed [was] sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">First, Soto argues that he should have been given a two-level minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because, as a courier, he played a minor role relative to other participants in the conspiracy. The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease where the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is defined as \u201cany participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.3). To determine whether the adjustment applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the conduct for which he has been held accountable. See <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 934. With regard to drug couriers, we have indicated that our holding in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>\u201c[did] not create a presumption that drug couriers are never minor or minimal participants, any more than that they are always minor or minimal,\u201d but \u201c[r]ather ... [established] only that the district court must assess all of the facts probative of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>role in [his] relevant conduct in evaluating the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Where there is sufficient evidence, after measuring the defendant\u2019s role against the conduct for which he is being held accountable, a district court also may measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943. In making this inquiry, a district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they (1) are identifiable or discernable from the evidence, and (2) were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (stating that \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Here, the relevant conduct attributed to Soto was the possession of 8.993 kilograms of cocaine, which represented the amount of cocaine found in Soto\u2019s vehicle. At the plea colloquy, Soto <em>admitted </em>to the amount of cocaine found in his vehicle during the traffic stop and, at sentencing, he did not object to the PSI\u2019s calculation of the amount of cocaine found in his car. The possession of 8.993 kilograms of cocaine was sufficient to show that Soto\u2019s role was not minor in the relevant conduct of possession with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine. <em>Cf. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43 (observing \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to her own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d; observing that amount of drugs is \u201ca material consideration\u201d in assessing the defendant\u2019s role in offense and that amount of drugs may be \u201cthe dispositive factor\u201d). Therefore, the first principle of <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>precludes a minor role reduction and we discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to award the adjustment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Next, Soto argues he was entitled to a safety-valve reduction. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Soto faced \u201ca term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years[.]\u201d Although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 provides that the district court \u201cshall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines <em>without </em>regard to any statutory minimum sentence,\u201d to do so it first must find \u201cthat the defendant meets the [safety-valve] criteria in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(l)-(5).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At Soto\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>sentencing hearing, he challenged only the first safety-valve criterion of \u00a7 3553(f)(1). Guideline 501.2(a)(1), implementing \u00a7 3553(f)(1), provides for the safety-valve reduction if \u201cthe defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the Sentencing Guidelines <em>before </em>application of [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) ].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l) (emphasis added). Guideline 4A1.3(b), in turn, provides for situations where a defendant\u2019s criminal history category \u201csubstantially over-represents the seriousness of [his] criminal history\u201d or the likelihood of recidivism, by allowing for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"A4B\">However, a \u201cdefendant whose criminal history category is Category I after receipt of a downward departure under this subsection does not meet the [first criterion for the safety-valve] if, before receipt of the downward departure, the defendant had more than one criminal history point under \u00a7 4A1.1[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(3)(B). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), the Guidelines instruct the court to add 2 points to a defendant\u2019s criminal history \u201cif [he] committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation^]\u201d Simply put, the assessment of two criminal history points for Soto\u2019s commission of the instant offense while serving a term of probation made Soto ineligible for safety-valve relief. Accordingly, a <em>correct </em>application of the Guidelines prevented the court from giving Soto the benefit of a safety-valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Finally, to the extent Soto challenges the reasonableness of his sentence under <em>Booker, </em>we can find no error. The district court expressly stated, after consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, that the sentence was reasonable. The offense committed involved a substantial amount of cocaine, and Soto was already on probation. Moreover, Soto presented no history or characteristics so compelling as to undermine the reasonableness of a standard sentence. The court sentenced him within the Guidelines range, including specific directives as to Soto\u2019s education while incarcerated, pursuant to Soto\u2019s request. As such, we can find nothing to suggest that Soto\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. We recently rejected the government\u2019s argument that we do not have jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting government\u2019s argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050, 1052 (8th Cir.2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">We can find no legal error in the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, nor can we discern clear error in its factual findings. Accordingly, we affirm Soto\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-6\">. Given. Soto's failure to carry his burden on the first <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, we need not reach the second prong, but we nevertheless observe that this second principle would also defeat the award of a minor-role reduction here. The PSI outlined that the conspiracy in which Soto was involved included both \"leaders\u201d and \"transporters,\u201d and that the transporters may have taken possession of the drugs on a consignment basis. Based on the amounts confiscated at other points in the investigation, as outlined in the PSI, the 8.9 kilograms Soto possessed was a substantial amount. Therefore, information before the district court suggested that Soto was an average member of the conspiracy, something more than minimal or minor. In any event, the conduct of others who were involved in the overall scheme is irrelevant to the assessment of Soto's role, as he was not charged with a larger drug trafficking conspiracy and the other conspirators were not identifiable from the evidence. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944 (observing that, on second prong, \"the district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant\" and \"[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b996-11\">.

In his initial brief, Soto also \"moves to adopt co-appellants\u2019 briefs as they may apply.\u201d According to our rules, parties wishing to adopt other parties\u2019 briefs \"shall include a statement describing in detail which briefs and which portions of those briefs are adopted.\u201d 11th Cir. R. 28 \u2014 1(f); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(i). We retain discretion to consider arguments as adequately adopted despite an appellant's failure to comply with the adoption requirements in instances such as when not doing so would result in the anomaly of \u201drevers[ing] some convictions and not others when all defendants suffer from the same error.\u201d <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>626 F.2d 494, 497 (5th Cir. 19 80); <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (noting that decisions by the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981, are binding as precedent in this Circuit). Not only does Soto not identify which co-appellant's briefs he means, but he is the only appellant in this action. Accordingly, Soto\u2019s statement of adoption was inadequate to assert any arguments other than the ones we have addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
