The indictment did not allege that Santana-AIvarado\u2019s deportation was subsequent to a felony or aggravated-felony conviction, and it did not specifically cite to any subsection of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. In pertinent part, the sentencing guideline base offense level was increased sixteen levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Santana-Alvarado was previously deported after a state deferred-adjudication conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a crime of violence. Santana-Alvarado objected to this increase on the basis of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Santana-Alvarado challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Santana-Alvarado contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied</em>, \u2014 \u2022 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005) . Santana-Alvarado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Santana-Alvarado also argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory sentencing guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government concedes that Santana-AIvarado\u2019s objection on the basis of <em>Blakely </em>preserved this issue. Because the district court sentenced Santana-Alvarado under a mandatory guidelines regime, it committed Fanfan error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>also United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005) (discussing the difference between Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error and Fanfan error).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201cThus, the only question is whether the Government has <em>met its </em>burden to show harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt in the imposition of [Santana\u2019s] sentence.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Santana-Alvarado concedes that his argument that the error was structural in nature and thus not subject to harmless-error review is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005), but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. We are not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the error was harmless, particularly in light of the district court\u2019s lack of clear commentary regarding the sentence and its decision to sentence at the bottom of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Accordingly, we VACATE Santana-Alvarado\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\">. Although we must follow the panel's decision in <em>Walters, United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999), we note that the standard of review it applied \u2014 requiring the Government to show that preserved Fanfan error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 was not contested in the case and appears to be incorrect because Fanfan error is nonconstitutional error, <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 553 (4th Cir.2005) (pointing out that Fanfan error, unlike <em>Booker </em>error, is nonconstitutional). Rather, \u201charmless error\u201d in Fanfan cases is defined by the standard announced in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 876 (5th Cir. 1998) (applying <em>Kotteakos </em>to preserved non-constitutional error). But the issue is irrelevant here because the Government cannot meet either burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
