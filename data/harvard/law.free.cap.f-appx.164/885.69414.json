He contends for the third time that his sentence should have been reduced pursuant to Amendment 599 of the sentencing guidelines. After review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">We affirmed the denial of Cover\u2019s second motion to reduce his sentence in <em>United States v. Cover, </em>88 Fed.Appx. 392, 393 (11th Cir.2003). We adopt the following statement of facts and procedural history from Part I of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-17\">On 2 December 1997, Cover and two accomplices, armed with firearms, took control of a NationsBank and held 15 people captive by force and threats of violence. One of Cover\u2019s accomplices forced the victims at gunpoint to lie on the floor while the robbery occurred. Cover and one accomplice were immediately apprehended; the other accomplice escaped by carjacking and kidnaping a motorist. Cover was convicted and initially sentenced to a term of 195 months of imprisonment for bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and for using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-18\">Cover appealed his sentence and the government cross-appealed. We affirmed Cover\u2019s sentence as to all issues, except the weapon enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1279 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam). We remanded the case so that the district court could apply a six-level weapon enhancement un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>der \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), rather than the five-level enhancement the district court applied originally under 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). <em>Id. </em>On remand, the district court resentenced Cover to a total term of 211 months of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">Cover filed a motion to reduce sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 35282(c)(2), seeking retroactive application of U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (2000) (\u201cAmendment 599\u201d) to, <em>inter alia, </em>the weapon enhancement. The district court determined that, had Amendment 599 been in effect at the time of Cover\u2019s resentencing, the weapon enhancement would not have been applicable. The district court then applied our Bravo two-step analysis to determine the proper sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir. 2000). The district court first recalculated Cover\u2019s sentence under the amended guidelines. Next, the court considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that the factors in (a)(2) outweighed all the other listed factors. The court referenced the specific facts of the bank robbery and the fact that, while Cover had accepted responsibility for his participation in the offense, \u201cCover [had] never evinced true remorse. For example, ... he [had] never assisted the United States in identifying the other perpetrators.\u201d Cover appealed this sentence and we dismissed the appeal as untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">Cover then filed a second motion for reduction of sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking retroactive application of Amendment 599 to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) weapon enhancement. The district court denied Cover\u2019s motion \u201cfor the same reasons stated in [its earlier order]\u201d denying Cover\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Cover timely appealed ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">(footnote and record citations omitted). In that case, we determined that the \u201cdistrict court had the discretion to determine whether to reduce Cover\u2019s sentence and did not abuse that discretion by choosing to retain Cover\u2019s current sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">On 31 May 2005, Cover filed the motion for sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) that is at issue in this case. In support of his motion, Cover challenged the court\u2019s finding that Cover had not evinced true remorse. This finding was one of the district court\u2019s previous grounds for denying Cover \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Cover alleged that \u201c[t]his scenario had changed\u201d and urged the district court to make a de novo determination of his entitlement to relief in light of Cover\u2019s representations that he was \u201ca new and changed person\u201d who had become a \u201crole model in prison\u201d and had <em>\u201ctruly </em>repented of his crime.\u201d R2-242 at 7-9. Cover also offered to assist the government with \u201cany information about the fugitive man in this case,\u201d although he admitted he did not know the fugitive\u2019s whereabouts. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The government argued in response that the motion should be denied in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On 20 June 2005, the district court entered an order denying Cover\u2019s motion \u201cfor the same reasons stated in the Court\u2019s Order of April 24, 2001.\u201d R2-245 at unnumbered 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Cover argues that he should not have received a weapon enhancement to his sentence because it effectively punishes him twice for the same crime. He also contends that the district court failed to consider new law and new facts, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir. 2003), as well as his expressions of remorse, offers to identify co-criminals who were never caught, and work to rehabilitate himself that were not presented dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ing his first two motions to reduce his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1228 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThe abuse of discretion standard has been described as allowing a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989), modified on other grounds, <em>United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1425 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\"><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), holds that, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (emphasis in original). Thus, <em>\u201cBooker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Under Title 18, a district court has the discretion to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when that sentence was based on a guideline range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201c[T]he court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Detailed findings as to all the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) are unnecessary; \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997)'.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Section 3553 provides that, in imposing a sentence, the district court must consider factors including (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide the defendant with correctional treatment; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the guideline ranges established for the particular crime; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid disparities between defendants\u2019 sentences; and (7) the need to provide restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Guidelines Amendment 599 clarified the policy against double-counting a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and under a weapon enhancement for the underlying offense guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., Amendment 599 (2000). In considering a defendant\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>trict court must engage in a two-part analysis: first, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines; second, the court must decide whether, in its discretion, it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">As all parties concede, Amendment 599 is retroactively applicable to Cover\u2019s case. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that Amendment 599 applied to the enhancement the defendant received, but made no ruling regarding the second portion of the <em>Bravo </em>test. <em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Turning to <em>Bravo\u2019s </em>two-step analysis, the district court did recalculate his sentence in response to his first motion, then denied it because of the severity of the crime and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, Cover\u2019s claim that he was punished twice for the same crime fails. Looking at step two of the <em>Bravo </em>analysis in Cover\u2019s current appeal, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying Cover\u2019s third motion to reduce his sentence. The record shows that the district court did not base its 24 April 2001 decision to deny Cover\u2019s first motion merely on Cover\u2019s expression of remorse (or lack thereof), but instead noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-7\">among the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) is the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. In light of the circumstances of this case, those factors outweigh all of the other listed considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">R2-245 at unnumbered 5. In its denial of Cover\u2019s third motion, the district court said that it \u201chad considered the motion, the pertinent portions of the record, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. It is hereby [ordered and adjudged] that the motion is [denied] for the same reasons stated in the Court\u2019s Order of April, 24 2001.\u201d Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce Cover\u2019s sentence because it specifically referenced its earlier order, which mentioned several considerations that could outweigh Cover\u2019s new claims of self-improvement and expressions of remorse. Moreover, Cover\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider his renewed motion is not supported by the record, especially considering the district court required the government to brief its argument in opposition before rejecting Cover\u2019s motion. Finally, the language above was sufficient to indicate that the district court had thoroughly considered all the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The district court had the discretion to determine whether to reduce Cover\u2019s sentence and did not abuse that discretion by choosing to retain Cover\u2019s current sentence. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Cover\u2019s third motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-10\">. Cover, in his reply brief, also argues that (1) he could not offer to assist law enforcement officers prior to now because his family was threatened; (2) the district court abused its discretion by setting up a \u201cdouble standard\u201d that lets his sentence stand; (3) the district court abused its discretion by maintaining a higher sentence to punish him for not assisting law enforcement officers; and (4) the district court abused its discretion because it only considered the punitive portions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when deciding whether to lower his sentence. We will not address these contentions as arguments not raised in the initial appellate brief are deemed abandoned. <em>United States v.
