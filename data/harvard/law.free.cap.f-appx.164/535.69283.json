Vargas was sentenced to 50 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He contends that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. As the government concedes, Vargas preserved this issue in the district court by objecting to his sentence pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Accordingly, our review is for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43,163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">The government has not carried its burden to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Vargas\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See Garza, </em>429 F.3d at 171. In light of Vargas\u2019s resentencing, we do not address his additional claim of sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-26\">Vargas also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vargas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vargas candidly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, raising it here solely to preserve it for further review. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-19\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
