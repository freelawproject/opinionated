The district court sentenced Salazar to 46 months in prison, based on a prior drug-trafficking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-26\">Salazar contends that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines. Salazar thus alleges a <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). In the district court, Salazar objected to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Government concedes that the preserved <em>Fanfan </em>error is subject to review for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-27\">The Government has not carried its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Salazar\u2019s sentence. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464; <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464; <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-28\">Salazar also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
