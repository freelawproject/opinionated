Although the district court granted relief to other defendants, the sole issue before us is the granting of a motion to dismiss in favor of the defendant Illinois National Insurance Company. See footnote 10 of Appellant\u2019s Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">In ruling on the motion to dismiss in question it does appear that the district court relied upon documents that were outside the allegations of the complaint. Since it now appears that much of the dispute over coverage involves another legal action in Missouri and a similar facsimile advertisement that was circulated in Missouri (this suit deals with activity in the area of Atlanta, Georgia), we conclude that the matter should be handled under Rule 56 as a motion for summary judgment and not under Rule 12(b)(6). This will require the giving of a ten day notice along with the other procedures involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The order of dismissal as to the Illinois National Insurance Company is vacated and the matter remanded to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
