On January 29, 1992, the district court imposed the following sentences: concurrent prison terms of 360 months on Counts I and II, concurrent prison terms of 60 months on Counts IV and VII, and a consecutive prison term of 60 months on Count III, for a total term of imprisonment of 420 months. Appellant appealed his convictions, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>20 F.3d 1173 (Table) (11th Cir. (Fla.), Apr 11, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">On November 9, 2004, after having been denied relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, appellant, proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), moved the court to reduce his combined sentences. Citing Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 lBl.l(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which applies to his drug offenses, Counts I and II, he asked that the court resentence him to a term of imprisonment somewhere between 210 and 262 months. The court denied his motion. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Appellant contends that the addition of \u201cto the offense of conviction\u201d made in Amendment 591 requires the court to determine his offense of conviction on Counts I and II, which is based upon the jury\u2019s drug quantity determination. He maintains that because the jury did not make a drug quantity determination in his case, his offense of conviction falls under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), and, therefore, his statutory maximum term of imprisonment on Counts I and II is 20 years. He posits that a 20-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment yields a base offense level of 32 under the Guidelines career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and a resulting guideline range of 210-240 months. Appellant further contends that Amendment 591 applies to career offender provisions of Chapter Four of the Guidelines because those provisions directly relate to a defendant\u2019s offense of conviction. Finally, he submits that Congress intended that drug quantities be an element of the offense before the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Generally, \u201cthe court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, where a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement in this case is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-12\">\u2018Where a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If none of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not consistent with this policy statement and thus is not authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). The amendment at issue here, of course, is Amendment 591, is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and thus applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">In <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2005), the defendant appealed the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. The defendant had been convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and presented arguments similar to those appellant advances here. Specifically, the defendant argued that Amendment 591 prohibited the court \u201cfrom selecting the base offense level pursuant to ... \u00a7 2D1.2 where the judge (not the jury) found the requisite drug quantity\u201d used to determine the applicable base offense level. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, we first found that \u201cAmendment 591 requires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>based only on the statute or offense of conviction rather than on judicial findings of actual conduct not made by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that the amendment \u201cdirects the district court to apply the guideline dictated by the statute of conviction, but does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20. As a matter of first impression, we then held that \u201cbecause Amendment 591 only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying [the defendant\u2019s] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Our decision in <em>Moreno </em>is directly on point. Appellant argues that because the drug quantity in his case was not determined by a jury, he should have been sentenced pursuant to a different offense of conviction and, therefore, received a lower base offense level. This argument is substantially similar, if not identical, to the argument presented in <em>Moreno. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. The <em>Moreno </em>panel clearly rejected the argument advanced by the defendant Moreno and by appellant here. <em>See id. </em>at 1220. Therefore, this portion of appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><em>Moreno </em>did not address the remainder of appellant\u2019s argument \u2014 that Amendment 591 requires his sentence pursuant to the career offender provision of the Guidelines to be modified because his offense of conviction directly relates to his offense statutory maximum used to calculate his offense level. Nevertheless, this argument is also without merit because Amendment 591 does not concern Chapter Four of the Guidelines (the career offender provisions). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(a), 4B1.1. As we explained in <em>Moreno, </em>Amendment 591 \u201cwas designed to clarify whether enhanced penalties provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 ... apply only where the offense of conviction is referenced to that guideline, or whether such enhanced penalties can be used whenever a defendant\u2019s relevant, uncharged conduct includes drug sales in a protected location or ... involving a protected individual.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. Amendment 591, therefore, does not address the calculation of a career offender\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Even if Amendment 591 did address \u00a7 4B1.1, appellant\u2019s sentence would still not warrant a reduction because his base offense level of 37 was not only based on his status as a career offender, but on the entirely independent ground of his drug quantity and \u00a7 3A1.2(b) enhancement. Thus, for the reasons explained above, his offense level is not affected by Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-10\">. Amendment 591 became effective November 1, 2000, and modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.1 (a) by replacing the existing language with the following: \"Determine, pursuant to \u00a7 IB 1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.2.\u201d U.S.S.G. App. C (November 1, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. If appellant thought that Congress had made drug quantities an element of the Counts I and II offenses which the jury should have found but did not, he should have brought the issue to this court\u2019s attention on direct appeal. He did not; hence, we do not consider it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
