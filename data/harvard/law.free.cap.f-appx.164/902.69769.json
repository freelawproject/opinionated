Abraczinskas appeals his 15-month sentence, imposed pursuant to his guilty plea, for escape, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a) &amp; 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Abraczinskas contends that he is due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>to be resenteneed in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court imposed his sentence under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. We vacate Abraczinskas\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Abraczinskas timely raised an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Thus, we review his <em>Booker </em>claim for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>two kinds of sentencing errors exist: \u201cone is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir. 2005). This case involves the latter. The government concedes that the district court committed a statutory <em>Booker </em>error when it sentenced Abraczinskas under a mandatory guideline system. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). The government then bears the burden of showing that the statutory error was harmless. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless only if the government shows that the error did not affect the sentence, or had only a very slight effect. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But we have written that the statutory <em>Booker </em>harmless error standard is not easy to meet: \u201c[i]t is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And here, the government not only concedes that a statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurred, but concedes that it cannot show that this error was harmless. Moreover, the district court made no statement that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of whether the guidelines were advisory or mandatory. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (concluding that statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless where district court announced it would have imposed same sentence if guidelines were unconstitutional as applied mandatorily).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Some facts exist in the record that suggest the district court might have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. Abraczinskas moved for a downward departure, based on his allegation that he had escaped out of medical necessity. The district court denied Abraczinskas\u2019s request, stating that \u201cthe circumstances under which both defendants were apprehended do not suggest anything that would support a downward departure or anything in mitigation of the sentence in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court then sentenced Abraczinskas to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the midpoint of the 12 to 18-month guideline sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Giovani, </em>416 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (stating, in preserved-error case, that sentence in midpoint of guideline range was one factor suggesting that statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless). The court noted that it was imposing this sentence \u201cdue to the lack of aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d And the district court stated that it \u201ccarefully considered\u201d the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning the sentence: the court specifically determined that the sentence (1) met \u201cthe general goals of punishment ... for your criminal conduct of escape\u201d and (2) acted as a \u201cdeterrence to others who might engage in similar conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>But the government concedes it cannot show that the district court\u2019s statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless; the government bears the burden of demonstrating harmless error. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. We are unable to say with fair assurance that Abraczinskas\u2019s sentence was not swayed substantially by the <em>Booker </em>error. Abraczinskas is due to be resentenced under an advisory guidelines system in accordance with Booker.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-13\">. Abraczinskas was serving 121-month concurrent sentences for money laundering convictions when he escaped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">. We need not address Abraczinskas\u2019s alternate argument that he established plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b929-11\">. Abraczinskas had escaped with codefendant Jose Ignacio Macia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b929-13\">. Also, the district court ordered the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>to run consecutively to Abraczinskas's undischarged prior sentence, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G 1.3(a). Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) provides that a district court may impose a sentence to run concurrently <em>or </em>consecutively to an undischarged sentence, the district court indicated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing Abraczinskas's sentence. And \u00a7 3584(b) provides that, in deciding whether to impose a consecutive or a concurrent sentence, the court is to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">. We note that the district court correctly determined the guideline sentencing range for Abraczinskas\u2019s conviction. By adopting codefendant Macia's arguments, Abraczinskas suggests that, <em>post-Booker, </em>the district court possesses flexibility to take into account the nature of the incarcerating facility in determining whether to apply an offense level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(2). But the nature of the facility is not a sentencing factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And in any event, in denying Abraczinskas's request for a \u00a7 2P 1.1(b) reduction, the district court judge determined, based on her personal knowledge of the facility that he escaped from, that he was in secure custody when he escaped. Thus, the district court sufficiently considered the nature of the facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
