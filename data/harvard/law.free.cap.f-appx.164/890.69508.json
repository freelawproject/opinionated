On March 29, 2004, while the appeal was pending, she filed a motion to reopen the proceedings before the IJ on the ground that her attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in those proceedings. She claimed that her attorney was not prepared to represent her and, prior to the hearing on her application, told her that her options were to represent herself or request voluntary departure. She chose the former option. The Department of Homeland Security (successor to the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposed Petitioner\u2019s motion on the ground that the motion failed to satisfy the requirements for remand on the ineffective assistance ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">In an order dated January 27, 2005, the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen and adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying Petitioner asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>doing so, the BIA concluded that Petitioner had failed to demonstrate (1) eligibility for removal relief and (2) that counsel\u2019s conduct had caused her prejudice and thus had deprived denied her of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">On February 14, 2005, Petitioner moved the BIA to reconsider its denial of her motion to reopen (the proceedings before the IJ). In her motion, Petitioner stated that the IJ had erred in failing to address her request for voluntary departure. On March 25, 2005, the BIA denied the motion, concluding that the motion cited no error of law or fact warranting reconsideration of its prior decision. Petitioner now seeks review of that decision. Before undertaking our review, however, we take note of the time limits that circumscribe Petitioner\u2019s right to review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">For us to have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal (which in this case denied Petitioner\u2019s (1) motion to reopen and (2) her application for asylum and withholding of removal), the alien must file her petition for review within 30 days of the date the final order issues. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This \u201cdeadline is not suspended or tolled by the fact that [the petitioner] filed a motion [for reconsideration and] to reopen the removal proceedings ... after issuance of the final order of removal.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s January 27, 2005 decision \u2014 which, as noted above, (1) denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen and (2) affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal \u2014 for the simple reason that Petitioner did not file a petition for the review of either of these rulings. The petition that is before this court only refers to the BIA\u2019s March 25, 2005 order. We now consider that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">\u2018We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2018ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert, denied, </em>543 U.S. 917, 125 S.Ct. 38, 160 L.Ed.2d 200 (2004). A motion to reconsider must \u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B), \u201c[T]here are at least three independent grounds upon which the [BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001). The underlying merits of the motion to reopen are not before us, except to the extent necessary to permit us to decide whether the BIA abused its discretion (in entering the order now before us). <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>(review of BIA\u2019s denial of motion to reopen is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the ... exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Petitioner contends that the BIA abused its discretion in rejecting her request for voluntary departure. Voluntary departure permits an alien to depart the United States in lieu of being deported and is granted with an alternate order of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(d). Voluntary departure may not be granted unless the alien requests it and agrees to the terms and conditions of voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b). Voluntary departure is divided into two categories: (1) aliens granted departure in lieu of or before the completion of removal proceedings;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) aliens granted departure at the conclusion of the proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b). An alien is eligible for voluntary departure at the completion of the removal proceedings if she (1) has been physically present in the United States for at least one year preceding service of the Notice To Appear; (2) has been a person of good moral character for at least five years immediately preceding the application; (3) is not deportable as an aggravated felon or on account of terrorist activity; and (4) has established by clear and convincing evidence that she has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to specify any errors of law or fact in the IJ\u2019s or the BIA\u2019s orders. Instead, what the motion presents is a new claim \u2014 that voluntary departure was still available to Petitioner. This is a claim that Petitioner should have presented in her motion to reopen since such a motion asks for the reopening of prior proceedings for the introduction of new evidence. As the BIA noted, Petitioner failed to submit any evidence showing <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief of voluntary departure. Given the foregoing circumstances, we could not say that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-17\">. Barreto sought asylum and withholding of removal for herself and her two sons, who effectively stand in her shoes. For convenience, we consider them collectively as \"Petitioner.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-9\">. Because the final order of removal issued on January 27, 2005, Petitioner had until March 1, 2005 to file her petition for the review of that order. The only petition for review petitioner filed is the one before us \u2014 a petition to review the BIA\u2019s March 25, 2005 order denying her motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-6\">. An alien may be permitted to depart the United States voluntarily in lieu of or before completion of the deportation proceedings for a period generally not to exceed 120 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a)(2). Extensions of the voluntary departure period may be granted within the 120-day time period. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.25(c). An alien requesting voluntary departure from an IJ prior to completion of the removal proceedings must make the request before or at the master calendar hearing at which the case will be heard on the merits. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(l)(i)(A). To obtain voluntary departure, (s)he must concede removability and waive appeal of all issues. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(l)(i)(C) and (D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
