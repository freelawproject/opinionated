A jury also found that Harmann attempted to manufacture methamphetamine. Both Cobb and Harmann challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions, having adequately preserved their challenge in district court. <em>See United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 911 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Viewing the evidence produced at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt Cobb\u2019s and Hamann\u2019s guilt as to each of the charged offenses. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
