SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b495-28\">The second opinion, 134 FedAppx. 666 (5th Cir.2005), which replaced the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>opinion, 120 Fed.Appx. 547 (5th Cir.2005), is WITHDRAWN, and the following opinion is substituted:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Peter Johnson appeals the dismissal, for want of subject matter jurisdiction, of his age discrimination suit. Because Johnson cannot allege facts sufficient to sustain a cause of action against this defendant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Johnson, while fifty-seven years old, attended a job fair in Houston hosted by Aramco Services Company (\u201cASC\u201d) and applied through ASC for a job as a Seismic Field Crew Supervisor working in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (\u201cSAO\u201d). SAO is a Saudi Arabian entity with its principal office in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and ASC, SAO\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, is incorporated in Delaware. ASC states that it provides SAO with a range of services, including assistance with recruiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">ASC apparently recruits \u2014 albeit infrequently \u2014 for entities other than SAO. Support for this is found in the record in the form of ASC\u2019s letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) in which it states, \u201cASC, among others, recruits employees for positions with the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (\u2018Saudi Aramco\u2019) and infrequently recruits for other entities.\u201d Johnson\u2019s unrefuted affidavit asserts that an ASC employee informed him that ASC acts as a recruiter for additional entities including its own subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">According to Johnson, he was later informed that he would not be selected for the job, allegedly because of his advanced age. He filed a complaint with the EEOC, was granted a right to sue letter, and sued ASC and SAO alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>ASC moved for dismissal based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(1), or alternatively for summary judgment, arguing \u201cthe court cannot apply extra-territorially the ADEA ... to a foreign corporation who employs U.S. citizens to work abroad.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court summarily granted the motion to dismiss \u201cwith prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-16\">Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found [on] any one of [the following bases]: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.... In examining a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the district court is empowered to consider matters of fact which may be in dispute. Ultimately, a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be granted only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle plaintiff to relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">The ADEA provides, in part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for an employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of such individual\u2019s age, or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the basis of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(b). Bridling this proposition is the notion that no federal statute applies extra-territorially unless Congress has expressly indicated its intent for such an application. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). This canon of statutory construction \u201cserves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ADEA does not evince any such intent; to the contrary, the plain language of \u00a7 623(h)(2) generally prohibits such applications. Age discrimination claims, consequently, are not cognizable with respect to foreign corporations who employ American citizens to work abroad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Based on the presumption against extraterritorial application, even Johnson concedes that SAO is not a covered employer under the ADEA. Nevertheless, because ASC is a U.S. corporation, the same principle does not necessarily immunize it from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Johnson asserts that ASC, functioning as an employment agency, may be liable for its own discriminatory practices under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(b). Johnson\u2019s complaint avers that ASC, through its screening and referral process that classified him according to his age, violated the ADEA \u2014 independently of SAO\u2019s discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">ASC correctly notes, however, that SAO is not a covered employer under the ADEA. Consequently, goes the argument, recruiting organizations such as ASC cannot be considered an employment agency for purposes of the act if the foreign corporation for whom the recruiter works is not a covered employer under the ADEA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Johnson responds by citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3, which states that an employment agency that <em>\u201cregularly </em>procures employees for at least one covered employer [ ] qualifies under section 11(c) of the [ADEA] as an employment agency with respect to all of its activities whether or not such activities are for employers covered by the act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consequently, to the extent the regulation applies, if ASC \u201cregularly\u201d recruits for any covered employer or employers, the fact that SAO is not a covered employer will not immunize it from its conduct with respect to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">We need not decide, however, whether ASC qualifies as an employment agency under the statute or the regulation. Assuming, for our purposes, that ASC is an employment agency, subsection (h)(2) absolves it of any liability under this section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is uncontested that SAO, the employer, is a foreign person not controlled by an American employer and that ASC was procuring employees for SAO to work in a foreign workplace.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>If we were to apply the regulation, we would need to determine precisely what is meant by the phrase \u201cregularly procure.\u201d We need not do so in this case, however, because when read in light of Congress\u2019s unequivocal admonition against extra-territorial application of the ADEA contained in subsection (h)(2), the regulation cannot impose liability on ASC where the plain words of the statute exempt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In light of the foregoing, Johnson has failed to allege facts sufficient to sustain an ADEA cause of action against ASC. The judgment of dismissal is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Treating the petition for rehearing en banc as a petition for panel rehearing, the petition for panel rehearing is DENIED. No member of the panel or judge in regular active service having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc (Fed. R.App. P. 35 and 5th Cm. R. 35), the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED. No further petitions for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc will be entertained. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">.
