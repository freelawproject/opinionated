After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) observed a fishing vessel, the San Jose, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, that was riding low in the water and was not engaged in fishing activities. USCG personnel boarded the San Jose and detained its Colombian captain and seven Colombian crew members, including Hurtado-Olmedo, who served as the vessel\u2019s cook. During a search of the vessel, USCG personnel located several discolored tiles under the lower bunks in the berthing compartments. After removing the tiles, they discovered 525 bales of cocaine, weighing a total of 10,500 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Hurtado-Olmedo pled guilty to both counts. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assessed a base offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), based on the amount of drugs (150 kilograms or more of cocaine) that Hurtado-Olmedo had possessed and conspired to distribute. The PSI recommended a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Further, at sentencing, the government did not object to Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s receiving a two-level safety-valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7) and an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Thus, Hurtado-Olmeda\u2019s total offense level was 33 and his criminal history category was I, resulting in a guidelines range of 135 to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">At sentencing, Hurtado-Olmedo renewed his request for a mitigating-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court denied Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s request, noting: (1) a substantial amount of cocaine was involved in the instant offense; and (2) as a cook, Hurtado-Olmedo was an integral part of this conspiracy. The government also emphasized that Hurtado-Olmedo had participated in other drug trafficking trips. The district court stated that, although Hurtado-Olmedo lived in \u201cabject poverty,\u201d like many of the defendants interdicted in drug boats, it found no reason to sentence him below the sentencing guidelines range. The district court then sentenced Hurtado-Olmedo to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the guidelines range. Hurtado-Olmedo renewed his objections. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A3e\">A. Mitigating-role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Hurtado-Olmeda argues that the district court erred by failing to grant him a mitigating-role reduction. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s qualification for a role reduction. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The defendant has the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. Two principles guide a district court\u2019s consideration: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. When the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">The district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant Hurtado-Olmedo a role reduction. Under the first prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the district court held Hurtado-Olmedo accountable for only the 10,500 kilograms of cocaine that he admitted con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>spiring to possess with the intent to distribute. <em>See id. </em>at 942-43. As to the second prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the evidence regarding Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s culpability indicates that he was at least as culpable as his codefendants. The district court also did not err in rejecting Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s contention that he had a lesser role in the offense because he was the ship\u2019s cook. In any event, the fact that a defendant\u2019s role is less than that of other participants involved in the criminal venture does not automatically entitle him to a role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">B. Jurisdiction over Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Because Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s sentence was within the correctly-calculated guidelines range, the government contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to review the reasonableness of Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">First, <em>post-Booker, </em>this Court repeatedly has reviewed sentences within the guidelines range for unreasonableness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Second, although <em>Booker </em>excised the standards of review in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), the Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe [Federal Sentencing] Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range in the exercise of his discretionary power under \u00a7 3553(a)),\u201d and cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (instructing appellate courts to review a sentence for \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Although the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>did not identify which provision of \u00a7 3742(a) provided for appeals for \u201cunreasonableness,\u201d we conclude that a post-<em>Booker </em>appeal based on the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 875 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not alter the rule that a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward is unreviewable, but noting that, after <em>Booker, </em>the court will \u201creview a defendant\u2019s argument that even a sentence within the advisory guideline range is \u2018unreasonable\u2019 with regard to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and an unreasonable sentence would be imposed \u2018in violation of law3 within the meaning of \u00a7 3742(a)\u201d) (citation omitted). Thus, this Court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a)(1) to review sentences for unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">C. Consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">Hurtado-Olmedo argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>tenting factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, is required to take into account the advisory guidelines range and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201cThe factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Although the district court must consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, \u201cacknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. \u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Here, Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is without merit. Although the district court did not explicitly state that it had considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. The district court indicated that it had considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of Hurtado-Olmedo, including the large amount of cocaine involved in the offense, Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s participation in other drug smuggling trips, and Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s economic situation in Colombia. Additionally, as noted above, the district court correctly calculated Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that, after <em>Booker, </em>the district court must consult the correctly calculate the guidelines range before imposing sentence). Considering the sentencing transcript as a whole, we conclude that Hurtado-Olmedo has shown no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">For the reasons above, we affirm Hurtado-Olmedo\u2019s concurrent 135-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">.
