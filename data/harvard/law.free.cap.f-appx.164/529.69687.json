The district court dismissed the suit for want of prosecution and denied their request to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The appellants now move this court for authorization to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-25\">The motion for authorization to proceed IFP is GRANTED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Nevertheless, the appellants have not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing their suit for want of prosecution. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 554-55, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Matassarin v. Lynch, </em>174 F.3d 549, 571 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
