On appeal, Valentierra-Sanchez argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when it imposed his sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">The United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) observed a fishing vessel, the San Jose, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, that was riding low in the water and was not engaged in fishing activities. USCG personnel boarded the San Jose and detained its Colombian captain and seven Colombian crew members, including Valentierra-Sanchez. During a search of the vessel, USCG personnel located several discolored tiles under the lower bunks in the berthing compartments. After removing the tiles, they discovered 525 bales of cocaine, weighing a total of 10,500 kilograms. Before the San Jose left Colombia, Valentierra-Sanchez and other crew members met with the captain, who told them that they would be transporting cocaine to a transfer point in the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Valentierra-Sanchez pled guilty to both counts. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assessed a base offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) based on the amount of cocaine (150 kilograms or more) that Valentierra-Sanchez had possessed and conspired to distribute. Based on a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category I, the PSI recommended a guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his written objection, Valentierra-Sanchez argued only that he should receive a mitigating-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Valentierra-Sanchez did not otherwise object to the PSI\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines or to the calculation of his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">At the sentencing hearing, ValentierraSanchez withdrew his request for a mitigating-role reduction. The district court nonetheless addressed the request, noting that it was declining to give ValentierraSanchez a downward adjustment based on the following: (1) Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s crew members indicated that he had been on three previous drug trips on the same vessel; and (2) a substantial quantity of cocaine was involved in the instant offense. The court then calculated Valentierra\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months and stated its belief that a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the range, was appropriate under the facts of the case and the factors it was supposed to consider, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqN\">Unless the Government possesses any adverse information, I\u2019m inclined to treat him the same as I\u2019ve treated everybody else in this case, except I haven\u2019t sentenced the captain yet. I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>going to give him the low end which is 135 months. I believe under the facts of this case and under all the factors I\u2019m supposed to consider, that\u2019s an appropriate sentence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">After permitting Valentierra-Sanchez to allocute, the district court imposed a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUT\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The government, as a threshold matter, points out that Valentierra-Sanchez does not challenge any application of the guidelines or the ultimate calculation of his guideline range of 135 to 168 months. Because Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s sentence was within a correctly-calculated guidelines range, the government contends that we lack jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to review the reasonableness of Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">First, <em>post-Booker, </em>this Court repeatedly has reviewed sentences within the guidelines range for unreasonableness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241 (11th Cir.2005). Second, although <em>Booker </em>excised the standards of review in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), the Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe [Federal Sentencing] Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range in the exercise of his discretionary power under \u00a7 3553(a)),\u201d and cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (instructing appellate courts to review a sentence for \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Although the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>did not identify which provision of \u00a7 3742(a) provided for appeals for \u201cunreasonableness,\u201d we conclude that a post-<em>Booker </em>appeal based on the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 875 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not alter the rule that a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward is unreviewable, but noting that, after <em>Booker, </em>the court will \u201creview a defendant\u2019s argument that even a sentence within the advisory guideline range is \u2018unreasonable\u2019 with regard to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and an unreasonable sentence would be imposed \u2018in violation of lav/ within the meaning of \u00a7 3742(a)\u201d) (citation omitted). Thus, this Court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a)(1) to review sentences for unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">B. Consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">Valentierra-Sanchez argues that the district court erred by failing to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>sider the sentencing factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing his sentence. Valentierra-Sanchez does not argue on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Instead, he argues only that the district court failed to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) on the record and instead blindly sentenced him within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, is required to take into account the advisory guidelines range and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201cThe factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Although the district court must consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, \u201cacknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Here, Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is without merit. At sentencing, the district court explicitly found that Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s final sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate \u201cunder the facts of this case and under all the factors [it was] supposed to consider.\u201d Additionally, the district court expressly mentioned the nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of Valentierra-Sanchez, including the amount of cocaine involved in the offense and other crew members\u2019 statements that Valentierra-Sanchez had been involved in at least three prior drug runs on the same vessel. Considering the sentencing transcript as a whole, we conclude that Valentierra-Sanchez has shown no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Therefore, we affirm Valentierra-Sanchez\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. To the base offense level of 38, the PSI recommended a two-level reduction in the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(7) because Valentierra-Sanchez met the criteria for application of the guidelines\u2019 safety-valve provision, a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and a one-level reduction for timely notification of the intent to plead guilty pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-9\">.
