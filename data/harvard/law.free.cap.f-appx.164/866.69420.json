We deny Pirzada\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">Pirzada legally entered the United States on September 29, 2000, as a non-immigrant visitor but overstayed his visa, which expired on March 28, 2001. Pirzada filed an application for a labor certification on April 27, 2001. Sometime before March 21, 2003, Pirzada registered, as required, with the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS). <em>See </em>67 Fed.Reg. 77136 (Dec. 16, 2002). The INS initiated removal proceedings against Pirzada by serving him with a Notice to Appear on March 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">Pirzada moved to continue his removal proceedings on the ground that he would be able to adjust his temporary alien status to permanent resident status upon the grant of his pending labor certification and issuance of his immigrant visa, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l), (2), but in a collective order that applied to several cases involving this same issue, the IJ denied Pirzada\u2019s motion for a continuation of removal proceedings on September 25, 2003. The BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ on May 10, 2005, and Pirzada filed this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-19\">Pirzada argues that his removal proceedings should have been continued until the Department of Labor processed his application for labor certification, a prerequisite to obtaining the immigrant visa that Pirzada needed to be eligible for adjustment in status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(5); <em>Zafar v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>426 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2005). Pirzada argues that, by denying the continuance, the IJ and BIA (1) abused their discretion because Pirzada\u2019s application for labor certification was timely under the statute, (2) committed legal error because various precedents suggested a different result, (3) violated section 245 of the INA because Pirzada was within a class of persons protected by the statute, (4) violated Pirzada\u2019s right to due process because removal would prevent adjustment to Pirzada\u2019s status, (5) violated Pirzada\u2019s expectation interest and various agency and public policies that suggested the result in Pirzada\u2019s case was abnormal, (6) and violated Pirzada\u2019s right to equal protection because non-Pakistanis were not subject to NSEERS and Pirzada was targeted for removal only because he complied with the NSEERS special registration require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>ments, and because IJs in jurisdictions other than Atlanta routinely closed similar proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">These arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>Zafar, </em>426 F.3d 1330, a case of identical legal issues and virtually identical facts. Although Pirzada, through the same counsel of record in <em>Zafar, </em>argues that we wrongly decided <em>Zafar, </em>\u201conly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004). Based on <em>Zafar, </em>the IJ and BIA did not abuse their discretion in denying Pirzada\u2019s motion for a continuance. PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
