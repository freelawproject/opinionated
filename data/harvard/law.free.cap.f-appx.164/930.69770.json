Wood, Ambassador (collectively referred to as \u201cDefendants\u201d), all of the United States Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, to process his wife\u2019s visa application and issue her a visa. We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">In April of 2002, De Castro, who is apparently a naturalized citizen living in Miami, Florida, filed an immigrant visa petition to have his wife, who lives in Barranquilla, Colombia, classified as an immediate relative. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) approved De Castro\u2019s petition in August of 2002. De Castro\u2019s wife then applied, through him, for an immigrant visa, at the United States Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. Approximately two months later, a consular officer notified De Castro\u2019s wife in writing that her application was rejected pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C). Under that provision, an alien who a consular officer (or the Attorney General) \u201cknows or has reason to believe ... is or has been an illicit trafficker in any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>trolled substance or in any listed chemical ... or is or has been a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder with others in the illicit trafficking in any such controlled or listed substance or chemical, or endeavored to do so ... is inadmissible.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C). Claiming that there was no evidence for the decision, and that his wife was not involved in drug trafficking, De Castro filed the mandamus petition at issue. He contends that his rights under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1154(a) and 1255(a) have been violated and seeks an order compelling the processing and issuance of an immigrant visa for his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The district court dismissed De Castro\u2019s petition based on the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, rejecting his claim that review was available under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. De Castro contends that this decision constituted legal error. According to De Castro, his mandamus petition alleges a constitutional violation of his. due process rights (and a violation of his rights under the INA) that renders the doctrine of consular nonreviewability inapplicable. De Castro further argues that jurisdiction exists because he is merely seeking to ensure that consular officials process his wife\u2019s visa application in a lawful and proper manner, not that they exercise their discretion to reach a particular result.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\u201cWhether a district court has subject-matter jurisdiction over an action is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Kent v. Secretary of Labor, </em>148 F.3d 1264, 1265 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). \u201cThe doctrine [of consular nonreviewability] holds that a consular official\u2019s decision to issue or withhold a visa is not subject to judicial review, at least unless Congress says otherwise.\u201d <em>Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, </em>197 F.3d 1153, 1159 (D.C.Cir.1999). Although our research discloses no published opinion in which we have directly addressed this doctrine, it has been recognized in binding precedent and applied by numerous sister circuits. <em>See, e.g., Te Kuei Liu v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>645 F.2d 279, 285 (5th Cir. Unit A May 1981) (explaining that actions of American consul in Winnipeg, Canada, where alien\u2019s relative visa petition had been forwarded, were not \u201cwithin the ambit of our review\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Centeno v. Shultz, </em>817 F.2d 1212, 1214 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (citing <em>Te Kuei Liu </em>for proposition that \u201cdecisions of United States consuls on visa matters are nonreviewable by the courts\u201d); <em>Saavedra, </em>197 F.3d at 1159 (defining doctrine of consular nonreviewability); <em>Doan v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>160 F.3d 508, 509 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that decision of INS district director, who was functional equivalent of a consular official, in denying visa-related waiver was not subject to judicial review because there was no clear statutory grant of authority); <em>Li Hing of Hong Kong, Inc. v. Levin, </em>800 F.2d 970, 971 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201c[I]t has been consistently held that the consular official\u2019s decision to issue or withhold a visa is not subject either to administrative or judicial review.\u201d); <em>Burrafato v. United States Dep\u2019t of State, </em>523 F.2d 554, 556 n. 2 (2d Cir.1975) (recognizing that court would lack jurisdiction to review denial of visa application by consul in Palermo, Italy).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">De Castro does not deny the viability of the consular nonreviewability doctrine, but contends that it does not apply to his mandamus petition because he alleges a constitutional due process violation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>He notes that the <em>Saavedra </em>court acknowledged that jurisdiction would exist where \u201cUnited States sponsors of a foreign individual claim that the State Department\u2019s denial of a visa to an alien violated their constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Saavedra, </em>197 F.Sd at 1163 (citing <em>Abourezk v. Reagan, </em>785 F.2d 1043, 1050 (D.C.Cir.1986), <em>affd by an equally divided court, </em>484 U.S. 1,108 S.Ct. 252, 98 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987)). We find this argument unpersuasive for several reasons. First of all, De Castro\u2019s claimed due process violation appears in his initial brief on appeal, not his mandamus petition. The petition appears to allege no more than a violation of De Castro\u2019s \u201crights\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 1154(a) and 1255(a). \u201cWith respect to purely statutory claims, courts have made no distinctions between aliens seeking review of adverse consular decisions and the United States citizens sponsoring their admission; neither is entitled to judicial review.\u201d <em>Saavedra, </em>197 F.3d at 1164. Second, the citizen-plaintiffs in <em>Abourezk </em>alleged that their First Amendment rights were violated by the denial of visas to foreigners whom they had invited to speak at various gatherings in the United States. <em>See Abourezk, </em>785 F.2d at 1048-50. De Castro, by contrast, does not explain the nature of the due process right of which he was allegedly deprived by the denial of his wife\u2019s visa application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He does not claim that consular officials failed to follow any particular statutory or regulatory provision governing the issuance or denial of visas. Moreover, the <em>Burrafato </em>court indicated that generalized due process claims like De Castro\u2019s would likely fall within the scope of the consular nonreviewability doctrine. <em>See </em>523 F.2d at 556 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">De Castro also argues that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability is inapplicable because he is simply challenging the handling of his wife\u2019s visa application, and not seeking to force a consular official to make a particular decision. The language of De Castro\u2019s mandamus petition, which clearly seeks a judgment ordering Defendants to process and <em>issue </em>an immigrant visa to his wife, belies this argument. Furthermore, notwithstanding De Castro\u2019s claim that Defendants\u2019 decision (in denying the visa) was not based on any evidence, he offers no explanation as to how Defendants failed to comply with any applicable statutory or regulatory provisions. Indeed, it is uncontroverted that De Castro\u2019s wife received a written statement of the reason for the rejection of her visa application, even though it appears that Defendants were not statutorily obligated to issue one. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(b); 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.121.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Finally, we reject De Castro\u2019s argument that the APA, in conjunction with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, provides for review of his claims. We have previously noted \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to preclude judicial review of administrative determinations concerning aliens who have never presented themselves at the borders of the country,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[r]eview under the APA would be inconsistent with that intent.\u201d <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc. v. Baker, </em>953 F.2d 1498, 1507 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam); <em>cf. Saavedra, </em>197 F.3d at 1162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>(\u201cTo put the matter in terms of APA \u00a7 701(a)(1), we may infer that the immigration laws preclude judicial review of consular visa decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Having considered the doctrine of consular nonreviewability and found De Castro\u2019s arguments against its application unavailing, we agree that the district court properly dismissed his mandamus petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. In <em>Bonner v.
