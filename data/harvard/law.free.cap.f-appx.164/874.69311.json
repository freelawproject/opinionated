On appeal, Holland argues (1) that the instant appeal is not barred by the sentence-appeal waiver in his plea agreement; (2) the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf constituted a breach of the plea agreement and a subsequent oral promise to file such a motion; and (3) the district court erred by denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Upon a thorough review of the record on appeal, including Holland\u2019s written plea agreement, the transcripts of the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings, and Holland\u2019s \u201cMotion to Compel Specific Performance of Plea Agreement and Filing of Rule 35(b) Motion\u201d and related pleadings, and after consideration of the briefs of the parties to this Court, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The Supreme Court has held that federal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion if the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In the absence of this showing, the defendant has no right to discovery or an evidentiary hearing on this issue. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. In <em>Wade, </em>the Court noted that a defendant would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate government interest. <em>Id. </em>Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wade, </em>this Court has concluded that \u201ccourts are precluded from intruding into prosecutorial discretion,\u201d except where there is \u201can allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Holland\u2019s allegations that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion was \u201carbitrary\u201d and made in \u201cbad faith\u201d are insufficient to justify judicial review, and because the government did not breach the plea agreement by refusing to file a Rule 35(b) motion when they retained discretion in the matter, the district court did not err in denying Holland\u2019s \u201cMotion to Compel\u201d or his motion for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
