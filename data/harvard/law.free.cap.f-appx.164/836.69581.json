The Government asserts the district court erred when it reduced Riley\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 668 could not have triggered the application of the statute. The district court erred, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Riley, a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, filed a \u201cLetter under the Compassion Rule for Reduction of Sentence.\u201d The Government did not file an immediate response to Riley\u2019s letter. The district court interpreted Riley\u2019s letter as a motion and granted a reduction in Riley\u2019s sentence. Specifically, the district court concluded the Rule of Lenity did not apply to Riley\u2019s case, and that Riley\u2019s sentence was not unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); however, Riley\u2019s sentence was due to be modified under \u00a7 3582, which permits the modification of a sentence when the applicable sentencing range is subsequently reduced by a Guidelines amendment. The district court expressly stated, \u201cit would sentence Riley to a different term of incarceration if the case were before it today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">In reducing Riley\u2019s sentence, the district court began at an offense level of 40, the offense level under which Riley was originally sentenced. It found Riley\u2019s limited participation in the drug conspiracy qualified him for a 2 level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and his offense level would be an additional 4 levels lower, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) as amended under Amendment 668,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> creating an offense level of 34, which with Riley\u2019s criminal history category of I, yielded an imprisonment range of 151 to 188 months. The court concluded \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allowed a court to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a range that has been subsequently lowered, but the court should consider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court then considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of Riley, just punishment for Riley, and the need to avoid sentence disparity. It concluded Riley was a minor participant and it was unjust to punish him longer than the leader of the conspiracy, who was sentenced to only 265 months. The court observed Riley received the longest sentence compared to the sentences of his co-conspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tors. According to the court, the new range of imprisonment would adequately deter Riley and still protect the public, and further incarceration of Riley would not serve any rehabilitation purposes. The district court acknowledged the policy statements limiting retroactivity of amendments but interpreted those policy preferences expressed by the Sentencing Commission as only advisory after <em>Booker. </em>The district court then granted Riley\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The Government moved for reconsideration, contending that neither Amendment 668 nor the <em>Booker </em>holding applied retroactively so as to trigger \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s provisions. The Government argued Riley\u2019s sentence could not legally be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 668 because that amendment is not included under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e), which provides a finite list of amendments which may be made the subject of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The district court denied the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration, concluding the Government\u2019s legal argument was misplaced. It agreed Riley could not use \u00a7 3582 to attack the constitutionality of his sentence via <em>Booker, </em>but the court distinguished that approach to the instant one. The court found it was only required to consider policy preferences expressed by the Sentencing Commission. The court concluded as the Guidelines were now advisory in nature, Riley\u2019s sentence reduction was not precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Generally, a court may not modify an imposed sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">a defendant ... has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The Guidelines policy statement provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-11\">[wjhere a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Amendments covered by this policy statement are: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, 606, and 657. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Only those amendments which lower the applicable Guideline range and are listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) trigger eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1). \u201cFailure to follow such commentary could constitute an incorrect application of the guidelines, subjecting the sentence to possible reversal on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">The district court clearly erred in reducing Riley\u2019s sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides a reduction in sentence must be <em>consistent with </em>applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. The Guidelines list specific amendments covered, and Amendment 668 is not included. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. lB1.10(c). Thus, a reduction pursuant to Amendment 668 is <em>not </em>consistent with the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The district court\u2019s reasoning that the Guidelines are now advisory is misplaced. The authority to reduce the sentence comes from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, and this statute was not affected by <em>Booker </em>and the advisory nature of the Guidelines post-<em>Booker. </em>Further, we have held <em>Booker </em>is not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, the district court clearly erred by granting a reduction to Riley\u2019s sentence based on Amendment 668 and the advisory Guidelines, and by denying the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In accordance with the foregoing reasons, we reverse the modification of Riley\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court with instructions to reinstate his previously imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-13\">. Amendment 668 modified the maximum base offense levels for certain offenders convicted for drug offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amdt. 668. This Amendment eliminated the mitigating-role cap of \u00a7 2D 1.1 (a)(3), and, in order to address proportionality concerns, inserted a sliding scale in both \u00a7 2D 1.1 and \u00a7 2D1.11, so that a person receiving a mitigating role reduction would receive a corresponding reduction in his base offense level. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
