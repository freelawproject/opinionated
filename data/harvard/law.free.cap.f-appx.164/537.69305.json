This issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Aparicio contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Aparicio candidly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, raising it here solely to preserve it for further review. His conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-27\">In addition, Aparicio asserts that the district court\u2019s proceeding during sentencing under the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, rather than advisory, requires us to reverse under <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We apply a harmless error standard of review. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2022 \u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The government has not met its burden of proving that the district judge would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-65 (5th Cir. 2005). Aparicio\u2019s sentence is thus vacated and his case remanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
