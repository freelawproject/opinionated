On appeal, Hilton argues that the plea sheet the district court relied on to uphold his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) was fraudulent because it contained a backward and <em>unsigned </em>seal. Hilton also maintains that the court should not have looked to his indictment and plea sheet to determine whether his underlying conviction was a violent felony for purposes of classification as an armed career criminal. Hilton further contends that \u201csomeone\u201d deliberately falsified the plea sheet in his prior state conviction, and thus the court relied on a fraudulent document to deny his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2003). Rule 60(b) states, in relevant part, \u201c[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">First, under <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005), Hilton\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion should not be construed as an application to file a second or successive habeas petition because Hilton\u2019s motion alleges fraud on the district court, thereby attacking the \u201cintegrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d as opposed to attacking the merits of the court\u2019s previous habeas decision. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>125 S.Ct. at 2648 n. 5 (explaining that alleging fraud in a Rule 60(b) motion attacks a defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings and, thus, is not barred by the restriction of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Even though Hilton\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is not barred by the restrictions of the AEDPA, his motion is still due to be denied for several reasons, one of which is that the district court has decided the precise issues against Hilton on several previous occasions, and Hilton has wholly failed to demonstrate any basis for further reconsideration. Hilton should understand this case is over.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hilton\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
