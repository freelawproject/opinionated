The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>court applied a 16-level offense level enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because Defendant had been deported after earlier convictions for alien smuggling and for carrying a concealed firearm. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Defendant acknowledges that he brings this appeal only to preserve an argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was decided wrongly in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And he maintains that his case is distinguishable from <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>First, he did not stipulate to his earlier convictions at the guilty plea hearing: he asserts that his convictions needed to be admitted by him or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, he contends that he did not admit to the characterization of his earlier conviction for conspiracy to transport aliens as an \u201calien smuggling\u201d offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Defendant concedes that he did not raise these arguments in the district court: we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), ceri. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">The district court committed no Sixth Amendment error. Defendant correctly observes that he did not admit during the guilty plea colloquy the earlier convictions for conspiracy to transport aliens and for carrying a concealed firearm. But Defendant failed to object to the fact statements in the presentence investigation report (PSI) about his earlier convictions. Thus, Defendant admitted to the existence of the convictions underlying the sentencing enhancement. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (defendant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to PSI\u2019s fact statements about relevant conduct constitutes admission to facts in PSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">And Defendant\u2019s 16-level enhancement was based solely on his earlier convictions. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court stated that the government need not allege in the indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had a prior conviction for a district court to use that conviction to enhance a sentence. \u201cThis conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. Thus, the district court did not violate Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) enhancement based on his earlier convictions. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">Moreover, we have rejected Defendant\u2019s argument that the enhancement was improper because he did not stipulate that his conviction for conspiracy to transport aliens was an \u201calien smuggling\u201d offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). <em>See Gallegos</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>Ag\u00fcero, </em>409 F.3d at 1276-77 (rejecting argument that Sixth Amendment requires jury, not a judge, to determine whether earlier conviction is within category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii)). In any event, the district court also noted that it could base the 16-level enhancement on Defendant\u2019s convictions for carrying a concealed firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in applying the 16-level \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-13\">. Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing took place 16 days after <em>Booker </em>was decided. The district court applied the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-14\">. On plain error review, a defendant must show \"error\u201d that is \"plain\" and that \"affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is only after these conditions have been satisfied that an appellate court then may exercise its discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
