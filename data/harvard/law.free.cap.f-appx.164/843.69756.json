On appeal, he argues that the district court clearly erred by denying him a lawful sporting purposes reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), and further argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider his need for rehabilitation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) received information from five cooperating sources \u2014 one of which was undercover surveillance \u2014 that Ingram actively possessed and distributed liquor and narcotics and possessed multiple firearms, including handguns, rifles, and shotguns, in his Blue Ridge, Georgia residence. Ingram\u2019s property included four houses: he and his wife lived in one; his son lived in another; a man named Gerald lived in the third; and the last was a \u201ctransient\u201d house from which people would constantly come and go, often leaving soon after arriving, and driving with no headlights on at night. One of the cooperating sources reported seeing moonshine and brandy liquor in Ingram\u2019s basement, but never saw any firearms. Another cooperating source reported trading Ingram a .22 caliber rifle in exchange for one-half gallon of liquor and $150 and seeing Ingram in possession of handguns and long guns. A different cooperating source reported that: (1) she or he had been purchasing Ingram\u2019s homemade liquor for approximately 20 years; (2) Ingram was mainly a marijuana user and distributor; and (3) Ingram possessed a \u201csmall arsenal\u201d of weapons, including handguns and long guns, which he stored throughout the residence. An undercover cooperating source met with Ingram and noted that Ingram wore a firearm on the waistband of his pants while he offered to sell the source homemade liquor and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Following these reports, investigative agents searched Ingrams\u2019s property and found four rifles: (1) a Marlin, model 25 M, .22 caliber; (2) a Marlin, model 60, .22 caliber; (3) a Marlin, model 366CS, .35 caliber; and (4) a Remington, model 552 Speedmaster, .22 caliber. The agents also found an ammunition container holding 608 grams of marijuana, various containers of distilled liquor, $4,162 in U.S. currency, and over 750 rounds of ammunition, including 17 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition and 6 rounds of .35 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The court denied Ingram\u2019s motion for reduction, noting that Ingram had pled guilty to both drugs and firearms charges, had sold substantial amounts of marijuana for \u201ca long, long time,\u201d and was an habitual offender with an extensive criminal record. <em>(Id. </em>at 20). With respect to \u00a7 3553(a), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar2E\">deterrent factors to the public and to the individual himself are factors. In this instance, I consider the protection of society or the protection of the community as a serious factor. All of the factors set forth in the statute are \u2014 probably except for rehabilitation. I\u2019m not sure rehabilitation is a factor at all to be considered. The person \u2014 he\u2019s still a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>young man, much, much younger than I....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">... I think that at his age and with his background, that rehabilitation\u2019s not a factor we think much about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction only for clear error. <em>United States v. Wyckoff, </em>918 F.2d 925, 928 (11th Cir.1990). Under the facts of this case, the district court did not clearly err in denying him the reduction under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">We also reject Ingram\u2019s argument that his sentence must be vacated because it was not reasonable. In imposing a sentence, the district court must consider the Guidelines and the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). We have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Nonetheless, it is clear from this record that the district court adequately considered all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and appropriately considered Ingram\u2019s argument regarding his need for rehabilitation, it did not err in imposing the 24-month concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
