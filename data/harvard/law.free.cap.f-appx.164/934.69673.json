This appeal requires us to consider whether the government\u2019s failure to move for downward departure pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), based on Taylor\u2019s cooperation, constitutes a breach of Taylor\u2019s plea agreement. We find that it does not and that there is no other error. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Taylor pled guilty to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon/armed career criminal, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1). Taylor\u2019s plea agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-20\">That the defendant is not called upon by this agreement nor any other to implicate any particular individual as to any particular illegal activity, nor to \u201cmake a case\u201d against anyone; That the defendant\u2019s benefits under this agreement are conditioned solely upon his cooperation and truthfulness, and are IN NO WAY conditioned upon the outcome of any trial, grand jury, or other proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-21\">If the defendant\u2019s cooperation is completed prior to sentencing, the government agrees to consider whether such cooperation qualifies as \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and under the policies of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Georgia warrants the filing of a motion for downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range and departure below any applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ble statutory mandatory minimum sentence. If the defendant\u2019s cooperation is completed or likely to be completed subsequent to sentencing, the government agrees to consider whether such cooperation qualifies as \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P. and under the policies of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Georgia warrants the filing of a motion for downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range and departure below any applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence, within one year of the imposition of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Rl-22 at 5-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Taylor, who was in custody following an arrest on a drug charge, provided a statement in which he admitted to pawning a handgun. He had obtained the handgun from an unidentified white male in exchange for crack cocaine. Taylor\u2019s criminal history showed that he had been convicted on four separate occasions of a \u201cviolent felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\u201d including robbery, burglary, and selling cocaine, thereby qualifying him as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 (2004). This gave him an offense level of 33. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">He received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), which resulted in a total offense level of 30. With his criminal history level of VI, the recommended sentencing guidelines range was 168 to 210 months. Because a sentence imposed may not be less than any statutorily required minimum sentence and the mandatory statutory minimum term of imprisonment for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) is 15 years (180 months), Taylor\u2019s guidelines range became 180 to 210 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Taylor made no objections to the facts as laid out in his pre-sentence investigation report. At his sentencing hearing, his attorney asked that the court be aware \u201cthat Mr. Taylor ha[d] been cooperating with the Government since the entry of his guilty plea ... that [according to the government] he [was] not eligible for a motion for downward departure right [then], but m[ight] be at some future time if [he] continue[d] to cooperate and be forthright and honest with [the government].\u201d R5 at 5. Accordingly, Taylor\u2019s attorney asked the court to impose the minimum possible sentence of fifteen years. <em>Id. </em>The government confirmed that Taylor had been cooperating by speaking with agents and that the government \u201chope[d] that in the future, it [would] bear fruit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court then sentenced Taylor to 180 months imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">On appeal, Taylor argues that his sentence should be reversed because the government breached the plea agreement by not filing a motion for downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his cooperation and assistance. Even though Taylor concedes that the plea agreement gives the government discretion as to filing such a motion, he asserts that the agreement specifically stated that all he had to do was cooperate, that he did cooperate, and that the government\u2019s reference to its hope that the cooperation would be \u201cfruitful\u201d directly breached the agreement under which his benefits were \u201cIN NO WAY conditioned upon the outcome of any trial, grand jury, or other proceeding.\u201d Rl-22 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">We typically review <em>de novo </em>the issue of \u201c[w]hether the government has breached a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ma</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number><em>hique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). If, however, a defendant fails to object to the imposition of his sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing, \u201cany objections ... are barred absent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. We </em>\u201cequate[ ] the manifest injustice inquiry with review for plain error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Taylor\u2019s attorney conceded that he understood, based on discussions with the government, that Taylor was ineligible for a downward departure motion at that point despite his cooperation. Thus, Taylor now alleges breach for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, Taylor\u2019s objection is barred absent plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\"><em>We </em>have made clear that, even post-<em>Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a motion from the government is required before a district court may depart downward from the guideline range on the basis of substantial assistance. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1182 (11th Cir.2005). In explaining our role concerning review of the government\u2019s decision not to file a substantial assistance motion, we have reasoned that \u201cjudicial review [of the government\u2019s decision not to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion] is appropriate when there is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502 (11th Cir.1993) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">In this case, although the government conceded at the sentencing hearing that Taylor had been cooperating, Taylor\u2019s plea agreement specified that the government was not promising to make a motion for downward departure based on his cooperation but rather agreed \u201cto consider whether [his] cooperation qualifie[d] as \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d Rl-22 at 6 The agreement leaves the decision as to filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion within the sound discretion of the government. Accordingly, the government did not breach the plea agreement by exercising its discretion not to make a motion. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1182. Further, because the government did not move for a downward departure, the district court was prohibited from departing from the guideline range on the basis of substantial assistance. Finally, Taylor has not demonstrated, or even alleged, an impermissible motive behind the government\u2019s failure to move for a downward departure. <em>See Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502. Consequently, there is no plain error and review of the government\u2019s decision is inappropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Taylor has appealed his sentence on the ground that the government breached his plea agreement in failing to file a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance. Because Taylor\u2019s plea agreement did not contain a promise by the government to move for a downward departure and because Taylor failed to articulate an unconstitutional motive behind the government\u2019s decision not to move for a downward departure, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-8\">. <em>United States v.
