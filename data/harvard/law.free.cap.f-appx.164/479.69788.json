Garcia contends that the district court erred when it sentenced him based on a prior conviction for delivering cocaine, as an aggravated-felony offense that warranted a 16-level offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i)(2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-27\">The record indicates that no document was provided to the district court to support the probation department\u2019s characterization of Garcia\u2019s prior drug offense as a felony that warranted this enhancement. Thus, this court has no such document before it in order to determine whether the district court erred when it enhanced Garcia\u2019s sentence. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The only support for the enhancement is the assertions that are set forth in the presentence report (PSR). For enhancement purposes, a district court may not rely solely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274. There must be a \u201ccharging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, [or an] explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257. As shown by <em>Shepard </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257, 1259-61, and Garza-Lopez, 410 F.3d at 273-75, the district court erred when it determined that Garcia\u2019s prior drug conviction warranted the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Garcia also contends that the treatment of felonies and aggravated felonies as sentencing factors under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that he should be resentenced subject to the two-year maximum set forth in \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Garcia properly concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">We therefore VACATE Garcia\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing. \u201cOn remand, the district court should order the Government to supplement the record with documents that might establish which elements [of the prior conviction Garcia] pleaded guilty to.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir. 2005). Then the district court should reconsider whether a 16-level sentence enhancement is warranted. <em>Id </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
