He argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had been previously deported because the Government did not introduce into evidence a signed copy of the order of deportation. MontesCastillo does not dispute that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>established that he was an alien and that he reentered the United States without the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reenter. A review of the record indicates that the evidence, particularly the Warrant of Deportation executed in August 2000, was sufficient to establish that Montes-Castillo had been previously deported. <em>See United States v. Mathes, </em>151 F.Sd 251, 252 (5th Cir.1998); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326; <em>United States v. Ramirez-Gamez, </em>171 F.3d 236, 238 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Flores-Peraza, </em>58 F.3d 164, 166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Montes-Castillo argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Montes-Castillo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Montes-Castillo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Montes-Castillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres and </em>circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Montes-Castillo\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
