He argues that the district court plainly erred in characterizing his prior battery conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and using it to increase his guideline offense level by 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-22\">In determining whether an offense is a crime of violence, this court \u201clooks to the elements of the crime, not to the defendant\u2019s actual conduct in committing it.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201cAs the elements of an offense come from the statute of conviction, the elements, and not the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct, are the proper focus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if the statute contains disjunctive elements, the charging instrument may be consulted. <em>See Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d at 258. Because proof of the intentional use of force is not required for a conviction under the Arkansas second degree battery statute, ArkCode Ann. \u00a7 5-13-202, and because the charging instrument is not part of the record from which the disjunctive elements of \u00a7 5-13-202 can be determined, we cannot conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>that Limon\u2019s prior battery conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 605 (5th Cir.)(en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>541 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 1728, 158 L.Ed.2d 410 (2004). The district court plainly erred in characterizing it as such. <em>United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 423-24 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Limoris conviction is AFFIRMED, his sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As Lim\u00f3n concedes, <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) forecloses his argument that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d portion of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) defines a separate offense which must be charged in the indictment. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
