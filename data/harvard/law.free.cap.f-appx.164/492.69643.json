STEWART, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Jacob Telles (\u201cTelles\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for declaratory judgment and motion to recuse Judge Kathleen Cardone. Telles\u2019s underlying lawsuit involved a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim, but the motions at issue in this appeal pertain to Telles\u2019s challenge to the legality of the District Attorney Information Management System (\u201cDIMS\u201d) in the City and County of El Paso and a subsequent motion to recuse. For the following reasons, we are without jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for declaratory judgment. We affirm the denial of the motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">Early in the morning of December 26, 2001, El Paso police officers were dispatched to 5933 Via Norte Lane in El Paso, Texas, in response to an alleged fight. The officers, however, erroneously arrived at Telles\u2019s home at 5925 Via Norte Lane, where Telles was entertaining guests during a Christmas gathering. The officers entered Telles\u2019s home pursuant to the original dispatch; more than twenty minutes passed before the El Paso Police Department dispatcher notified the officers that they were at the wrong address. During the period that the officers remained in Telles\u2019s home, Telles repeatedly insisted that the officers leave. The officers eventually arrested him and subsequently charged him with assaulting a police officer. Telles alleges that this arrest was improper; he also claims that he was beaten and \u201csprayed\u201d by El Paso police officers and later improperly detained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>This appeal, however, does not involve the substance of his \u00a7 1983 claim. Instead, it involves motions made in preparation for trial in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Telles initially filed a motion for declaratory judgment requesting the district court determine whether the DIMS program,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as used by the City and County of El Paso, violated Texas law and his constitutional rights. Specifically, Telles claims that because assistant district attorneys acting pursuant to the DIMS program allegedly authorized the filing of charges against him and set bond from an approved schedule, Telles was deprived of his right to have a magistrate make a finding of probable cause and set bond. The district court, however, noted in its order denying his motion for declaratory judgment that Telles had not complied with the district court\u2019s \u201cMotion Filing Procedure Before Judge Cardone.\u201d This local rule provides that \u201c \u2018[t]he original motion and moving papers shall not be filed with this Court\u2019 but shall rather be \u2018serve[d] on all counsel.\u2019 \u201d Determining that a motion for declaratory judgment is not exempt from this local rule, the district court denied the motion without prejudice to refiling. In a footnote in its order, the district court also cautioned Telles that his motion for declaratory judgment \u201cappears to be a request to add additional counts despite plaintiff failing to specifically request amendment of the complaint .... [and that if] plaintiff refile[s] a similar request it should be in the form of a motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The second subject of this appeal involves Telles\u2019s subsequent motion to recuse Judge Cardone pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. He sought District Judge Kathleen Cardone\u2019s removal based on her involvement in 1995 with the El Paso Council of Judges, the governing body that voted in 1995 to approve the DIMS program and pre-set bond schedule. Telles also stated in his motion that he questioned Judge Cardone\u2019s impartiality because she is married to a retired El Paso police officer and had recently socialized with the El Paso District Attorney. Judge Cardone, however, denied Telles\u2019s motion and explained that she was not a voting member of the Council of Judges when it approved the DIMS program or enacted a pre-set bond schedule. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to recuse also answered a personal attack on Judge Cardone by requiring \u201cplaintiffs counsel ... show cause ... as to why he should not be sanctioned for contempt for including [Judge Cardone\u2019s] personal home address in a publicly filed motion.\u201d This appeal stems from the denial of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">A, Motion for Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss or stay a federal declaratory judgment action under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Holmes County, </em>343 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir.2003). Under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, a district court \u201cmay declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (2005). The district court, however, is not compelled to exercise that jurisdiction. <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 287, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). In fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized the Declaratory Judgment Act as \u201can enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.\u201d <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 241, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952); <em>Green v. Mansour, </em>474 U.S. 64, 72,106 S.Ct. 423, 88 L.Ed.2d 371 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In this case, however, we do not reach the merits of the constitutionality of the DIMS program, nor do we determine if the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for declaratory judgment. This court is without jurisdiction to do so. Prior to reaching the merits, a court of appeals must first verify that it has jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>Hernandez v. Tex. Dept. of Prot. &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>380 F.3d 872, 878 (5th Cir.2004). Courts of Appeals have \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2005). In determining appellate jurisdiction, a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of a district court generally is one that ends the litigation and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment. <em>McLaughlin v. Miss. Power Co., </em>376 F.3d 344, 350 (5th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The case before us is an appeal from a denial of a motion without prejudice to refile; it is not a final judgment, as the order of the district court did not adjudicate or dispose of any substantive issues. <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (stating that \u201cas long as the matter remains open, unfinished or inconclusive,\u201d the appellate court is without the power of review). Section 1292(a), however, does provide an exception to this final judgment requirement, as it allows for the appeal of certain interlocutory orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (2005). This exception does not aid Telles because a motion for declaratory judgment is not one of the specified types of interlocutory orders subject to appeal in \u00a7 1292(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Moreover, the reason Telles\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment was denied without prejudice is because he failed to follow the district court\u2019s rule that moving papers be served on counsel rather than filed directly with the district court. The district court did not even reach the merits of his motion. The district court\u2019s order denying Telles\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment does not conclusively determine a disputed question, and it also does not qualify this issue on appeal as a collateral order exception-an alternative route to jurisdiction in the absence of a final judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Baldridge v. SBC Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>404 F.3d 930, 931 (5th Cir.2005). Furthermore, \u00a7 1292(b) provides an additional exception to the final judgment rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">[w]hen a district judge ... shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law ... that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (2005). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides yet another exception,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). These exceptions, however, are also unhelpful to Telles because the order denying his motion for declaratory judgment without prejudice has not been certified for interlocutory appeal under either \u00a7 1292(b) or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b). Therefore, because Telles cannot rely on an exception to the final judgment rule, we do not reach the merits of his appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal of the denial of the declaratory judgment motion for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">B. Motion to Recuse</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Recusal is proper if the court determines that a reasonable person would perceive a significant risk that the judge will resolve the case on a basis other than the merits. <em>Sao Paulo State of Federative Republic of Braz. v. Am. Tobacco, Co., </em>535 U.S. 229, 232-33, 122 S.Ct. 1290, 152 L.Ed.2d 346 (2002). \u201cTh[e] recusal standard is objective; the relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable man, were he to know all the circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cWe review a district court judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Trevino, </em>168 F.3d at 178; <em>In re Hipp, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The issue of judicial disqualification is a sensitive one; it requires that we assess the relevant facts and circumstances to appropriately determine whether a judge\u2019s failure to disqualify herself from a proceeding was an abuse of her judicial discretion. <em>See In re City of Houston, </em>745 F.2d 925, 927 (5th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). Furthermore, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself ... [if] his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(1) Where he has a personal bias or. prejudice concerning a party ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">(4) He knows that he ... has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">(5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">(ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">(iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>(iv) Is to the judge\u2019s knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 (2005). There must also be a reasonable factual basis for calling the judge\u2019s impartiality into question. <em>See United States v. Avilez-Reyes, </em>160 F.3d 258, 259 (5th Cir.1998). Such a factual basis exists if a judge has a personal bias or prejudice against a party, in favor of an adverse party, or about the subject matter of the suit. <em>Sao Paulo, </em>535 U.S. at 232-33, 122 S.Ct. 1290. In such a case, the judge should recuse himself or herself. <em>In re City of Houston, </em>745 F.2d at 927-28. This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Telles\u2019s motion to recuse does not comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, which clearly requires that a motion to recuse be supported by an affidavit of the party. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (2005). Affidavits of disqualification must be construed strictly \u201cfor form, timeliness, and sufficiency.\u201d <em>United States v. Womack, </em>454 F.2d 1337, 1341 (5th Cir.1972). In this case, Telles\u2019s attorney attached a signed affidavit, but because an affidavit of counsel is not sufficient, Telles\u2019s motion to recuse is procedurally invalid notwithstanding its substance. <em>Davis v. Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs of Mobile County, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1050-51 (5th Cir. 1975) (explaining that the term \u201cparty\u201d as used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 does not include counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Furthermore, even if Telles had followed proper procedure and provided his personal affidavit with his motion, his motion to recuse must still fail. In his motion, Telles called into question Judge Cardone\u2019s neutrality in this case and alleged: (1) she is married to a retired El Paso police officer who receives retirement benefits from the City of El Paso; (2) she was a member of the El Paso Council of Judges in 1995 when the DIMS program was approved by the Council; (3) as a member of the state court, she approved a pre-set bond schedule to be used in the DIMS program; and (4) she socialized with District Attorney and co-defendant, Jaime Esparza, during a celebration for El Paso Police Department Chief Richard Wiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Judge Cardone explained in her order denying the recusal motion that she is not an interested party to this action. Though she is married to a retired police officer and she was an Associate Judge in El Paso County in 1995, Judge Cardone corrected Telles\u2019s false impression of her association with the DIMS program by explaining that she did not vote on any action taken by the Council of Judges and therefore did not vote on the DIMS program or approve a pre-set bond schedule. Judge Cardone denied that she had socialized with the District Attorney by stating that she neither attended the party, nor was she even aware that such a party took place in the Police Chiefs honor. In closing, Judge Cardone reiterated her neutrality and denied Telles\u2019s motion to recuse because there no longer existed a reasonable question as to her impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Viewing this issue on appeal from an objective, reasonable person standard, we agree that no bias exists. <em>See Phillips v. Joint Legist. Comm., </em>637 F.2d 1014, 1019 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Avilez-Reyes, </em>160 F.3d at 259 (\u201cThe standard by which we judge recusal is an objective one.\u201d). Judge Cardone did not abuse her discretion in denying Telles\u2019s motion to recuse. She specifically addressed and subsequently explained and dismissed each of Telles\u2019s concerns as to her potential bias. The appearance of partiality, much less the existence of <em>actual </em>partiality, is absent from this appeal. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>49 F.3d 152, 155 (5th Cir.1995). This case does not present a risk of undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process nor does it present a risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of injustice to the parties in this case or in other cases. <em>In re Continental Airlines, </em>981 F.2d 1450, 1462 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination regarding Telles\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we do not reach the merits of Telles\u2019s appeal on the order denying his motion for declaratory judgment and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denying the motion to recuse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-20\">. According to the record, Telles bases his \u00a7 1983 action on the following claims: exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>sive force, warrantless arrest, warrantless search of his residence, improper detention, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, assault and battery, conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">.
