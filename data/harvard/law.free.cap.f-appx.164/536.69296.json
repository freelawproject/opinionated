United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Martinez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez--Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-25\">Martinez asserts that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to mandatory Sentencing Guidelines in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts that the error in his case is structural and is insusceptible to harmless error analysis. Contrary to Martinez\u2019s contention, we have previously rejected this specific argument. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-26\">Martinez contends that the Government cannot show that the error that occurred at his sentencing was harmless. The Government concedes that Martinez preserved his claim of error. We review Martinez\u2019s challenge to his sentence for harmless error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). <em>See Wal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>ters, </em>418 F.3d at 463. Nothing in the record demonstrates and the Government has not shown that the district court would not have imposed a different sentence under advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 466. Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and his case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because resentencing is warranted, there is no need to address Martinez\u2019s remaining sentencing claims. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>dos </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
