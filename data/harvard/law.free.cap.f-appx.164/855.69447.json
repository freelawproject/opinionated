The district court ordered the injunction when it entered a default judgment against Malatesta for failing to file a sufficient answer to the government\u2019s civil complaint for permanent injunction. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">Malatesta argues that the district court erred in entering a default against him. We review a district court\u2019s decision to uphold an entry of default for an abuse of discretion. <em>See E.E.O.C. v. Mike Smith Pontiac GMC, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 524, 528 (11th Cir.1990). The entry of a default is appropriate \u201c[w]hen a party against whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Malatesta contends that he sufficiently answered the allegations in the government\u2019s complaint with statements in his \u201cAnswer to Plaintiffs Motion for Temporary Injunction and Restraining Order\u201d (Answer to TRO). We disagree. First, the caption of this document indicates that it is a response to the government\u2019s motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which the government filed in connection with its complaint for permanent injunction. Second, and most important, Malatesta\u2019s Answer to TRO contained no general or specific denials of the averments in the government\u2019s complaint: this document does not comport with the pleading requirements of Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, the Answer to TRO responded to the \u201cFacts\u201d section of the government\u2019s motion for TRO with a vague statement that Malatesta did not engage \u201cin any activity that could even remotely be described as unlawfully \u2018obstructing IRS examination and collection efforts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Third, the record indicates that Malatesta was not served formally with the government\u2019s complaint until 12 January 2004; but he filed the Answer to TRO on 19 December 2003, apparently after receiving the government\u2019s motion for TRO only.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject Malatesta\u2019s suggestion that, by diligently responding to the motion for TRO, he somehow answered the government\u2019s complaint before being served with the complaint. Even giving Malatesta\u2019s Answer to TRO the benefit of the doubt as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, <em>see Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003), we cannot agree with Malatesta that his Answer to TRO can function as an answer to the government\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">And even after being served with the government\u2019s complaint, Malatesta failed to file a timely answer. The district court denied the government\u2019s initial motion for default: the court noted our disfavor of entries of default and our \u201cstrong policy for deciding cases on their merits.\u201d <em>In re Worldwide Sys., Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2003). The district court then directed Malatesta to file an answer to the government\u2019s complaint within ten days of the entry of the court\u2019s order. But still Malatesta filed no answer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ing a default against Malatesta for failing to answer the government\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Malatesta next argues that the district court abused its discretion in entering default judgment because the government in its complaint failed to state a valid cause of action against him. We review a district court\u2019s grant of default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Sanderford v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>902 F.2d 897, 898 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The government\u2019s complaint alleged that Malatesta was a CPA who acted as personal representative for customers of American Rights Litigators (ARL) and its successor entity, Guiding Light of God Ministries (GLGM), both of which were vehicles for selling abusive tax schemes that purported to exempt their customers from federal taxation. According to the complaint, Malatesta made false, fraudulent statements on behalf of ARL/GLGM customers that were intended to obstruct IRS enforcement acts and that resulted in the understatement of tax liability. In representing ARL/GLGM customers, Malatesta drafted letters to the IRS (1) making frivolous arguments about the internal revenue laws, (2) threatening to file complaints against individual IRS employees, (3) falsely claiming that IRS employees were violating the law by attempting to collect taxes from,, ARL/GLGM customers, and (4) making frivolous Freedom of Information Act requests demanding nonexistent documents. Customers also could purchase letters from Malatesta to third parties demanding that they refuse to comply with IRS administrative summonses. And Malatesta represented customers at IRS collection due process hearings, where he would make frivolous arguments and refused his customers\u2019 cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Malatesta correctly notes that a default judgment may not stand on a complaint that fails to state a claim. <em>See Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Houston Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975). But after reviewing the government\u2019s complaint, we conclude that the complaint contained sufficient \u201cwell-pleaded allegations,\u201d <em>see id., </em>to state a claim for injunctive relief under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402(a) and 7408, based on violations (of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6700 and 6701) by Malatesta and the codefendants. And because the default judgment establishes as fact the government\u2019s well-pleaded allegations of fact, Malatesta may not contest these facts on appeal. <em>See Buchanan v. Bowman, </em>820 F.2d 359, 361 (11th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Also, we reject Malatesta\u2019s argument that the district court failed to apply the correct legal standards in granting the permanent injunction. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant an injunction for an abuse of discretion. <em>S.E.C. v. ETS Payphones, Inc., </em>408 F.3d 727, 731 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determinations of law; but we review for clear error the fact determinations supporting an injunction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">After determining that Defendants violated \u00a7\u00a7 6700 and 6701, the district court enjoined them from, among other things, preparing documents for submission to the IRS on behalf of others or representing others in IRS proceedings. The district court determined (1) that the United States and the public would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction, (2) that Defendants would suffer little harm from the injunction, (3) that Defendants\u2019 tax positions were frivolous, (4) that the public interest would be served by granting the injunction, and (5) that, absent the permanent injunction, Defendants would continue to violate \u00a7\u00a7 6700 and 6701 and to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws. Malatesta has not shown that these fact determinations are clearly erroneous: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>we remember that the default judgment established as fact the allegations of fact in the government\u2019s complaint. <em>See Buchanan, </em>820 F.2d at 361. And the district court\u2019s determinations are sufficient to show that it set out and applied the proper factors for granting a permanent injunction under \u00a7\u00a7 7402(a) and 7408.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Finally, Malatesta argues that the permanent injunction is a prior restraint on his speech and violates his First Amendment rights. But he did not present this issue to the district court: we do not consider it. <em>See Wright v. Hanna Steel Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that, subject to several narrow exceptions, courts of appeal generally do not consider an issue not raised in the district court).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In sum, we reject Malatesta\u2019s arguments and affirm the district court\u2019s order entering default judgment and a permanent injunction against Malatesta.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. We note that the complaint contained a section with detailed allegations of Malatesta\u2019s conduct. But nowhere in Malatesta's Answer to TRO do we find a reference to the government's complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">. We point out that Malatesta in this statement quotes from the government\u2019s motion for TRO, not the government\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. The government filed both the complaint and the motion for TRO in district court on 8 December 2003. The TRO included a statement that it had been mailed to Malatesta on 8 December 2003; but the complaint contained no such provision. Malatesta for the first time in his reply brief contends that he received both the complaint and motion for TRO on 8 December 2003: this alleged fact, he claims, explains how he was able to respond to the complaint before being served. But apart from Malatesta\u2019s bare assertion, nothing in the record indicates that Malatesta received the complaint prior to 12 January 2004, the day the process server delivered the complaint to Malatesta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b883-13\">. Malatesta filed many documents in response to the government\u2019s renewed motion for default. But none of these documents suggest that they were an answer to the government's complaint. In any event, on appeal Malatesta argues only that his Answer to TRO constituted a sufficient answer; and he did not indicate to the district court that his Answer to TRO constituted his answer to the government\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. We reject Malatesta\u2019s claim that he will be harmed excessively by the provision of the injunction forbidding him from representing others before the IRS. He admits that his last full-time job involved bookkeeping for a company: nothing in the injunction forbids him from pursuing similar employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b885-25\">. Malatesta argues for the first time in his reply brief that his First Amendment argument comes under the exceptions to our general prohibition against considering new issues on appeal. We need not consider this argument. <em>See Hening v. Sec\u2019y, Dep't of Corr., </em>397 F.3d 1338, 1343 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are not properly before this Court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
