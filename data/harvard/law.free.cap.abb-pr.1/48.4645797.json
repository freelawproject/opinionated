Stat., 35, the omission of a petitioning creditor to relinquish a security held by him, does not affect the jurisdiction of the officer, nor avoid the discharge, even though his petition disclosed the existence of such security.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-10\">Nor is the proof of publication of notice of the order to creditors to show cause, essential to give jurisdiction. A discharge which recites due publication and that due proof thereof was presented, is not invalidated by defects in the notice, in its publication, or in the proof thereof, on file.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-11\">The statute does not require publication for a certain length of time, but ten publications, each within so many successive weeks, the commencement of which is determined by the first publication.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-12\">Proof that a notice was \u201c published in the New York Day Book \u201d is sufficient to show compliance with an order that it be published in \u201cthe newspaper published in the city of New York, entitled .\u2018the Evening Day Book, \" in the absence of any evidence of the existence of two papers with the title of Day Book.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-13\">An affidavit, in the commencement of which the deponent is designated by name, is not void for not being subscribed by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The published notice of an order to creditors to show cause, stating that the proceeding is for the discharge of an insolvent from his debts, need not specify the particular statute under which it is had, and adding a defective reference to the statute does not vitiate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-5\">The proof of publication of such notice is not limited by the statute, to an affidavit of the printer or the clerk or foreman of the printer, although it enables the insolvent to perpetuate the evidence by taking their affidavit. The petitions and schedules need not state the grounds of the demands of creditors With such particularity as is required in a statement for judgment by confession; and <em>it seems </em>that want of sufficient particularity does not affect the jurisdiction of the officer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-6\">Where a discharge recites all the required jurisdictional faefs and proceedings, the county clerk\u2019s certificate that certain papers, technically insufficient to show jurisdiction, are all that have been filed with him in the proceeding, is not, of itself, sufficient to disprove the recitals.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-7\">Whether a name in the list of creditors variant from that of the plaintiffs\u2019 was intended to designate them; or whether their names were omitted, and if so, whether the omission was <em>fraudulent;\u2014Held, </em>in this case prop- \u2022 erly submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-8\">An insolvent\u2019s discharge, granted under the laws of this State, is a good defence to an action on a judgment recovered here, in the absence of any evidence as to where the contract was made on which the judgment was recovered.

W. Smith was not mentioned in the schedules as a debtor or creditor of the insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">The order of the County Judge, requiring creditors to show cause why an assignment of the said insolvent\u2019s estate should not be madej and he be discharged from his debts, pursuant to the statute, directed notice of the same \u201c to be published for ten weeks in the State paper, and in the newspaper printed in the city of New York, entitled the <em>Evening Day </em>Booh, and the newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>printed in the city of Brooklyn, entitled the Brooklyn <em>Daily Eagle?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The notice, as published in the State paper, was entitled and commenced with a reference to the statute under which the proceedings were taken, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">\u201c Hotice of application for the discharge of an insolvent from his debts, pursuant to the third article of the first title of the fifth chapter of the second part of the Revised Statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">In the copy published in the <em>Brooklyn </em>Eagle, the words <em>\u201c </em>of the fifth chapter,\u201d were omitted; and in that published in the <em>Day </em>Book, the words, <em>\u201c </em>of the second part,\u201d were omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">The publication was once in each week for ten weeks successively, commencing, in the State paper, on the 21st of Hay, 1859, in the <em>Eagle </em>on the 20th, and in the <em>Day Book </em>on the 28th of Hay. The order was returnable on the 1st of August.

The affidavit of publication in the State paper contained the deponent\u2019s name in the commencement, as -is usual, but was without signature. It was, however, certified by a commissioner of deeds with the usual jurat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">In the debtor\u2019s schedule, or account of his creditors, the nature of the debts, and the cause and consideration of them were indicated only by the following phrases, set opposite the creditors\u2019 names:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-12\">Promissory notes for merchandise sold and delivered..............</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxqS\">Promissory notes for merchandise sold, delivered, and a hook ac\u2019t..,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUV\">Promissory note for merchandise sold and delivered...............</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH6\">Endorsement on promissory note for goods, wares, and merchandise,.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQkI\">Endorsement on note for goods and merchandise; and various <em>stochs, </em>.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad\">Endorsement on note for goods, wares, and merchandise.........</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AW\">Promissory note for goods.sold and delivered.....................</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A78\">Book account for merchandise sold and delivered..................</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWH\">Endorsement on note for <em>goods </em>sold and delivered.................</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The list of creditors contained the name of W. G. Soule, of Hew York, as a creditor to the amount of two hundred and six dollars and seventy-four cents, accrued at Hew York on a promissory note for merchandise sold and delivered. In the affidavit of personal service of the order to show cause, this creditor was designated at W. G. Saurl. The plaintiffs were not named, unless they were intended by these names.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">The papers produced in evidence with the discharge, as being a copy of the proceedings on which it was granted, were certified to by the county clerk as having been compared by him \u201cwith the original papers in the matter of Thomas B. Chase, an insolvent debtor, on file in my office, ^and that they are the true transcripts thereof, and of the whole of said original.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">Various objections to'the validity of the discharge, which were taken by the plaintiffs, are stated in the opinion of the Court. The plaintiffs also offered to prove by a witness, that the plaintiffs at the time the debt was contracted by the defendant, were both not only non-residents of the State of Hew York, but were also citizens of another State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">This wais excluded by the Court, to which ruling the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">The witness, in answer to the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">\u201c Did the plaintiffs receive notice of the defendant\u2019s application to be discharged from his debts, being the discharge offered in evidence?\u201d testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">\u201c They never did\u201c I and my partner have done business in the firm-name of H. &amp; G. Soule for the past sixteen years, and both of us lived in Hew Jersey during that time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">The Court refused the plaintiffs\u2019 request that the jury be instructed to find in their favor, and charged the jury, that they must determine whether the names of the plaintiffs in this suit were omitted from the proceedings for the discharge, and if so, whether such omission was with fraudulent intent. To this the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial having been denied and the judgment having been entered, they now appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-13\"><em>D.

There is a variance in the title of the newspaper printed in Hew York, in which the Judge ordered the notice to be published. The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>was for the newspaper entitled \u201c The <em>Evening Day Book? </em>The proof is of its publication in \u201c The New York <em>Day Book </em>,\u201d and was not a compliance with the order. (Brisbane <em>v. </em>Peabody, 3 <em>How. Pr., </em>109; Hallett <em>v. </em>Righters, 13 <em>Id., </em>43.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">n. By the affidavit of G. 0. Stimpson of the publication in the New York <em>Day Book, </em>the first publication was May 28th, 1859. The affidavit was made July 30th, 1859, within the <em>ninth week </em>after the first publication, and,by no reasoning could it be held to be a publication for <em>ten weeks </em>where the affidavit was made within the <em>ninth week, </em>it being made on the <em>sixty-third day of the publication, </em>and it gave the officer no jurisdiction to grant the discharge. It presents an entirely different case than it would where the affidavit had been made after the expiration of the <em>ninth week, </em>but before the <em>tenth week </em>had expired, but even in that case, the discharge would be void. (Demarest <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>468; Small <em>v. </em>Wheaton, 2 <em>Id., </em>175. In the matter of Underwood, 3 <em>Cow., </em>59; Anonymous, 1 <em>Wend., 90; </em>Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis, 16 <em>Barb., </em>319.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">Chase\u2019s creditors were required to appear before the ten weeks could elapse before the first publication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">IH. By the omission in describing the Revised Statutes, the notice does not designate whether the application would be made under \u201c the Two-thirds act,\u201d \u201c the Non-imprisonment act,\u201d \u201c the Stillwell act,\u201d or \u201c the Fourteen Day act,\u201d and is not a notice of defendant\u2019s application under, the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">IY. The affidavits do not show that the notices were published ten weeks under and in pursuance of the Judge\u2019s order. Hallett <em>v. </em>Righters and Salter, <em>supra. </em>Nor do they show that the persons making them were \u2022 competent, inasmuch as they do not swear that they are either principal clerks or foremen of the printers. They might he clerks or foremen in the offic\u00e9, and. still not be foremen of the printers. The person making the affidavit must be the printer, or the clerk of foreman of the printer. See. 7, 3d Revised Statutes, page 686.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">Y. What purports to be the affidavit of publication in the State paper is not an affidavit, because <em>it is not signed 'by the deponent', </em>the oath is not binding, as no perjury could be charged upon such a paper. Consequently, there is no proof of such publication to give jurisdiction to the Judge to entertain the proceedings. By the definition of an affidavit, it must be signed.' (Laimbeer <em>v. </em>Allen, 2 <em>Sandf, </em>647; Graham <em>v. </em>McCoun, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>5 <em>How.

There is a want Of proper specifications in the affidavits of the petitioning creditors as to the nature of their debts, how and for what they arose, <em>when </em>and <em>where </em>and <em>who </em>were the parties thereto, the consideration and character of the indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-7\">All and each of these should appear on the papers, and without a full and proper statement thereof, the intent to defraud must be inferred, and becomes a question of law. (Slidell <em>v. </em>McCrea, 1 <em>Wend., </em>156; Small <em>v. </em>Wheaton, 2 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>175, 179 ; McNair <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 3 <em>Wend., </em>344; Gillies <em>v. </em>Crawford, 2 <em>Hilt., </em>338.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-8\">Sec. 7 (4), of 3 Revised Statutes, page 92 (5th ed.), requires the petitioning creditors to state the nature of the demand, with the general ground and consideration of such indebtedness. The next section specifies what the petitioner shall do. Unless the specifications stated them, subdivisions 3, 4, and 5, of section 7, are nonsense. Chase did not comply with either of these subdivisions. There was no specification as required, nor is there any statement whether there was any security, for the indebtedness or not, neither is Smith named as a debtor or creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-9\">By the affidavit of John Robinson it does not appear that the property was ever sold or delivered, nor is any specification made of any kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-10\">\u2022 In the statement of the debts it should be made to appear how and for what they arose, when and where, who were the parties, the consideration or the character of the indebtedness, who delivered the goods or merchandise, and to whom they were delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-11\">Such a specification as was made would not support a judgment. (Dunham <em>v. </em>Waterman, 6 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>357; Chappel <em>v. </em>Chappel, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 <em>Kern.], </em>215 ; Freligh <em>v. </em>Brink, 16 <em>How. Pr., </em>272; Moody <em>v. </em>Townsend, 3 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>375; Stebbins <em>v. </em>The East Society, 12 <em>How. Pr., </em>410.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-12\">In the case of Gandal <em>v. </em>Finn (13 <em>How. Pr., </em>418), specifications were much more particular and greater than in these affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>davits. How much more full, precise, and particular, should every statement he made, in a case where a party\u2019s just claim is to he swept away by a judicial statutory proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-5\">It is submitted that no confession of judgment has ever been upheld where no date or place has been given. None are given in the affidavits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-6\">YII. The Court erred in refusing to. allow the plaintiffs to show that at the time the debt for which .the judgment was rendered was contracted, they were neither residents nor citizens of this State; as the insolvent laws of one State cannot impair debts contracted with the citizens of another State at the time of contract. Donnelly <em>v. </em>Corbett, 7 N. <em>Y. </em>(3 <em>Seld.), </em>500. Analogous to this case, is Ogden <em>v. </em>Saunders, 12 <em>Wheat., </em>213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-7\">VHI. The discharge was void, inasmuch as the plaintiffs\u2019 names were left out of the proceedings. They were residents of New Jersey, and no persons are put in as residing there\u2014nor do their names appear: this claim was for a judgment, and is for a different amount than any claim named\u2014no mention of any judgment is made in the schedule, and the discharge was void. (Subdivision 5 of Sec. 8, 3d <em>Revised Statutes, </em>page 93; Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 <em>Kern.), </em>575.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-8\">IX. The plaintiffs had no notice of the application which was required by law, which rendered the discharge fraudulent, not as a question of fact but of law. (Cases above cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-9\">X. There was no schedule of the defendant\u2019s creditors sworn to, as required by Sec. 8 of the Revised Statutes. As the word <em>\u201csworn\u201d </em>is left off, there is no <em>jurat\u2014and ihe oath can only he administered hy the Judge </em>granting the discharge. (Small <em>v. </em>Wheaton, <em>supra) </em>The same' objection is taken to the oath to the schedule of the nature of the indebtedness, and where the creditors resided,' required by Sec. 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-10\">XI. This application of the defendant was a special statutory proceeding, and if any essential prerequisite was wanting, the discharge is a nullity. (Small <em>v. </em>Wheaton, 2 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>175, and the cases there cited.) And the discharge being fraudulent in law, the Court ought to have directed judgment for the plaintiffs on their motion. In the matter of Underwood, 3 <em>Cow., </em>59; and see 2 <em>Kern., </em>575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-11\">. The Court is now asked to correct the error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-12\">It is submitted that if the discharge is held invalid for any jurisdictional defect in the proceedings,, no possible state of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>will entitle the defendant to judgment, and it brings this case within the rule laid down in Edmonston <em>v. </em>McLoud (16 N. <em>Y. </em>[2 <em>Smith], </em>543); and final judgment should be given for the plaintiffs. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-5\"><em>E.

Want of proper specification in the affidavits of petitioning creditors of \u201c the nature of their debts and claims, how and for what they arose, when and where, who were the parties, the consideration and character of the indebtedness, who delivered the goods, wares, and merchandise, or to whom they were, delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">4th. The omission of the names of the plaintiffs in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">5th. The omission from the defendant\u2019s list of creditors of the name of C. W.

Like want of specification of the nature of the creditors\u2019 demands, in the defendant\u2019s statements of them, as in their affidavits of indebtedness. .</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">7th. The absence of any signature subscribed to the proof of publication in the State paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">To these objections the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel now adds another, of the failure of the petitioning creditor to relinquish to the assignee, by a statement at the foot of their affidavit, the security, which by such affidavit they appear to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">Such of these objections as do not relate to jurisdictional facts are cured by the provisions of law which make the discharge <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the facts recited in it (2 R. S., 38, \u00a7 19), and enumerates for what causes the discharge may be set aside, (2 R. S., 23, \u00a7 34, 5th Ed., 40.) Formerly they excluded all eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>test even on jurisdictional facts (Lester <em>v. </em>Thompson, 1 <em>Johns., </em>300 ; Jenks <em>v. </em>Stebbins, 11 <em>Id., </em>244; People <em>v. </em>Stryker, 24 <em>Barb., </em>649); but the more recent case of Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis (12 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 <em>Kern.], </em>576; S. C., 16 <em>Barb., </em>319) reduces the effect of -the recitals as to jurisdictional facts to mere prima facie evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">What are necessary jurisdictional 'facts are clearly and succinctly enumerated in the case of Rusher <em>v. </em>Sherman (28 <em>Barb., </em>116), in which they are stated by the learned Judge who decided that case to be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">1st. A proper petition by proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">2d. Proper affidavits, by the petitioning creditors, of the nature, amount and consideration of their debts, and their freedom from any bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">3d. A proper account of creditors, and the amounts due them, the consideration of their debts, and any security held by them therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">1th. A proper inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u25a0 5th. The oath of the insolvent, <em>before the officer, </em>as to the accuracy of his petition and schedule, and other matters required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">6th. Proof of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">I cannot regard the relinquishment by the petitioning credit- or of any security held by him before he became a petitioning creditor, as a jurisdictional fact (2 R. S., 36, \u00a7 21). The statute provides no mode of informing the officer of their existence, ex cept by tire statement in the petition or schedule annexed. In this case the statement of it in the creditor\u2019s affidavit was superfluous, because not required by the statute. The statute did not intend that the whole proceedings should be had for nought if it should afterwards be accidentally discovered that the petitioning creditor held a security which he had omitted to relinquish. It might form a good objection to granting the discharge on the hearing, and possibly might be cured by rclihquiskment even at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The provision in regard to such relinquishment forms no part \u2018 of the article prescribing the proceedings to be had before procuring the order for publication of the notice to show cause, and is only directory in form. Moreover, in this case, no mention is made of any securities held by the petitioning creditors in the insolvent\u2019s schedule of debts, and although- proof may be now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>offered <em>alixmde </em>of the existence of such securities, such omission' will not affect the validity of the discharge (Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 Kern.], 575, per Denio, J.) The accidental statement in the affidavits of petitioning creditors in this case, that their \u25a0 claim is secured by said endorsement, did not make it incumbent on the officer to see that it was given up. The statute only required that the documents mentioned in the case of Busher <em>v. </em>Sherman <em>(ubi sup.) </em>as jurisdictional, shall be presented to the officer to procure the order for publication, and upon such presentation and order he acquires jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The proof of publication required by the statute is not a jurisdictional <em>fact; </em>the decision of the Supreme Court in Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis <em>(ubi sup.) </em>to that effect is doubted by the Judge who gave the only-opinion-in the same case on appeal (12 <em>N. Y., </em>580, Denio, J.) He says he <em>\u201c </em>suspects it is notthus giving as strong an impression as possible, considering that the point was not necessary to the case. He intimates very strongly in that case that jurisdiction begins on granting the order before the publication is made. The statute merely <em>directs </em>proof to be made before inquiring into the merits; while the amendment in 1847 as to one mode of service which prescribes that the proof shall be <em>satisfactory to the officer </em>(Sess. Laws of 1847, Ch. 366, \u00a7 2), neither. states whether it shall be made by affidavit or orally. There was no evidence in this case that the affidavits offered were the only proofs of publication received by the officer; and the recitals in the discharge are at least prima facie evidence of due proof, even if it were a jiuisdictional fact; and the same principles will apply to all the other objections except the contents of the papers presented to the officer. But even if they were the only evidence, they are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The objection of too short a publication of the notice to show cause was properly overruled, because the statute only requires ten publications, each one of which is to be successively within one of ten successive weeks (2 R. S., 18, \u00a7 11, [14],) the com- , mencement whereof is determined by the first publication (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Wright, 5 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Seld.] </em>497 ; S. C., 7 Barb., 39 ; see 1 <em>Mass., </em>255). A contrary doctrine upheld in The People <em>v. </em>Yates C. P. (1 <em>Wend., </em>90), followed in Bunce <em>v. </em>Reed at Special Term (16 <em>Barb., </em>347), is overruled by. the cases last cited. The difference, when a definite period of publication, such as ten weeks, and not the number of publications is fixed, was over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>looked in those cases. In the statute, no length of time' is prescribed during which the notice to -show cause must be given, except by such order of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The question of the name of the newspaper, <em>The Day </em>Badlc, is entirely one of identity. The affidavit of publication complained of does not aver the title of the paper to be the New York Nay Book, but designates it by that name as a New York newspaper. In the order of publication, the term \u201c <em>Evening </em>\u201d may have been used merely to specify it as an afternoon issue. There was no evidence of the existence of two papers, published in the city of New York, with the title of Day Book, to \u25a0 create a patent ambiguity. Similar variances have been held immaterial even in actions for torts. (Southwick <em>v. </em>Stevens, 10 <em>Johns, </em>443.) Extrinsic circumstances are admissible to show who is intended by a certain name. (People <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 8 <em>Cow., </em>102.) Even the entire omission of the christened name of a person has been held to be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The want of a signature subscribed to another affidavit of publication is also immaterial. In this case the affiant\u2019s name was at the head of the affidavit, and that, in the case of vsjills and agreements under the former Statute of Frauds, was held to be a sufficient signature. '</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The same view was taken in Jackson <em>v. </em>Virgil (3 <em>Johns., </em>539), where a signature was omitted. The only object of a signature or mark <em>(signum) </em>is to identify the deposition sworn to. Persons incapable of making either a signature' or mark by disease or natural infirmities or defects, are not debarred from making an affidavit, which is but written testimony. The description in Bacon\u2019s Abridgment (Tit. <em>Affidavits) </em>of an affidavit will hardly stand any critical examination as a definition. It is there called an <em>oath in writing administered </em>/ how that can be when the form is presented orally, is not very clear. The case of Laimbeer <em>v. </em>Allen (2 <em>Sandf., </em>647), decided at Special Term, where the question arose on a pleading not an affidavit, and was hastily considered without any notice of the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>Virgil <em>(ubi sup.) </em>can hardly be considered as overruling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">There is no statutory provision requiring the particular act \u25a0 of the Legislature under which the applicant seeks relief, to be designated in the published notice to show cause. The Revised Statutes only require him to state therein, merely whether he seeks a discharge from his debts or only from imprisonment. (2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>R.S., </em>648, \u00a7 44). The proof of publication is not limited by statute to any particular person; although it enables an insolvent to perpetuate such evidence when made by specified persons. The objections made on the score of an omission in the notice of the. subdivisions of the Bevised Statutes in which the Two-Third act is to be found, as well as of the person malting ' the affidavit, therefore, fall to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The statutory requisites that the nature of the demands of the petitioning creditors, as well as whether they arise on a written security or otherwise, and their general grounds and consideration, shall be stated in their affidavits, and that their true cause and consideration shall be stated in the debtor\u2019s schedule annexed to his petition, seem to have been sufficiently complied with. If enough is stated to apprise disputing or opposing creditors of the general grounds of indebtedness, such as <em>money </em>lent, <em>money paid, </em>or <em>services at the debtor's request, </em>it has been held to be sufficient, because it gives them a clue to inquiry (Taylor <em>v. </em>Williams, 20 <em>Johns., </em>21). Defects in such statements, arising from w;ant of particularity, have been held to be cured by the discharge, and even to be curable at the hearing (In matter of Hurst, 7 <em>Wend., </em>239). Want of particularity differs from an entire omission of the consideration (McNair <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 3 <em>Wend., </em>344). It was not necessary to specify to whom the goods were sold and delivered, or when, with the particularity required in a complaint, or even in the specification required by the Code of Procedure to be annexed to a confession of judgment (\u00a7 383). That exacts a concise statement of <em>\u201c the facts out of which the liability </em>\u201d arises, which is far more extensive than \u201c <em>the nature of the demand and ground and consideration of the indebtedness.\u201d </em>Hone of the conflicting decisions in regard to that section of the Code would therefore be applicable. The subsequent provision in the Statute authorizing the officer to whom the application is made, to commence his acts for granting the discharge by directing an assignment upon being satisfied of the appearance of certain matters (2 R. S., 21, \u00a7 25), would alone throw great doubt on the question whether the proper description of the indebtedness of the insolvent to petitioning creditors, which is not one of those matters, was a jurisdictional fact. That provision only requires the officer to be satisfied of the insolvent\u2019s indebtedness to the creditors for the- amount claimed, without reference t \u2019* \"\u2022\u2019\u00ab\u25a0m or nature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>A mistake in anything hut the amount would seem to be capable of being overlooked. On the fact of the indebtedness and its being two-thirds, the discharge seems to be conclusive (Betts <em>v. </em>Bagley, 12 <em>Peck, </em>812). The language of Judge Denio, in Van Alstyne <em>v. </em>Erwine (11 N. <em>Y. </em>[1 <em>Kern.], </em>331), in reference to another, and of special proceeding quoted with approbation by the learned Judge who delivered the opinion in Rusher <em>v. </em>Sherman <em>[ubi sup.), </em>is still more apt in regard to insolvent discharges, for without \u201c the liberal indulgence \u201d challenged by him <em>\u201c </em>even on questions of jurisdiction,\u201d proceedings to' obtain them would be <em>\u201c a snare instead of a beneficial </em>remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">But most if not all \u25a0 of these objections are technical and founded on the supposition that the recitals in the discharge are contradicted by the sole want of conformity of certain documents produced from the County Clerk\u2019s office to the provisions of. Statute. There was no evidence obtained to show that the officer granting the discharge had not other evidence before him of the facts recited in the discharge than appeared in the papers so produced. The County Clerk certified that he had compared the latter with \u201c <em>the original papers, </em>in the matter of Thomas B. Chase <em>on file in Ms </em>office,\u201d and that they were true transcripts of the whole of them. He probably knew nothing of such original papers except they were on file in his office : by whom filed, or when, did not appear. The case states that they were a copy of <em>the proceedings and discharge. </em>They consisted of what purported to be copies of a discharge; assignment; some affidavits of publication and personal service of notice on creditors; an order for an assignment; a certificate of its execution by the assignee and of its record by a County Clerk; an order of publication of notice; a petition by the defendant and some creditors, and an affidavit of his good faith; some affidavits of such creditors ; a list of them and their residences; a schedule of the nature of their debts; and an inventory of the insolvent\u2019s estate. These .undoubtedly were a compliance with some of the provisions of the statute, but are not proved to include every thing that took place before the, officer. He is required to file <em>\u201c all proceedings </em>\u201d to obtain a discharge, within a certain time after the same shall have been consummated, with the Clerk of his County (2 <em>R. S., </em>39, \u00a7 21). What is meant by <em>\" proceedings </em>\u201d does not clearly appear from such provision, whether they include those required to be reported by such an officer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>another Court (2 <em>R. S., </em>10, \u00a7 <em>46 ; Ib., </em>13, \u00a7 68), those for obtaining a jury (2 <em>R. S., </em>26, \u00a7 14; Ib., 29, \u00a7 6), or the minutes required to be kept by such officer of the testimony of witnesses examined before him (2 <em>R. S., </em>37, \u00a7 16), which might include proof of due publication of the notice to show cause,\u2014does not appear. In some parts of the title containing the statute in question, the term <em>\u201c </em>proceedings \u201d is evidently used to signify all the steps taken to procure a discharge, according to its proper meaning. Under such circumstances the <em>frima facie </em>evidence that all the jurisdictional proceedings and facts recited in the discharge took place, created by law from such recital, is hardly repelled by a County Clerk\u2019s certificate, that certain documents are copies of all the original papers filed in the matter of such insolvency in his office, without evidence to show that the proper proceedings did not take place before the officer certifying in the discharge granted by him that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The question of fraud growing out of a supposed omission of the plaintiffs\u2019 names from the documents presented by the defendant to obtain the order to show cause against his discharge, was submitted to the jury. That is entirely different from inserting a creditor\u2019s name and omitting the amount due him, which is held to be essential in Stanton <em>v. </em>Ellis (ubi <em>supra) </em>because the two thirds cannot be ascertained. In that case it was held that the entire omission of a creditor\u2019s name or insertion of an incorrect amount would not have made the proceedings defective (p. 579, per Demo, J., 2 <em>R. S., </em>81, \u00a7 3, <em>subd. </em>4).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">There was no evidence in the case where the contract, on which the judgment of the plaintiffs sued on was obtained, was made. <em>Prima facie, </em>therefore, the discharge was good against it. Proof of a party\u2019s mere residence in another State was immaterial, and properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">There being no error in the rulings of the Court on the trial, the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b70-16\"> Present Moncrief, Robertson and Monell, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
