The claim for judgment was for this amount.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-11\"><em>C. M.

But such pleading will be allowed with great caution, and only where it is very clear that the nature of the case-renders it proper and necessary to protect the rights of the plaintiff, and secure him against the danger of a non-suit, on the trial. The motion is denied, without costs to either party. Defendant to have ten days to answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
