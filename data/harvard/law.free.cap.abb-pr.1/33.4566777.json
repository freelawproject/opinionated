S. Purple, assignee of Minerva Purple. The complaint alleged that the defendants; contracted to carry Minerva Purple from Greenbush to Canal-street, and deliver her there in safety; that she was violently thrown from the car when landing, by reason of its being started improperly, whereby she was severely injured: and that she had assigned the cause of action to the present plaintiff. To this complaint the defendants demurred on the ground that the cause was not assignable. The demurrer was sustained at special term, and the plaintiff appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-10\"><em>Geo.

It seems to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>understood by many members of the bar that the Code authorizes an assignee to maintain an action in his own name, and that in all cases where right of action exists in a party, that right may be assigned. The law in that respect has not been altered. An assignee where an assignment is valid according to the rules of law as they formerly existed, may maintain an action in his own name, but when a cause of action is a simple tort, and for a special injury to the person, it is not more assignable under the Code than it was under the laws that formerly prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Judgment, therefore, must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
