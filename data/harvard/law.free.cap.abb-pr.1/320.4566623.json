The amount of the judgment as stated in the affidavit, is five hundred and eleven dollars. It <em>must </em>be for twenty-five dollars, exclusive of costs, because the plaintiff could have recovered no costs unless he recovered at least fifty dollars. The allegation that that judgment is for twenty-five dollars, exclusive of costs, was therefore unnecessary in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In the District Court, the costs are limited to five dollars. Here the amount of the judgment is stated to be thirty-three dollars and upwards, so that it <em>must </em>have been for twenty-five dollars, exclusive of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The examination proceeded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
