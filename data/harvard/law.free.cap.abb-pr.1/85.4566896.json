J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The complaint was amended under \u00a7 172 of the Code. The motion is made on the ground, that under that section a plaintiff cannot amend, by adding a new and distinct cause of action. Thence <em>is </em>no such <em>restriction imposed </em>by that section of the Code. The only limitation upon the right to amend, on the nature of the amendments to be made is, that it shall not be done for the purpose of delay, nor under such circumstances as to prevent a trial at a \u201c term for which the cause is, or may, be noticed.\u201d Neither of these objections are alleged to exist. Under the rules and practice of the courts, as they existed prior to the Code, a party, on amending as a matter of course, could add new counts or pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Supreme Court.
