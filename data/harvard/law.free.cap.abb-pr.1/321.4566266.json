It merely set forth in the usual form the indebtedness of defendant for work, labor and materials furnished. The defendant moved to set it aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-12\">Bellows, for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax2t\">As the complaint is regular upon its face, we could not demur. We therefore move to set it aside. The notice is equivalent to a summons, and according to the former practice, if the complaint did not agree with the summons, it would be set aside. Here the summons or notice is for the foreclosure of a lien; but the complaint says nothing about any lien.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Waite, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aot\">We are not bound to state in our complaint that proceedings have been instituted to enforce a lien.

The plaintiff claims, by virtue of his contract, to enforce a lien upon the building, and the peculiar nature of that claim should appear by the complaint. This is essential to the judgment which he seeks, or rather to the right claimed by him, to enforce his lien by execution against the specific building.'</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Plaintiff had liberty to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
