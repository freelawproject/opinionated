J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGjC\">During a robbery committed late at night in the lighted parking lot of an apartment complex, defendant Jerome Joshua Monjaras told the female victim, \u201cBitch, give me your purse.\u201d He then pulled up his shirt and displayed the handle of a black pistol tucked in his waistband. After the victim turned over her wallet, defendant\u2019s accomplice pressed something against the victim\u2019s back and took her purse from her shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">A jury convicted defendant of robbery and found he personally used a firearm within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.53, subdivision (b), which applies to \u201cany device, designed to be used as a weapon, from which is expelled through a barrel, a projectile by the force of any explosion or other form of combustion.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12001, subd. (b); farther section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.) He received a term of 10 years for the firearm use enhancement, consecutive to the term imposed for the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>On appeal, defendant raises a contention that we thought had been put to rest but has resurfaced in a number of appeals before this court. Pointing out that the victim could not say whether the pistol in defendant\u2019s waistband was a gun or a toy, and making the dubious assertion that he \u201cdid not undertake any behavior suggesting that he would fire the weapon,\u201d defendant argues the \u201cpersonal use allegation under section 12022.53, subdivision (b), was sustained merely on conjecture about the nature of the alleged weapon.\u201d Stated another way, he claims \u201cthere was no evidence of a gun presented to the jury to support an inference the weapon was real\u201d and, thus, the firearm use enhancement must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">Defendant was not engaged in a childhood game of cops and robbers; the robbery was real, and the evidence supports a reasonable inference that the pistol he used was a real firearm, not a toy. Our point in publishing this opinion is to say in no uncertain terms that a moribund claim like that raised by defendant has breathed its last breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">Section 12022.53, subdivision (b) provides that \u201cany person who, in the commission of a felony specified in subdivision (a) [including robbery], personally uses a firearm, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 10 years. The firearm need not be operable or loaded for this enhancement to apply.\u201d As used in that section, \u201c \u2018firearm\u2019 means any device, designed to be used as a weapon, from which is expelled through a barrel, a projectile by the force of any explosion or other form of combustion.\u201d (\u00a7 12001, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">Thus, toy guns obviously do not qualify as a \u201cfirearm,\u201d nor do pellet guns or BB guns because, instead of explosion or other combustion, they use the force of air pressure, gas pressure, or spring action to expel a projectile. (\u00a7 12001, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">The fact that an object used by a robber was a \u201cfirearm\u201d can be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. (See <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>Cal.4th 1, 11-12 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lochtefeld </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 533, 541 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 778]; <em>People v. Dominguez </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 410, 421 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Most often, circumstantial evidence alone is used to prove the object was a firearm. This is so because when faced with what appears to be a gun, displayed with an explicit or implicit threat to use it, few victims have the composure and opportunity to closely examine the object; and in any event, victims often lack expertise to tell whether it is a real firearm or an imitation. And since the use of what appears to be a gun is such an effective way to persuade a person to part with personal property without the robber being caught in the act or soon thereafter, the object itself is usually not recovered by investigating officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a finding that an object used by a robber was a firearm. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 514, 516-517 &amp; fn. 1 [212 Cal.Rptr. 451] [although the victim did not see the weapon, the fact that one of two culprits put a cold object to the victim\u2019s head after threatening to shoot her baby was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the culprit, later found with bullets in his pocket, personally used a firearm in robbing and raping the victim]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 396 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1] [inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence are sufficient to support a conviction]; <em>People v. Bloom </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1194, 1208 [259 Cal.Rptr. 669, 774 P.2d 698] [\u201ccircumstantial evidence is as sufficient as direct evidence to support a conviction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Here, defendant demanded of the female victim, \u201cBitch, give me your purse,\u201d then pulled up his shirt and displayed the handle of a black pistol tucked in his waistband. The victim, who had seen guns before but had never handled one, testified she immediately saw that the pistol looked like a gun, and it made her scared. She \u201cassumed\u201d the pistol was \u201creal\u201d and handed over her pocketbook. When asked by defendant\u2019s trial attorney what the pistol was made of, the victim said: \u201cProbably metal because\u2014I don\u2019t know. Wasn\u2019t wood, wasn\u2019t plastic. I don\u2019t know if it was plastic or metal. ... He don\u2019t show it to me. He just do \u2018this\u2019 to me [pulled up his shirt and displayed the pistol].\u201d The victim then conceded that she could not say for certain whether it was \u201ca toy or real or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">The jury was not required to give defendant the benefit of the victim\u2019s inability to say conclusively the pistol was a real firearm. This is so because \u201cdefendant\u2019s own words and conduct in the course of an offense may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>support a rational fact finder\u2019s determination that he used a [firearm].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 13.) Indeed, even though for purposes of section 12022.53, subdivision (b), a firearm need not be loaded or even operable, \u201cwords and actions, in both verbally threatening and in displaying and aiming [a] gun at others, [can] fully support[] the jury\u2019s determination the gun was sufficiently operable [and loaded].\u201d <em>(People v. Lochtefeld, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) Accordingly, jurors \u201cmay draw an inference from the circumstances surrounding the robbery that the gun was not a toy.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518, 533 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265] (hereafter <em>Aranda).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Common sense and common experience illustrate that little has changed since 1927, when a court astutely observed that criminals \u201cdo not usually arm themselves with unloaded guns when they go out to commit robberies\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1927) 87 Cal.App. 634, 635-636 [262 P. 50]). If anything, with the proliferation of handguns in America since 1927, robbery has become a more dangerous crime today because of the greater likelihood that victims will protect themselves by using deadly force against the robber. Consequently, it is all the more unlikely today that robbers use toy guns or unloaded or inoperable weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">As the old saying goes, \u201cif it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck.\u201d The pistol tucked into defendant\u2019s waistband looked like a firearm, and it in effect communicated that it was a firearm when defendant menacingly displayed it and ordered the victim to give him her purse. While it is conceivable that the pistol was a toy, the jury was entitled to take defendant at his word, so to speak, and infer from his conduct that the pistol was a real, loaded firearm and that he was prepared to shoot the victim with it if she did not comply with his demand. (See <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 532, 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Simply stated, when as here a defendant commits a robbery by displaying an object that looks like a gun, the object\u2019s appearance and the defendant\u2019s conduct and words in using it may constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding that it was a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b). In other words, the victim\u2019s inability to say conclusively that the gun was real and not a toy does not create a reasonable doubt, as a matter of law, that the gun was a firearm. (See <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>Cal.2d at pp. 532-533 [\u201cTestimony by witnesses who state that they saw what looked like a gun, even if they cannot identify the type or caliber, will suffice\u201d to prove \u201cthe gun was not a toy\u201d].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">The judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect that the trial court imposed and stayed a restitution fine of $200, not $420 (\u00a7 1202.45), and to send a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Nicholson, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 2008, S166445.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1200-6\"> Defendant believes that <em>Aranda </em>helps not hurts his position. In his counsel\u2019s words, <em>Aranda </em>\u201cstrongly suggests that there was insufficient evidence on which to base the jury finding [that the pistol used by defendant was a real firearm].\u201d This is so, he argues, because although <em>Aranda </em>held the circumstances of a robbery will support an inference that the \u201cgun was not a toy,\u201d the court went on to say \u201ctestimony to the effect that the defendant was flourishing the pistol or pointing it at the victim and was using threatening words or conduct indicating that he intended to fire it if his demands were not met would be evidence from which the inference [the gun was not a toy] could be drawn.\u201d <em>(Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 533.) Such was not the case here, defendant asserts, because he \u201cdid not brandish the alleged weapon, did not point it at [the victim], [and] did not undertake any behavior suggesting that he would fire the weapon.\u201d This viewing of the facts through rose-colored glasses ignores the powerful message sent by a robber who simply lifts his shirt to let the victim know he has a gun. Only the most foolhardy victim would demand to be looking down the barrel before understanding that the robber who displays a gun intends to use it if necessary to get the goods. In any event, the passage from <em>Aranda </em>that defendant quotes cannot be read to establish a minimum standard of threatening conduct from which a jury can infer a gun is real.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Also unhelpful to defendant is another case upon which he relies, <em>People v. Brookins </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1297 [264 Cal.Rptr. 240], which addressed whether Brookins\u2019s prior armed robbery conviction and his new offense made him an habitual offender within the meaning of section 667.7, subdivision (a). (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 1300.) To do so, the prior conviction had to be for robbery \u201cinvolving the use of force or a deadly weapon\u201d (\u00a7 667.7, subd. (a)), which required proof that the firearm he used in the robbery was loaded or was used as a bludgeon. (215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1300, 1304\u20141308.) The sole evidence introduced on the point was the abstract of judgment and other documents \u201cshowing only that [he] was convicted of robbery while personally using a firearm\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 1300); <em>Brookins </em>held that this was insufficient because it \u201cprovided no proof the firearm was either loaded or used as a bludgeon.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1305.) Defendant\u2019s effort to equate his case to <em>Brookins </em>fails. To qualify as a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b), the gun used by defendant did not have to be loaded or used as a bludgeon; it just had to be a real gun. Evidence of the nature of defendant\u2019s words and conduct in displaying the pistol was sufficient to establish that it was real, not a toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">And contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, <em>People v. Dixon </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 985 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 637] does not suggest there was no evidence in this case \u201cabout the true nature of a suspected weapon.\u201d There, as here, the guns used in the robbery were not recovered and witnesses were unfamiliar with guns and could say only that the robbers had what appeared to be guns. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1001.) However, unlike here, \u201c[t]here was evidence that the guns were BB guns or pellet guns and not real firearms.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 989.) Thus, the case is distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1432.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
