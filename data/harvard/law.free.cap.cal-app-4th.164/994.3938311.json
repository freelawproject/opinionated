We reject defendant\u2019s contentions and will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">A.G. and defendant had been married to each other for 11 years; during the last three years they were separated. After their separation, A.G. moved to Sacramento with the children in February 2006, leaving defendant behind and not telling him where she was going. Nonetheless, defendant found her and arrived in Sacramento in May or June 2006. In September 2006, A.G. was again living with defendant and their two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">About 9:00 a.m. on September 21, 2006, A.G. and defendant argued about defendant\u2019s lack of employment. A.G. told defendant that their relationship was not working and he needed to move out. A.G.\u2019s testimony about what happened next differed from her earlier statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">At trial, A.G. testified that defendant asked her not to evict him, grabbing her upper arms and pushing her in the back with one hand. She did not fall down but instead threw herself to the ground so he would get scared and leave, thinking she was going to call the police. He agreed to leave but she changed her mind and did not want him to leave because he had no place to go and would end up using drugs, so she tried to call the police to report that he hit her. She used her cell phone but defendant took it and broke it. Angry, she broke the phone more. She went to the bedroom. Defendant followed A.G. into the bedroom where they had consensual sex. At first, she did not want to have sex. After he asked for forgiveness and she forgave him, they had consensual sex. She described the sex as gentle. About noon, A.G. left defendant in their apartment and ran to the complex office where she called the police. She was crying. The 911 tape was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">A.G. admitted that she had previously reported the following to the police. Defendant threw her to the floor and hit her in the face two times with his fist. He took his belt off, made a loop with it and threatened to strangle her with it. He took her cell phone and broke it, preventing her from calling the police. He also threatened to stab her to death with a knife if she called the police. He placed a towel over her nose and mouth and pulled her underpants down. She pleaded with him to stop, telling him she did not want to have sexual intercourse, and tried to push him off. He bit her hand. She continued to struggle but he penetrated her vagina with his penis and ejaculated. She went to the bathroom. Defendant made her return to the bedroom and stay for about an hour and then told her he would leave. She called 911 from the apartment office, reporting that she could not use her cell phone because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>defendant had broken it, that he had hit her, thrown her to the floor, struck her in the head, forced her to have sexual intercourse, and locked her up in a room.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">At trial, A.G. denied that defendant hit her, threatened to kill her or her sister, or threatened to stab her. A.G. explained away her scratches on her hand as caused by cleaning. Although defendant bit her on the hand and back, he had done so before during sex. She bit herself on the inside of her lip and her ear injury was an old one. She had no explanation for the bruise over her right eye. She had a fingernail mark on her nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">A.G. claimed at trial that defendant had pushed her, but only once, days before the incident on September 21. She denied that he had beaten her three years before and had threatened to hurt her if she called the police. A.G. admitted at trial that she told Ann Tran on September 26, five days after the current incident, that defendant had a history of domestic violence, and that A.G. was afraid defendant might hurt family members if released from jail. She admitted she told Tran that defendant hit her, threw her on the bed, covered her mouth with a towel and raped her, and that three years before, defendant had beaten her and threatened to hurt her if she reported it.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">At trial, A.G. admitted that when she was examined at a hospital, she told a nurse practitioner and a domestic violence advocate who was present that defendant had threatened to hit her with a belt and to cut her up with a knife and threatened to kill her and her sister. She also admitted that defendant punched A.G. in the face, dragged her by her hair, grabbed her by her arms and wrists, pinched her lips together to keep her quiet, put a towel over her nose and mouth, broke her cell phone and forced her to have sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">About 2:00 p.m. on September 21, 2006, the apartment complex\u2019s security guard, Jose Hernandez, went to the complex office and saw A.G. She was crying. She needed an interpreter when the police arrived. She told Hernandez that she had a domestic violence problem at home. At trial, A.G. denied discussing the September 21 incident with the complex\u2019s security guard prior to the arrival of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">When Sacramento Deputy Sheriff Kenny Lee arrived at the apartment complex office, Hernandez interpreted for Lee and A.G. A.G. had bruising and redness on her forehead, scratches on her nose and back, redness on the inside of her leg, abrasions on her elbow and wrist and a bite mark on her hand. At her apartment, A.G. showed the officer the belt in the bathroom and broken cell phone pieces. A.G. told the officer that she was married to defendant, that they had moved from Mexico, and that she had moved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>previous year to Sacramento from the Bay Area to get away from defendant and did not tell him she was moving. Defendant found her three months before the September 21 incident and she let him move in provided that he obtain employment and assist around the house. On September 21, they argued because he had done neither and she told him to move out. She then recounted the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The sexual assault examination revealed nonmotile sperm in A.G.\u2019s vagina which was consistent with a sexual assault earlier in the day and a small tear in A.G.\u2019s vaginal opening which was a new injury and very unusual for someone who does not report a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">When interviewed by detectives on September 25, 2006, defendant admitted that he had argued with A.G., broke her cell phone because she was going to call the police, bit her hand and her back, and hit her once with the belt. He admitted he grabbed her, taking her to bed where they had sexual intercourse even though she said no. He claimed that she liked him to bite her. He also claimed that he had been using \u201ccrystal\u201d the day of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">On October 11, 2006, defendant\u2019s telephone call from jail to a woman named \u201cSonia\u201d was monitored. He stated that the sexual abuse charge was \u201cscrewing\u201d him up and if \u201cshe take[s] off the charges\u201d he would not bother A.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">On December 20, 2006, defendant\u2019s telephone call from jail was monitored. He claimed he received a letter and \u201cshe says that. . . she\u2019ll help me. That I tell her how. That she was told that she can\u2019t take away the charges.\u201d Defendant said she could help him by \u201cnot appearing at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">On February 5, 2007, Sonia Orozco-Gutierrez visited defendant at the jail. Defendant told her that \u201cif they don\u2019t . . . find her this time the case will close\u201d and \u201cthe case closes if\u2014if she doesn\u2019t appear.\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">Defendant first contends that the trial court prejudicially erred in excluding defense expert testimony on marital relationships and sex. We conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">Prior to presentation of defense evidence, defense counsel sought to call Deborah Davis as an expert and the trial court conducted an Evidence Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>section 402 hearing at the prosecutor\u2019s request. Davis was a psychology professor at the University of Nevada and had taught psychology classes for 34 years. She had taught seminars pertaining to romantic relationships for 16 years, which included the topic of handling conflict. She had also published research on sex in relationships, which included research on rape and consent. She also owned Sierra Trial and Opinion Consultants, a corporation. Defense counsel offered Davis as an expert on marital relations and sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The prosecutor questioned Davis. Davis admitted that she had never qualified to testify in court on the topic of marital relations and sex; she had \u201cnever been asked to serve as one.\u201d She had served as a consultant on the topic in a civil case and three criminal cases, all for the defense. She had previously qualified as an expert on the topic of eyewitness accuracy and interrogations and confessions, each time for the defense. With respect to the current case, Davis had reviewed the preliminary hearing transcript and defendant\u2019s statement to the police. She planned to testify about couples, conflict and sex, and the theory colloquially referred to as \u201cmake-up sex,\u201d which she described as a \u201cphenomena of sex being more arousing after a fight in some circumstances,\u201d as a pattern of behavior and why it occurs. She explained that the make-up sex in literature was \u201cinvestigated\u201d under other theories, that is, \u201cattachment theory, excitation transfer theory, and so on.\u201d She planned to inform the jury about things they did not know in order to come to their own conclusions, \u201cnot to come to a conclusion [herself].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Defense counsel argued Davis\u2019s opinion was relevant to the issue of consent and defendant and A.G.\u2019s pattern of interaction. Defense counsel planned to ask Davis a hypothetical question about make-up sex. The prosecutor opposed Davis\u2019s testimony arguing that it was not outside the scope of common knowledge and experience and that Davis lacked expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The trial court precluded the testimony, finding that the testimony would not assist the jury \u201cin any way,\u201d that Davis\u2019s proffered testimony was not beyond the jury\u2019s common experience and not relevant to any defense since Davis stated that she was not reaching a conclusion herself and that her general testimony would not address the issue of whether defendant actually and reasonably believed that A.G. consented. The court noted that Davis had never qualified as an expert in marital relations and sex, commenting that it was \u201cprobably because\u201d the testimony \u201csimply would not assist the trier of fact and/or it\u2019s not necessarily beyond the common experience of the jurors.\u201d The court also noted that Davis had never interviewed defendant or A.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Davis\u2019s proffered testimony. Defendant claims the trial court\u2019s erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>ruling also violated his right to due process and to present a defense. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15; <em>In re Martin </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 1, 29-30 [241 Cal.Rptr. 263, 744 P.2d 374]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 521, 536 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 181].) Defendant argues that Davis was fully qualified to testify as an expert on the topics of marital relations and sex and her testimony was relevant to consent. With respect to Davis\u2019s qualifications, defendant asserts that it was undisputed that she had extensive experience. Citing <em>McCleery </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1059 [216 Cal.Rptr. 852], defendant claims that the practice should not be to exclude for lack of prior testimony because there would never be any experts. With respect to the relevance of Davis\u2019s testimony, defendant cites nothing on point but argues Davis\u2019s testimony on \u201cmake-up\u201d sex would \u201cdisabuse jurors regarding misconceptions about the likelihood of consensual sexual relations immediately after a heated and physical argument.\u201d Citing <em>People v. Wells </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 179 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 762], he claims such testimony is analogous to expert testimony on child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (CSAAS). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 186.) We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\u201cA person is qualified to testify as an expert if he has special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on the subject to which his testimony relates. . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 720, subd. (a).) Expert opinion is appropriate if it is \u201c(a) [r]elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact; and [][] (b) [b]ased on matter (including his special knowledge ...)... that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject. . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">A trial court\u2019s determination as to whether an expert should be allowed to opine about a particular subject is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Catlin </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 131 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 26 P.3d 357]; <em>People v. Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 766 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Manriquez </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1492 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">CSAAS cases involve expert testimony regarding the responses of a child molestation victim. Expert testimony on the common reactions of a child molestation victim is not admissible to prove the sex crime charged actually occurred. However, CSAAS testimony \u201cis admissible to rehabilitate [the molestation victim\u2019s] credibility when the defendant suggests that the child\u2019s conduct after the incident\u2014e.g., a delay in reporting\u2014is inconsistent with his or her testimony claiming molestation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. McAlpin </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1300-1301 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>563].) \u201c \u2018Such expert testimony is needed to disabuse jurors of commonly held misconceptions about child sexual abuse, and to explain the emotional antecedents of abused children\u2019s seemingly self-impeaching behavior. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1301.) \u201cFor instance, where a child delays a significant period of time before reporting an incident or pattern of abuse, an expert could testify that such delayed reporting is not inconsistent with the secretive environment often created by an abuser who occupies a position of trust. Where an alleged victim recants his story in whole or in part, a psychologist could testify on the basis of past research that such behavior is not an uncommon response for an abused child who is seeking to remove himself or herself from the pressure created by police investigations and subsequent court proceedings. In the typical criminal case, however, it is the People\u2019s burden to identify the myth or misconception the evidence is designed to rebut. Where there is no danger of jury confusion, there is simply no need for the expert testimony. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Bowker </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 385, 394 [249 Cal.Rptr. 886].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that Davis\u2019s testimony is akin to CSAAS testimony. First, the evidence was not proffered to rehabilitate the complaining witness; it was offered to explain her consent and to bolster her recantation at trial. Second, the proffered evidence did not relate to any behavior of the complaining witness, subsequent to the criminal conduct, that was inconsistent with the crime. Finally, the defense identified no myth or misconception held by the jury that needed to be addressed. Defense counsel\u2019s argument was simply that not everyone may be aware of make-up sex. As the Attorney General argues, the concept of \u201cmake-up\u201d sex was within the common knowledge and experience of the jurors, was not relevant to the issue of consent and would not have assisted the jury on the issue of consent. We conclude the proffered expert testimony would not have assisted the jury in understanding the concept of make-up consensual sex. Nor would it have assisted the jury in determining the complaining witness\u2019s credibility\u2014the primary issue at trial. There was simply no need for expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>The trial court\u2019s statement that Davis had never qualified before to testify on marital relations and sex, particularly make-up sex, was simply part of the trial court\u2019s observation that the testimony would not assist the trier of fact. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Davis\u2019s testimony. Defendant\u2019s constitutional claims likewise lack merit for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">n.iv.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Scotland, P.
