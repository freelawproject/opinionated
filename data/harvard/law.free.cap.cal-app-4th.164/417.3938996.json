Schwartz, as trustee of the Lawson Revocable Trust (the Trust), appeals from various orders of the probate court suspending most of his powers and appointing Frumeh Labow as \u201cinterim trustee,\u201d and ordering him to turn over all Trust documents and books to Labow. He contends that, in the absence of a proper petition before it, the court had no jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>issue these orders. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that appellant\u2019s petition for approval of his account under Probate Code section 17200, subdivision (b)(5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> invoked the court\u2019s inherent equity power to suspend certain of appellant\u2019s powers as trustee for perceived breaches of trust pending a full hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">1. <em>The Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Louis W. and Sylvia Lawson, now deceased, established the Trust in November 1995. The beneficiaries are the three adult children of the now deceased trustors. Cheryl Lawson (Cheryl) is one of the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The total value of the Trust\u2019s assets on hand as of May 24, 2003, was $2,104,780.63. Of that, $74,780.63 was cash held by the trustee. The Trust\u2019s largest asset was the family residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The settlors served as trustees until they became conservatees in May 2003. Appellant succeeded the trustors as the sole trustee. In January 2003, appellant drafted the Trust\u2019s sole amendment and restatement. In August 2003, the probate court appointed Lionel B. Sanders, certified public accountant, conservator of Sylvia\u2019s and Louis\u2019s estates in the related conservatorships.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">2. <em>The civil action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">One of the Trust\u2019s assets was title to an undivided one-half interest in real property in Santa Barbara, California. Beneficiary Cheryl held the other one-half interest. In May 2003, Louis and Sylvia executed a quitclaim deed conveying the Tmst\u2019s interest in that property to Cheryl. Cheryl then filed a complaint against the Trust to quiet title in Santa Barbara Superior Court. According to appellant in his later filed account, Cheryl\u2019s litigation style drove up the cost to the Trust of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">As a solution to the cost problem, appellant proposed filing an elder abuse action (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15600 et seq.) against Cheryl to \u201cpermit the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d from her. Although conservator Sanders opposed filing such a lawsuit for more than six months because of the health of the senior Lawsons, he eventually acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Accordingly, for the express purpose of obtaining a recovery of attorney fees, appellant and conservator Sanders sued Cheryl alleging elder abuse (the civil action).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In July 2005, after the case was removed to Los Angeles County, the trial court in the civil action entered judgment in favor of appellant and conservator Sanders and against Cheryl in the amount of $683,769.83, plus yet-to-be-fixed costs and fees. Cheryl appealed from the judgment and so it is not final. Cheryl also filed for bankruptcy court protection under chapter 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">3. <em>The trustee\u2019s account</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">On August 25, 2005, appellant filed his first account, seeking approval of his actions and requesting trustee\u2019s fees pursuant to section 17200, subdivision (b)(5) and (9). Appellant\u2019s supplement to the account, dated September 16, 2005, focused on the litigation against Cheryl. Appellant\u2019s account showed that the value of the Trust assets at the end of the accounting period was $1,376,587.78, of which $731,847.83 was the as-of-yet-uncollected judgment against Cheryl, and $5,222.10 was cash. The trustee had encumbered and then sold the senior Lawsons\u2019 residence to pay the \u201cexpense of the litigation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">4. <em>The suspension of the trustee\u2019s powers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Verified objections to appellant\u2019s account were filed by Labow as conservator of the persons of Louis and Sylvia Lawson, conservator Sanders, and the probate volunteer panel attorney for the senior Lawsons. Each objector requested that appellant be immediately suspended and surcharged, and Labow requested that she be appointed interim trustee until the court ruled on appellant\u2019s account. Among the bases for the objections was that appellant had spent the trust\u2019s assets on trustee\u2019s and attorney fees leaving insufficient money for the level of care the senior Lawsons deserved. Conservator Sanders explained how, according to the account, appellant spent $1,271,593.40 on attorney and trustee\u2019s fees and requested appellant be required to justify spending that sum to pursue a judgment of $683,769.83 where the likelihood of recovering those fees in addition to the judgment was \u201cextremely low.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The probate court\u2019s notes indicated its concerns about appellant\u2019s account. The notes questioned the authority for appellant to borrow money to finance the lawsuit. They also asked what the legal services were to justify the fees paid, and whether those services benefitted the estate. The notes stated, \u201cNotwithstanding terms of tr[ust] re h[ou]rly rate of t[rust]ee, who is an att[ome]y, <em>fees appear outrageous considering size of tr[ust] estate </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">a. <em>The order of October 17, 2005</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">At the hearing on the petition to settle the account held on October 17, 2005, the objectors pressed their arguments. Appellant countered, among other things, that a motion for fees against Cheryl in the civil action was pending and only he and his attorney had the information and ability to pursue that motion. After hearing these arguments, the court suspended appellant as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then responded by broaching a proposal discussed by the parties under which the court would carve out of any suspension order the power to pursue the fee motion in the civil action on behalf of the trust. Appellant\u2019s counsel found the \u201ccarve out\u201d to be \u201cintriguing].\u201d The court asked the parties whether they would like to discuss a \u201ccarve out\u201d outside the courtroom. Although the conservator was doubtful, appellant\u2019s counsel agreed. The court ordered the parties to discuss a \u201ccarve out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">b. <em>The order of November 17, 2005</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">By the November 17, 2005 hearing, the parties had reached an agreement about the \u201ccarve out\u201d raised in court by appellant\u2019s attorney. Appellant stipulated, among other things, that Labow would be appointed successor trustee under <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1124 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 947 P.2d 279] (Moeller) and <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 201 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 716, 990 P.2d 591] (Boltwood). The probate court vacated its previous orders suspending appellant, nunc pro tunc, to October 17, 2005, and reinstated appellant <em>but limited his powers to seeking the attorney and trustee\u2019s fees in the civil action, at no cost to the Trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The court issued its order on March 30, 2006, reflecting its ruling, inter aha, that appellant would remain trustee with powers limited <em>solely </em>to the completion, at his own cost, of the pending fee matter in the civil action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>court specified that appellant would have no power to file any motions or engage in any other activity in the bankruptcy court with regard to Cheryl\u2019s bankruptcy, and would have no power to seek enforcement of the judgment in the civil action. The court ordered appellant to serve on Labow all documents filed by him or served upon him by Cheryl in the civil action, and ruled that Labow, as temporary trustee, was entitled to obtain copies of all future communications between appellant and his attorney with respect to the civil action only. Appellant appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">c. <em>The orders of January 19, 2006, and May 22, 2006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The court ordered appellant on January 19, 2006, to turn over all personal property of the senior Lawsons to the successor trustee and to clear the probate court\u2019s notes by the next hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On May 22, 2006, Labow, as successor trustee, argued that appellant was refusing to turn documents over to her on the ground she was only an interim trustee. The court ordered that Labow be successor trustee \u201cforthwith.\u201d The court ordered appellant to hand over all books and records of the Trust to Labow\u2019s attorney and to transfer all privilege issues to Labow. Appellant appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">d. <em>The order of July 24, 2006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On July 17, 2006, Labow, as interim trustee, petitioned the probate court under section 17200, subdivision (b)(10) to remove appellant as trustee for all purposes for appellant\u2019s refusal to comply with previous court orders to turn the Trust documents over to her. As appellant had been insisting that he was not suspended and that Labow was not an interim trustee, on July 19, 2006, Labow applied ex parte for an order under section 15642, subdivision (e) to <em>suspend </em>appellant\u2019s remaining powers and compel him to surrender all Trust property, including documents subject to the attorney-client and work-product privileges, pending the court\u2019s order on the removal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">On July 24, 2006, the probate court issued an order finding that the suspension of appellant had been warranted. The court stated that it had suspended appellant\u2019s powers on October 17, 2005, for asserted breaches of duty, including paying himself and his attorneys approximately $1.3 million of Trust funds to obtain a judgment of around $700,000 in the civil action without probate court order and without filing a fee petition. It was likely that the judgment against Cheryl would be only partially collectible, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>found. After appellant was suspended, the court found, Labow stipulated to an order at appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s urging, appointing appellant as trustee with limited powers to pursue the fee motion in the civil action. This order was based on the express condition that Labow would hold the attorney-client privilege for appellant\u2019s acts concerning those fees and the privilege for all actions taken before his suspension. However, appellant refused to turn over the Trust property and records, claiming privilege and asserting that Labow was only an interim trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Based on these facts, the probate court suspended appellant, effective \u201cforthwith\u201d; ordered Labow to succeed immediately to appellant\u2019s position in the civil action; and granted Labow authority to do all that was necessary to protect the Trust. The court directed appellant to turn over to Labow all Trust files, records, and books, irrespective of attorney-client privilege. The court scheduled a hearing on the removal petition for September 11, 2006. Appellant appealed from that order and we consolidated the three appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">1. <em>The probate court had jurisdiction in November 2005 to suspend appellant\u2019s trustee\u2019s powers </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Appellant contends, in the absence of the procedural prerequisite of a petition for removal, that the probate court had no jurisdiction to suspend or limit his powers, appoint Labow as interim<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or successor trustee, or to order him to turn Trust documents over to Labow before July 2006, when it received the first petition for removal under section 15642, subdivision (e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>He observes that sections 17200<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8(petition for removal of trustee), 17206<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (petition to take action), and 15642, subdivision (e)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (petition for suspension of trustee), all contemplate that a petition for removal be filed before the court can remove, suspend, or appoint a trustee, and no such petition was before the probate court in October or November 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The question of jurisdiction here does not involve the probate court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. The probate court\u2019s general jurisdiction encompasses \u201cthe internal affairs of trusts\u201d and \u201c[ojther actions and proceedings involving <em>trustees </em>. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 17000, subds. (a), (b)(3), italics added.) Rather, we are concerned with jurisdiction in the sense of the court\u2019s power or authority to act. (See <em>Conservatorship of O\u2019Connor </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1087 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 386], disapproved on another point in <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>RRL Corp. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 261, 280 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 807, 27 P.3d 702].) \u201cLack of jurisdiction in its most fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942].) \u201cBut in its ordinary usage the phrase \u2018lack of jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d is also employed \u201cwhere, though the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in the fundamental sense, it has no \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 (or power) to act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>Law Offices of Stanley J. Bell </em>v. <em>Shine, Browne &amp; Diamond </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1022 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 717] <em>(Bell).) </em>The question presented here involves the latter form of jurisdiction, i.e., whether the probate court, having fundamental subject matter jurisdiction, acted in excess thereof in ordering appellant\u2019s suspension, without the prerequisite of a petition for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The probate court has general power and duty to supervise the administration of trusts. Proceedings in the probate court \u201cconcerning the internal affairs of the trust\u201d are commenced with the filing of a petition. (\u00a7\u00a7 17201, 17200, subd. (a); Ross, Cal. Practice Guide: Probate (The Rutter Group 2007) <em>f </em>2:116.20, p. 2-76.13.) Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, such a petition was filed here: <em>appellant\u2019s own </em>\u201cFirst Account Current &amp; Report of Trustee, and Petition for: 1. Approval of Acts of Trustee; and 2. Approval of Trustee\u2019s Fees\u201d <em>pursuant to section 17200, subdivision (b)(5) </em>and (9). Although appellant is correct that the petition was not one for removal (\u00a7 17200, subd. (b)(10)), or suspension pending removal (\u00a7 15642, subd. (e)), the petition was filed under section 17200, subdivision (b)(5) which asked the court not only to approve his account, but also <em>to pass upon his acts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Presented with a section 17200 petition to settle an account, \u201cthe probate court has a duty <em>imposed by law </em>to inquire into the prudence of the trustee\u2019s administration.\u201d <em>(Lazzarone v. Bank of America </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 581, 594 &amp; fn. 10 [226 Cal.Rptr. 855], citing <em>McLellan </em>v. <em>McLellan </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 552 [110 P.2d 1034] &amp; <em>Carr v. Bank of America etc. Assn. </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 366 [79 P.2d 1096].) Appellant\u2019s petition to settle his account under section 17200 activated the probate court\u2019s duty and authority to scrutinize appellant\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">To preserve the trust and to respond to perceived breaches of trust, the probate court has wide, express powers to \u201cmake any orders and take any other action necessary or proper to dispose of the matters presented\u201d by the section 17200 petition. (\u00a7 17206.) Among the remedies in the probate court\u2019s arsenal is the express power to remove a trustee on its own motion, <em>without a petition </em>(\u00a7 15642, subd. (a); see 3 Gillick et al., Cal. Civil Practice: Probate &amp; Trust Proceedings (1992) Remedies (2005 supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 24:96, pp. 24-102 to 24-105 &amp; 24:47, p. 24-60), along with the express authority to suspend a trustee pending a hearing on a petition for the trustee\u2019s removal. (\u00a7 15642, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">More important, the probate court has the <em>\u201cinherent power </em>to decide all incidental issues necessary to carry out its express powers to supervise the administration of the trust.\u201d <em>(Estate of Heggstad </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 943, 951 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 433], italics added.) This inherent equitable power of the probate court has long been recognized to encompass the authority to take remedial action. \u201cUnder California trust law, a court can intervene to prevent or rectify abuses of a trustee\u2019s powers. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 599, 604 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 653].) And, where a probate court has the express authority to remove a trustee sua sponte (\u00a7 15642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>subd. (a)), it necessarily has the inherent equitable power to employ the less extreme remedy of suspending most of the trustee\u2019s powers and appointing an interim trustee pending a hearing. <em>(Getty </em>v. <em>Getty </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 134, 142 [252 Cal.Rptr. 342] [where probate court has authority in exercise of its general jurisdiction to <em>remove </em>a trustee, it may also, in exercise of inherent equity jurisdiction, take the ancillary step of removing only some of the trustee\u2019s powers and appointing a trustee ad litem].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Here, appellant submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the probate court when he filed his <em>petition under section 17200, subdivision (b)(5) </em>asking the court to settle his account and pass on his acts. His petition triggered the probate court\u2019s duty to scrutinize the prudence of his administration of the Trust. <em>(Lazzarone v. Bank of America, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at p. 594 &amp; fn. 10.) Appellant\u2019s account and supplement, together with the verified objections and supplemental objections from at least three parties requesting that appellant\u2019s powers be suspended and that he be surcharged, raised red flags about appellant\u2019s actions as reflected in appellant\u2019s petition. Equipped with broad, express and inherent powers to take any action necessary to dispose of matters presented by the petition (\u00a7 17206), manifestly the probate court had the jurisdiction (i.e., power) to take the steps it did in October and November 2005 to protect the trust from perceived and threatened abuse by suspending most of appellant\u2019s powers and appointing a successor trustee in accordance with the carve-out stipulation, pending a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Our conclusion \u201cmakes sense as a matter of judicial economy.\u201d <em>(Estate of Heggstad, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 951.) We reject appellant\u2019s implication that a trustee may be removed or suspended only in response to petitions under section 17200, subdivision (b)(10) or section 15642, subdivision (e). (Cf. <em>Estate of Heggstad, supra, </em>at p. 952 [no legal significance that trustee sought relief through petition for instruction under section 17200 rather than for conveyance under section 9860].) \u201cEven if the petition did not fall within the literal provisions of section 17200, subdivision (b), it nevertheless would fall within the general jurisdiction of probate courts under sections 17000 and 17200 for proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust\u201d <em>(Conservatorship of Irvine </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1342-1343 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 587]; cf. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Towse </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 425, 428-429 [249 Cal.Rptr. 622]), or \u201cinvolving trustees\u201d (\u00a7 17000). It would be illogical, in light of the probate court\u2019s authority to remove a trustee sua sponte (\u00a7 15642, subd. (a)), its general jurisdiction, and its inherent equitable powers\u2014 where there is already a section 17200 petition pending\u2014to require the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>to wait for a beneficiary\u2019s petition for removal or suspension pending removal (\u00a7\u00a7 17200, subd. (b)(10), 15642, subd. (e)) before the court could take action to protect the trust from possible injury or loss shown by a trustee\u2019s petition to settle an account. (Cf. <em>Estate of Heggstad, supra, </em>at p. 951 [trustee\u2019s petition for instruction under section 17200, subdivision (b)(1) invokes probate court\u2019s \u201cgeneral jurisdiction to decide the merits of a third party challenge to the inclusion of property in a trust\u201d].) The suggestion that the court may pass on the trustee\u2019s acts under section 17200, subdivision (b)(5), and take any action necessary to dispose of the matters presented by the section 17200 petition (\u00a7 17206), but may not suspend that trustee for those same acts, even where it appears that the trust may be injured, simply ignores the probate court\u2019s extensive, general express, and inherent equity powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We are mindful of appellant\u2019s due process rights. Appellant had the requisite notice of the effort to suspend his powers. Even if the objections were untimely in October 2005 because filed within 30 days of that hearing (\u00a7 17203, subd. (a)), they <em>were not untimely </em>with respect to the November 2005 hearing appealed from. Long before that hearing, appellant had his account and supplement, along with the verified objections and supplemental objections from three parties containing requests to suspend appellant\u2019s powers and surcharge him for enumerated breaches of duty. These various documents all provided appellant with the requisite notice in advance of the November 17, 2005 hearing that the precise issue before the court was his suspension and surcharge. Finally, as the probate court was aware, appellant was entitled to a hearing on his petition for approval of his acts, which hearing was scheduled but postponed because of appellant\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Appellant next argues that the probate court did not receive any evidence or make findings to justify the suspension order. The probate court made findings in July 2006 that reflect its earlier suspension rulings. Respondent\u2019s appendix contains<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s account and supplement, the verified objections, and the probate court\u2019s notes showing the issues the court wanted resolved. These documents provide support for the July 2006 minute order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>which the court found that it had suspended appellant for spending approximately $1.3 million in Trust funds, without court order, to obtain a judgment in the civil action of just under $700,000, which judgment was likely to be only partly collectible. Where the decision to remove a trustee lies within the probate court\u2019s discretion <em>(Estate of Gilmaker </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 627, 633 [21 Cal.Rptr. 585, 371 P.2d 321]), the decision to suspend most of the trustee\u2019s powers likewise falls within the court\u2019s discretion. We cannot say based on the documents it had before it that the court abused its discretion in suspending appellant\u2019s powers pending a hearing on whether he should be fully removed and surcharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In any event, appellant is estopped from appealing from the order in November 2005 restricting his powers as trustee to proceed against Cheryl for fees in the civil action and appointing Labow interim trustee because he stipulated to it. His contention on appeal to the contrary notwithstanding, appellant did not object to the order restricting his authority on November 17, 2005.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On October 17, 2005, <em>his attorney raised the subject of a \u201ccarve out\u201d to limit his power, </em>and on November 17, 2005, <em>he stipulated that his power would be restricted to </em>pursuing the pending fee motion against Cheryl. \u201c[A] party may, by its conduct, be estopped from contesting an action <em>in excess of </em>jurisdiction\u201d <em>(Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1022-1023, italics added) because conduct that is in excess of jurisdiction by a court that has subject matter jurisdiction is voidable not void. <em>(Conservatorship of O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1088.) When, as here, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe court has jurisdiction of the subject, a party who seeks or consents to action [that might be] beyond the court\u2019s power as defined by statute or decisional rule may be estopped to complain of the ensuing action in excess of jurisdiction. [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1092; see <em>Bell, supra, </em>at pp. 1023-1024.) Having suggested the \u201ccarve out\u201d to the probate court and then stipulating to it, appellant is estopped to challenge the ensuing November 2005 suspension order as taken in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">2. As <em>the predecessor trustee, appellant had no right after November 17, 2005, to refuse to turn over original documents pertaining to Trust administration to the successor trustee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Appellant contends he could not be required to turn over Trust documents to a \u201cstranger\u201d to the Trust, i.e., Labow. As trustee, he had a \u201cduty to take reasonable steps under the circumstances to take and keep control of and to preserve the trust property.\u201d (\u00a7 16006.) Appellant argues that, where his efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>to protect the Trust documents were consistent with that duty, he could not be ordered to turn over documents that include attorney-client privilege to a stranger. The contention is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Again, appellant is estopped to challenge the order. <em>(Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1023-1024.) Just as with appellant\u2019s stipulation to the limitation of his powers, at the November 17th hearing, he stipulated that \u201cMiss Lebeau [sic], as I said, would be successor trustee for <em>Moeller </em>and Boltwood.\u201d Where appellant stipulated to Labow\u2019s appointment as successor trustee with the powers and rights under <em>Moeller </em>and <em>Boltwood, </em>he is estopped to challenge any perceived error in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Nor was the successor trustee a \u201cstranger\u201d to the Tmst after November 2005, and certainly after May 2006, when the court declared Labow the successor trustee. When the probate court appoints a successor trustee, that new trustee accedes to the position of the former trustee along with the same powers granted by the trust documents. In <em>Moeller, </em>our Supreme Court held that a predecessor trustee may not assert the attorney-client privilege as to documents reflecting confidential communications between the predecessor and an attorney on trust administration matters to the extent the predecessor trustee was acting in the official capacity as trustee. <em>(Moeller, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 1127, 1134.) The Supreme Court explained: \u201cThe powers of a trustee are not personal to any particular trustee but, rather, are inherent in the office of trustee. It has been the law in California for over a century that a new trustee \u2018succeed[s] to <em>all </em>the rights, duties, and responsibilities of his predecessors.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . \u2018The powers conferred upon a trastee can properly be exercised by his successors, unless it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.\u2019. . . [T]he power to assert the attorney-client privilege follows from the trustee\u2019s power to hire an attorney in order to obtain advice regarding administration of the trust and to litigate to protect trust property. The trustee\u2019s power to assert that privilege thus is certainly essential to its effective administration of the trust. <em>Therefore, when a successor trustee takes office it assumes all of the powers of trustee, including the power to assert the privilege with respect to confidential communications between a predecessor trustee and an attorney on matters of trust administration.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1131, first italics in original, second italics added; accord, <em>Boltwood, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 208-209; see also, 3 Gillick et al., Cal. Civil Practice: Probate &amp; Trust Proceedings, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24:48, pp. 24-61 to 24-63.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>When appellant stipulated on November 17, 2005, to treating Labow as successor trustee, Labow assumed all powers of trustee under the Trust, except for the carved-out power to pursue fees against Cheryl in the civil action. Moreover, pursuant to the stipulation, Moeller, and <em>Boltwood, </em>appellant had no attorney-client privilege with respect to communications about Trust administration, which included the prosecution by the Trust of the civil action against Cheryl. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege was not available to appellant as predecessor trustee to justify his refusal to turn the Trust documents over to Labow as successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">At oral argument, the parties disputed whether a predecessor trustee had the obligation to surrender <em>original </em>Trust documents to a successor trustee. As of the November 2005 and certainly the May 2006 orders that appellant turn over all books and records of the Trust to Labow and transfer \u00bf11 privilege issues to her, appellant, as predecessor trustee, had no justification for retaining <em>any originals. </em>He was obligated to \u201cdeliver the trust property to the successor trustee.\u201d (\u00a7 15644.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Labow had been unequivocally appointed successor trustee assuming most of appellant\u2019s powers (see \u00a7 16420, subd. (a)(4))<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and so, under <em>Moeller, </em>Labow held the attorney-client privilege as to all documents, books, and things involving Trust administration matters. <em>(Moeller, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 1127.) As predecessor trustee, appellant had no right to the Trust papers which means no right to keep the originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">3. <em>No undertaking was paid and sanctions are not appropriate in this case</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.

He further asserts that he has challenged three separate and substantively different orders to turn over trust property, \u201cany one of which can be the occasion for examination of the October 17, 2005, suspension.\u201d We agree with appellant that the November 17, 2005 order was the first appealable one (\u00a7 1300, subd.
