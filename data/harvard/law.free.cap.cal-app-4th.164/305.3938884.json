He contends that (1) the prosecutor improperly used peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors based on race and (2) the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of a handgun owned by the victim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In late 2001, defendant and his wife, Dolores Sanders, separated, after being together 15 years and married six. Sanders moved in with her daughter and son-in-law, Connie and Jerry Johnson, while defendant moved to New Orleans. Several months later, defendant returned from New Orleans and tried to convince Dolores to resume their relationship. She refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Defendant continued in his efforts to resume his relationship with Dolores, calling frequently and going to her home unannounced, all to no effect. In late 2004, defendant\u2019s communications to Dolores became more threatening and irrational. He said he was going to kill himself. Defendant claimed that Jerry was controlling Dolores.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In early 2005, Dolores obtained a restraining order, prohibiting defendant from having contact with her or the others in her household. Nonetheless, defendant continued in his efforts to contact Dolores. Defendant left a voice mail message for Dolores telling her that he loved her and would not hurt her, but that she would \u201cfeel the [ejffects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Jerry normally left for work between 3:30 and 3:45 in the morning. Defendant knew about Jerry\u2019s work schedule. On May 9, 2005, defendant confronted Jerry as Jerry left for work in the early morning and, using a rifle, shot him in the abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Dolores was awakened by the gunshot. She went to the front of the house and found Jerry on the lawn, calling for help. She went outside and Jerry said, referring to defendant who was no longer there, \u201cA1 shot me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Connie, who was sleeping in her room upstairs, was also awakened by a loud boom. She followed Dolores out of the house to where Jerry was lying. When an ambulance arrived, she ran upstairs, changed her clothes, and returned downstairs to accompany Jerry to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">A neighbor, William Pahia, was awakened by yelling on the morning of the shooting. He heard two voices, and one of the voices said, \u201cNo, not that.\u201d He heard a loud gunshot, and then a quieter one that may have been an echo.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Jerry died about two hours after he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Defendant was pulled over in his car about 4:00 a.m., within minutes after the shooting. He had a rifle in the trunk of his car. Testing revealed that the bullet recovered from Jerry was fired from the rifle possessed by defendant. A test for gunshot residue revealed one particle of residue on the back of defendant\u2019s right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\n<em>Peremptory Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The prosecutor used two of her peremptory challenges to excuse African-American women from the jury venire. The trial court found that the prosecutor did not use the peremptory challenges for an improper purpose. (See <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79, 84-89 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 79-83, 106 S.Ct. 1712] <em>(Batson); People v. Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 276-277 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] <em>(Wheeler).) </em>On appeal, defendant contends that the judgment must be reversed because (1) the trial court did not make a \u201csincere and reasoned effort\u201d to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for challenging the two prospective jurors and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were unconvincing. We conclude that the trial court properly evaluated the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons and did not err in concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">A. <em>Legal Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The California Supreme Court summarized the law regarding discriminatory peremptory challenges:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\u201cBoth the state and federal Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors based solely on group bias. <em>(Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 89; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277.) Recently, \u2018the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that <em>Batson </em>states the procedure and standard to be employed by trial courts when challenges such as defendant\u2019s are made.  \u201cFirst, the defendant must make out a prima facie case by \u2018showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \u2018burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\u2019 by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. [Citations.] Third, \u2018[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 <em>(People v. Cornwell </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 50, 66-67 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 117 P.3d 622], quoting <em>Johnson v. California </em>(2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168 [162 L.Ed.2d 129, 125 S.Ct. 2410], fn. omitted <em>(Johnson).) </em>The high court clarified that \u2018a defendant satisfies the requirements of <em>Batson\u2019s </em>first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.\u2019 <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 170 . . ., reversing in part <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1302, 1318 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 71 P.3d 270] [requiring the defendant to \u2018show that it is more likely than not the other party\u2019s peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias\u2019].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the defendant ultimately has carried his burden of proving purposeful racial discrimination, \u2018the trial court \u201cmust make \u2018a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s explanation in light of the circumstances of the case as then known, his knowledge of trial techniques, and his observations of the manner in which the prosecutor has examined members of the venire and has exercised challenges for cause or peremptorily . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reynoso </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 903, 919 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 769, 74 P.3d 852].) \u2018[T]he trial court is not required to make specific or detailed comments for the record to justify every instance in which a prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory challenge is being accepted by the court as genuine.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>Inquiry by the trial court is not even required. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 920.) \u2018All that matters is that the prosecutor\u2019s reason for exercising the peremptory challenge is sincere and legitimate, legitimate in the sense of being nondiscriminatory. \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 924.) A reason that makes no sense is nonetheless \u2018sincere and legitimate\u2019 as long as it does not deny equal protection. <em>(Ibid.)\" (People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1100-1101 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 118, 129 P.3d 321]; see also <em>People v. Stanley </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 913, 936 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 420, 140 P.3d 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of purposeful racial discrimination is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>(People v. Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 541 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076].) Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the demeanor of a prospective juror, we accord that court\u2019s findings, express and implied, great deference. <em>(People v. Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 926; see also <em>People v. Stanley, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 939.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">B. <em>Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Before defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion, the prosecution used peremptory challenges to excuse nine jurors, two of whom were African-American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>women: first K.H., and then H.B. After the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective Juror H.B., the defense made its <em>Wheeler </em>motion. We therefore summarize the voir dire proceedings with respect to those two jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">On the first day of jury voir dire, K.H. arrived in the courtroom late, after the other prospective jurors had been sworn in. She asked the court to excuse her on a hardship because of a potential calendaring conflict and because she was looking for work, but the court determined there would be no conflict and therefore denied her request. During questioning of the prospective jurors, K.H. stated that her son had been the victim of a \u201cDUI driver.\u201d Upon further questioning, however, it was determined that her son was arrested for driving under the influence and was not the victim. K.H.\u2019s grandfather and her \u201cboyfriends\u201d owned firearms. Defense counsel asked the prospective jurors whether \u201cany time anybody is shot with a firearm that it\u2019s necessarily murder.\u201d K.H. said she did not understand and asked, \u201cIf anybody is shot with a firearm, would it be murder or would it be like attempted murder?\u201d Defense counsel clarified that the hypothetical person dies. Defense counsel could not read what K.H. wrote concerning the occupations of her children, so K.H. told him that one works at a pharmacy and the other delivers documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In response to questioning from the court and counsel, H.B. stated that she had worked as a certified nursing assistant for about 20 years but was then working for a paratransit service. She believed she would be open to persuasion, even after asserting an opinion. She felt she could be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Defense counsel asserted that there was no rational basis for using a peremptory challenge on either of the two prospective jurors. Although K.H.\u2019s son had a conviction for driving under the influence, other jurors had similar experiences. The court noted that two African-American women remained unexcused in the jury box and other African-Americans were in the jury venire. Nonetheless, the trial court determined that defense counsel had established a prima facie case because there was a possible inference of discriminatory purpose. The court noted that the burden therefore shifted to the prosecutor to justify the peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">As to K.H., the prosecutor stated that she had been late and seemed very confused. She sat in the wrong chair and did not seem to be able to follow the court\u2019s instructions. She was dazed and somewhat unresponsive, and her son had a conviction for driving under the influence. She had also asked to be excused on a hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>As to H.B., the prosecutor noted that she was a bus driver and had worked in that capacity less than two years. Concerning H.B.\u2019s prior experience as a certified nursing assistant, the prosecutor said: \u201cI guess I have a little bias against CNA\u2019s based on my own experience involving my father within the last year. He was in a nursing home, and we did not have a very good experience with CNA\u2019s, and ended up moving him out. [][] That\u2019s, that was one of the reasons, but it was one of those reasons sort of like the juror before, I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should kick her off. I was on the fence about [H.B.] but decided to go with my gut instinct on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">After allowing defense counsel to respond, the trial court denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motion. It found that the prosecutor did not act with a discriminatory purpose in using peremptory challenges to excuse the two African-American women from the pool of prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">C. <em>Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">1. <em>Court\u2019s Sincere and Reasoned Effort</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Defendant contends that the record does not reflect a sincere and reasoned effort on the part of the trial court to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for using peremptory challenges on two African-American women. He claims the court should have scrutinized the reasons more carefully, thereby providing a better record for review. Because the trial court did not adequately scrutinize the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons, argues defendant, the court\u2019s ruling is not entitled to great deference on appeal. To the contrary, the record establishes that the trial court properly performed its function in responding to defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">As noted above, a trial court is not required to make specific and detailed statements on the record in evaluating a <em>Wheeler </em>motion. <em>(People v. Guerra, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 1100-1101.) The trial court made the proper inquiry and required the prosecutor to explain her peremptory challenges. The court also allowed defense counsel to respond. Yet defendant asserts that the court should have probed further into the prosecutor\u2019s reasons because, in defendant\u2019s opinion, the reasons given were not convincing. In the next part, we conclude that the reasons stated were sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that the peremptory challenges were not used in a discriminatory manner. It suffices here to note that the trial court was required to do no more than it did in considering the <em>Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">2. <em>Sufficiency of Prosecutor\u2019s Reasons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Defendant attacks the reasons the prosecutor gave for her use of peremptory challenges. He claims that, even if the stated reasons were \u201ctheoretically \u2018neutral,\u2019 \u201d they were insufficiently convincing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>As to Prospective Juror K.H., defendant claims that the prosecutor should have been required to explain why K.H.\u2019s lateness made her less acceptable as a juror. The prosecutor also did not explain how K.H. was dazed or confused or why K.H.\u2019s response to the inquiry about her son\u2019s driving under the influence conviction was significant. Defendant concludes: \u201cNone of these claimed justifications was reasonable in any way to distinguish [K.H.] from the rest of the jurors; the fair implication was the prosecutor did not like her for a less-innocent reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">This argument is unconvincing. On their face, the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were race neutral. Although the question of whether the prosecutor\u2019s reasons are rational and reasonable weighs into the trial court\u2019s determination of whether to conclude that they are genuine and not a pretext, those reasons need not meet any particular standard of reasonableness. The only relevant consideration for the trial court is whether the reasons were sincere and nondiscriminatory. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reynoso, supra, 31 </em>Cal.4th at p. 924.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Prospective Juror K.H.\u2019s conduct and answers to questioning gave plenty of reasons for an attorney not to want her on the jury. She was not punctual and she did not otherwise do well in following the court\u2019s directions. Her son had been involved in criminal activity, for which she characterized him, whether mistakenly or intentionally, as a victim. There was sufficient evidence on this record to support the finding that the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge on her was not for discriminatory reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Likewise, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the use of a peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective Juror H.B. was not for discriminatory reasons. Excusing her because she was a certified nursing assistant and the prosecutor had bad feelings towards certified nursing assistants because of her experience with her father was a subjective judgment with respect to H.B.\u2019s profession, not her skin color.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">But defendant asserts: \u201cThis was, beyond doubt, not a neutral explanation related to the particular case being tried, but rather an excuse for the prosecutor\u2019s lack of any rational basis for the challenge other than to rid herself of a juror whom she distmsted because of her race.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Having had a prior bad experience with certified nursing assistants, the prosecutor had a \u201cgut instinct\u201d that she should use a peremptory challenge to excuse H.B. The record does not belie the prosecutor\u2019s sincerity in this regard. \u201cA prosecutor may act freely on the basis of \u2018hunches,\u2019 unless and until these acts create a prima facie case of group bias, and even then he may rebut the inference.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854].) Further supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>was not a pretext is that other African-Americans remained in the pool of prospective jurors. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 711, 719 [230 Cal.Rptr. 656, 726 P.2d 102] [inference of discriminatory purpose when all African-American jurors excused].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">3. <em>Snyder v. Louisiana</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">After the briefing in this case was completed, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Snyder v. Louisiana </em>(2008) 552 U.S._[170 L.Ed.2d 175, 128 S.Ct. 1203] <em>(Snyder). </em>In <em>Snyder, </em>the court reversed a defendant\u2019s murder conviction and death sentence because the prosecutor exercised a racially motivated peremptory challenge. We conclude that <em>Snyder </em>does not require reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The jury panel in <em>Snyder </em>consisted of 36 prospective jurors, including five African-American prospective jurors, after challenges for cause. The prosecution had 12 peremptory challenges and used five of those to eliminate all of the African-American prospective jurors from the panel. <em>(Snyder, supra, </em>552 U.S. at p._[170 L.Ed.2d at p. 180].) The Supreme Court focused on the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for using a peremptory challenge to excuse one particular prospective juror, Jeffrey Brooks, who is African-American. When asked by the trial court for his reasons, the prosecutor stated that he had two: (1) Brooks looked nervous during questioning and (2) he had asked to be dismissed for cause because he was a student-teacher and was missing necessary observation time in the classroom. <em>(Snyder, supra, </em>552 U.S. at pp. - [170 L.Ed.2d at pp. 181-182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Considering the nervousness justification first, the Supreme Court noted that the trial judge did not describe its own observation of Brooks\u2019s demeanor and may not have had its own impression concerning whether Brooks seemed nervous. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that it could not presume that the trial court credited the prosecutor\u2019s assertion concerning Brooks\u2019s nervousness. <em>(Snyder, supra, </em>552 U.S. at p._[170 L.Ed.2d at p. 182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The Supreme Court then considered the rationale that, because Brooks was missing student-teaching observation time, he might be too willing to agree quickly to a lesser offense. Based on the facts that (1) the trial court had checked with Brooks\u2019s teacher and found that jury service would not present a problem and (2) other prospective jurors had similar concerns about missing work or school, the Supreme Court found the proffered reason suspicious and implausible. <em>(Snyder, supra, </em>552 U.S. at pp. - [170 L.Ed.2d at pp. 182-186].)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Because the Supreme Court found no support for the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for eliminating Brooks from the jury, it concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s proffer was pretextual and that he exercised the challenge with discriminatory intent. It therefore found <em>Batson </em>error and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Snyder </em>is distinguishable from this case on the facts. There, the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to excuse all five of the African-American prospective jurors from the panel. Here, the trial court noted that two African-American women remained unexcused in the jury box and other African-Americans were in the jury venire. In <em>Snyder, </em>the prosecutor used as a reason the demeanor of the prospective juror, and the trial court made no express finding concerning that prospective juror\u2019s demeanor. Here, the prosecutor used an element of demeanor with respect to Prospective Juror K.H., but that demeanor is shown on the record from her lateness and inability to follow the court\u2019s instructions. No further finding was needed. In <em>Snyder, </em>the Supreme Court found the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason (Brooks\u2019s apprehension concerning missing student-teaching time) suspicious and implausible because the prosecutor did not excuse other prospective jurors with similar problems. Here, although Prospective Juror K.H. (1) asked to be excused for cause and (2) had a family member with a drunk driving conviction, and the prosecutor did not excuse others with those circumstances, there were other reasons\u2014inattention and failure to follow instructions\u2014that justified the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge based on demeanor. In summary, unlike in <em>Snyder, </em>there is in this case no basis to reject the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor did not act with discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">There were no Snyder-related demeanor issues as to Prospective Juror H.B. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\"><em>Exclusion of </em>Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Sims, Acting P.
