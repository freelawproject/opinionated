We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Respondents own a residence in Los Angeles, California. In June 2004, Weisz represented to respondents that he was personally engaged in the business of residential construction and remodeling and that Barak was \u201chis\u201d company. Weisz also stated that both he and Barak were licensed California building contractors. In reliance on these statements, respondents entered into a contract with Barak for an addition to, and a remodeling of, their home. The work to be performed under the contract included demolition and disposal of an existing garage, excavation and pouring of concrete foundations for a new structure, furnishing structural steel for the new construction, erecting the framing and roof of the new structure and plumbing, electrical, heating, air conditioning, interior finishing, painting and other work. The total cost for all material and labor was $363,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Neither Barak nor Weisz was a licensed contractor at the time the contract was signed on June 18, 2004. After the contract was executed, Barak commenced working on the project. Three months later, on September 17, 2004, Barak obtained a contractor\u2019s license for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Respondents allegedly paid Barak the sum of $362,660.50 under the contract. However, Barak allegedly abandoned the job before the work was completed, leaving respondents with a home that was unfinished and riddled with construction defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Respondents filed the present action against Barak, Weisz and others in March 2005. As against both appellants, the verified complaint sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>recovery for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, concealment, negligence, breach of implied warranties, breach of contract and unfair business practices. The complaint also sought recovery of money paid to an unlicensed contractor as against Barak.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Appellants filed a verified answer to the complaint. Appellants admitted that Barak entered into a contract \u201crelating to the construction of an addition to, and remodeling of, [respondents\u2019] residence.\u201d The answer admitted that a general building contractor license was not issued to Barak until September 17, 2004, and neither Barak nor Weisz held a California building contractor\u2019s license at the time the contract with respondents was executed. Appellants also admitted in their answer that Weisz was an officer, director and majority shareholder of Barak and alleged that respondents made payments to Barak totaling $362,629.50. They further admitted that Barak never held a contractor\u2019s license prior to entering into the contract with respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">After appellants filed their verified answer, respondents filed applications for a right to attach order and order for issuance of a writ of attachment against Barak and Weisz. Respondents asked for an attachment in the amount of $385,388, which included $362,660.50 respondents allegedly paid Barak, estimated costs of $643 and allowable attorney fees of $22,084.50. Respondents proffered a declaration testifying to the basic facts as related, <em>ante. </em>The declaration further averred that respondents were obliged to retain attorneys to seek recovery of the amounts they paid under the contract, and they incurred attorney fees of $22,084.50 and costs of $643 in prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Appellants filed a written opposition to the applications. The opposition raised four contentions: (1) respondents\u2019 claim was not based on a contract; (2) the amount was not fixed or readily ascertainable; (3) respondents had not proved the probable validity of their claim by a preponderance of evidence; and (4) there was no legal or factual basis for allowing an attachment against Weisz individually. Appellants further took issue with the amount sought to be secured by the attachment, arguing that (1) over $80,000 of the funds paid Barak was for \u201cextras\u201d separate from the subject contract; (2) $34,800 of the contract was for allowances paid directly by respondents to third parties; (3) Barak was seeking an offset for work performed and materials provided but not paid for; and (4) respondents had not apportioned fees and costs among multiple defendants. The opposition specifically did not include notice of any intention to claim any exemption of property from attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Weisz filed a declaration stating that he had incorporated Barak on April 17, 2003, and Barak has been an active corporation in good standing since then. Weisz asserted Barak had been adequately capitalized and had maintained a separate corporate existence. He admitted the facts of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>but asserted the contract price included $34,800 in allowances that respondents paid third parties. He stated that respondents had an unpaid balance on the contract of $56,470. Weisz admitted that Barak had not completed respondents\u2019 project, but he claimed it was due to the \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d of respondents. Also, he contended, the project included \u201cextras\u201d agreed to by respondents in the amount of $93,150.60, of which respondents paid $90,899.50, leaving the sum of $2,251.10 of \u201cextras\u201d unpaid. According to Weisz, $81,470.13 of the \u201cextras\u201d paid for by respondents was requested and performed after Barak obtained its contractor\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Weisz declared that Barak had submitted an application for a contractor\u2019s license in mid-2003, and Aharon Vaknin, then a shareholder of Barak, had taken the contractor\u2019s license examination in March or April 2004. Vaknin failed to pass all the portions of the examination. It was not until August 2004 that Vaknin was able to retake and pass the examination, after which a license was issued to Barak on September 17, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Weisz claimed Barak performed \u201cvery little\u201d work on respondents\u2019 project, primarily site preparation and demolition, prior to issuance of the license. He stated the \u201cmajority\u201d of the work under the contract occurred after Barak had its license. He denied ever telling respondents he or Barak had a contractor\u2019s license and asserted the subject of licensing never came up in his discussions with respondents. Weisz contended on information and belief that respondents \u201cknew\u201d Barak did not have a contractor\u2019s license when they entered into the contract. He stated he advised respondents at the time of contracting that he would engage a licensed onsite project supervisor or manager, and Barak did in fact engage a bonded and licensed general building contractor other than Vaknin to oversee the project, both before and after Barak had secured its own license.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">After a hearing, the trial court granted respondents\u2019 application for a right to attach order and order for issuance of a writ of attachment solely against Barak in the amount of $385,388 upon the filing of a $10,000 undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The court denied respondents\u2019 application as to Weisz individually, but it ordered Weisz not to sell, encumber, or diminish the value of his residence in Los Angeles until further order of the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court specifically found there was a basis in alter ego for its ruling and respondents\u2019 applications were based on breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Appellants timely appealed the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 483.010, a prejudgment attachment may issue only if the claim sued upon is (1) a claim for money based upon a contract, express or implied; (2) of a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than $500; (3) either unsecured or secured by personal property, not real property (including fixtures); and (4) commercial in nature. (See Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2007) f 9:858, p. 9(II)-69 (rev. # 1, 2007).) The plaintiff must establish \u201cthe probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 484.090, subd. (a)(2); see also <em>Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 271 [254 Cal.Rptr. 748].) \u201cA claim has \u2018probable validity\u2019 where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.\u201d (\u00a7 481.190; see also <em>Loeb &amp; Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1120 [212 Cal.Rptr. 830]; see <em>Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Titan Electric Corp. </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1476 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 673].) A defendant who opposes a right to attach order must give notice of his objection, \u201caccompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual issues raised and points and authorities supporting any legal issues raised.\u201d (\u00a7 484.060, subd. (a).) The defendant may make a claim of exemption with respect to his property in the opposition. (\u00a7 484.070.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The amount to be secured by an attachment is based on \u201c[t]he amount of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff\u201d plus an estimated amount for allowable attorney fees and costs authorized by the court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7483.015, subd. (a)(1); see \u00a7\u00a7 483.015, subd. (a)(2), 482.110.) That amount must be reduced by the amount of any indebtedness of the plaintiff that the defendant has claimed in a cross-complaint, or raised as a defense, if the claim is one upon which an attachment could be issued. (\u00a7 483.015, subd. (b)(2), (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">At the hearing of an application for a right to attach order, the court shall consider the showing made by the parties appearing and shall issue such an order if it finds (1) the claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued; (2) the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based; (3) the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based; and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 484.090, subd. (a).) The court\u2019s determinations shall be made upon the basis of the pleadings and other papers in the record. (\u00a7 484.090, subd. (d); <em>Loeb &amp; Loeb v. Beverly Glen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>Music, Inc., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 1120 [\u201cthe court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On appeal from an attachment order, we review the record for substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>(Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 273.) We apply the same evidentiary standard to an attachment hearing decided on affidavits and declarations as to a case tried on oral testimony. <em>(Lorber Industries </em>v. <em>Turbulence, Inc. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 535 [221 Cal.Rptr. 233]; <em>Loeb &amp; Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 1120.) We will not disturb a determination upon controverted facts unless no substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s determination. <em>(Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">1. <em>Writ of Attachment Against Barak</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in granting the right to attach order and in issuing a writ of attachment as to Barak on several grounds: (1) the record does not support a finding that the claim is one upon which attachment can be issued since respondents sought attachment based on a \u201cpunitive\u201d statute; (2) the claim was neither fixed nor readily ascertainable; (3) respondents did not establish the probable validity of their claim; (4) Barak is entitled to retain all compensation paid to it for work performed after it was licensed; and (5) Barak is entitled to retain all compensation paid for \u201cextras.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">A. <em>The Claim Is One on Which Attachment Can Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Appellants assert the claim is not one upon which attachment can be issued because respondents sought attachment based upon a \u201cpunitive\u201d statute, the Contractors\u2019 State License Law, Business and Professions Code section 7000<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> et seq. (CSLL), rather than any express or implied contract. Without citing any cases and without analysis, appellants assert that attachment is not available when the application for right to attach is based on a cause of action brought under the CSLL. We hold a claim brought under the CSLL against an unlicensed contractor may appropriately form the basis for a right to attach order since an agreement for the performance of services lies at the heart of such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The CSLL embodies a comprehensive legislative scheme governing the construction business in California. The CSLL manifests a strong public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>policy favoring protection of the public against unscrupulous and incompetent contractors. Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]he purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services. [Citation.] The licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in California have the requisite skill and character, understand applicable local laws and codes, and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. v. Oasis Waterpark </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 988, 995 [277 Cal.Rptr. 517, 803 P.2d 370] (Hydrotech); see also <em>Construction Financial v. Perlite Plastering Co. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 170, 176-177 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 574] <em>(Construction Financial).) </em>It has long been established that the provisions of section 7031 represent \u201ca legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties.\u201d <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen v. N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 151 [308 P.2d 713] <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen).) </em>Section 7031 applies \u201cdespite injustice to the unlicensed contractor.\u201d <em>(Hydrotech, supra, </em>at p. 995.) Accordingly, such provisions apply even when a person for whom work was performed knew the contractor was unlicensed. <em>(MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 424 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41] <em>(MW Erectors); Hydrotech, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 997; <em>Construction Financial, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Under section 7031, subdivision (b), except as provided in section 7031, subdivision (e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201ca person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or contract.\u201d Respondents provided evidence that Barak was unlicensed at the time the home improvement contract with respondents was executed, and performance under the contract commenced while it was still unlicensed. The record also showed it was not until several months afterwards that Barak obtained its license. Respondents presented a prima facie case under section 7031, subdivision (b), justifying the trial court in issuing a right to attach order upon their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">A claim under section 7031, subdivision (b) is fundamentally contractual in nature since it is based on an unlicensed contractor\u2019s agreement with the beneficiary to provide services, and the beneficiary\u2019s agreement to pay for same. Had the unlicensed contractor not received payment for unlicensed services, the beneficiary would have no cause of action to recoup such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>payments under section 7031, subdivision (b). The trial court therefore did not err in ruling respondents\u2019 claim was contractual in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">D. <em>Barak Is Not Entitled to Compensation for Postlicense Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Appellants argue that Barak should have been granted an offset for unpaid work performed after Barak became licensed. The fact that Barak became licensed sometime during performance of the contract is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">As our Supreme Court has stated, \u201cTo protect the public, the [CSLL] imposes strict and harsh penalties for a contractor\u2019s failure to maintain proper licensure. Among other things, the CSLL states a general rule that, regardless of the merits of the claim, a contractor may not maintain any action, legal or equitable, to recover compensation for \u2018the performance of any act or contract\u2019 unless he or she was duly licensed <em>\u2018at all times </em>during the performance of that <em>act or </em>contract.\u2019 (\u00a7 7031, subd. (a) . . . , italics added.)\u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 418, fn. omitted; see <em>Great West Contractors, Inc. v. WSS Industrial Construction, Inc. </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 581, 587 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 8] <em>(Great West </em>Contractors).) Thus, to recover for work performed on a project, the contractor must have been licensed at all times <em>before </em>commencing <em>any </em>work on the project. The Supreme Court has clarified that \u201cif fully licensed at all times during contractual <em>performance, </em>a contractor is not barred from recovering compensation for the work solely because he or she was unlicensed when the contract was <em>executed.\u201d (MW Erectors, supra, </em>at p. 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Because appellants were not licensed at the time performance under the contract commenced, they are not entitled to any recovery for work performed even if Barak obtained its license during construction. <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 425-426 [Legislature intended to impose \u201cstiff all-or-nothing penalty\u201d for unlicensed work]; <em>Great West Contractors, supra, 162 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 591-592 [unlicensed contractor may not segregate acts performed in furtherance of contract into discrete tasks to avoid bar of CSLL].) Any postlicense work may not be set off against respondents\u2019 potential recovery. This would be so \u201ceven when the person for whom the work was performed has taken <em>calculated advantage </em>of the contractor\u2019s lack of licensure,\u201d since <em>\u201cit matters not </em>that the beneficiary of the contractor\u2019s labors knew the contractor was unlicensed.\u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>at p. 424, italics added; see <em>Hydrotech, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 997-1002.) Indeed, the beneficiary of services by an unlicensed contractor would not be estopped by equitable concerns from invoking the CSLL against a claim for payment or offset by the contractor. (See <em>MW Erectors, supra, </em>at pp. 423-424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">E. <em>The Court Properly Included \u201cExtras\u201d in the Attachment Amount</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Appellants contend that any compensation for \u201cextras\u201d was paid pursuant to separate <em>oral </em>agreements and, with one exception, such work was performed subsequent to Barak\u2019s becoming licensed. We have disposed of the argument that work performed after Barak obtained licensing is subject to a different rule than work performed before licensing, performance having begun without a license. We further hold that \u201cextras\u201d undertaken in furtherance of the contract are subject to the CSLL.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The CSLL does not simply apply to work by unlicensed contractors under formal contract; it is intended to deter unlicensed contractors from offering or performing <em>unlicensed services </em>for pay. <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 427-428; <em>Lewis &amp; Queen, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 147; <em>Great West Contractors, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.) The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cparties do sometimes operate without, or beyond the boundaries of, a formal contractual arrangement, under an implicit understanding that the contractor is working on a quantum meruit basis.\u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>at p. 428.) The court has held that reference to \u201cact\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d in section 7031, subdivisions (a) and (b) \u201censures that one may not avoid the all-or-nothing bar against recovery for unlicensed services simply because there is no formal contract.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>at p. 428.) That appellants may have undertaken work for respondents not strictly listed within the four comers of the June 2004 written contract would not forestall application of the CSLL to such \u201cextras.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">2. <em>Stipulated Order Against Weisz</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The orders are affirmed.

Although it is the appellant\u2019s duty to show error, the respondent has a corresponding obligation to aid the appellate court in sustaining the judgment or order. (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 612, p. 644.) We may, in our discretion, treat respondents\u2019 failure to file a brief as an acknowledgement that the appeal is well taken and reverse the trial court\u2019s orders. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>California Custom Coach, Inc. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 333, 338 [285 Cal.Rptr. 649]; see Cal.

Notwithstanding respondents\u2019 dereliction of duty, we have undertaken to examine the record on the basis of appellants\u2019 brief, and review the orders for prejudicial error.
