The WCAB affirmed. A different judge, however, determined the expense of a report prepared by the same consultant for applicant Bradley Dorigo was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>reasonably and necessarily incurred and therefore would be awarded as a cost under section 5811. We conclude the WCAB retains discretion to award costs whether or not the report itself is admissible. Because the WCAB failed to exercise its discretion in Barr\u2019s case by erroneously finding that an inadmissible report precludes an award of costs as a matter of law, we remand the case to the WCAB to exercise its discretion. We affirm the award of costs in Dorigo\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Jim Barr had preexisting injuries when, in August 1999, he sustained additional injuries while working for Maita Oldsmobile Body Shop as an estimator. He filed an application for adjudication of the claim in May 2002 and settled his claim against his employer for approximately $10,000 in January 2004. In April 2004 he filed an application for subsequent injuries benefits. (\u00a7 4751.) The case was ready to proceed in May 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Barr\u2019s lawyer then hired a vocational rehabilitation consultant to evaluate Barr\u2019s then-existing condition, some seven years after the industrial accident. The consultant concluded Barr was 100 percent disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In October 2006 the Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIF) agreed to the terms of a stipulation of facts and award but objected to payment of the fees of the vocational rehabilitation consultant. There was no trial and no testimony was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge ordered the parties to brief the issue of costs. He concluded the cost of the consultant\u2019s time to prepare testimony was a reimbursable cost under section 5811, but the cost of preparation of the report was not. The WCAB affirmed. Both sides petitioned for review. We summarily denied SIF\u2019s petition <em>(Rea v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(Apr. 26, 2007, C054922) [petn. den. by order]) and granted Barr\u2019s (case No. C054907).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Bradley Dorigo, like Barr, settled his claim against his employer for job-related personal injuries and then filed an application for subsequent injuries benefits. His lawyer hired the same vocational rehabilitation consultant used for Barr, and the consultant issued a report. Dorigo, also like Barr, settled his SIF claim without trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Dorigo thereafter sought an award requiring SIF to pay the cost of the consultant\u2019s report. As noted above, the workers\u2019 compensation judge deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>mined the cost of the report was reasonably and necessarily incurred. The WCAB granted SIF\u2019s petition for reconsideration, rejected SIF\u2019s arguments, and affirmed the award of costs. We now address whether the WCAB has the discretion to award costs for the preparation of a vocational rehabilitation consultant\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, the WCAB is authorized to award costs.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 235, 238 [207 Cal.Rptr. 857, 689 P.2d 1127].) Section 5811 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIn all proceedings under this division before the appeals board, costs as between the parties may be allowed by the appeals board.\u201d (\u00a7 5811, subd. (a).) Because these costs are not defined by statute, the WCAB and SIF venture far and wide to resolve our narrow issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The WCAB, citing to the overarching constitutional principle that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings \u201cshall accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously, inexpensively, and without incumbrance of any character\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4), admits that \u201cit frequently has admitted vocational rehabilitation reports in evidence, in lieu of or in addition to vocational rehabilitation expert testimony, to expedite trials and reduce costs.\u201d On the one hand, citing section 5708, the WCAB rejects the notion that it is bound by the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure but, on the other hand, analogizes to civil cases in which written reports of experts are admitted in lieu of their testimony. <em>(County of Orange </em>v. <em>Barratt American, Inc. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 420, 439 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 542].) Essentially, the WCAB sees no reason to treat the report of a vocational rehabilitation expert any differently than the report of an examining physician, which is expressly admissible under the provisions of section 5703, subdivision (a), assuming it is submitted under penalty of perjury, because in the WCAB\u2019s view the list of admissible reports in section 5703 is nonexclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">SIF\u2019s arguments are more impassioned. Accusing the WCAB of unrestrained overreaching, SIF insists the WCAB\u2019s position is contrary to the law and public policy favoring prompt and cost-effective workers\u2019 compensation remedies, particularly in the wake of the legislative overhaul necessitated by the \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation crisis\u201d in the State of California. It complains that the WCAB has \u201celevated its discretionary powers to the point that it denudes section 5703 of any meaning.\u201d SIF, mistaking us for the Legislature, asks us to further public policy in this unregulated area by adopting the common law rule that the expert\u2019s expenses are not awarded as costs unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the court appoints the expert. But our task is a modest one: we interpret the law; we do not write it. Thus, we reject SIF\u2019s notion that we should cure the gaps in this \u201cunregulated\u201d arena by imposing our own prescription for sound public policy. Rather, as mere arbiters of the meaning of the statutes, we turn to the language of the pertinent sections of the Labor Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">First, as mentioned above, section 5811 confers on the WCAB the discretion to award costs. SIF cites a litany of cases, none of which involve the costs of a vocational rehabilitation expert, but in all of which, according to SIF, the Courts of Appeal have frequently placed limits on the WCAB. But these cases involve blatant violations of due process <em>(Carstens v. Pillsbury </em>(1916) 172 Cal. 572, 577-578 [158 R 218]), rulemaking provisions of the Labor Code <em>(Rea v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 625, 644-645 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 828]), rules of judicial notice <em>(Gee </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1426 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 105]), or the statute of limitations <em>(McGee Street Productions </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th <em>717 </em>[133 Cal.Rptr.2d 813]). Not one of the extreme examples cited by SIF bears any resemblance to the scope of discretion to award costs pursuant to section 5811.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Second, we agree with the WCAB that sections 5708 and 5709 do provide the context within which it exercises its discretion. Section 5708 provides that the WCAB \u201cshall not be bound by the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure, but may make inquiry in the manner, through oral testimony and records, which is best calculated to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties and carry out justly the spirit and provisions of this division.\u201d Similarly, section 5709 provides: \u201cNo informality in any proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order, decision [or] award [of the WCAB]. No order, decision, [or] award [of the WCAB] shall be invalidated because of the admission into the record, and use as proof of any fact in dispute, of any evidence not admissible under the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure.\u201d Thus, taken together, sections 5708 and 5709 allow the WCAB considerable discretion to conduct its business in a manner quite unlike civil litigation; in fact, the WCAB is unencumbered by formality or traditional rules of evidence and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Yet SIF insists that section 5703 limits the WCAB\u2019s discretion to award costs. We disagree. Section 5703 provides that \u201cin addition to sworn testimony presented in open hearing,\u201d \u201c[t]he appeals board may receive as evidence either at or subsequent to a hearing, and use as proof of any fact in dispute\u201d various reports, documents, schedules, records, protocols, and publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>cations. Section 5703 lists the following: \u201c(a) Reports of attending or examining physicians, [f] . . . [][] (b) Reports of special investigators appointed by the appeals board or a workers\u2019 compensation judge to investigate and report upon any scientific or medical question, [f] (c) Reports of employers, containing copies of timesheets, book accounts, reports, and other records properly authenticated. []Q (d) Properly authenticated copies of hospital records of the case of the injured employee, [f] (e) All publications of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation, [f] (f) All official publications of the State of California and United States governments. [][] (g) Excerpts from expert testimony received by the appeals board upon similar issues of scientific fact in other cases and the prior decisions of the appeals board upon similar issues, [f] (h) Relevant portions of medical treatment protocols published by medical specialty societies. ... [1] (i) The medical treatment utilization schedule in effect pursuant to Section 5307.27 or the guidelines in effect pursuant to Section 4604.5.\u201d A vocational rehabilitation consultant\u2019s report is not included in the list set forth in section 5703. We need not decide, however, whether the list is exclusive, as SIF contends, or merely illustrative, as the WCAB suggests, because the issue before us is not the admissibility of the report but whether the WCAB had discretion to award costs pursuant to section 5811 even if the report itself was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">SIF offers no authority for the proposition that the WCAB can only award costs attributable to admissible evidence. Nothing in the language of section 5811 suggests the WCAB\u2019s discretion is circumscribed by the rules of admissibility. Indeed, reports that are inadmissible for any number of reasons might be valuable in preparing for a hearing or to further settlement negotiations. Given that the WCAB is accorded generous flexibility by sections 5708 and 5709 to achieve substantial justice with relaxed rules of procedure and evidence and that SIF concedes the use of vocational rehabilitation experts is unregulated, we can find nothing in the Labor Code or general principles of due process to limit the WCAB\u2019s discretion to award costs in accord with the broad language used in section 5811.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">At oral argument, SIF\u2019s counsel argued vigorously that the recently decided case of <em>Olson v. Automobile Club of Southern California </em>(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1142 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 81, 179 P.3d 882] <em>(Olson) </em>compels us to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that, in the absence of language in section 5811 or elsewhere expressly conferring authority to award expert witness fees as costs, the WCAB could not award the costs here at issue. As acknowledged by SEF\u2019s counsel, the principles discussed in <em>Olson </em>are not new but have never been applied to section 5811. Nor have they been considered in light of the unique demands of litigation before the WCAB where, unlike in civil litigation generally, expert witnesses are routinely employed and are often essential to the resolution of factual disputes. Thus, while we take note of <em>Olson, </em>we are not persuaded that its holding restricts the WCAB\u2019s discretion to award expert witness fees as costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">SIF argues that the WCAB\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Costa v. Hardy Diagnostic </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 1492 <em>(Costa) </em>demonstrates the danger of according the WCAB unfettered discretion. In <em>Costa, </em>the vocational rehabilitation consultant\u2019s report was excluded from evidence because it was based on incorrect assumptions, inappropriately considered nonindustrial factors, and incorrectly calculated preinjury earnings capacity. Nevertheless, the WCAB ruled the cost was allowable under section 5811 under standards analogous to medical-legal costs under section 4621, subdivision (a). The WCAB applied those standards as follows: \u201cThus, the costs of evidence on and/or in rebuttal to a permanent disability rating must be reasonable and necessary at the time they were incurred, and such determination will also be made on a case by case basis. We further note that as with medical-legal costs, which may be reimbursable even though the applicant is unsuccessful in his or her claim (see, e.g., <em>Subsequent Injuries Fund v. Industrial Acc. Com. (Roberson) </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 842, 844 [28 Cal.Comp.Cases 139, 140]; <em>Beverly Hills Multispecialty Group, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Pinkney) </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 789, 802 [59 Cal.Comp.Cases 461, 471]), the expert evidence offered by an applicant does not necessarily have to successfully affect the permanent disability rating to be reimbursable. At the same time, however, the WCAB has the discretion to balance the amount of such costs against the benefit obtained. (See <em>Jimenez v. San Joaquin Valley Labor </em>(2002) 67 Cal.Comp.Cases 74, 84-85, fn. 18 (Appeals Board en banc).) Moreover, as with medical-legal costs, reimbursement will not be allowed if the report and/or testimony is premised on facts or assumptions so false as to render it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>worthless. (See <em>Penny </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 48 Cal.Comp.Cases 468 (writ den.); <em>Pacific Medical Associates, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(Rodarte) (1995) 60 Cal.Comp.Cases 526 (writ den.).) Furthermore, as medical-legal costs are not recoverable with respect to reports, for example, that are incapable of proving or disproving a disputed fact, or whose conclusions are totally lacking in credibility (see <em>Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Practice </em>(Cont. Ed. Bar, 4th ed., June 2007 Update) \u00a7 3.52, pp. 232-233), reports and testimony of a vocational rehabilitation expert must at least have the potential to affect a permanent disability rating in order for their costs to be recoverable.\u201d <em>(Costa, </em>at pp. 1498-1499, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The WCAB\u2019s conclusion in <em>Costa </em>is at odds with a statement it made over 20 years earlier, without analysis, in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 47 Cal.Comp.Cases 122 <em>(Barrett). </em>The WCAB wrote: \u201cIn its opinion the Board stated that the opinion of a vocational expert could be proper and relevant rebuttal evidence to a recommended permanent disability, but the expert must be present to testify regarding his opinion because Labor Code \u00a7 5703 . . . does not include a vocational expert\u2019s report among the material that may be admitted into evidence in lieu of sworn testimony to prove a disputed fact. The Board also stated that the vocational expert\u2019s charges for the report were not recoverable as cost[s] within the meaning of Labor Code \u00a7 5811 . . . .\u201d <em>(Barrett, </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In Barr\u2019s case, the workers\u2019 compensation judge relied on <em>Barrett </em>in deciding not to award costs under the mistaken impression that admissibility is a prerequisite to reimbursement. We accept the WCAB\u2019s more recent decision in <em>Costa </em>and reject SIF\u2019s characterization of the case as \u201can example of the problem.\u201d <em>Costa </em>reflects the legislative policy to accord the WCAB the discretion to evaluate whether the costs of a vocational rehabilitation consultant\u2019s report are reasonable and necessary based on the facts of the particular case before it. It may be, as in <em>Costa </em>and here in Dorigo\u2019s action, that the worker should be reimbursed for the cost of the report because it facilitated the expert testimony. Or it may be, as in <em>Barrett, </em>that the WCAB will decide SIF should not be obligated to pay for the cost of a report, which may not have been admissible and may have been of little, if any, value since the injury had been sustained seven years earlier. But the parties have not provided, and we have not found, statutory or case law limiting the WCAB\u2019s discretion to preclude an award of costs for a vocational rehabilitation expert\u2019s report as a matter of law. SIF entreats us to fill the void by legislating under the guise of statutory interpretation and blurring the distinctions between civil jurisprudence and workers\u2019 compensation law. This we cannot do. As a result, we conclude the broad language of section 5811 is controlling; we accord deference to the WCAB\u2019s construction of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>as explained in <em>Costa, </em>and we remand the Barr case to the WCAB to exercise its discretion to award the costs of the report even if it might have been inadmissible. Petitioner shall recover costs in the Barr proceeding. The WCAB\u2019s award of costs in the Dorigo matter is affirmed. Respondents shall recover costs in the Dorigo proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Sims, Acting P. J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> Nor do we accept SIF\u2019s attempt to avoid sections 5708 and 5709 by characterizing the issue as substantive rather than procedural. SIF maintains that, as a matter of substantive law, expert witness costs cannot be awarded unless a court appoints the expert, and therefore, the liberality accorded to the WCAB under sections 5708 and 5709 does not apply. We will not dilute or ignore sections 5708, 5709, and 5811, all of which reflect a legislative assessment that the WCAB should have the discretion to tailor workers\u2019 compensation proceedings to meet the unique demands of that system, in the name of generic principles of civil law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-5\"> The precise issue presented in <em>Olson </em>was whether Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, which provides that a prevailing party may be awarded attorney fees, can be construed to authorize the payment of expert witness fees as well. The court noted that the language of the statute mentioned attorney fees explicitly but made no reference to costs, and traced the legislative history of section 1021.5, including failed efforts to include language making express reference to \u201c \u2018costs, and other expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Olson, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 1154.) The court concluded section 1021.5 did not provide the express authority required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 for the award of expert witness fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
