EMC Management is a general partner with a 1% share in the partnership. EMC Cement is a Class A limited partner with a 49.5% ownership stake. Walker and his family and Wilson are Class B limited partners with a collective 49.5% ownership share in the partnership. Under the Partnership Agreement, the following was required of Class B limited partners Walker and Wilson:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Section 2.5.

The \"sound business principles\" language modifies the language about the partnership's goal of maximizing market penetration, not Walker and Wilson's obligation to loan funds and/or obtain financing for the partnership. The interpretation advanced on appeal by Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix would require us to rewrite the agreement to move the \"sound business principles\" language from Section 1.5 to Section 2.5 of the Partnership Agreement-something we cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

However, whether EMC Products or Walker and Wilson breached first is immaterial because of the well-settled rule that when a party materially breaches an agreement, the non-breaching party can\n   elect to either rescind the agreement or affirm and seek damages, but not both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texana Oil Co. v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ronin and Lygren both testified that, in 2008 and 2009, they began negotiating with C-Change in California about financing, developing, and commercializing EMC Cement's intellectual property. According to Ronin and Lygren, John Preston, a managing partner of C-Change, and Alan Quasha, the president of Quadrant Management, were involved in the negotiations. Lygren noted that Walker and Wilson were aware of the C-Change negotiations, though Wilson's testimony implied that he was unaware of the negotiations. Nevertheless, as a result of the negotiations, Ronin, Lygren, and C-Change executed a letter of intent calling \"for C-Change to commit to contribute a maximum investment of 50 million dollars to ... California, 49 million to the company and a million to the idea\" in exchange for a 51% equity interest in a holding company formed to develop and commercialize EMC Cement technology in California. Beginning in 2010, Quasha and Preston spoke with Walker and Wilson several times. Apparently, Quasha and Preston told Walker and Wilson that they wanted to buy EMC Products' business but did not want to enter into an agreement with Lygren. Both Ronin and Lygren testified that they were unaware that Quasha and Preston were communicating with Walker and Wilson. In any event, in December 2010, EMC Cement called off negotiations with C-Change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In January 2011, Walker and Wilson, frustrated with the actions of Lygren and Ronin, decided to stop making the monthly $25,000 payments on EMC Products' loan with Texas Capital Bank, thereby causing the partnership to default on an underlying loan. Phillip Wood, Texas Capital Bank's Executive Vice President, testified that Walker and Wilson had stated that their goal was to end their relationship with Lygren and allow Quasha and Preston to buy EMC Products' assets at a foreclosure sale following the default. These plans were subsequently relayed to Quasha and Preston, according to the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lygren recounted that, in February 2011, Wilson told Wood that a group represented by Quasha was interested in EMC Products-a sentiment that Quasha confirmed to Wood. On April 12, 2011, Texas Capital Bank noticed the foreclosure of EMC Products' assets for May 3, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   VHSC formed on April 28, 2011. The company is owned by INEA International, Limited, a company purportedly closely associated with Quasha and Preston. According to Wood, Wilson put together the potential sale of the loan to INEA, which led to Quasha entering into discussions with the bank. These discussions allegedly resulted in a draft agreement that designated Quasha as the sole primary contact for purposes of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also in April 2011, Lygren informed the bank that EMC Products' license from EMC Cement was \"neither assignable nor transferable\" and that the foreclosure proceedings would result in the disclosure of intellectual property belonging to EMC Cement. Lygren also noted that the bank had no right to foreclose and that legal\n   action would be taken if the foreclosure was to proceed. Lygren then notified Walker a couple of days before May 3, 2011, that EMC Cement had terminated the license agreement with EMC Products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Upon receiving Lygren's notices, the bank decided not to conduct the foreclosure sale. However, Walker and Wilson coordinated the purported sale of the loan to Few Ready Mix, Walker's company, so that Few Ready Mix could foreclose on EMC Products' assets on May 3, 2011. To facilitate the purported sale of the loan, Walker and Wilson both wired over $1.9 million to the bank on behalf of Few Ready Mix. Thereafter, Few Ready Mix sold EMC Products' assets to VHSC at the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale. Wilson served as the trustee, and Preston was the bidder at the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   VHSC bought EMC Products' assets for $3,126,090; however, the winning bid left an approximate $800,000 deficiency on the loan. In any event, Walker testified that he and Wilson equally shared the proceeds from the sale. A day later, Few Ready Mix sold the loan agreement to VHSC for $300,000. Walker and Wilson once again equally split the proceeds from the sale. And within days of the sale, VHSC began selling products produced by EMC Cement's purported trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the evidence outlined above, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could determine that Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix worked together to achieve the common goal of delivering EMC Cement's trade secrets to Quasha and Preston at VHSC by breaching the Partnership Agreement, defaulting on the loan, and ensuring that EMC Products' assets were sold to VHSC at the foreclosure sale-acts that resulted in damage to EMC Cement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956922\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/162/552/#p556\">\n    162 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   556 ;\n   <em>\n    Juhl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022799\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/936/640/#p644\">\n    936 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   644 ;\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019397\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/900/716/#p719\">\n    900 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   719 ;\n   <em>\n    BP Auto., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903234\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/562/#p573\">\n    448 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   573 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215659\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/272/588/#p592\">\n    272 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   592 ;\n   <em>\n    City of Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p822\">\n    168 S.W.3d at 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At trial, Ronin testified about the information that EMC Cement maintained as trade secrets and about specific documents that contained trade-secret information. Specifically, Ronin described confidential Mill Records and test reports from 2010 that contain specific details about EMC Cement processes. Ronin explained that the records show the test results of processing materials through high-energy vibratory-ball mills (\"VBM\") under different conditions. According to Ronin, the tests show that changing the speed at which fly ash is fed through the mill affects the final product. Additionally, the tests indicate the effects of varying the size and weight of the grinding media, the particle size of the fly ash, and the configuration of the openings on the mill wall. Ronin testified that these test results and records were not intended to be disclosed to the public because they were trade secrets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Ronin also explained the he did fill out a patent application for the VBMs, but that he purposely excluded certain information to prevent it from being released to the public. Ronin noted that: \"We didn't include information related to an exact positioning of the openings, an exact configuration of the openings, an exact size of the openings related to different rates,\n    through capacities of the mill. So this whole element you always keep it out like the trade secret-know how.\" He denied including the aforementioned Mill Records and reports from 2010 in the patent application.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In later testimony, Ronin stated that EMC Cement maintained information as trade secrets about the grinding media-i.e., the ceramic balls-within the mills, the frequency and amplitude of the mill's vibrations, data regarding the alteration of fly ash in the mill, and the results of performance tests on two EMC products, CemPozz and PozzoSlag. Ronin also testified that these trade secrets gave EMC Cement a competitive advantage over its competitors in the cement industry because EMC Cement was the \"one company who's doing this\" and that EMC Cement had always taken measures to protect and guard the secrecy of the trade-secret information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The record reflects that Pike, the former general manager of EMC Products who eventually became President of VHSC, included the Mill Records in the patent application he filed on May 6, 2011, just three days after VHSC acquired the EMC assets at the foreclosure. With regard to the Mill Records, Pike testified that \"[t]he data belonged to Texas EMC but what we did with that data and how we modified that mill, particularly the mill, I felt like it was the mill modification nothing to do with the process.\" Nevertheless, Pike admitted that this information was EMC's trade secrets and that it contained highly-sensitive information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Based on our review of the evidence, a rational factfinder could conclude that EMC Cement identified its trade secrets at trial; that Pike used his position at EMC Products to obtain the trade-secret information that ultimately benefitted his new employer, VHSC-a competitor of EMC Products; that Pike used the information in his patent application and VHSC used the information to produce cement subsequent to the foreclosure sale; and that the use of the trade-secret information caused EMC Cement damage.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bohnsack\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049155\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/262/#p279\">\n     668 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    279 ;\n    <em>\n     Sw.

In addition, VHSC and Pike allege that they were authorized to use any trade secrets that EMC Cement might have had based on licenses acquired in the foreclosure sale.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The record includes testimony from Ronin, the inventor of the process, about the methods and tools he developed over time for activating fly ash and the data collected from years of experimentation. And as outlined above, information related to the\n    unique configuration, use, and maintenance of the VBMs used to produce CemPozz and PozzoSlag were kept as trade secrets within the company and were not disclosed to the public in advertising materials or in a patent application filed by Ronin. In fact, Ronin testified that he purposefully excluded certain trade-secret information from his patent application to protect it from disclosure to the public. Ronin also noted that PozzoSlag, for example, could not be reproduced using only the information contained in the patent application. The disputed trade-secret information was needed to replicate PozzoSlag. Moreover, the record reveals that it was Pike, not Ronin, who disclosed EMC Cement trade-secret information to the public via his patent application.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In addition, we are not persuaded by VHSC and Pike's contention that they were authorized to use EMC Cement's trade secrets by virtue of the licenses acquired in the foreclosure sale. The Deed of Trust acquired after the foreclosure sale provided the following definition for \"Contracts\": [A]ll of the right, title and interest of [EMC Products], including equitable rights, in, to, and under any and all ... contracts, licenses, or permits which are directly or indirectly related to, or connected with, the development, ownership, maintenance or operation of the [cement plant].\" Despite this language, Lygren testified that EMC Cement terminated the License Agreement before the foreclosure sale. To corroborate Lygren's testimony, appellees included an email dated April 20, 2011, notifying Walker that EMC Products' rights under the License Agreement with EMC Cement had been cancelled. Therefore, at the time of the foreclosure sale, EMC Products had no license to convey to VHSC, and thus, VHSC could not have acquired use of EMC Cement's trade secrets by virtue of the License Agreement. Accordingly, we reject VHSC and Pike's arguments with regard to the trade-secret-misappropriation finding and overrule their first issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     VI.

Specifically, the Management Agreement provides the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    The Manager agrees that he is subject to the same obligations of confidentiality and secrecy with respect to the Company's or Ltd's Confidential Information as set out in the License Agreement attached as Exhibit B hereto for a duration of his engagement with the Company and for a period of 10 (ten) years following his termination, irrespective of the circumstances of which termination took place.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    For the duration of this Agreement, and any extension thereof, all rights to intellectual property related to the Company's or Ltd.'s business belongs to the Company or Ltd., respectively, including but not limited to intellectual property under development or under consideration for development, with or without the participation of the Manager.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    Moreover, the Manager may not use information gleaned about the EMC Technology for purposes other than to benefit EMC, Ltd. or the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The attached Licensing Agreement stated that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    \"Technical Data\" shall mean any and all documents containing design and technical information, engineering or production data, drawings, plans, specifications, techniques, methods, processes, trade secrets, reports, models, market research data, and any and all other material and matter used by or in possession of Licensor and applicable to the design, manufacture, assembly, service and sale of Products as defined hereafter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    \"Know-how\" shall mean the general and specific \"knowledge, experiences and information known to the Licensor, not in written or printed form, applicable to the design, manufacture, assembly, service and sale of Products.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    \"Confidential information\" shall mean information regarding the development of products or otherwise relating to the business of either party or of a related company, including without limitation Technical Data and Know-how.

At the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale, VHSC acquired EMC Products' assets. On May 5, 2011, Pike resigned from EMC Products and immediately went to work for VHSC as its president. The following day, VHSC filed a patent application naming Pike as the sole inventor. Testimony revealed that the substance of the patent application was based on Ronin and EMC Cement's technology and trade secrets. Even Pike admitted at trial that he gave VHSC highly-sensitive trade-secret information from EMC Cement. Pike further acknowledged that he filed the patent application containing trade-secret information because he was upset with Lygren and Ronin.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Pike later testified that Preston approached him the day after the foreclosure sale and suggested that he apply for a patent for EMC Products' technology and information and assign the patent to VHSC. Pike gathered \"a stack\" of material containing information that he and Ronin had spent eighteen months preparing and faxed the information to VHSC's patent attorney on May 5, 2011. A day later, VHSC filed the patent application with twenty-five patent claims. In support of their contention that VHSC interfered with Pike's Management Agreement by inducing Pike to divulge confidential trade-secret information obtained from EMC Products prior to the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale, appellees asked Ronin, the owner of twenty-seven patents, how long the process is for filing a patent. Ronin responded, \"[u]sually takes-if you're really focused on that, between four and six weeks when you have all experimental data.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Based on the foregoing, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could conclude that Pike breached the Management Agreement by providing VHSC with trade-secret information obtained during his employment with EMC Products.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, we hold that the evidence supporting the jury's finding that Pike breached the Management Agreement is legally sufficient.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215659\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/272/588/#p592\">\n     272 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    592 ;\n    <em>\n     City of Keller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p822\">\n     168 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    822 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Runge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9470225\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/57/562/#p565\">\n     57 S.W.3d at 565\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Additionally, we cannot say that the jury's verdict as to this claim is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9965344\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/709/175/#p176\">\n     709 S.W.2d at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, we further conclude that the jury's finding as to this claim is supported by factually-sufficient evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9965344\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/709/175/#p176\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    However, our analysis of this issue does not stop there. VHSC also challenges\n    the jury's tortious-interference finding, asserting four arguments: (1) EMC Products lacks standing to assert the tortious-interference claim because it currently has no interest in the Management Agreement; (2) VHSC could not interfere with the Management Agreement because VHSC acquired EMC Products' assets in the foreclosure sale; (3) VHSC had a license to use the confidential information; and (4) VHSC's actions were justified because it acquired the License and Management Agreements in the foreclosure sale. Each of these arguments is premised on a faulty assumption-that appellees' tortious-interference claim is based on events that occurred after the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale. In Question No. 8 of the charge, the jury was asked: \"Did VHSC intentionally interfere with Pike's Management Agreement prior to May 4, 2011?\" The jury answered Question No. 8 in the affirmative. And based on the evidence outlined above with respect to Pike's Management Agreement, a rational factfinder could have concluded that VHSC induced Pike to share EMC Cement's confidential information-an act that was prohibited by Pike's Management Agreement-long before the foreclosure sale for purposes of filing the patent application and to produce and market VHSC cement. We therefore conclude that the evidence contains legally- and factually-sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that VHSC tortiously interfered with Pike's Management Agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11178476\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/29/74/#p77\">\n     29 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    77 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215659\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/272/588/#p592\">\n     272 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    592 ;\n    <em>\n     City of Keller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p822\">\n     168 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    822 ;\n    <em>\n     Cain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9965344\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/709/175/#p176\">\n     709 S.W.2d at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    And finally, VHSC and Pike also challenge the jury's conspiracy finding. While we agree that Pike cannot be liable for interfering with his own Management Agreement,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Vesta Ins. Group, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8423236\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/192/759/#p761\">\n     192 S.W.3d 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 761 (Tex. 2006), we note that we have already determined that legally- and factually-sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that VHSC and Pike misappropriated EMC Cement's trade secrets and that VHSC tortiously interfered with Pike's Management Agreement. Thus, VHSC and Pike's liability is not based on the jury's conspiracy finding, but on findings of direct liability. Nevertheless, throughout this memorandum opinion, we document VHSC and Pike's involvement in the conspiracy to default on EMC Products' loans, sell EMC Products' assets at a foreclosure sale, and form a new company, VHSC, using the trade-secret information and technology obtained from EMC Cement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    As stated earlier, \"once a civil conspiracy is found, each co-conspirator is responsible for the action of any of the co-conspirators which is in furtherance of the unlawful combination.\"\n    <em>\n     Akin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957029\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/661/917/#p921\">\n     661 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    921 ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carroll\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9954200\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/592/922/#p926\">\n     592 S.W.2d at 926\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Additionally, because we have upheld the jury's conspiracy finding, all co-conspirators are jointly and severally liable for actual damages resulting from acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carroll\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9954200\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/592/922/#p926\">\n     592 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    925-26 ;\n    <em>\n     Sandt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092587\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/401/204/#p220\">\n     401 S.W.3d at 220\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The concept of civil conspiracy is sometimes used by a plaintiff as a basis for establishing joint and several liability among several defendants, some of whom may not have committed a tort by their own conduct.\");\n    <em>\n     Moody\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8973987\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/161/56/#p90\">\n     161 S.W.3d at 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

THE DAMAGES &amp; ATTORNEY'S FEES AWARDS\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In their third through fifth issues, VHSC and Pike make numerous challenges to the damages award. Specifically, they assert that the evidence supporting the damages award is conclusory and speculative and, thus, is not sufficient. Additionally, they contend that appellees' damage model is not competent evidence; the record contains no evidence of \"costs saved\" damages; the trial court's judgment improperly allowed appellees to recover multiple times for the same injury; and that the trial court's judgment incorrectly calculated the deficiency judgment. Moreover, in their first issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix join in the arguments made by VHSC and Pike and also assert that appellees' damage model is not a proper \"lost profits\" or \"market value\" model; that appellees' expert opinions are mixed with fact and fiction and cannot support the damages award; and that EMC Cement cannot recover under a damage model that is premised on the diminished value of a partnership interest. Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also challenge the attorney's fees award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Lygren's Testimony About the Value of EMC Products\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    At trial, Lygren testified that the value of the Texas EMC business related to the Jewett plant, including EMC technology was \"about $12 million, excluding the value of the plant itself\" before the foreclosure sale. After the foreclosure sale, the business was valued at zero. Later, Lygren stated that the value of the plant as carried on the books of EMC Products as of March 2011 was \"about $4 million.\" Lygren purportedly arrived at these values based on two theories: (1) a comparison of EMC Products' operation in Texas to the proposed partnership with C-Change in California; and (2) EMC Products' financial records from 2006-2010, Pike's projections about future growth, historical records of cement sales in Texas, and generally-accepted accounting methods. Lygren's assessment that the business had fair-market value of $12 million prior to the foreclosure sale was based on an evaluation of EMC Products' projected EBITDA\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    for the years 2011 through 2020. Lygren, an individual with a Bachelor of Science in Business from the Norwegian School of Business and over forty years' of experience in business, testified that EBITDA is recognized and commonly used for assessing the value of a business. Appellants' damages expert, Todd Burchett, agreed that an EBITDA-based analysis is an acceptable valuation methodology, though he asserted that the methodology was not properly applied in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    In any event, Lygren noted that he arrived at his valuation by considering the following: (1) EMC Products' financial statements from 2006-10, which notably reflected positive EBITDA figures; (2) Federal Accounting Standards and Procedures; (3) International Private Equity Fund and Venture Capital Guidelines; (4) Pike's projections for EMC Products' earnings and expenses for 2011; (5) American Coal Ash Association reports on consumption and production of fly ash in the United States; (6) United States Geological Survey reports on cement consumption in Texas; and (7) deposition testimony of Walker. Using this information, Lygren made the following determinations: (1) the amount of Portland Cement that was sold\n    in Texas from 2005-2012; (2) the market potential for CemPozz, a substitute product for Portland Cement; (3) market penetration for CemPozz from 2005-2010, which Lygren characterized as having \"significant upside potential\"; (4) EMC Products' average EBITDA from 2006-2010 as $458,003;\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    (5) the volume of products EMC Products would have sold in 2011 (86,273 tons); (6) the price per ton sale price EMC Products would have received in 2011 ($52.97), based on sales prices from 2006-10; (7) cost of goods sold per ton for 2011 ($34.52), based on costs from 2006-10; and (8) administrative, sales, and marketing costs for 2011, based on Pike's estimates ($573,328 for general administrative expenses and $199,291 for sales and marketing). Using these figures, Lygren extrapolated that EMC Products would have had an EBITDA of $819,083 for 2011. When using a 20% inflation rate to discount cash flows over a nine-year period, Lygren calculated the net present value of the EBITDA of 2011 to be $682,569.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Next, Lygren projected a 19% annual increase in sales volume from 2012 through 2020. This projection was based on a 48% increase in sales volume that Pike estimated for 2011 over 2010 and EMC Products' historical market penetration, which was small at the time of the foreclosure sale. Additionally, Lygren projected the selling price per ton that EMC Products would receive for sales from 2012 through 2020, based on prices from 2005 to 2010. The price projections increased from $55.26 per ton in 2012 to $73.61 per ton in 2020. Lygren did the same for cost of goods sold and administrative, sales, and marketing costs for 2012 through 2020. With respect to administrative, sales, and marketing costs, Lygren applied a 1.5% inflation rate. From these figures, Lygren derived a yearly EBITDA for 2012 through 2020, and after applying the previously-mentioned 20% discount rate, Lygren determined the present value of the EBITDA figures for 2012 through 2020.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Based on the foregoing testimony, we cannot say that Lygren's testimony was unreliable on its face.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beaumont v.

Walker and Wilson's Monthly Payments to Texas Central Bank\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Walker and Wilson also argue that they are entitled to recover sums they \"loaned\" to EMC Products. Their claim is premised on the jury's award of $250,000 to Walker and Wilson for \"unpaid loans made to EMC Products,\" which they contend omits funds that are still owed. Specifically, Walker and Wilson allege that they should be reimbursed for the $25,000 monthly principal payments made to the bank from July 2009 to December 2010.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    At the outset, we note that Walker and Wilson have not cited any authority to support their claim for these amounts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Moreover, under the express terms of the Partnership Agreement, any payments made by Walker and Wilson to the bank as a result of their personal guarantees were deemed to be additional capital contributions to the partnership, rather than loans. Specifically, section 2.6 of the Partnership Agreement provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Deemed Additional Capital Contributions.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    A Partner shall be deemed to have made an additional Capital Contribution\n    to the Partnership if and to the extent: (i) such Partner makes any payment to a creditor of the Partnership because of personal liability thereon; or (ii) such Partner makes any payment to a creditor of the Partnership because of the personal guarantee by such Partner.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Because Walker and Wilson admitted that they made $25,000 monthly principal payments because of their personal guarantees, and because Walker admitted that he understood the payments to be additional capital contributions under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, we cannot say that it was error to not include the principal payments in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    <strong>\n     8. EMC Products' Liability Under the Loan Agreement\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    In this sub-issue, VHSC contends that EMC Products is liable for the amount allegedly remaining due on the loan. The record reflects that Walker and Wilson wired a combined sum of $3,937,418-the full amount outstanding on the EMC Products loan-to Texas Capital Bank. VHSC asserts that this money was sent on behalf of Few Ready Mix to pay for its acquisition of the loan. VHSC, Pike, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    A trial court may disregard a jury's verdict and render a JNOV if there is no evidence to support the jury's findings or if a directed verdict would have been proper.\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

Wood noted that the beneficiary listed on the document was EMC Products, not the bank. Though Wood believed that the wire transfers were for the purchase of the note, he admitted that there was not any reference to the purchase of the note in bank documents. The bank honored the beneficiary named in the wire transfer and applied the funds to EMC Products' account. The transactions were recorded in the bank ledger, and as a result of the transactions, the principal balance of the note was zero.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Given that bank documents do not reflect a purchase of the note, but rather the paying off of the note, we cannot say that the jury erred in relying on the bank's records in finding that EMC Products complied with the loan agreement.

Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The complaints about the permanent injunction correspond with the misappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim alleged at trial. The trial court made numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that EMC Cement does not face imminent harm based on the following fact findings:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n    1. VHSC is not currently using any of EMC Cement's claimed trade secrets.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n    2. VHSC discontinued use of any EMC Cement's claimed trade secrets shortly after the foreclosure sale.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n    3. Soon after the foreclosure sale, VHSC removed the equipment modifications EMC Cement used to mill cementitious material.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n    4. Within several weeks of the foreclosure sale, VHSC began using different materials in its milling process, by among other things, substituting lime for Portland Cement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n    5. In 2012, VHSC began using entirely different milling equipment that employed a different technique to produce cementitious materials.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    And in concluding that EMC Cement did not face imminent harm, the trial court stated that the Amended Final Judgment awarded future damages for the misappropriation of trade secrets; thus, EMC Cement already obtained an adequate legal remedy and is not entitled to a permanent injunction. Contrary to the assertions of cross-appellees, appellants have challenged the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Existence of a Wrongful Act\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    As we have concluded earlier, the evidence supporting cross-appellants' misappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim is legally and factually sufficient. As such, cross-appellants have established the first prong for a permanent injunction-a wrongful act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Imminent Harm\n    </strong>\n    The next prong-imminent harm-was hotly contested at trial and was the focus of the trial court's findings of fact. On cross-appeal, cross-appellants contend that harm is presumed in a misappropriation-of-trade-secrets case when a defendant possesses trade secrets and is in a position to use them. Cross-appellees, on the other hand, argue that there is no basis for finding imminent harm, especially considering that the trial court, in its findings of fact, stated that VHSC is no longer using the claimed trade secrets. With this prong, we necessarily have to analyze the propriety of the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    Findings of fact entered in a case tried to the court have the same force and dignity as a jury verdict.\n    <em>\n     Anderson v.

Additionally, immediately after the foreclosure sale, VHSC sold the same PozzoSlag product that EMC Products had developed, and testimony at trial revealed that VHSC was still selling PozzoSlag at the time of trial. Finally, the evidence indicated that Pike worked with Ronin to develop processes for using Rotary Ball Mills to manufacture energetically-modified cement, and at the time of trial, VHSC was using this same technology to manufacture PozzoSlag.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    In light of this unchallenged evidence, it is our belief that a reasonable factfinder could not have concluded that VHSC stopped using EMC Cement trade secrets shortly after the foreclosure sale. Additionally, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that VHSC was using EMC Cement trade secrets at the time the permanent injunction was denied. As such, we conclude that the trial court's findings of fact regarding VHSC's usage of EMC Cement's trade secrets are not supported by legally-sufficient evidence. And given that the underlying fact findings are not supported by legally-sufficient evidence, we must reverse the trial court's conclusion of law that EMC Cement did not face imminent harm.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    And despite the fact that the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to imminent harm are not supported by sufficient evidence, we also agree with cross-appellants' contention that when a defendant possesses trade secrets and is in a position to use them, harm is presumed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     IAC, Ltd. v.

Here, Pike was previously the general manager for EMC Products and had access to EMC Cement's trade secrets. However, the record shows that immediately after the foreclosure sale, Pike went to work for VHSC, another cement-manufacturing company, and tried to patent EMC Products' trade secrets. Furthermore, Pike admitted that VHSC continued to use EMC Products' trade secrets until at least May 2013. Clearly, Pike and VHSC were in possession of EMC Cement's trade-secret information and were in a position to use it.

This would seem to indicate that it does not involve any novel legal issues or the application of settled law to new or different facts. I respectfully disagree with the Court's analysis and disposition of the issues, and dissent to the Court's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    No useful purpose will be accomplished by an extended dissenting opinion. I recently spent the time necessary to write such an opinion and thereby delayed the disposition of an appeal for an extended period of time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tafel v. State\n    </em>\n    , S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App.-Waco Aug. 31, 2016, pet ref'd). I will not do that in this appeal. The parties are entitled to a disposition, and I will not delay the disposition as I did in\n    <em>\n     Tafel\n    </em>\n    by writing an extensive dissenting opinion. I will only make a few observations that might assist further review or allow those that follow us to dig into the issues and distinguish the holding in subsequent cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <strong>\n     STANDING\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    I begin with the perennial issue of standing. This issue can arise in many contexts and forms and is frequently confused with capacity. The analysis of this issue in the Court's opinion is somewhat difficult to follow since it is a memorandum opinion and the very complex ownership interest of the parties, alignment of the parties, pleadings, and cross-claims was not discussed. In summary, the partners in EMC-Production (EMC-P) were EMC-Cement (EMC-C), EMC-Management (EMC-M), Walker et al., and Wilson. The standing issue has substantive implications because of the need to determine who, if anyone, has the proper interest to be the representative behind EMC-P's claims and bring suit as the partnership to recover on the claims of the partnership as distinguished from the claims of the various partners. The collateral issues cascade down from the resolution of this issue, flow through the damages analysis, and ultimately pool in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    There are claims of EMC-C and EMC-M against Walker and Wilson; thus partners vs. partners. EMC-P is also a party to the litigation whose \"interest\" has been \"aligned,\" for purposes of pursuing this litigation, with EMC-C and EMC-M. Thus, the recovery on claims made by or on behalf of EMC-P will necessarily benefit all the EMC-P partners, including Walker and Wilson. But EMC-P's claim that EMC-C breached the partnership agreement, is obviously not being presented by EMC-C, but rather is being presented and pursued by Walker and Wilson. No one has suggested that EMC-P was dissolved. As noted above, EMC-P is purported to be a party to the litigation. The problem is further complicated in this proceeding because the assets of the partnership, EMC-P,\n    were foreclosed upon. So there is a question of whether the partnership's several claims for breach of the partnership agreement, as raised by different partners, were assets of the partnership sold as part of the foreclosure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The Court resolves the issue of standing, partially under the theory that as a partner, EMC-C is authorized to represent EMC-P, and partially upon the determination that there was no sworn denial of the ability of EMC-C to recover in the capacity that suit was brought. If there is a pleading problem due to the capacity issue, I believe it was tried by implied consent. The issue, however, does not seem to be a capacity issue because Walker and Wilson are not challenging whether EMC-C can recover in a certain capacity, but rather whether EMC-C has the necessary interest in the recovery to be the mouthpiece for EMC-P and thus, to selectively assert claims against Walker and Wilson.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    To some extent, I believe the Court misapprehends the issue as briefed. Nevertheless, this is an area that cries out for guidance from the State's high court; whether a partnership's competing interest against and between its partners allows the first partner to get to the courthouse the ability to be the representative behind the partnership's claims and thus to sue as the partnership and thereby insulate itself from its own breach of the partnership agreement, a breach which the other partners established in this proceeding. In effect, who has the necessary and proper independent interest in the outcome to pursue all of the claims of the partnership and to thus sue for all of its claims, if any, against all the various partners.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    <strong>\n     ILLEGALITY\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Next I turn to another area that could use some high court guidance; the nature of the \"illegal\" act that will support a conspiracy. The lynchpin of the liability of the appellants is the alleged conspiracy. The lynchpin of the conspiracy is the illegal act. In the hundreds of pages of briefing and the thousands of pages of the record, I have been unable to find the illegal act to support a conspiracy, remembering that it is not illegal to breach a contract, even if done maliciously, or to commit a common law tort. So out here in the trenches, it would be helpful to have some articulation of what acts will support a conspiracy claim that can convert an ordinary tort or breach of contract claim from one for damages caused by one's own conduct into joint and several liability for the conduct of anyone that was in the area when the \"conspiracy\" went down.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Guidance in this area would be particularly helpful in a case such as this where it is clear that there was a falling out between the parties that provided the idea, the parties that provided the financing, and the parties that were supposed to make the idea work in production and the marketplace. When the venture falls apart, people search for legal solutions that are clearly not what they went into the partnership thinking or intending. One partner takes an unreasonable position never contemplated by anyone, for example that the partnership agreement requires some of the partners to provide an infinite stream of funding until PozzoSlag and CemPozz penetrate the market for cement, which is a position that is unsupported by any reasonable construction of the partnership agreement. The other partners, who think they have already put more than enough money into the business venture for it to be a success, if it is ever going to succeed, begin to look for a way to stop the financial losses of a business enterprise that will obviously never work. One party or the other may choose to breach the contract and suffer the consequences. In hindsight, it looks bad but it is not illegal and the\n    trial court must give the appropriate guidance in the charge in the form of questions and instructions to the jury to instruct them on the law of what \"illegal\" conduct will support a conspiracy that may lead to joint and several liability under conspiracy claims for the actions of other parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    <strong>\n     DAMAGES\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    And while I will not elaborate extensively on the conclusory testimony that purports to be a damages analysis which was based on no history of profitability and based on projections of earnings and growth that have no basis in reality (19% annual increase in the volume of tons of cement sold while also increasing prices 19% annually, both of which occur uninterrupted and compounded for a 10 year run), it is clear to me that Lygren had no idea what he was testifying about by his discussion of \"Federal Accounting Standards and Procedures.\" Accounting for the Federal Government has no application to the valuation of a privately owned business.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    Moreover, after spending a good deal of time and effort in analysis of the damage model used by the plaintiffs in this case, I would hold the testimony of the \"experts\" are no more than unsupported conclusions with an\n    <em>\n     ipse dixit\n    </em>\n    connection to the facts of the case. There is simply, in the words of the high court, too great of an analytical gap to support the damages awarded, much of which appears to be a double recovery for alleged damages to EMC-P, and also to EMC-C for the damage to its investment in EMC-P (especially when EMC-C purported to pull out its contribution to EMC-P which would destroy the value of EMC-P but for which EMC-C is then awarded damages, thus rewarding EMC-C's own conduct in breaching the partnership agreement as determined by the jury but not reflected in the judgment). And because you cannot retry only the issue of damages, and in the interest of justice, I would reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the entire proceeding for a new trial. Because the Court does not, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-229\">\n     Pike also makes a standing argument in this issue, which hinges on the assumption that the breach transpired after the foreclosure sale. However, we reject this argument because we conclude that the jury could have determined that the breach of the Management Agreement transpired prior to the foreclosure sale. Accordingly, appellees had a \"justiciable interest\" in the outcome at the time the breach occurred.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Austin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v.
