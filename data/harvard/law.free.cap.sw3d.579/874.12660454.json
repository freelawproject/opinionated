Holly (collectively Golden) appeal from an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court denying its motion to compel arbitration and dismiss or stay the pending litigation. After reviewing the record and applicable law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2015, David Dolan executed a durable power of attorney (POA) naming Ronald Briney as his attorney-in-fact. In June 2015, Dolan was admitted to Golden Living Center - Mt. Holly, a long-term care facility in Louisville where he resided until August 2015. As part of the admission process, Briney was given the option to sign an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) agreement whereby any disputes between Dolan and the facility would be resolved by arbitration. The facility made clear at the time of admission, that signing an ADR agreement was not a prerequisite to admission and was voluntary. Briney\n   signed the arbitration agreement as Dolan's attorney-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2016, Dolan filed a lawsuit in the Jefferson Circuit Court alleging negligence in the care and treatment he received at the facility. In March 2016, Golden filed a motion to compel arbitration and to either dismiss the pending action or hold it in abeyance. Golden relied upon the ADR signed by Briney as Dolan's agent, the Kentucky Uniform Arbitration Act, codified in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 417.050\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), codified in 9 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied Golden's motion and its subsequent motion to alter, amend or vacate. The trial court found that the ADR agreement was not a requirement for admission to the Golden facility. The trial court then determined that Briney's signing of the ADR agreement exceeded his authority under the POA, which permitted Briney to sign only if it was \"requisite\" or \"necessary\" to the performance of any act on behalf of Dolan. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An order denying a motion to compel arbitration is immediately appealable. KRS 417.220(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. v.

The Clark POA stated that the attorney-in-fact\n   had the authority \"to transact, handle, and dispose of all matters affecting me and/or my estate in any possible way\" and \"\n   <strong>\n    to do and perform for me and in my name all that I might if present.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Whisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n    478 S.W.3d at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Kentucky Supreme Court held that \"[g]iven this extremely broad, universal delegation of authority, it would be impossible to say that entering into a pre-dispute arbitration agreement was not covered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n    at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, our Supreme Court held that was not enough to authorize the attorney-in-fact to enter into an arbitration agreement. The Court observed that by executing the arbitration agreement, the attorney-in-fact waived the principal's constitutional rights to access the court and for a trial by jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n    at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It held that a rule requiring a clear statement conferring on the attorney-in-fact the power to waive constitutional rights where the attorney-in-fact otherwise possessed the power to enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements was a prohibited rule \"hinging on the primary characteristic of an arbitration agreement-namely, a waiver of the right to go to court and receive a jury trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604105\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1421/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The United States Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As noted earlier, the state court held that the Clark [POA] was sufficiently broad to cover executing an arbitration agreement. The court invalidated the agreement with Kindred only because the [POA] did not specifically authorize Janis to enter into it on Olive's behalf. In other words, the decision below was based exclusively on the clear-statement rule that we have held violates the FAA. So the court must now enforce the Clark-Kindred arbitration agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1421/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1421/\">\n    at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Wellner POA contained different language and the Kentucky Supreme Court concluded its powers were not as broad as those in the Clark POA. In contrast to its conclusion that the Clark POA was broad enough to give the attorney-in-fact authority to enter into a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, the Kentucky Supreme Court decided that the Wellner POA was insufficiently broad to give the attorney-in-fact authority to execute an arbitration agreement on the principal's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Whisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829578\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/306/\">\n    478 S.W.3d at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That reasoning, the United States Supreme Court noted, was not based on any characteristic of a pre-dispute arbitration agreement but was an application of Kentucky law. The United States Supreme Court concluded that \"[i]f that interpretation of the [Wellner POA] is wholly independent of the court's clear-statement rule, then nothing we have said disturbs it. But if that rule at all influenced the construction of the Wellner power of attorney, then the court must evaluate the document's meaning anew.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604105\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1421/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Wellner\n   </em>\n   case was remanded to the Kentucky Supreme Court to determine whether its opinion was tainted by the clear-statement rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604105\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1421/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On remand, the Kentucky Supreme Court emphasized that Kindred did not rely on as broad of a provision as that in the Clark POA. As stated by the Court, Kindred relied on two provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1) the power \"to demand, sue for, collect, recover and receive all debts, monies, interest and demands whatsoever now due or that may hereafter be or become due to me (including the right to institute legal proceedings therefor)\"; and, 2) the power \"to\n   make, execute and deliver deeds, releases, conveyances and contracts of every nature in relation to both real and personal property, including stocks, bonds, and insurance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Wellner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n    533 S.W.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Court reaffirmed its decision that neither provision was sufficiently broad to include the authority to execute an arbitration agreement and that its decision was made independent of and untainted by the clear-statement rule denounced in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n    at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court reiterated its original conclusion that with respect to the powers to \"demand, sue for, collect, recover and receive all ... demands whatsoever\" and \"to institute legal proceedings,\" the Wellner POA confers the authority to bind\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   claims to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n    at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Kindred arbitration agreement was not executed in the context of a lawsuit or claim but in the context of admitting the principal to a nursing home.

The word \"necessary\" the Court held, limited Ms. Hibbs's authority \"to the doing of such things and the performance of such acts as were necessary to the conducting of the business affairs of her husband, and manifestly did not include the signing of his name as surety for another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n    at 357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court refused to extend Ms. Hibbs's authority beyond the \"fair meaning of the words conferring it[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n    at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Even when there is express authority for the agent to bind his principal as surety, it is the policy of the law to construe it strictly, and to hold the principal not bound unless the authority is exercised within the undoubted limits prescribed by the principal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hibbs' Ex'x\n   </em>\n   Court also noted that it was significant how the surety was signed thereby giving Clinton notice of the limitations on her authority. By her signature, Ms. Hibbs articulated in writing she was signing in the context of her husband's agency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20S.W.%20356\">\n    at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Dolan POA does not, as Golden argues, confer the broad power \"to do whatever\" Dolan himself could have done. Briney's powers were limited by the words \"requisite, necessary and proper to be done[.]\" That limitation applied to any transaction performed by Briney on Dolan's behalf. As the trial court found, the ADR agreement was optional, which meant it was not requisite, necessary and proper to Dolan's admission to Golden's facility. In short, Briney chose to sign the agreement on Dolan's behalf and did so without his authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the Kentucky Supreme Court pointed out in its detailed analysis in\n   <em>\n    Wellner\n   </em>\n   , although no clear statement that the attorney-in-fact has the power to bind the principal to an arbitration agreement is required, such power will not be inferred unless it is \"reasonably consistent with the principal's expressed grant of authority[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Wellner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386591\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/189/\">\n    533 S.W.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The express grant of authority and the express limitations on that authority renders the Dolan POA insufficiently broad to confer the power on Briney to bind Dolan to an arbitration agreement. By signing as Dolan's attorney-in-fact, Golden had notice of the limitations on Briney's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the order of the Jefferson Circuit Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    GGNSC Louisville Mt.
