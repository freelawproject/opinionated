FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001(b)(2) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.); TEX. R. CIV. P. 245. We reverse and remand in part and we affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the Department of Family and Protective Services (\"the Department\") filed its original petition requesting emergency removal of B.C. and her brother B.T. from J.C.'s home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   B.C. was five years old at the time and B.T. was four. The Department alleged that: (1) drugs were used and sold in the home; (2) the home lacked running water and light; and (3) there were ongoing domestic violence issues in the home. At a hearing on August 10, 2017, Department investigator Crystal Krueger testified concerning the initial referral to the Department. She testified that there was no running water in the home, there was no light, and she confirmed that there were concerns of domestic violence. She also testified that methamphetamines were used in the home. J.C. did not contest the removal of the children from her home, and the Department\n   was named the temporary managing conservator of B.C. The trial court informed J.C. that if she submitted an affidavit of indigency, she would be entitled to a court-appointed attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a subsequent hearing on September 11, 2017, the family plan of service was adopted, and a hearing schedule was created. The hearing schedule listed the dates and times for the remaining permanency hearings, including the date of the final bench trial to be held on July 9, 2018. Every party present, including J.C., signed the hearing schedule. J.C. testified that she understood that she might have her parental rights terminated if she didn't complete the service plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 12, 2017, the initial permanency hearing was held, with J.C. present. She had begun some of the services on the plan but also tested positive for marijuana. The court informed J.C. of the next hearing on February 1, 2018. At this hearing, the court discussed whether J.C. was making enough progress to avoid termination; J.C. did not attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next hearing was held on April 5, 2018, with J.C. present. The court was informed that B.C.'s third placement with a maternal cousin was going to need to change soon due to medical issues. The court scheduled an additional review hearing for May 17, 2018. At this hearing, the parties were reminded of the pretrial permanency hearing on July 3, 2018. Permanent managing conservatorship of B.T. was transferred to a paternal aunt, leaving only B.C. in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   J.C. was present for the June 7, 2018 hearing. According to testimony from caseworkers, her progress on the family service plan had completely stagnated. The trial court reprimanded J.C. for not making the family plan of service a priority; for example, the trial court was concerned with J.C.'s failure to submit for drug tests on multiple occasions. The trial court reminded everyone present that they were set for trial in less than thirty-two days. All the parties were once again reminded of the next hearing on July 3, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.C. did not appear at the July 3 hearing. Because of J.C.'s lack of progress on the service plan, the Department was now requesting termination of her parental rights. At this point, B.C. was in her fourth placement home with G.G., a maternal third cousin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 9, 2018, the bench trial was held. J.C. did not appear, even though caseworker Sarah Wallace testified that she had called J.C. to remind her of the bench trial. Krueger once again testified concerning the lack of utilities in the home and the use and trafficking of methamphetamines in the home. Caseworkers spoke with the neighbors and confirmed frequent reports of domestic abuse concerning J.C.'s boyfriend. Lab tests showed that J.C. tested positive for methamphetamines, amphetamines, and marijuana around the time the children were removed from the home. Krueger also testified that when B.C. was removed from the home, she had extensive head lice and was in dire need of a bath and clean clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wallace testified concerning J.C.'s performance on the family plan of service. The service plan's primary goals were for J.C. to maintain sobriety, employment, and housing. However, Wallace testified that J.C. couldn't maintain employment, which led to J.C. moving back and forth between living with different relatives. She testified that J.C. tested positive for methamphetamines, amphetamines, and marijuana in July of 2017. She tested positive for methamphetamines and marijuana in September of 2017. She did have a negative drug test result in April of 2018; however, J.C. failed to complete her drug tests in November,\n   December, and May. Wallace averred that J.C. failed to consistently visit B.C., excluding the month J.C. was incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   G.G. testified that as a distant cousin of B.C., she did not have a lot of history or experience with B.C.'s immediate family. She related that J.C. appeared to be under the influence of drugs during J.C.'s last visitation with B.C. According to G.G., every time a visitation was scheduled, J.C. would either become unavailable or not show up. G.G. testified that it was \"damaging\" to B.C. to have her mother constantly not show up for visitation. Caseworker Windy Luna testified that in her opinion, termination was appropriate and in the best interests of B.C. The trial court found that termination was in the best interest of B.C. and terminated J.C.'s parental rights pursuant to parts (D), (E), (O), and (P) of subsection 161.001(b)(1) of the Texas Family Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001(b)(1)(D), (E), (O), (P).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 17, 2018, a hearing was held before the trial court to appoint J.C. an attorney for her appeal, and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Trial Court]: All right. [J.C.], you were brought here today because you came by after your trial and requested a [sic] attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [J.C.]: Yes, Ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Trial Court]: And what is going on?

I had already knew [sic] I was going to lose my rights. I didn't want to come down here in front of everybody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court considered J.C.'s indigency application and appointed her counsel for her appeal. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FORTY-FIVE DAY NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In her first issue, J.C. contends that she was denied due process under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments because she was not given reasonable notice of the date of the bench trial at least forty-five days in advance of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. amends.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, J.C. argues that there is no evidence that she was ever informed of the specific trial date on July 9, 2018. She claims that the trial court only vaguely mentioned a possible trial setting in July. However, the record clearly establishes that J.C. was informed of the date of the bench trial well in excess of the minimally-required forty-five days. At the hearing on September 11, 2017, J.C. signed and received a copy of the hearing schedule, which listed the date of the bench trial. Furthermore, J.C.'s remarks at the post-trial hearing to appoint an attorney for the appeal indicated that she had received notice and was aware of the date of the bench trial but simply decided not to appear. We find that J.C. received proper notice of the final trial date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re I.L.S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318887\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/339/156/#p159\">\n    339 S.W.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If you cannot afford an attorney because this is a case that might involve the Department seeking to have permanent custody of your children or seeking to terminate your parental rights, depending on how it turns out later in the case, you have the right to request an attorney to be appointed to present you. To do that you have to fill out some forms with the district clerk and the Judge has got to look at them to determine whether or not you're truly indigent and if you're truly indigent, the judge is required to appoint an attorney to represent you. Does everybody understand you've got the privilege?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is also true that she never filed an affidavit of indigency. However, at the adversary hearing, she testified that she wanted her children back.
