The only question we need to resolve is whether Janice Baker made out a prima facia premises liability case against the County arising from an injury she claims was caused by a set of elevator doors at the County Courthouse. The County presented evidence that it had no knowledge of the claimed defect with the elevator doors which is a necessary element of Baker's claim. We conclude that Baker offered no evidence raising a fact issue on that specific question. Accordingly, the trial court erred in overruling the County's plea to the jurisdiction. The order below is reversed and the case against El Paso County is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Janice Baker visited the El Paso County Courthouse on July 17, 2014. While entering elevator number six, she claims the doors shut on her causing bodily injury. She reported the injury that day and spoke with Deputy Sheriff Alfredo Colorado, who prepared a report documenting the incident. The El Paso Fire Department treated her on scene, but she refused to go to the hospital. Officer Colorado transported her by wheelchair to a nearby bus stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A month after the incident, her lawyer sent a letter to the El Paso County Judge stating that he had been retained in connection with Baker's personal injuries sustained on July 17, 2014 at the County Courthouse. An attorney for the County promptly acknowledged the correspondence. The County's attorney stated \"[o]nce you have provided sufficient information for us to evaluate your client's allegations, I will present the matter to Commissioner's Court for their consideration of your claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2016, Baker filed suit against the County asserting a claim for negligence. The County answered and later named ThyssenKrupp Elevator Corporation as a responsible third party, claiming that entity services the elevators for the County. Following several amended petitions, ThyssenKrupp Elevator Corporation and ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas Corporation appeared as defendants below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The County eventually filed a combined plea to the jurisdiction, traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment. The motion advanced two arguments relevant here. First, the County claimed it was not given proper notice of the claim as required by TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 101.101(a) (a governmental unit is entitled to receive notice of a claim within six months of the incident which describes: \"(1) the damage or injury claimed; (2) the time and place of the incident; and (3) the incident.\"). Second, the County argued that the claim against it is limited to a premises liability theory, and under that theory, a licensee such as Baker must show that the County had actual knowledge of the claimed defect. Supported by several maintenance records and the affidavit of its maintenance supervisor, the County urged it had no actual knowledge of the claimed dangerous condition in elevator six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the notice of claim issue, Baker responded by offering proof of the oral report of injury that she made that day, the incident report prepared by Officer Colorado, and the notice of representation letter that her lawyer sent the month following the incident. She contends that the County had formal notice as contemplated by Section 101.101(a), or alternatively, actual notice as permitted by Section 101.101(a). As to the premises liability issue--whether the County had actual knowledge of the claimed defect--she offered only a photocopy of a news article that we describe in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied the County's motion following a non-evidentiary hearing. This interlocutory appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(8) (allowing interlocutory appeal from order that grants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEAS TO THE JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sovereign immunity (from suit) implicates a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over a lawsuit unless the State expressly consents to suit.\n   <em>\n    Engelman Irrigation Dist. v.

The County supported its plea with the affidavit of Gilbert Mijarez, the Public Works Facilities Manager for the County. He oversees the El Paso County Courthouse. One of his duties is to maintain the elevators, but the County contracts with Thyssenkrupp Elevator Corporation to do any maintenance. When a problem is reported about an elevator, department policy requires that the elevator be locked down, and Thyssenkrupp Elevator Corporation called to perform maintenance. The County's maintenance department itself inspects the elevators yearly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In December 2013, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation issued a Certificate of Compliance for elevator six following its inspection. Mijarez further swore that prior to July 17, 2014, he was not aware of any problems with the doors on elevator six, nor had he received any reports that someone had been injured by them. Even after the incident, he was not made aware of any similar problems with that elevator. The County also attached what appear to be elevator maintenance records for 2014. The records reflect issues such as call buttons working improperly, elevators getting stuck, or the generic statement \"elevators not working.\" But there are no records showing problems with the elevator doors closing on building patrons. The County also included an affidavit from Sheriff's Deputy Colorado who investigated Baker's claim that day. He was not aware of anyone getting injured because elevator doors in the County Courthouse closed on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Baker's response included a copy of a news article reporting that a woman got stuck in one of the elevators the first week of December 2015 (almost a year and half after Baker's incident). The story refers to another \"woman who works at the courthouse\" who said that \"several months ago a County staffer was also trapped in a courthouse elevator.\" Baker mainly relies on a quote in the article from Pat Adauto, identified as the County Public Works Director, who stated that the elevators \"are old\" and \"have not been replaced since the building was built\" (some 28 years ago). Adauto reportedly also stated: \"If we are not at the point, we are near the point of possibly a full replacement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The County responds that we cannot consider this evidence because it is hearsay to which no exception applies. And indeed, the hearsay rules would generally preclude a newspaper article offered for the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Deramus v.

The fact that the elevator trapped someone inside (after Baker's injury) is of no help--it is not specific to elevator number six, or even the same kind of problem that Baker alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nor would the fact that the County knew that the elevators were \"old\" and should be replaced show the kind of knowledge required for a valid licensee-premises-liability claim. In\n   <em>\n    City of Dallas v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   , the court addressed an injury from a cover plate in a walkway that the city knew \"could become loose and raise suddenly or over time with ordinary wear and tear.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343111\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/601/#p603\">\n    210 S.W.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603 (Tex. 2006). This knowledge, however, was not actual knowledge of a premises defect; \"the fact that materials deteriorate over time and may become dangerous does not itself create a dangerous condition, and the actual knowledge required for liability is of the dangerous condition at the time of the accident, not merely of the possibility that a dangerous condition can develop over time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343111\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/601/#p603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    City of Denton v.

At most, Baker raises a suspicion that the County might have known of problems with the elevators, but \"[a]n inference is not reasonable if premised on mere suspicion--'some suspicion linked to other suspicion produces only more suspicion, which is not the same as some evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184765\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/500/380/#p384\">\n    500 S.W.3d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marathon Corp. v.

Our review of the record shows that suit was filed on April 1, 2016 at which time Baker included a request for disclosure, requests for production, and interrogatories to the County. Her first complaint about the County's discovery responses in our record was made through a motion to compel filed on January 11, 2018, the same date Baker filed her response to the plea to the jurisdiction. The motion to compel makes two complaints: (1) the County failed to provide a withholding statement under TEX.R.CIV.P. 193.3 for various redactions made on the elevator maintenance records; and (2) the County failed to respond to a request for production for \"all surveillance tapes, movies or photos of the Plaintiff on the date of the alleged occurrence.\" Apparently, Deputy Sheriff Colorado on the date of the incident viewed surveillance video footage that showed Baker that day enter the courthouse, leave the courthouse, and then return to the courthouse. The County maintained that the video was not saved at that time and was eventually recorded over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to the surveillance tape, Baker does not explain how video of her comings and goings in the courthouse that day would address the issue of the County's prior knowledge of a premise defect. As to her complaint about the redactions to the maintenance records, Baker never set the motion to compel for a hearing, and thus never proved that the motion was meritorious under the requirements of TEX.R.CIV.P. 193.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We grant Issue Two, and render judgment dismissing the premises liability claim against the County for want of jurisdiction.
