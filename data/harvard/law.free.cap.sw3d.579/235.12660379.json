Seals (\"Seals\") seeks a writ of prohibition or mandamus commanding the Honorable Calvin Holden (\"the trial court\") to sustain his motion to dismiss with prejudice Counts I and II, as charged by the second amended felony information, and prohibiting the trial court from conducting any further court proceedings in this matter. This Court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition, and the Greene County Prosecutor's Office filed an answer on behalf of the trial court. For reasons stated below, we now quash the preliminary writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 31, 2014, the State of Missouri (\"the State\") filed an amended felony information charging Seals with the class C felony of domestic assault in the second degree\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count I), for events occurring on March 12, 2013; the class D felony of domestic assault in the third degree\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count II), for events occurring on February 6, 2013; and the class C felony of attempted victim tampering\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count III), for events occurring between March 16, 2013 and April 26, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 6, 2014, a jury trial commenced wherein the jury found Seals\n   guilty of all three counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On direct appeal, Seals asserted the trial court: (1) abused its discretion in admitting evidence of an uncharged assault on the victim; and (2) plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury regarding self-defense for the charge of second-degree domestic assault (Count I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 17, 2016, this Court issued its opinion reversing and remanding for a new trial as to Count I due to instructional error, but affirming as to Counts II and III.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. S.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 23, 2016, in a letter to the trial court, the State dismissed Count I:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 7, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued a mandate in SD33621-1. [Seals'] conviction on Count I, Domestic Assault in the Second Degree, was reversed and remanded for a new trial. In the interest of judicial economy the State dismisses Count I.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 18, 2016, Seals filed an amended Rule 29.15\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   post-conviction relief motion. Seals asserted, in part, that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to include in Seals' direct appeal brief that in the event the trial court reversed the second-degree domestic assault charge (Count I), it must also reverse the victim tampering charge (Count III). Seals argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If [Seals] acted in self-defense as to Count I, then he was not guilty of that offense and there was no victim with which to tamper. In order to convict a defendant of victim tampering, the state must prove that the alleged victim of tampering or attempted tampering was in fact the victim of some crime. If the jury were to acquit [Seals] of the offense of domestic assault in the second degree, it could not convict him of the victim tampering charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held on October 11, 2016. On June 26, 2017, the motion court filed its \"Order Denying Movant's Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment and Sentence Under Rule 29.15.\" The motion court denied Seals' motion finding that no evidence existed that had the claim been included it would have required reversal. The motion court took note of Seals' reliance on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Owens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166112,8165984\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/270/533/\">\n    270 S.W.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2008), but distinguished it because Owens was \"\n   <em>\n    acquitted\n   </em>\n   of the underlying crime[,]\" and Seals was not. (Emphasis in original). The motion court, relying on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Dooley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011967\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/851/683/\">\n    851 S.W.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 1993), indicated that \"[a] defendant need not be found guilty of\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   predicate offense which could render the object of the tampering the 'victim of a crime;' nevertheless, it plainly assumes that the jury must find that the targeted [sic] of the persuasion was the victim of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   underlying offense.\" (Emphasis in original). The motion court found that Seals failed to show that raising this claim on appeal would have resulted in reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Seals appealed the motion court's order, asserting two claims for ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and one claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 29, 2018, this Court issued its opinion affirming the motion court's order as to Seals' claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but found merit in his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\n   counsel.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Seals v.

App. S.D. 2018). Specifically, this Court reversed Seals' victim tampering conviction (Count III) because Seals' appellate counsel should have raised the issue on direct appeal. This Court vacated Seals' conviction and sentence for Count III (victim tampering) because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Nothing in the record reflects any reasonable basis for [appellate counsel]'s decision not to request reversal of the attempted victim tampering conviction where [appellate counsel] had requested reversal of the second-degree domestic assault conviction. [Appellate counsel] did not offer a basis, nor did the motion court, nor the State on appeal. Here, the claimed error was sufficiently serious that it created a reasonable probability that had it been raised, the outcome of the appeal would have been different. [Appellate counsel]'s failure to raise this issue under these circumstances was not a reasonable legal strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Footnote omitted). This Court remanded the case back to the trial court for a new trial on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 27, 2018, the State filed a second amended felony information charging Seals with second-degree domestic assault (Count I), and attempted victim tampering (Count II, previously Count III).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A motion for leave to file the second amended information was also filed, but was never taken up by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 25, 2018, Seals filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice, based on the charges as filed in the second amended felony information, arguing that: (1) Count I was barred by double jeopardy because the State dismissed it after a jury was empaneled; and (2) the State could not proceed on the attempted victim tampering (Count III) without Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A hearing was held on October 19, 2018. At the beginning of the hearing, the State withdrew the second amended felony information and indicated that Count I could not be refiled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Seals' Attorney]: I think, with regard to one of the counts, the State is going to dismiss, or at least that was my understanding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [State]: It's already dismissed. The State had filed the [second] amended information that had not been ruled on yet which brought back the domestic assault second that was reversed on direct appeal. I read [Seals' Attorney's] cases on that, and I agree with him on that count.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   So the State's just withdrawing the [second] amended information that it filed in August. It is just planning to proceed on the original Count 3, attempted victim tampering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The docket entry from the date of that hearing also reflected: \"State withdraws Second Amended Felony Information filed on 8/27/18.\" During the argument, the prosecutor also argued that the victim tampering charge could be brought as a stand-alone offense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [State]: The big distinction between [\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. E.D. 1998) ], which I'm very well aware of, is that in those cases the defendant was acquitted of the underlying charge, and you can't be acquitted of the crime for which the victim is a victim but be convicted of the victim tampering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Seals has not, nor will he ever be found not guilty of the domestic assault in the second degree. It's just not before the Court. The State still has to prove - I'm looking at 329.87 which is the MAI for victim tampering. We will still have to prove to the jury that she was the victim of domestic assault in the second degree, but there doesn't have to be an attached underlying charge; or else, in the case of victim tampering where someone never cooperated with police, we would never be able to file that because there wouldn't be a charge for it to go along with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 7, 2018, Seals' motion to dismiss was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 11, 2019, Seals filed a \"Petition for Writ of Prohibition or Mandamus\" seeking an order from this Court commanding the trial court to sustain his motion to dismiss Counts I and II of the second amended felony information, and prohibiting the trial court from conducting any further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 23, 2019, this Court granted a preliminary writ of prohibition, with briefing to proceed in accordance with Rule 84.24(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In two points, Seals asserts he is entitled to a permanent writ that: (1) prohibits the trial court from taking any further action on Count I, and to grant a dismissal of that count; and (2) prohibits the trial court from conducting a trial on the original Count III, and grant a dismissal of that count because Seals cannot be retried on Count I, and no \"fact finder could be properly instructed to allow them to make a finding of guilt as to Count I and as such Count III is insubmissible as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A writ of prohibition may issue to: (1) prevent the usurpation of judicial power when a lower court lacks authority or jurisdiction; (2) remedy an excess of authority, jurisdiction or abuse of discretion where the lower court lacks the power to act as intended; or when (3) a party may suffer irreparable harm if relief is not granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Seals also argues that this Court should enter \"an order mandating [the trial court] to grant [his] motion to dismiss Count 1 of the original felony information\" because \"prosecution of this matter is barred by double jeopardy[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State dismissed Count I of the original felony information on March 23, 2016.

The relator has the burden of demonstrating its entitlement to a writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Seals argues that \"a conviction for [victim tampering] cannot survive absent a finding of guilt on the crime upon which the victim tampering is dependent[.]\" The premise of this argument is that the dismissal of Count I, via statutory double jeopardy as noted above, forecloses any further prosecution of the victim tampering charge. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The version of section 575.270 in 2013 permitted victim tampering to be brought, without an associated charge, as a stand-alone proceeding.

Furthermore, the controlling rationale in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was that the verdicts were destructively inconsistent.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166112,8165984\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/270/533/\">\n    270 S.W.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Count I has been dismissed with prejudice\n   and will not be submitted to the jury, no inconsistent verdict is possible. Therefore, Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   That said, our opinion only addresses the issue of whether any further prosecution of Seals was foreclosed by the dismissal with prejudice of Count I. \"Prohibition is not generally intended as a substitute for correction of alleged or anticipated judicial errors and it cannot be used to adjudicate grievances that may be adequately redressed in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
