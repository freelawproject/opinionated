(\"Innerimages\" or \"the developer\") filed suit against homeowners Robert Newman, David and Melba White,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and David and Susan Schilt as trustees for the David Schilt and Susan Schilt Trust. It sought to recover unpaid maintenance fees required by the restrictive covenants governing their real property. The homeowners filed a counterclaim, seeking various forms of relief. The homeowners also joined the following third-party defendants: Sandra Gunn, the president of Innerimages, homeowners David and Joan Barrett, and property owner Cupid's Rose, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a bench trial, the court dismissed the collection action filed by the developer. The court determined: (1) that\n   the restrictive covenants are unenforceable as to the four homeowners and their successors in title; (2) that the developer is liable for breach of fiduciary duty for its failure to honor its obligations under the restrictive covenants; and (3) that Sandra Gunn is personally liable under an alter ego theory of piercing the corporate veil. Finally, the court awarded the homeowners damages in the amount of all fees paid since taking ownership of their property or, in the case of the Schilt family, fees paid over the last three years. In a subsequent order, the trial court clarified that only Mr. Newman was entitled to money damages because the other homeowners had not paid fees to the developer during the relevant time period. The court also denied the homeowners' request for attorney's fees. Innerimages, Sandra Gunn, and Cupid's Rose, LLC appeal. Because this appeal presents novel issues relating to the enforceability of restrictive covenants, we take this opportunity to adopt the Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes \u00a7 6.19(1)-(2) (Am. Law Inst. 2000). We modify the trial court's judgment pursuant to the principles set forth in the Restatement. As modified, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Innerimages is a Tennessee corporation. It develops real property in Sevier County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also performs design services for a prominent defense contractor in Maryland. Sandra Gunn is the president and sole shareholder of Innerimages. Ms. Gunn owns a home in Sevierville. At various times, she also resides in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 1993, Innerimages acquired approximately fifteen acres of undeveloped real property located in the \"Shagbark\" neighborhood in Sevierville. Shagbark is a gated community that contains approximately 300 homes and 550 property owners. It provides twenty-four hour security with a guard at its entrance gate. Residents of Shagbark have access to amenities, such as a pool, tennis courts, an office building, and a picnic area. Residents are members of the Shagbark Property Owners Association (POA) and pay dues for maintenance of the amenities described above. Residents must also abide by the Shagbark Declaration of Restrictions (Shagbark Restrictions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 1993, Innerimages recorded an instrument titled \"Land Use Restrictions, Protective Covenants and Building Standards for The Village\" (The Village Restrictions). This document declared the developer's intent to use its recently acquired property in Shagbarks to establish \"The Village\" - a small residential community\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the larger Shagbark property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to The Village Restrictions, property owners in The Village remain residents of Shagbark. Consequently, property owners in The Village must continue to abide by the Shagbark Restrictions and must also pay fees to the Shagbark POA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Village Restrictions impose additional restrictive covenants governing the use and appearance of property in The Village. In some ways, these restrictive covenants are more stringent than the Shagbark Restrictions. The Village Restrictions also require property owners to\n   pay a monthly maintenance fee to the developer - forty dollars per month for an unimproved vacant lot and eighty dollars per month for an improved lot. According to The Village Restrictions, these fees\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   shall be used by The Developer for: the maintenance of THE VILLAGE roadways; the overall security of the development; the maintenance of the utility plants, security entrance features and landscaping; the Shagbark [POA] maintenance fees and assessments when appropriate; and for such other purposes as The Developer or Association pursuant to its bylaws, deem necessary for property maintenance of services. It is anticipated that private recreational facilities will be constructed within THE VILLAGE. Said monthly fees will increase for improved lots in order to defer operational costs, maintenance, insurance and utilities at the time that these recreational facilities are constructed and in use for THE VILLAGE owners and guests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Capitalization in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, The Village Restrictions provide that until seventy-five percent of the lots in The Village have been sold, \"[t]he [d]eveloper shall exercise all rights herein.\" When this occurs, \"[a]ll owners of property shall automatically become members of The Village Property Owners Association,\" and the association will exercise the rights and responsibilities formerly exercised by the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1996, the developer recorded two plats that identified how The Village would be subdivided. Together, the plats depicted eighty-six lots,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   several recreation areas, and a network of private roads. The property would be developed in five phases (Phases A - E). One of the plats showed an \"Inn of the Clouds Conference Center\" and a \"Conference Center &amp; Executive Suites\" adjacent to The Village. At some point, the developer combined various lots, which reduced the total number of lots to eighty-two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since 1993, the developer has only sold six lots in Phase A of The Village.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Four of those lots are improved with homes. One lot, owned by the White family, is used as a septic drain field. The other lot, which is owned by Cupid's Rose, LLC, remained unimproved at the time of trial. Development of Phase B began on the eve of trial. The remainder of the property is unimproved. No property owners association has ever been formed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   David and Susan Schilt purchased their home on Lot 25/12B in March 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, the Schilts lived in Florida. They used their home in The Village as a vacation home and went there about four times a year. In 2012, the Schilts conveyed their home by quitclaim deed to the David Schilt and Susan Schilt Trust. In 2014, they moved from Florida to Seymour and began using their home in The Village about once a month. From 2007 to 2014, the Schilts paid monthly maintenance fees to the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   They stopped paying the fees in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   David and Joan Barrett bought their home on Lot 6A in August 2011. Their permanent residence is in Baxter. When they still owned their home in The Village, they used it about once a month. The Barretts always paid maintenance fees to the developer and did not wish to be parties to this litigation; however, they were subsequently joined as necessary and indispensable parties. After trial, the Barretts sold their home to Daniel Montgomery, who was substituted for the Barretts as an appellee. For convenience sake, we will continue to refer to this property as the Barretts' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Robert Newman purchased his home on Lot 1A in November 2013. He and his wife reside in The Village for about six months of the year. The Newmans also have a home in Louisiana. Mr. Newman paid maintenance fees to the developer in 2014. He stopped paying maintenance fees in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   David and Melba White purchased their home on Lot 26/12B in April 2014. Because the Whites' septic tank was tied to a drain field on Lot 3A, the Whites also purchased Lot 3A. The Whites are permanent residents in The Village. They have never paid maintenance fees to the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This litigation began in February 2015 when the developer filed three sworn accounts against Mr. Newman, the Whites, and the Schilts in the General Sessions Court for Sevier County, seeking the collection of unpaid maintenance fees. According to the developer, Mr. Newman and the Schilts both owed $ 650 plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The Whites allegedly owed $ 1,125 plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs. Each of the three families filed an answer and counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By agreed order, the general sessions court consolidated the three cases and transferred them to the trial court. The trial court ordered the joinder of necessary and indispensable parties. Thereafter, the defendant homeowners filed an amended counterclaim and third party complaint, naming the following third-party defendants: Sandra Gunn, the president of Innerimages, homeowners David and Joan Barrett, and property owner Cupid's Rose, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The homeowners sought the following forms of relief: an order declaring The Village Restrictions to be unenforceable; an order compelling the developer to account for all funds allegedly spent on common expenses; a money judgment equal to the amount of any misappropriated funds; punitive damages for willful or intentional misconduct in the misappropriation or misuse of funds, breach of fiduciary duty, and conflict of interest; an order enjoining the developer from further interference with the homeowners' use of their property; and an award of attorney's fees and costs. The homeowners also alleged that Ms. Gunn should be held personally liable under an alter ego theory of piercing the corporate veil. In response, the developer filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A four-day bench trial followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties stipulated as to the amount of fees that each homeowner allegedly owed. All homeowners, except Mr. Newman, also stipulated that The Village Restrictions were in their respective chains of title. The developer called the following witnesses: Ms. Gunn (the president of Innerimages), Stephen Gunn (Ms. Gunn's ex-husband\n   and the vice-president of Innerimages), Janie Click (a lawn care and maintenance worker), Dan Hager (a board member of the Shagbark POA), Mark Gaisser (security chief and facility manager for Shagbark POA), and Rick Bearfield (an attorney qualified as an expert in title searches). The homeowners called: Mr. Barrett, Ms. Schilt, Mr. Newman, Mr. White, Michael Atchley (an employee of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)), Daniel Ferguson (an environmental specialist for Sevier County Environmental Health Department), and James Temple (former assistant director of the Sevier County Planning Department). Witnesses testified about the relationship between Shagbark and The Village, the enforcement of The Village Restrictions, the services provided (or not provided) by the developer, the developer's lack of accounting, etc. From this testimony, two radically different stories emerged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the appellants, the developer has always intended to use its property to establish a residential community. Ms. Gunn testified about her plans to use The Village to support \"Leslie's Week,\" a non-profit organization founded by Ms. Gunn that gives breast cancer patients and their families a one-week paid vacation. According to Ms. Gunn, the developer will eventually build a \"spa\" in Phase B of The Village and women will be able to rent certain homes in The Village for one week per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Gunn testified that development of The Village has been delayed due to \"downturns in the economy,\" low appraisals, and federal laws that have restricted lending policies. Nevertheless, Ms. Gunn claimed that the developer has invested significant amounts of time and money into the project. According to her, the developer has: graded roads, recorded plats, paid for engineering and surveying services, applied for various permits from regulatory agencies, and installed underground utilities (conduits for electric, telephone, and cable as well as pipes for water and sewer collection). Mr. Gunn, the \"project manager\" of The Village, testified that the developer spent \"close to sixty thousand dollars\" on an experimental \"Anflow system\" that was designed to treat sewage for about sixty homes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Anflow system was never operational,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Gunn testified that it will eventually be modified to operate as a drip system. Ms. Gunn also testified that the developer continues to maintain roads in The Village and pays lawn care workers to weed-eat along the edges of roads, clear debris from ditches and culverts, and mow a drain field that services the septic systems of two homeowners in The Village. Ms. Gunn also testified that she has consistently enforced the architectural review restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the homeowners, The Village is virtually non-existent. The homeowners testified that the developer has only constructed four homes in twenty-four years, the last of which was built in 2007. The community's one paved road - Village Summit Drive - was actually paved pursuant to a private agreement between the homeowners and the developer; costs\n   were shared equally. Although the developer and all residents in The Village have an easement to use the road, the homeowners insist that it rests entirely on their private property. There is also a gravel road leading to the Barretts' home. There was an unresolved factual dispute regarding the extent to which the developer maintained these roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Barretts' home and the Newmans' home have traditional septic tank systems that tie into a common drain field allegedly maintained by the developer. The Schilts' home has a traditional septic tank system that ties into a drain field that the Schilts own and privately maintain. The Whites' septic system is a low pressure piping system that ties into a drain field on Lot 3A, which the Whites own and privately maintain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the developer installed underground utilities (conduits and piping), the homeowners testified that the developer does not provide water. Instead, all four homeowners receive water from a well that is located on the Whites' property. The homeowners entered into a private well agreement that governs their use of the well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2008, the Schilts demanded an accounting from the developer. Other homeowners demanded an accounting in October 2014. Although Ms. Gunn testified that the developer kept records of all expenses, she did not produce a complete accounting until litigation was underway. At trial, Ms. Gunn testified that, until shortly before trial, she deposited the homeowners' maintenance fees into the developer's operating account, which was used to pay expenses incurred by both The Village and Innerimages. Ms. Gunn insisted, however, that she kept track of how the maintenance fees were being spent. The homeowners argued that many of the \"expenses\" listed in the accounting were not \"common expenses.\" The homeowners also alleged that Ms. Gunn comingled funds. Finally, the homeowners testified about Ms. Gunn's enforcement of the architectural review restrictions. All of the homeowners recounted stories of Ms. Gunn's strict interpretation and/or arbitrary application of the restrictions. This became a severe source of distress for the Schilt, Newman, and White families.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After trial, the court produced a forty-page memorandum opinion. Findings of fact and credibility determinations were scattered throughout the court's summary of the testimony and the court's subsequent legal analysis. Although the court did not resolve all factual disputes that arose from the parties' testimony, the court clearly determined that the developer \"cannot and has not fulfilled her obligations to the landowners under [The Village Restrictions].\" The court also found that the developer never intended to relinquish control of The Village to a homeowners association. Instead, the court found that Innerimages \"is used as a business conduit or a place to divert assets to the detriment of creditors\" and is \"purely an instrument for the enrichment of Sandra Gunn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ultimately, the court ruled that The Village Restrictions appear in the homeowners' respective chains of title and \"run with the land.\" However, the court also determined: (1) that the restrictive covenants governing The Village are unenforceable as to the four homeowners and their successors in title; (2) that the developer is liable for breach of fiduciary duty\n   for failing to honor its obligations under The Village Restrictions; and (3) that Sandra Gunn is subject to personal liability under an alter ego theory of piercing the corporate veil. Finally, the court awarded damages to the homeowners in the amount of all fees paid since taking ownership of their respective property or, in the case of the Schilt family, fees paid over the last three years. The court reserved the issue of attorney's fees as well as the calculation of the aforementioned money judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 21, 2018, the trial court entered an order resolving the issues previously reserved. The order stated that only Mr. Newman was entitled to money damages because the other homeowners had not paid fees to the developer during the time period identified in the court's memorandum opinion. The trial court also denied the homeowners' request for attorney's fees. This order was certified as final pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54. Innerimages, Sandra Gunn, and Cupid's Rose, LLC appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We restate and consolidate the issues raised by the appellants as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Whether the trial court committed reversible error by admitting extrinsic evidence that was offered at trial for the purpose of impeaching Ms. Gunn's character for truthfulness?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in holding that The Village Restrictions are unenforceable as to the four homeowners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in determining that the developer owed and breached a fiduciary duty to the homeowners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in piercing the corporate veil to hold Ms. Gunn personally liable for the developer's alleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The homeowners raise the additional issue of whether the trial court erred in denying their request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We begin by considering the potentially dispositive issue of whether the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted extrinsic evidence that was offered at trial for the purpose of impeaching Ms. Gunn's character for truthfulness. Questions regarding the admissibility of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Shipley v. Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318598\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/350/527/#p552\">\n    350 S.W.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552 (Tenn. 2011). Even when a trial court abused its discretion, however, this Court will not reverse the judgment of the trial court \"unless, considering the whole record, error involving a substantial right more probably than not affected the judgment....\" Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Counsel for the homeowners apparently asked the trial court in a post-trial brief to admit into evidence an exhibit that was previously marked for identification purposes only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The exhibit contained several court documents relating to a 1989 judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee that afforded full faith and credit to judgments entered in a Colorado state court in favor of First Federal Savings Bank and against Mr. Gunn and Caltennco-Colorado, Inc. In that case, the federal court concluded that \"Caltennco was a mere alter ego or instrumentality of Stephen A. Gunn, used as a conduit for passing loan proceeds siphoned from [a real estate development] project\n   on to other entities for the personal benefit of Mr. Gunn, his wife Sandra W. Gunn, and the objects of their affections.\" The federal court also determined that Ms. Gunn \"participated knowingly and voluntarily in her husband's fraudulent scheme to divert loan proceeds to personal uses.\" According to the federal court, Mr. and Mrs. Gunn were not credible witnesses. Various documents relating to that federal court case were offered at trial for the purpose of impeaching Ms. Gunn's character for truthfulness. Ms. Gunn's counsel immediately objected, citing Rule 608(b) of the Tennessee Rules of Evidence. The trial court sustained the Rule 608(b) objection but allowed the evidence to be entered as exhibit twenty-five and marked for identification purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In its memorandum opinion, the trial court in this case reversed its earlier evidentiary ruling and admitted exhibit twenty-five into evidence pursuant to Rules 405(b) and 406 of the Tennessee Rules of Evidence. Appellants argue that the trial court erred by admitting this exhibit into evidence. They argued that this error demands outright reversal. According to the appellants, exhibit twenty-five \"played a large role\" in the trial court's judgment because the court heavily relied upon the federal court's memorandum opinions in that exhibit. Appellants also argue that the trial court \"made credibility determinations about witnesses\" based on exhibit twenty-five, which \"colored the entire process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We decline to address whether the trial court erred in admitting exhibit twenty-five into evidence because, after considering the whole record, we cannot say that the evidence \"more probably than not affected the judgment....\" Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b). The trial court primarily relied on the evidence in exhibit twenty-five to substantiate the trial court's own\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   findings that (1) Sandra and Stephen Gunn were not credible witnesses; and (2) that Innerimages is the alter ego of Ms. Gunn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For example, after considering the evidence in exhibit twenty-five, the trial court remarked that the credibility of Ms. Gunn and her ex-husband \"has been destroyed.\" Standing alone, it would appear that the trial court's credibility determination was significantly, if not entirely, based on the evidence in exhibit twenty-five. A closer review of the trial court's memorandum opinion, however, reveals that the court had\n   <em>\n    already independently\n   </em>\n   determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   the credibility of Sandra Gunn and Stephen Gunn had been\n   <em>\n    seriously damaged\n   </em>\n   by their demeanor while testifying and their bold assertions in responding to questions not only at trial but in pretrial depositions without ever producing any evidence to support their claims[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Emphasis added.) To support this conclusion, the court specifically and repeatedly identified portions of the Gunns' testimony that the trial court found incredible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similarly, in the trial court's alter ego/veil-piercing analysis, the court cited a \"very convenient expression of the applicable law\" as set forth in a federal court memorandum opinion in exhibit twenty-five. The quoted passage, however, merely articulated factors that a court should consider when conducting an alter ego/veil-piercing analysis. The trial court proceeded to conduct its own independent analysis and made numerous factual findings based on the testimony and exhibits introduced at trial. Although the trial court also quoted liberally from other passages in the federal court memorandum opinions, the court's purpose in doing so is not entirely clear. Some quotations seem to establish the general relevancy of the evidence (i.e., the names of the parties, overlapping dates, etc.). Other quotations contain harsh\n   language directed at the Gunns, which the trial court apparently incorporated for dramatic effect. On balance, however, it appears that the trial court placed greater weight on its own factual findings and legal analysis than on the evidence presented in exhibit twenty-five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Viewing the trial court's memorandum opinion in its totality, we do not think the court's consideration of exhibit twenty-five \"more probably than not affected the judgment....\" Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b). Consequently, the consideration of exhibit twenty-five, if erroneous, was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Turning to the substantive issues raised in this appeal, we now consider whether The Village Restrictions are enforceable by the developer against the homeowners. This presents a question of law that we review de novo without affording a presumption of correctness to the conclusions of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Harris v.

Mr. Barrett attempted to testify about oral representations made by his real estate agent, but that testimony was excluded by the trial court as inadmissible hearsay.

The developer's primary interest is in completing and selling the project, while that of the purchasers is in maintaining their property values and establishing the quality of life they expected when buying the property. Both the developer and the purchasers have substantial investment interests that are affected by the amount of assessments, the level of maintenance and capital improvements, and the establishment of reserves for future maintenance and replacement of common property. The developer needs to retain control of the association long enough to avoid changes that will jeopardize its ability to sell the remainder, while the purchasers need to stabilize assessments and take charge of the rules governing operation of the community. The longer the developer retains control, the greater the likelihood of conflict. Accordingly, modern common-interest-community statutes specify timetables within which the developer must turn over control to the members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Comment (b) elaborates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In determining when control of a project reasonably must be turned over to the members, the percentage of lots or units that have been sold, the interval since the first unit was sold, and the level of the developer's construction and marketing activities are relevant. The Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act [UCIOA] provides a timetable for turnover\n   of control based on these factors. In the absence of a controlling statute, a court may look for guidance to such a timetable in determining when the developer is required to cede control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Under the UCIOA, the developer of a common-interest community must cede control to a homeowners association under any of the following circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (1) [60] days after conveyance of [three-fourths] of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (2) two years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (3) two years after any right to add new units was last exercised; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (4) the day the declarant, after giving notice in a record to unit owners, records an instrument voluntarily surrendering all rights to control activities of the association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   UCIOA \u00a7 1-103(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Thus, under the Restatement, developers have a\n   <em>\n    common law duty\n   </em>\n   to create an association and to turn over control \"[a]fter the time reasonably necessary to protect its interests in completing and marketing the project[.]\" Rest.

The following excerpt from the court's memorandum opinion is illustrative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Sandra Gunn protected her intention of never relinquishing control of The Village to a Homeowners Association by requiring the sale of 75% of the lots. If that had occurred, the property owners would assume ownership and responsibility of the subdivision, and if not, 'The Developer shall exercise all rights herein.' The idea of a homeowners association was thwarted from the very beginning. These homeowners in this case have received nothing except grief and torment by Sandra Gunn.... She still talks of proposals and when court days get near, the mowing and cleaning up, takes place for the pictures to be taken.... It is not really an overstatement at this point after all the proof is in that nothing in the way of those things set out hereinabove has been accomplished in 24 years, except the building and sale of four (4) homes. In its present condition, the Developer cannot go any further. The Village is at a dead standstill and the poor homeowners are at the mercy of Sandra Gunn....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It is evident from this excerpt that the trial court considered (1) \"the percentage of lots or units that have been sold\"; (2) \"the interval since the first unit was sold\"; and (3) \"the level of the developer's construction and marketing activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rest. (Third) of Property: Servitudes \u00a7 6.19 cmt. b. The trial court also found that the developer had not constructed a new home since 2007. Under the UCIOA, a developer must cede control \"two years after any right to add new units was last\n   exercised.\" UCIOA \u00a7 1-103(d)(3). If that is any measure of reasonableness, then ten years without construction of a new home is patently unreasonable. Although development of Phase B began around the time of trial, we agree with the trial court's implicit determination that these efforts are \"too little too late.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The evidence in the record does not preponderate against the court's finding that the developer has only constructed four homes and provided minimal services in the twenty-four years since The Village's conception. Because the developer has failed to discharge its duty to create a homeowners association and to turn over control \"[a]fter the time reasonably necessary to protect its interests in completing and marketing the project,\" we affirm the judgment of the trial court to the extent that it prohibits the developer from exercising any further control over the defendants and their property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rest. (Third) of Property: Servitudes \u00a7 6.19(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Appellants complain that \"[t]he Trial Court's judgment has left an absolute mess as a practical matter in The Village.\" Specifically, appellants say that the court's ruling raises the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Who will make decisions about what will happen to the private roadways and common areas such as when to pave and when to mow? How would money be collected in order to accomplish these purposes, especially if there is not unanimous agreement among the owners as to what needs to be done, when and at what cost? Without the structure set forth in the Village Restrictions about who maintains the roads and common areas, there is chaos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   There is a simple solution: the developer should\n   <em>\n    create a homeowners association.\n   </em>\n   Once again, the Restatement provides guidance in fashioning an equitable remedy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   In projects with multiple phases that will be developed over a substantial period of time, more flexibility in the required transfer of control may be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Sold-out phases of the project can be given control over the local aspects of the project without jeopardizing the developer's ability to complete the project in accord with the plan.\n   </em>\n   Subassociations can be used to give local control over budgets for maintenance, design review, and rules for common areas in that part of the project, while allowing the developer to retain control over facilities needed to serve remaining unsold or unbuilt phases and facilities needed for marketing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Rest.

The charter and/or bylaws of the association must specify that the association will consist of the defendant homeowners and their successors in title. Members of the association must continue to abide by The Village Restrictions, but the association will have all of the rights and responsibilities of the developer with respect to Lots 1A, 26/12B, 25/12B, 3A, and 6A. The association will also have the responsibility of maintaining the private roads in Phase A that existed at the time of trial.

These property owners will not become members of the association until the developer has sold seventy-five percent of the lots or until \"the time reasonably necessary to protect its interests in completing and marketing the [remaining phases of the] project,\" measured from the date this opinion is filed. When the developer turns over control of the remaining lots, the property owners in the remaining lots will join the association of the defendant homeowners. At that time, the association will take control of the remaining property in The Village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Our holding should not be construed as a license for property owners to escape the consequences of valid restrictive covenants before a developer has had a reasonable opportunity to market and develop the property. Our holding should also not be construed as prohibiting developers from specifying a period of developer control in a declaration of restrictions. We merely hold that a developer cannot rely on such a provision to control property in perpetuity. When the developer's authority to enforce restrictive covenants is challenged, courts should consider the principles in the Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes \u00a7 6.19(1)-(2) in determining whether the developer has discharged its duties to the property owners and/or the property owners association. To the extent that the developer has not discharged its duties under these provisions, courts may exercise their equitable powers to fashion an appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Appellants also challenge the trial court's finding that the developer is liable for breach of fiduciary duty. With respect to this issue, the trial court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   The next issue of whether or not Sandra Gunn has a fiduciary duty owing to these landowners, is easy to answer. She definitely does. In this case someone must have such a duty. There is no one else but Sandra Gunn, and she stated in her deposition that she did have a fiduciary duty, and for all the reasons stated thus far, she has breached her duties under the covenants and restrictions duly signed and acknowledged before a notary public by the President of Innerimages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As an initial matter, Tennessee law recognizes two types of fiduciary relationships: relationships that are fiduciary per se (e.g., attorney/client, guardian/ward) and relationships that are \"confidential\" due to one party's ability to exercise \"dominion and control\" over another party.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Foster Business Park, LLC v.

We will not disturb that finding of fact. Pursuant to The Village Restrictions, the developer dictated rules regarding the appearance and use of all property in The Village. The developer also had the authority to impose assessments on property owners. No deviation from The Village Restrictions was permitted without the developer's approval. The developer also retained the sole right to amend the restrictions until an association was formed. Because the evidence demonstrates that the developer exercised dominion and control over the homeowners, there was a confidential fiduciary relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Courts in other jurisdictions have also held that developers owe fiduciary duties to homeowners and homeowners associations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Laurel Road Homeowners Association, Inc. v.

Reasoning by analogy, some courts compare real estate developers to promoters of a corporation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Both are entrusted by interested investors to bring about a viable organization to serve a specific function.

We think this analogy is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, the trial court found that the developer was liable for breach of fiduciary duty because the developer \"breached her duties under [The Village Restrictions.]\" We interpret the trial court's ruling as a determination that the developer did not act in good faith in continuing to develop the property and in providing the services promised under The Village Restrictions. Although the trial court did not resolve all factual disputes with respect to the developer's alleged misuse of funds, it is undisputed that the developer failed to produce an accounting until the discovery phase of this litigation. The evidence does not preponderate against the trial court's findings with respect to this issue.

For example, the court noted that no stock certificates were issued to Ms. Gunn; Ms. Gunn was the sole shareholder of Innerimages; the \"office\" of Innerimages is Ms. Gunn's home; Ms. Gunn and Innerimages use the same bank; and Ms. Gunn and Innerimages hired the same attorneys. The court further remarked that the developer's business dealings with Ms. Gunn's ex-husband were \"suspect\" and had \"the appearance of impropriety.\" We also note that Ms. Gunn and Innerimages hired the same employees - Jamie and Wayne Click - to perform lawn care and maintenance services. The court's findings implicate at least one third of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Allen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   factors and each finding weighs in favor of piercing the corporate veil.
