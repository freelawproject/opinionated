Because we find Pinnell adduced substantial evidence that at the time of his fall from the South Oak Street bridge in Union, the City's property was in a dangerous condition precluding the entry of a directed verdict, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arose from the injuries Pinnell sustained on September 9, 2015 when he lost his balance while sitting on the headwall of a short bridge or culvert\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on South Oak Street, a public roadway in Union, and fell 13 feet down into the creek below. The features of the bridge relevant to this case included north-south traffic lanes, a pedestrian sidewalk separated from the traffic lanes by a curb, and a headwall from which Pinnell fell, located immediately adjacent to the sidewalk. The\n   term \"headwall\" refers to a curb-like structure approximately 18 to 20 inches high and 18 to 20 inches wide, running parallel to the road surface along the westernmost edge of the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pinnell filed a one-count negligence lawsuit against the City alleging that it maintained the bridge with its sidewalk and headwall in a dangerous condition that caused his fall and injuries. Specifically, he averred that where Oak Street passed over the creek, at a height of 13 feet from the creek bed to the bridge surface, the City \"maintained a sidewalk for pedestrian use\" on the western side of the roadway, \"thereby encouraging pedestrian traffic thereupon,\" even though between the sidewalk and the precipitous drop down to the creek there was only a curb-like structure approximately 18 to 20 inches high-the headwall-which was substantially shorter than the average person's center of gravity. He further alleged that the City, by maintaining such a low headwall, \"encourage[d], entice[d], or otherwise invite[d] the public to sit upon\" it. As a result, Pinnell claimed, the City failed to \"adequately protect\" the public from the foreseeable risk of falling over the headwall and into the creek below, and therefore the City's premises were in a dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pinnell filed a one-count negligence lawsuit against the City alleging that it maintained the bridge with its sidewalk and headwall in a dangerous condition that caused his fall and injuries. Specifically, he averred that where Oak Street passed over the creek, at a height of 13 feet from the creek bed to the bridge surface, the City \"maintained a sidewalk for pedestrian use\" on the western side of the roadway, \"thereby encouraging pedestrian traffic thereupon,\" even though between the sidewalk and the precipitous drop down to the creek there was only a curb-like structure approximately 18 to 20 inches high-the headwall-which was substantially shorter than the average person's center of gravity.

As a result, Pinnell claimed, the City failed to \"adequately protect\" the public from the foreseeable risk of falling over the headwall and into the creek below, and therefore the City's premises were in a dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City, for its part, claimed that it enjoyed sovereign immunity under \u00a7 537.600.1 from Pinnell's lawsuit. During the pretrial phase of the case, the City filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings contending that Pinnell failed to adequately allege a dangerous condition required to bring his lawsuit within the statute's express waiver of sovereign immunity for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on a public entity's property. Specifically, the City argued (1) that Pinnell failed to identify a physical defect in the property at issue and (2) that Pinnell's injuries resulted solely from his misuse of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied the City's motion and the case proceeded to trial. There, Pinnell's expert testified that \"the general rule of thumb for culverts is if you have ... sidewalks within 36 inches of the potential fall area you need the railing at ... 42 inches [in height].\" The expert reasoned that the \"general engineering theory about why you need a 42-inch high guardrail\" is \"based on an average person's center of gravity\"-that \"they're not going to walk up to [the headwall] and trip over it and fall\" because \"[i]t's going to stop them.\" He concluded that maintaining a sidewalk next to a 13-foot drop without a 42-inch-high barrier constituted a \"dangerous and defective condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City's engineer, testifying as an expert, agreed the consensus standard to be\n   that \"42 inches is the minimum barrier necessary to provide reasonable safety for pedestrians in the proximity of fall-offs of more than 30 inches.\" He testified that anything less would not be \"reasonably safe\" and would present a \"hazard.\" He also testified it was foreseeable that members of the public would sit on an 18-to-20 inch headwall, and that if the public were permitted to sit on such a headwall with a 13-foot drop on one side, he \"would recognize that condition as a danger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several other witnesses testified that they had seen people sit on the headwall before including children that had been playing in the area and adults smoking cigarettes. And both experts agreed that while the condition of the headwall and adjacent sidewalk had remained the same for more than a decade, nothing prevented the City during that time from raising the height of the headwall or introducing some other barrier to meet minimum safety standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the close of Pinnell's case-in-chief, the City filed its motion for a directed verdict asserting that Pinnell had failed to make a submissible case for waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 537.600.1 because, it claimed, he had not presented substantial evidence of a dangerous condition. The City argued again that Pinnell failed to show a physical defect in the premises, and that his injuries resulted solely from his misuse of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on each of those arguments, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of the City. Pinnell filed a motion for new trial, which was denied, asserting that he made a submissible case for waiver of the City's sovereign immunity because he presented substantial evidence, such as the above-noted testimony of his expert and the City's engineer, that the City maintained the public property in question in a dangerous and defective condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the trial court's grant of a directed verdict.\n   <em>\n    Oyler v.

We find Pinnell met this burden and therefore the trial court erred by concluding that he failed to establish grounds for waiver of the City's sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Specifically, we disagree with the trial court that Pinnell failed to present substantial evidence of a\n   <em>\n    dangerous condition\n   </em>\n   of the public property at issue. We find that the trial court's error stems from its erroneously narrow interpretation of what constitutes a dangerous condition within the meaning of \u00a7 537.600.1, The trial court reasoned that the \"dangerous condition\" element of the statute can only be satisfied with evidence that the headwall suffered from some purely physical and\n   <em>\n    intrinsic\n   </em>\n   defect such as \"rotten\" or crumbling concrete that gave way causing Pinnell's fall and injuries.

So, a jury reasonably could have found it was foreseeable that Pinnell might fall from the headwall down into the creek and be injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While there may be no evidence of an\n   <em>\n    intrinsic\n   </em>\n   physical defect, there is substantial evidence of a dangerous condition. The location of the sidewalk between the roadway and the 13-foot drop with a less-than-two-foot wall to keep pedestrians from tumbling down to the creek below\n   <em>\n    posed a physical threat or danger to the public\n   </em>\n   , including Pinnell. So Pinnell did not fail to present substantial evidence that the juxtaposition of the sidewalk, headwall, and 13-foot drop-off constituted a dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, the very opinions that the trial court here relied on for its erroneously restrictive interpretation of \"dangerous condition\" as being limited to intrinsic physical defects only, do not actually support the trial court's interpretation because they use the phrase \"physical defect\" with a much broader scope.\n   <em>\n    Necker by Necker v.

Therefore, any alleged misuse should have been an issue for the jury in apportioning comparative fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Mo. Bank, N.A. v. City of Grandview,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124475\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/105/890/#p896\">\n    105 S.W.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (Mo.App.W.D. 2003) (\"The negligence of the defendant need not be the sole cause of the injury, as long as it is one of the efficient causes thereof, without which injury would not have resulted.... Ordinarily, causation is an issue that should be left to the trier of fact.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, because Pinnell also made a submissive case on every other element of the \"dangerous condition\" waiver of sovereign immunity-indeed, the question was little disputed beyond whether Pinnell demonstrated a \"dangerous condition\" at all-we conclude that the City's motion for a directed verdict should have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The structure in question was referred to during the lawsuit as a \"culvert\" and as a \"bridge.\" For ease of understanding, we will use the term \"bridge\" in this opinion and note that the difference is immaterial for purposes of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The City also argues for the first time on appeal here that the trial court's actions should be upheld because if there was a dangerous condition in evidence, it was open and obvious\n    <em>\n     as a matter of law\n    </em>\n    . To the extent this contention can properly be considered on appeal even though not raised in the trial court, we find that on this record an open-and-obvious defense would at most raise a\n    <em>\n     factual\n    </em>\n    dispute for the jury. For Pinnell has presented substantial evidence from which a jury might reasonably conclude that an open-and-obvious defense must fail. The Missouri Supreme Court confirmed in\n    <em>\n     Harris v. Niehaus\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995814\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/857/222/#p226\">\n     857 S.W.2d 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 226 (Mo.banc 1993) that even where a dangerous condition readily presented itself, the defendant landowner may nevertheless be found liable if it should still have anticipated the sort of harm that resulted. The question is whether \"the risk of harm exist[ed] only if the plaintiff fail[ed] to exercise due care,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995814\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/857/222/#p226\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995814\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/857/222/#p226\">\n     at 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Where, as here, there is substantial evidence that such a risk existed\n    <em>\n     regardless\n    </em>\n    of whether Pinnell exercised due care, the open-and-obvious defense is a jury issue. Indeed, in such circumstances, \"[a]n invitee's knowledge of an obvious danger is considered in determining the invitee's\n    <em>\n     comparative negligence\n    </em>\n    rather than in determining the duty of the owner.\"\n    <em>\n     Eide v. Midstate Oil Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995462\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/895/35/#p39\">\n     895 S.W.2d 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 39 (Mo.App.W.D. 1995) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
