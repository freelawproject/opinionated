BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee Jonathan Drake was injured in a single-person motor vehicle accident. Appellee contends Appellant Recbar, LLC negligently served him alcoholic beverages when it knew or should have known he was intoxicated, resulting in his injuries. Appellant moved for summary judgment under KRS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   413.241, Kentucky's Dram Shop Act, on the basis that the statute does not permit \"first-party\" claims against dram shops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 1, 2019, the trial court entered an order denying Appellant's motion for summary judgment. The order provides: \"[t]he Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact and that summary judgment is not appropriate.\" The order does not contain finality language under CR\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   54.02. Appellant filed a \"Notice of Interlocutory Appeal\" on March 29, 2019. Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"A final or appealable judgment is a final order adjudicating all the rights of all the parties in an action or proceeding, or a judgment made final under Rule 54.02.\" CR 54.01. Ordinarily, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is considered interlocutory and not appealable.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Prater asserted the Board was negligent in its maintenance of the residence. The Board filed a motion to dismiss the complaint \"on the ground that it is absolutely immune from damages claims brought in court, as opposed to the Board of Claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301742\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/292/883/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301742\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/292/883/\">\n    at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court denied the motion to dismiss.
