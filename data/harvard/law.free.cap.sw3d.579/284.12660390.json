For the reasons explained below, we affirm Defendant's convictions, but remand to correct a clerical error in the trial court's written judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Considering the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, the following evidence was adduced at trial as is relevant to this appeal. J.C. (\"Victim\") was in a relationship and lived with Defendant for almost a year. During the afternoon or evening of June 6, 2016, there was an argument, Defendant pushed Victim down, got on top of her and choked her. After she got back up, he pushed her down a second time, she got up again, and he \"came after [her] with a knife.\" Victim \"held up [her] arm to protect [herself,]\" and the knife cut her dominant right arm. She wrapped up her arm with a towel and the police were called. The cut left a 2-3 inch scar on Victim's arm and marks were found on her throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's theory at trial was that Victim had mental health problems and her injuries were self-inflicted, specifically, that she was \"a cutter.\" Prior to trial which began on February 1, 2018, Defendant filed two pre-trial motions on January 25, 2018 related to Victim's mental health records: (1) a motion for a court order compelling the production of Victim's mental health records for the period of time from January 1, 2015 to July 31, 2015;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   (2) a motion to compel \"an [\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ] review of records and subpoenas duces tecum filed by the Defendant on the Custodian of Records for Cox Medical Center.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State opposed these motions, noting that Defendant had not alleged any specific facts to show how the mental health records were relevant. Defendant filed amended suggestions on January 30, 2018 in support of his request (\"amended suggestions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After oral argument, the trial court denied Defendant's motions on January 30, 2018. The trial court's order stated that the court \"finds that the records which Defendant [asks] to have reviewed are privileged records and protected by the provisions of RSMo \u00a7 491.060. As such, Defendant's motion for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A jury found Defendant guilty of domestic assault in the second degree (count 1) and domestic assault in the third degree (count 2). As to count 1, the court orally sentenced Defendant to 12 years in the custody of the Department of Corrections, and as to count 2, he was orally sentenced to one year in the county jail with that sentence to run concurrently. Defendant was sentenced as a prior and persistent offender. Defendant timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because Defendant's point relates to the trial court's decision not to compel the production of Victim's medical records as part of discovery, it is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

A review of those records was \"necessary to determine whether [Victim] had engaged in self-harm through cutting\" because the \"main theory\" of his defense was that Victim, not Defendant, had harmed herself.

We hold that the trial court's decision to deny the Defendant's motion to compel disclosure or, in the alternative for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the requested records, was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We note that the trial court's judgment contains a clerical error that mislabels Defendant's count 2 conviction as a class D felony instead of a class A misdemeanor. At the sentencing hearing, the court recognized Defendant's count 2 conviction as a class A misdemeanor, and orally sentenced Defendant to one year in the county jail on count 2. The amended judgment signed on May 25, 2018 erroneously listed the count 2 charge as a class D felony. In a criminal case, clerical errors in the sentence and judgment \"may be corrected by an order\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   if the written judgment does not reflect what actually was done.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.
