On appeal, Middleton contends that the circuit court erred in denying Middleton's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to show that Middleton was not acting in self-defense at the time of the murder. We affirm. For the reasons explained more fully in a memorandum provided to the parties, we affirm Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
