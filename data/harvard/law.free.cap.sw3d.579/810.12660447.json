(\"the Federation\") for defamation and tortious interference with prospective business relations. In response, the Federation moved to dismiss Day's lawsuit pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation Act (\"TCPA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 27.001 -.011. The trial court granted the Federation's motion to dismiss and awarded it $ 83,292.50 in attorney's fees. Day filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In four issues, Day argues the trial court erred by (1) denying his motion to strike an affidavit, (2) dismissing his suit because the TCPA did not apply, (3) dismissing his suit because he established a prima facie case for both defamation and tortious interference, and (4) awarding the Federation $ 83,292.50 in attorney's fees. We overrule Day's issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Texas State Medical Board (\"the Board\") is a state agency that regulates the practice of medicine in Texas. TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 152.001(a). In June 2011, the Board temporarily suspended Day's medical license and commenced administrative proceedings against him. The suspension was prompted by complaints of \"boundary violations\" made by six individuals, including several of Day's patients, and Day's arrest and indictment for sexual assault arising from one of these complaints. A\n   jury convicted Day of sexual assault, but the conviction was set aside when the trial court granted a new trial. The criminal charges against Day were eventually dismissed. In addition, four of the six complainants refused to cooperate in the Board's administrative investigation. By early 2017, only one of the complaints remained pending before the State Office of Administrative Hearings. On March 3, 2017, Day and the Board entered into an \"Agreed Order,\" which resolved the remaining administrative complaint, lifted the suspension of Day's medical license, and imposed numerous restrictions on Day's practice of medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federation maintains a website that provides physician data, including sanctions reported by state licensing boards. The part of the Federation's website known as the \"Physician Data Center\" contains a profile for each physician, including his or her licensure history, education, training, and biographical information. The Federation received the Agreed Order from the Texas Medical Board and, under the heading, \"Board Actions,\" posted the following information on its website pertaining to Day:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Reporting Entity: Texas Medical Board\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Date of Order: 3/3/2017\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Form of Order: Agreed Order\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Action(s): RESTRICTIONS/LIMITATIONS PLACED ON MEDICAL LICENSE/PRACTICE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Basis: Unprofessional Conduct\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Day complained to the Federation that the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was false and insisted that it be removed from his profile. Day asserted that the restrictions the Board placed on his return to practice were based solely on the fact that he had not practiced for six years because of his suspension. The Federation responded to Day's complaint by asking the Board if the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was accurate. The Board advised the Federation that the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was \"a true, fair, and accurate description of the Agreed Order.\" The Federation declined to remove the statement from its website. Thereafter, Day sued the Federation for defamation and tortious interference with prospective business relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Federation moved to dismiss Day's suit pursuant to the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.003 (providing a party may file a motion to dismiss a legal action based on, related to, or in response to its exercise of the right to free speech). The Federation's motion was supported by the affidavit of Scott Freshour, the Board's interim executive director, and other evidence. Day filed a response to the motion to dismiss, to which he attached his own affidavit and other evidence. After a hearing, the trial court signed an order granting the Federation's motion to dismiss.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.). Here, the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying Day's motion to strike. First, the TCPA expressly authorizes the trial court to consider affidavits in deciding a motion to dismiss. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.006(a) (\"In determining whether a legal action should be dismissed under this chapter, the court shall consider the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts on which the liability or defense is based.\").

In\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court recognized, in the context of an appeal of an administrative order, that the reviewing court could \"consider only what was written by the Commission in its order\" and \"measure its statutory sufficiency by what [the order] says.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10119729\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/498/147/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10119729\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/498/147/#p152\">\n    at 149, 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This rule does not apply to appellate review of a dismissal order under the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Day's motion to strike Freshour's affidavit, we overrule Day's third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABILITY OF THE TCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his second issue, Day argues the trial court erred in granting the Federation's motion to dismiss because the Federation failed to show that the TCPA applies to his claims. Whether the parties have satisfied their respective burdens under the TCPA is an issue that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Elkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657249\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/553/596/#p603\">\n    553 S.W.3d at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In arguing that the TCPA does not apply to his claims, Day argues that \"[t]ypically, SLAPP suits are filed by large businesses and other deep-pocketed entities to silence criticism aimed at them by average citizens,\" but in this case the \"corporate goliath seeking to suppress the [First] [A]mendment rights of a small, helpless [p]laintiff simply does not exist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Day misstates the criteria for determining the applicability of the TCPA.

According to Day's petition, the Federation \"falsely pos[t]ed in its physician data center that the basis of the Agreed Order was 'Unprofessional Conduct.' \" Day's petition further alleges that the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement on the Federation's website was false because the Agreed Order contained \"no adverse findings\" regarding Day's \"professional competence or conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, Day does not dispute that he was required to establish the falsity of the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement. Day argues that he met his burden as to this element of defamation, relying on the Agreed Order itself. Given Day's argument, we carefully examine the contents of the Agreed Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Agreed Order states that the \"charges\" before the Board were allegations that Day had \"engaged in unprofessional conduct including boundary violations with respect to six women, several of whom were patients.\" It further states that a formal complaint was filed with the State Office of Administrative Hearings, but that before proceeding to a hearing on the merits, \"the parties engaged in negotiations and reached this settlement.\" The Agreed Order contains numerous findings, including: (1) that Day was convicted of one count of sexual assault; (2) that Day's conviction was overturned based on misconduct by both the defense attorneys and the prosecutors; (3) that Day's criminal case was eventually dismissed when the complainants refused to testify at trial; (4) that four of the five complainants refused to cooperate in the administrative case; (5) that Day was still the subject of one formal complaint at the State Office of Administrative Hearings \"regarding allegations of unprofessional conduct in his medical practice;\" (6) that the Board considered \"[m]itigating [f]actors\" in determining \"appropriate sanctions in this matter;\" and that (7) Day \"agree[d] to the entry of this Agreed Order\" \"[t]o avoid further investigation, hearings, and the expense and inconvenience of litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Agreed Order also contains \"Conclusions of Law,\" some of which cite to Chapter 164 of the Occupations Code, the Texas statutory scheme governing disciplinary actions for physicians. Among other things, the conclusions of law state that Chapter 164 \"authorizes the Board to take disciplinary action against [Day] based upon [Day's] unprofessional or dishonorable conduct\" and \"authorizes the Board to impose a range of disciplinary actions against a person for violations of the [Occupations Code].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 164.052(a)(5) ; 164.001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Agreed Order lifts the suspension of Day's medical license under certain terms and conditions. Specifically, the Agreed Order requires Day to participate in a proctorship, whereby his medical work is supervised by another physician for approximately six months. The supervising physician is required to report to the Board about whether Day has the skills, abilities, and knowledge to return to the practice of medicine. The Agreed Order also requires Day (1) to limit his medical practice to a group or institutional setting, (2) to continue the practice of having at least one other health care professional in the room when seeing or treating patients, (3) to keep a log of his patient interactions, (4) to have the other health care professional contemporaneously initial the log entries, and (5) to provide a copy of the\n   Agreed Order to all health care entities with which he affiliates or seeks to affiliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Day argues the Agreed Order itself establishes the falsity of the Federation's \"unprofessional conduct\" statement. Emphasizing that the Agreed Order does not contain an explicit finding that he engaged in \"unprofessional conduct,\" Day contends the Agreed Order shows that the restrictions imposed on him had \"nothing to do with any misconduct.\" Day further contends the Agreed Order shows that the purpose of the restrictions imposed on him was to ensure that his \"skills had not atrophied during his hiatus from practice.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Both the language and the effect of the Agreed Order support the Federation's statement that the \"basis\" of the order was \"unprofessional conduct.\" The Agreed Order expressly states that it is the result of a settlement between Day and the Board and that it resolves the remaining complaint that Day had engaged in \"unprofessional conduct including boundary violations.\" Additionally, the Agreed Order explains that the Board considered \"mitigating factors\" in deciding \"appropriate sanctions\" for Day. The use of the word \"sanctions\" indicates that the purpose of the Agreed Order, at least in part, was to administer disciplinary action against Day. Furthermore, in addition to requiring Day to be supervised by another physician while performing medical procedures and requiring the supervising physician to provide feedback to the Board, the Agreed Order imposes numerous other restrictions on Day's practice of medicine, including requiring Day to have another health professional in the room while seeing patients, requiring Day to keep a log of his patient interactions, and requiring Day to practice medicine only in a group or institutional setting. Finally, the Agreed Order operates to resolve the remaining \"unprofessional conduct\" charge against Day, lift the temporary suspension of Day's license, and impose restrictions on Day's practice of medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We conclude the Agreed Order does not demonstrate, by clear and specific evidence, the falsity of the Federation's \"unprofessional conduct\" statement. To the contrary, when considered in its entirety, the Agreed Order shows that the Federation's statement that the \"basis\" of the order was \"unprofessional conduct\" was substantially true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally, the evidence in this case includes the affidavit of the Board's interim executive director, Freshour, who testified that the Board suspended Day's medical license and began conducting a disciplinary review of Day based on allegations of unprofessional conduct; that this review lasted several years; that the Board and Day entered into the Agreed Order on March 3, 2017; that the Board forwarded the Agreed Order to the Federation; and that after Day complained about the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement on the Federation's website, the Board advised the Federation that this statement was \"a true, fair, and accurate description of the Agreed Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After examining the pleadings and the evidence, we conclude that Day did not present clear and specific evidence sufficient as a matter of law to establish the falsity of the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Day argues that he was required to establish that the Federation acted negligently with regard to the truth of the statement because he is a private individual. The Federation counters that Day was required to establish that the Federation acted with actual malice. We will assume, without deciding, that the requisite degree of fault in this case is negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the defamation context, negligence is defined \"as the failure to investigate the truth or falsity of a statement before publication, and the failure to act as a reasonably prudent person.\"\n   <em>\n    Harwood v.

App.-Waco 2012, pet. denied). Therefore, to establish a prima facie case as to the requisite degree of fault, Day was required to establish, by clear and specific evidence, that the Federation knew or should have known that the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203712167\">\n    2017 WL 3712167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 ;\n   <em>\n    Harwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202791321\">\n    2017 WL 2791321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Initially, we note that Day's petition does not include specific facts to support his contention that the Federation acted negligently. The only reference to negligence in Day's petition is a statement that the Agreed Order contains \"insufficient underlying Findings of Facts to support any conclusion of law and renders the [Federation's] postings to be arbitrary, capricious, libelous, and negligent.\" Thus, Day's petition fails to point to the clear and specific evidence that is required when the TCPA is implicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 590-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, Day's response to the motion to dismiss states only that the Federation \"was given the opportunity to alter its posting to reflect the correct findings of the order and despite an in-depth explanation, refused to do so. Therefore, the requisite degree of fault on the part of the [Federation] is evident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Despite the lack of specificity in Day's pleadings, we will consider the evidence as it relates to this element of Day's defamation claim. In arguing on appeal that he established a prima facie case regarding the requisite degree of fault, Day focuses on several documents attached to his affidavit: (1) the Agreed Order, (2) the emails Day sent to the Federation complaining that its \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was false, and (3) the description of the Agreed Order on the Board's website. We disagree that this evidence establishes the Federation's negligence with respect to the truth or falsity of the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As discussed in the previous section, the Agreed Order supports the Federation's \"unprofessional conduct\" statement and shows this statement is not false. Furthermore, the emails show that when the Federation\n   received a complaint from Day about the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement, it contacted the Board about the accuracy of this statement, and the Board advised the Federation that the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement accurately reflected the basis of the Agreed Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Day maintains that the Federation's negligence is established by comparing the description of the Agreed Order posted on the Board's website with the Federation's statement. However, this is not a valid comparison. The Federation posted its \"unprofessional conduct\" statement in 2017, but the description of the Agreed Order posted on the Board's website is dated June 28, 2018. Furthermore, no other evidence shows the Federation was aware of or should have been aware of the description posted on the Board's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203712167\">\n    2017 WL 3712167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (stating in a defamation case that \"[b]ecause the evidence did not show [the defendant] was aware of the report, the evidence could not have conclusively proved the report put [the defendant] on notice that her statements were false.\"). Therefore, we conclude the evidence does not establish that the Federation knew or should have known that its \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To defeat the Federation's motion to dismiss, Day was required to present clear and specific evidence \"sufficient as a matter of law to establish [the Federation's negligence] if it is not rebutted or contradicted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the record shows that the Federation failed to investigate the truth or falsity of the statement, that the Federation failed to act reasonably, or that the Federation knew or should have known the statement was false when it made it. Rather, the evidence shows that the Federation's statement was substantially true, that the Federation responded to Day's complaint by consulting with the Board about the statement's accuracy, and that the Board confirmed that the statement was accurate. After considering the pleadings and the evidence, we conclude that Day failed to establish, by clear and specific evidence, a prima facie case that the Federation acted negligently with regard to the truth of its \"unprofessional conduct\" statement. Therefore, Day failed to meet his burden to establish a prima facie case regarding the requisite degree of fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because Day failed to satisfy his burden to establish, by clear and specific evidence, a prima facie case as to at least two elements of his defamation claim, the trial court did not err in dismissing this claim under the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To establish a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations, a plaintiff must establish (1) a reasonable probability the plaintiff would have entered into a business relationship with a third party, (2) the defendant acted with a conscious desire to prevent the relationship from occurring or knew the interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its conduct, (3) the defendant's conduct was independently tortious or unlawful, (4) the defendant's interference proximately caused the plaintiff's injury, and (5) as a result the plaintiff suffered actual damage or loss.\n   <em>\n    Coinmach Corp. v.

Day's petition shows that his tortious interference claim was premised on the Federation's \"unprofessional conduct\" statement. According to Day's petition, Day \"operate[d] in a highly competitive [field] and maintain[ed] his competitive edge by virtue of his business relationships and by his Board Certification\" \"and by his ability to be accepted on insurance panels,\" which the \"unprofessional conduct\" statement \"prevents him from doing.\" Day's petition further alleges the Federation \"knew interference with his ability to obtain the above was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of the publication\" of the statement and that the Federation's \"willful and intentional interference was the proximate cause of actual harm and/or damages\" to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On appeal, Day argues he met his burden to demonstrate a prima facie case for tortious interference with prospective business relations. The third element of Day's claim-whether he established that the Federation's conduct was independently tortious-is dispositive. Day argues that he established a prima facie case that the Federation's conduct was independently tortious, relying exclusively on his contention that the Federation's \"unprofessional conduct\" statement was defamatory. But as previously discussed, Day failed to present clear and specific evidence to establish a prima facie case as to at least two elements of his defamation claim, the falsity of the statement and the requisite degree of fault. Therefore, we conclude Day failed to satisfy his burden to establish, by clear and specific evidence, a prima facie case that the Federation's conduct was independently tortious or wrongful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Der Linden v.
