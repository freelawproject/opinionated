Susano, Jr., J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal concerns the proper method of invoking a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction in a proceeding to modify a permanent parenting plan. About one year after the parties' divorce, Travis Freeman (father) filed a petition to modify the court-ordered custody arrangement and attached a proposed permanent parenting plan pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-405\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wendy Freeman (mother) opposed the requested modification. The trial court subsequently entered two orders gradually expanding father's co-parenting time. Later, father filed another motion seeking greater expansion of his co-parenting time and/or designation as the primary residential parent. Father did not attach a new proposed parenting plan to this motion. Ultimately, the trial court ordered a new permanent parenting plan that retained mother as the primary residential parent but granted father additional\n   co-parenting time. Mother appeals. She argues that father did not properly invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction because father did not attach a new proposed parenting plan to his most recent motion to modify the custody arrangement. We agree with mother that father was statutorily required to submit a new proposed parenting plan pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-405\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; nevertheless, we hold that father's petition to modify the parenting plan was sufficient to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The material facts of this case are not in dispute. In 2013, the domestic relations court for Meigs County\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted mother and father a divorce and established a permanent parenting plan that the parties agreed was in the best interest of their child, I.H.F. The permanent parenting plan designated mother as the primary residential parent and awarded father supervised visitation for two hours every Saturday. The court's order also provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [a]fter January, 2014, should [father] so desire, he may request to remove the supervised requirement and to expand visitation by sending a letter to [mother's] attorney. If this request is denied, [father] may file a petition requesting a change if there has been a change in circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 7, 2014, father filed a petition to modify the custody arrangement and attached a proposed permanent parenting plan pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-405\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Under father's proposed parenting plan, mother would continue to parent the child during the week while school was in session and father would parent the child every weekend from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. During the summer, the residential schedule would be flipped. In addition, father's proposed plan divided holidays equally. On December 29, 2015, the court entered an order that modified the residential schedule by granting father unsupervised visitation from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. every Saturday \"for a period of one year after which Father can petition the court for further modification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 7, 2016, before the one-year period had elapsed, father filed a motion for the early expansion of his co-parenting time. On August 11, 2016, after a hearing on father's motion, the court ordered \"[t]hat the father's co-parenting time shall be extended to overnight visits from Saturday at 10:00 a.m. through Sunday evening at 6:00 p.m. beginning on the first weekend in October, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 31, 2017, father filed another motion requesting the court to \"expand his co-parenting time and/or grant him primary parenting status.\" After a hearing on father's motion, the court entered an order that included the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The father started off this case back in November 2014 and the Court instructed him then that this would be a slow and gradual process and the Court is impressed with and appreciative of the father's efforts in building and maintaining a relationship with the minor child as well as his efforts that have resolved any child support arrearage issue[s] that the father had when he first filed his petition to modify the permanent parenting\n   plan and request for additional co-parenting time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Accordingly, on September 27, 2017, the court ordered a new permanent parenting plan that granted father \"standard co-parenting time\" during the school year (every other weekend from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.) and equal co-parenting time during the summer (alternating weeks from Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.). The court also divided holidays equally between both parents. The court indicated that this order was a \"final judgment.\" Mother appealed directly to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mother raises one issue for our review: whether father failed to properly invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction because father did not attach a new proposed permanent parenting plan to his January 31, 2017 motion to modify custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A determination of whether a trial court had subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo, without affording a presumption of correctness to the trial court's finding.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Redwing v.

As discussed above, father first invoked the trial court's jurisdiction on November 7, 2014, when he filed a petition to modify and attached a proposed parenting plan. Mother concedes that father's November 7, 2014 petition fully complied with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-405\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Mother argues, however, that once the court entered a final judgment modifying the parenting plan, father was required to file a new proposed parenting plan with any subsequent petition to modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As we see it, this case turns on the answer to two questions: (1) Was father required to attach a new proposed parenting plan to his January 31, 2017 motion? (2) If father\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   required to attach a new proposed parenting plan, does his failure to do so mean that his attempt to invoke the court's jurisdiction was ineffective?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The answer to the first question - whether father was required to attach a new proposed parenting plan - largely depends on whether the trial court had previously entered a final judgment in the case. If a final judgment had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been entered, then the court's prior orders were subject to revision by the court at any time, whether or not father filed a new proposed parenting plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Creech v.

However, as we emphasized in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hodge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , when there\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   been a final judgment in a domestic relations case, it is incumbent on the parties \"to awaken the trial court's jurisdiction from this period of rest\" by (1) filing a petition to modify and attaching a proposed parenting plan pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-405\">\n    Tenn.

The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Davidson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court clarified that \"temporary parenting plans are reserved for temporary orders pending the final hearing.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We find the facts of the present case extremely similar to the facts in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gentry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The trial court attempted to order a temporary parenting plan at the time of the parties' divorce. The court also attempted to make subsequent modification orders temporary in nature by allowing father to seek further modification after a one-year period. In light this Court's prior interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-6-404\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), we hold that all of the trial court's orders were final judgments, notwithstanding language in some of those orders to the contrary. After the entry of each final judgment, the court lost the ability to exercise its authority over the case until father \"invoked\" the court's jurisdiction in one of the two ways discussed above. Father obviously attempted to invoke the court's jurisdiction by filing a motion to modify the parenting plan. We now turn to the second question of whether father's failure to attach a new proposed parenting plan means that his attempt to invoke the court's jurisdiction was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court recently discussed the consequences of a parent's failure to attach a proposed parenting plan to a petition to modify custody.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Allen v.

In response, \"[f]ather filed a petition in opposition to relocation and a petition to modify custody.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Mother, in turn, filed an answer to father's petition as well as a petition requesting injunctive relief allowing her to relocate and seeking a modification of the permanent parenting plan.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *2.

This Court rejected father's argument, holding \"that Mother's petition was filed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 36-6-108 [the parental relocation statute], which does not specifically require a parent to file a proposed parenting plan with his or her petition.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *7.
