B. Price, Jr., attempted to plead nolo contendere to two counts of sexual battery, and Defendant Victor Sims attempted to plead guilty to three counts of aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Defendants had reached plea bargains with the State, and each of the pleas included a term of probation. The trial court declined to accept the pleas and requested the parties to return for a later hearing to present proof and argument regarding the constitutionality of certain portions of the Public Safety Act of 2016 (\"the PSA\"), which has the practical effect of authorizing the Tennessee Department of Correction (\"DOC\") to address at least some probation violations, a role up to this point reserved exclusively to trial courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the hearing, the trial court ruled portions of the PSA facially unconstitutional on grounds of separation of powers, due process, and equal protection. The trial court subsequently accepted the Defendants' pleas and inserted in each judgment the following special condition: \"The probated portion of the Defendant's sentence is not subject to the Public Safety Act; rather, the Defendant shall be subject to the rules and regulations governing probation applicable through pre-existing law (law in effect prior to January 1, 2017).\" The State appealed, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgments. We granted the State's application for permission to appeal. We hold that the constitutionality of the PSA provisions at issue was not ripe for consideration by the trial court. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Criminal Appeals. We remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant A. B. Price, Jr., was charged with two counts of sexual battery, each offense alleged to have occurred in the spring of 2015. Defendant Price and the State reached a plea bargain calling for Defendant Price to plead nolo contendere to both charges with consecutive sentences of five years to be served on supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Victor Sims was charged with three counts of attempt to commit first degree murder, all offenses alleged to have\n   occurred on or about July 8, 2016. Defendant Sims and the State reached a plea bargain calling for Defendant Sims to plead guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with concurrent sentences of eight years, suspended to supervised probation after service of one year in confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Defendants sought to enter their negotiated pleas in early January 2017. Before accepting the pleas, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , expressed concern about the provisions of the PSA that became applicable on January 1, 2017, and that could impact the administration of the probated portions of the Defendants' sentences. Apparently without any request from either party, the trial court requested the parties to return at a later date to offer proof and argument regarding potential constitutional issues with the PSA including whether the PSA violated the separation of powers doctrine and whether it violated the Defendants' due process and equal protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 10, 2017, the trial court heard testimony from a probation officer based in Henry County and also heard argument from the prosecutor, the attorney representing Defendant Price, and the attorney representing Defendant Sims. Counsel for the Defendants both argued that the provisions of the PSA calling for the DOC to impose graduated sanctions on probationers committing certain violations were facially unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor disagreed. On February 16, 2017, only six days after the hearing, the trial court filed a forty-four page document titled \"Conclusions of Law and Order\" in which it concluded that provisions of the PSA applicable to probation violations were facially unconstitutional. The trial court's order included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The decision reached in these cases will leave in effect the statutory process shared by judges and probation officers for the management of alleged violations of probation which pre-existed January 1, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Judgments entered in these cases and in future similar cases shall incorporate the holdings herein by reference as a special condition, pending appellate review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 13, 2017, the trial court held plea hearings on the Defendants' cases and accepted the negotiated pleas. On each of the Defendants' respective judgment orders, the trial court included as a special condition the following: \"The probated portion of the Defendant's sentence is not subject to the Public Safety Act; rather, the Defendant shall be subject to the rules and regulations governing probation applicable through pre-existing law (law in effect prior to January 1, 2017).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State appealed on the basis of the special condition and the underlying determination by the trial court that the PSA was, at least in part, facially unconstitutional. On review, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgments, with one judge dissenting.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The probationer was entitled to contest the allegations and was entitled to be represented by counsel. If, based upon the preponderance of the evidence, the trial court concluded that the probationer had violated the conditions of her probation, the trial court was authorized to determine the appropriate remedy, up to and including revoking the probationer's suspended sentence and ordering the probationer to complete all or a portion of her remaining sentence in confinement. In short, both the determination of probation violations and the imposition of punishments for established violations were left to the trial court. If the trial court revoked the probationer's probation, the probationer had the right to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-311\">\n    Tenn.

Specifically, Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-28-303 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) The [DOC] shall adopt a single system of graduated sanctions for violations of the conditions of [probation]. The system shall set forth a menu of presumptive sanctions for the most common types of [probation] violations, including, but not limited to: failure to report; failure to pay fines and fees; failure to participate in a required program or service; failure to complete community service; and failure to refrain from the use of alcohol or controlled substances. The system of sanctions shall take into account factors such as the severity of the current violation, the supervised individual's previous criminal record, the number and severity of any previous supervision violations, the supervised individual's assessed risk level, and the extent to which graduated sanctions were imposed for previous violations. The system shall also define positive reinforcements that supervised individuals will receive for compliance with conditions of [probation]. The system shall clearly specify as to each type of sanction whether the supervised individual has the option to object and seek administrative review of the sanction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) The [DOC] shall establish by policy an administrative process to review and approve or reject, prior to imposition, graduated sanctions that deviate from those prescribed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) The [DOC] shall establish by policy an administrative process to review graduated sanctions contested by supervised individuals under [Tennessee Code Annotated section] 40-28-305. The review shall be conducted by the chief supervision officer, who shall be impartial and trained to hear cases regarding graduated sanctions for violations of supervision conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (d) The [DOC] shall establish and maintain a program of initial and ongoing training regarding the system of graduated sanctions for probation and parole officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-28-303\">\n    Tenn.

The notice shall inform the supervised individual of the violation or violations alleged, the date or dates of the violation or violations, and the graduated sanction to be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (c) The imposition of a graduated sanction or sanctions by a probation and parole officer must comport with the system of graduated sanctions adopted by the [DOC] under [Tennessee Code Annotated section] 40-28-303. Upon receipt of the notice, the supervised individual shall immediately accept the sanction or, if permitted under the system of graduated sanctions, object to the sanction or sanctions proposed by the probation and parole officer. The failure of the supervised individual to comply with a sanction shall constitute a violation of probation.... If the supervised individual objects to the imposition of the sanction or sanctions, when permitted by the system of graduated sanctions, the individual is entitled to an administrative review to be conducted by the department within five (5) days of the issuance of the notice. If the [DOC] affirms the recommendation contained in the notice, the sanction or sanctions shall become effective immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (d)(1) A notice of a graduated sanction may not be issued for any violation of probation ... that could warrant an additional, separate felony charge or Class A misdemeanor charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) Notwithstanding subdivision (d)(1), a notice of a graduated sanction may be issued for a positive drug test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (e) Upon successful completion of a graduated sanction or sanctions, a court shall not revoke the term of [probation] or impose additional sanctions for the same violation. Notwithstanding this subsection (e), a court may consider an individual's supervision and sanctions history when adjudicating subsequent violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (f) The [DOC] shall regularly provide notice of sanctions imposed upon probationers to the sentencing court and the prosecutor's office for each jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (g) If a probation and parole officer imposes a graduated sanction, the officer shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) Deliver a copy of the sanction to the [probationer]; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) Note the date of delivery of the copy in the [probationer's] file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-28-305\">\n    Tenn.

That authority remains within the exclusive jurisdiction of the trial court. Rather, graduated sanctions include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   any of a wide range of non-prison offender accountability measures and programs, including, but not limited to, electronic supervision tools; drug and alcohol testing or monitoring; day or evening reporting centers; rehabilitative interventions such as substance abuse or mental health treatment; reporting requirements to probation and parole officers; community service or work crews; and residential treatment facilities[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-28-301\">\n    Tenn.

Moreover, probationers contesting sanctions imposed by the DOC are constrained to administrative proceedings (at most) rather than evidentiary hearings before a trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We emphasize that at the time the trial court issued its ruling regarding the PSA's constitutionality, neither Defendant had been accused of violating a condition of his probation nor subjected to a sanction imposed by the DOC for a probation violation. Indeed, neither Defendant had even been sentenced to probation as of the time the trial court decided to declare portions of the PSA facially unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Justiciability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Tennessee courts are to decide only \"legal controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

Although not a model of clarity, section -304 requires a trial court imposing a sentence of probation to perform two distinct tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The first task is to determine the \"conditions of [probation].\" Elsewhere referred to as \"the terms of supervision,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-303\">\n    Tenn.

It is this second task that both of the lower courts fastened on as creating an issue ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In our view, the notification requirement of section -304 relied on by both courts below clearly does not satisfy the first prong of the ripeness doctrine. The lower courts interpreted section -304 as forcing a transfer of power from the judiciary to the executive branch, at the direction of the legislature, effective as of the time the notification provision is incorporated into a judgment order. This transfer, according to the trial court and the Court of Criminal Appeals, triggered a separation of powers issue calling for an immediate determination of whether probation violation matters are to be addressed exclusively by the judiciary or may be delegated, at least partially, to the executive branch. Respectfully, we disagree with this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We acknowledge that an actual party in interest, that is, a probationer, at some point, may make the argument that probation violation matters may be determined only by the judiciary. However, no probationer will be in a position to make such an argument unless and until someone other than a member of the judiciary makes a determination about a probation violation matter. That triggering event will not occur unless and until a probation violation, at least allegedly, has taken place. Obviously, no such violation had been alleged as of the time the trial court made its ruling regarding the facial constitutionality of the PSA in this matter because the pleas had not even been entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition to concluding that section -304 triggered a separation of powers issue, the trial court also concluded that a constitutional due process issue was \"ripe and fit for decision\" because section -304 \"requires the trial judge to immediately include a provision within a criminal judgment that has the plain effect, validly or not, of limiting due process rights which exist now but which will not be exercised until a future time.\" Finally, the trial court concluded that an equal protection issue was ripe because other provisions of the PSA \"establish[ ] two classes of probationers with differing due process rights.\" The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed that both of these issues were ripe for adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203934213\">\n    2018 WL 3934213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Again, while probationers later facing the determination of an alleged probation violation matter by the DOC\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   claim a constitutional violation, neither of the Defendants was facing such a determination here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In short, any issue, constitutional or otherwise, that may arise from the DOC sanctioning\n   a probationer accused of violating the conditions of his probation will remain inchoate unless and until such an accusation has been made and acted upon by the DOC. No such accusation had been made, much less acted upon, as of the time the trial court rendered its ruling in these cases. Indeed, no such accusation\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been made, as the trial court rendered its ruling that the PSA was facially unconstitutional even before it sentenced either of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We hold that the constitutional issues identified and ruled upon by the courts below were not fit for judicial decision at the time of the trial court's ruling. Accordingly, the first prong of the ripeness analysis has not been satisfied in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    The Second Prong\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The trial court also concluded that the second prong of the ripeness analysis was satisfied, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The hardship caused to all parties from the uncertainty surrounding probationer status and acceptable procedure, which would be caused by withholding the resolution of these issues by the courts, outweighs any possible concern about a court prematurely deciding the questions. Furthermore, the issues raised are common to the many thousands of persons likely to be placed on probation in Tennessee on or after January 1, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We disagree with the trial court's ruling on the second prong of the ripeness analysis, as well. The second prong of the ripeness analysis requires a court to consider whether withholding adjudication of the issue presented will impose any meaningful hardship on the parties.\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845485\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/468/482/#p490\">\n    468 S.W.3d at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It bears emphasizing that the parties in this matter are the State of Tennessee and the two Defendants. As of the time of the trial court's ruling, neither of the Defendants was facing an accusation that he had violated the terms of his probation. Therefore, neither of the Defendants was facing the prospect of a probation violation matter being determined by someone other than a trial judge. Accordingly, withholding adjudication of the constitutional issues addressed by the trial court (and not raised by any party until asked to do so by the trial court) would not have imposed any meaningful hardship on the State or either of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Similarly, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded as to the second prong as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [T]he Defendants will suffer a hardship if their claims are not heard because the condition of probation is imposed by operation of law and immediately deprives them of judicial review of certain aspects of their probation. It directly [a]ffects the day-to-day activities of probationers because (1) they are required to comply with the sanctions grid by operation of law; (2) their right to judicial determination of probation violations, albeit \"technical,\" is transferred from the court to a probation or parole officer; and (3) there is no judicial review of these infractions. Here, it is not a question of when or whether the Defendants violate their probation but rather the validity of the graduated sanctions grid as a condition of their probation. We are simply unable to distinguish the posture of this case from the many appeals from a trial court's imposition of special conditions of probation which this court has reviewed immediately after probation is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203934213\">\n    2018 WL 3934213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We disagree with the Court of Criminal Appeals' assertion that the provisions of the PSA relating to the punishment of some probation infractions \"immediately deprive[ ] [the Defendants] of judicial review of certain aspects of their probation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   and that the provisions have a direct impact on the Defendants' \"day-to-day activities.\" The PSA provisions at issue do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   immediately deprive the Defendants of anything. As we continue to emphasize, the provisions of the PSA that ostensibly limit judicial review are triggered only upon a probation officer determining that a defendant has violated the terms of his or her probation and subsequently imposing a graduated sanction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-28-305\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-28-305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (providing that if a probationer objects to a graduated sanction imposed by his probation officer, he may be entitled to an administrative review). Therefore, the Defendants were not \"immediately deprived\" of any judicial review upon being sentenced to probation. Moreover, we fail to see how the PSA impacts the Defendants' day-to-day activities. The Defendants are not \"required to comply with the sanctions grid.\" The PSA requires\n   <em>\n    probation officers\n   </em>\n   to comply with the sanctions grid\n   <em>\n    in the event of a probation violation.\n   </em>\n   Nor are the Defendants affected by any \"loss\" of judicial determination or review of probation violations\n   <em>\n    unless and until they commit a probation violation.\n   </em>\n   We reiterate that, at the time the trial court issued its ruling that the PSA was facially unconstitutional, the charges against the Defendants had not yet even been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, the notification \"condition\" required by section -304 is not comparable to the \"special conditions of probation which [the Court of Criminal Appeals] has reviewed immediately after probation is granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203934213\">\n    2018 WL 3934213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

Crim. App. Feb. 10, 2009). As set forth above, the terms of supervision that trial courts are required to impose for sentences of probation may require defendants to engage in particular behavior or to refrain from engaging in particular behavior.
