(\"Father\") to J.C. (\"Child\") based on abandonment, failure to rectify the conditions that caused the family court to assume jurisdiction over Child, and Father's unfitness to be a party to the parent-child relationship. The trial court further found that termination of Father's parental rights was in the best interest of Child. Father appeals from that judgment. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
