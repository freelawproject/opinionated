We withdraw our opinion dated March 19, 2019 and issue the following substitute opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, Jerry Sanchez, Timothy Williams, and Jose Estrada (collectively, the officers), correctional officers for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), challenge the trial court's denial of their plea to the jurisdiction, seeking dismissal of claims brought against them by inmate James Daniel Boone. Boone complains that the officers confiscated certain items from his cell and failed to return them. We conclude that the officers have shown their entitlement to official immunity as to Boone's claims involving one item but not the other items. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Boone's claims as to the former but not the latter. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to Boone, Williams and Estrada came into his cell and strip searched him. Boone alleges that a handmade dog tag and wedding band, among other things, were confiscated. Williams and Estrada told Boone to get dressed and step out of his cell. As he did so, Sanchez approached. Sanchez found a typewriter, \"slammed it on the cell floor busting it open[,] ripped the top off,\" and found a cell phone charger hidden inside. Boone had another typewriter with SIM cards hidden inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, Boone received disciplinary reports for possession of the cell phone charger and SIM cards as contraband. The property officer returned certain property to Boone along with an inventory sheet. The returned property did not include the second typewriter, the dog tag, or wedding band. Boone complained about his missing property and did not sign the inventory sheet. The property officer told Boone to file a \"step-1 grievance\" and took the property back to the property room. The property officer subsequently returned with the property, and Boone again refused to sign the inventory form. The property officer told him that he was signing only for the property he was receiving since he had already filed a grievance for the missing property. Boone then signed the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After exhausting his administrative remedies, Boone filed this lawsuit against the officers in their individual capacities, bringing a claim under the Theft Liability Act (the Act), and seeking damages for the confiscated typewriter, dog tag, and wedding band.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Arguments Specific to Handmade Items\n   </strong>\n   The officers contend in their first issue that (1) there is no evidence that Boone had possession of his handmade dog tag and wedding band at the time of the cell search or that the items were confiscated; and (2) the officers are immune from Boone's theft claims as to these items because the alleged amount of actual damages is insignificant.

They contend that they \"need not prove official immunity\" because Boone lacks a claim to assert. This argument-based on the lack of evidence to support Boone's theft claim-is not an assertion of immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440586\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/208/4/#p11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to address this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440586\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/208/4/#p11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The officers also contend for the first time on appeal that Boone's claims as to the handmade items are barred under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    de minimus non curiat lex.\n   </em>\n   Under that doctrine, any error is deemed harmless when the amount of actual damages is insignificant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

We decline to hold that this doctrine confers official immunity from suit and thus implicates this court's jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal under section 51.014(a)(5). We thus conclude that we lack jurisdiction to address this issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Entitlement to Official Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The officers argue in their second issue that they are entitled to immunity as to all of Boone's claims because in confiscating the items, they met their burden to conclusively prove each element of official immunity: they contend specifically that they were performing discretionary duties in good faith within the scope of their authority. We conclude that the officers have established they are entitled to official immunity as to the confiscated typewriter because it was used to conceal contraband. We cannot reach the same conclusion as to the handmade items because the officers did not meet their burden to show that they acted in good faith in confiscating these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Act defines \"theft\" as \"unlawfully appropriating property or unlawfully obtaining services.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 134.002(2). A person who commits theft is liable for the damages resulting from the theft.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9964569\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/822/152/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 134.003(a). In his original petition, Boone alleged the following facts. The officers \"took\" his dog tag. The property inventory sheet listing items \"[i]n [o]ffender's possession\" and \"[s]tored in [p]roperty [r]oom\" excluded his typewriter, dog tag, wedding band, and certain other items that were taken. Boone initially refused to sign the sheet because of the missing items. He eventually signed it because the property officer told him that he was signing only for the property that he was receiving back. We conclude that Boone alleged facts making out a prima facie case that the officers unlawfully appropriated Boone's typewriter, dog tag, and wedding band. We turn to the evidence supporting the officer's official immunity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discretionary or ministerial duties?\n   </strong>\n   As discussed, a governmental employee is entitled to official immunity for the good faith performance of discretionary duties within the scope of the employee's authority.\n   <em>\n    City of Houston v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316938\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/808/#p814\">\n    363 S.W.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied). A discretionary act is one involving personal deliberation, decision, and judgment; in contrast, actions requiring obedience to orders or the performance of a duty to which the actor has no choice are ministerial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316938\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/808/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Lancaster v.

Thus, if the duty is imposed by law, then the performance of the duty is a ministerial act, and there is no official immunity for the failure to perform it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015542\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/883/650/#p654\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because ministerial acts are those which the law prescribes and must be performed with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment, a significant aspect of determining whether an act is ministerial or discretionary involves a consideration of whether a law or regulation controls the acts of the government employee in a particular situation.\n   <em>\n    Harris Cnty. v.

However, the officers point to TDCJ policy to support their argument that confiscating contraband is discretionary. The TDCJ Offender Orientation Handbook defines \"contraband\" in relevant part as \"[a]ny item\n   which, in the judgment of TDCJ personnel, unreasonably hinders the safe and effective operation of the facility.\" The handbook further states, \"Any contraband found on TDCJ property may be taken and disposed of according to procedures set forth by the TDCJ and the State of Texas.\" We agree that this policy allowed the officers to use their own judgment to decide what constituted contraband and whether to confiscate it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Boone challenges the confiscation of the typewriter, which he concedes was used to conceal contraband. The TDCJ Orientation Handbook includes a nonexclusive list defining cell phones, among other things, as dangerous contraband \"[r]epresent[ing] a threat to the security and safety of the unit.\" Although the list does not specifically reference SIM cards, they are related to-arguably a part of-cell phones.

Their first and second arguments apply to the \"handmade items,\" which are the dog tag and the ring. First, the officers contend Boone has alleged no facts and presented no evidence that the officers committed theft as to the handmade items. Second, the officers say Boone's theft claim should be dismissed under the doctrine of \"\n   <em>\n    de minimus non curiat lex\n   </em>\n   \"-the law cares not for small things.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the officers argue that they conclusively established their entitlement to official immunity as to all items allegedly confiscated and not returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I agree with the majority that we lack interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over the officers' first two arguments under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.014(a)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I begin with a preliminary observation regarding whether our appellate jurisdiction is invoked under section 51.014(a)(5) (applicable to assertions of immunity by officers or employees) as opposed to section 51.014(a)(8) (applicable to orders granting or denying pleas to the jurisdiction by governmental units). The officers' notice of appeal cites section 51.014(a)(8) as the basis for appeal and states that \"this is an appeal of a trial court's partial denial of a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit.\" Section 51.014(a)(8) is not a proper basis for interlocutory appellate jurisdiction in this case. To the extent the officers were sued in their official capacities, such claims are considered to be asserted against their governmental unit employer;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the trial court granted the officers' plea as to any such claims and neither party complains of that ruling.

Thus, addressing the officers' first argument, they acknowledge, does not require that we reach the official immunity issue.

It is not clear from our record whether Boone was entitled to possess the dog tag and the ring, and the officers do not argue that those items are contraband or that Boone was not otherwise entitled to possess them. The officers' good faith argument on appeal does not acknowledge those items were confiscated; they claim the handmade items either do not exist or they never took them. They characterize Boone's complaint as alleging that the officers \"lost\" his handmade items, and they argue that\n   misplacing an inmate's property \"does not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   demonstrate a lack of good faith.\" The officers also contend they returned all of Boone's property or explained why they were justified in not returning any property retained.
