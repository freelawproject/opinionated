He contends the circuit court erred in prohibiting defense counsel from making comments during closing arguments about the State's failure to present certain evidence at trial. For reasons explained in a Memorandum provided to the\n   parties, we find no error and affirm the judgment of conviction. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
