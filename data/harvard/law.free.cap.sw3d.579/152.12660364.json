PALAFOX, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Martin Rodriguez filed this premises liability suit against Cemex, Inc. (Cemex), alleging he was injured while working at a cement plant that was owned and operated by Cemex. In a traditional motion for summary judgment, Cemex alleged that Rodriguez lacked evidence establishing that Cemex owed him a duty of care given that he was injured while performing his work as an employee of an independent contractor. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Cemex. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Parties' Relationship\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cemex owns and operates a cement plant in Odessa, Texas, known as the Cemex-Odessa plant (hereinafter the \"Plant\"), which is open 24 hours a day, allowing approximately a hundred tractor-trailer trucks to come onto the premises to fill up with cement every day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Union Logistics frequented the plant as an independent contractor hired by Cemex and would send its own employees to fill and deliver loads of cement on behalf of Cemex's customers. Pursuant to its standard procedures, Cemex had trained Union Logistics' owner, Tony Franco,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the Plant's operations, and in turn, Franco was responsible for training his own employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Plant's Operations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time of Rodriguez's injury, the Plant had a dual nature tower where drivers filled their trucks with a variety of cement products. The tower consisted of two separate platforms suspended on each side, one to be used as an entrance to the\n   filling area, and the other to be used as an exit. After entering the tower, the driver needed to exit his truck, lower the entrance platform onto the top of his truck, then walk onto the platform to open the hatch located on the top of his truck. After opening the hatch, the driver next raised the entrance platform back to its upright position and secured it into place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the driver would move his truck to a position for loading cement into the hatch. After positioning his truck for loading, the driver would once again exit his truck to meet with Cemex employees to advise them of the type of cement needed. Thereafter, a Cemex employee known as a \"bulk loader\" would fill the load from a control room. Once the fill was complete, the driver would return to his vehicle to move it to the exit side of the platform, where he would be required to lower the exit platform onto the top of his truck and use the platform to walk back to the hatch of his truck to close it. Once he closed the hatch, the driver then raised the exit platform back into its upright position, secured it into place, then returned to his truck to exit the Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 11, 2012, the day of Rodriguez's accident, Union Logistics had hired Rodriguez to fill a load of cement at the Plant, and had also sent another employee, Alfredo Armendariz, to the Plant to fill a load in a separate truck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Rodriguez walked on the entrance side of the platform to open the hatch on his truck, Armendariz had already advanced to the exit side of the tower, and he was in the process of closing the hatch on his truck. After Armendariz lifted the exit platform off his truck, he failed to secure the platform in the upright position causing it to fall back onto his truck. Thereafter, Armendariz drove away with the exit platform on top of his truck, not aware that he dragged it with him, causing the entire tower to \"move,\" \"twist,\" and destabilize with motion. Due to the movement, Rodriguez's leg became wedged between the entrance platform and the top of his trailer, which crushed his ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the accident, there were no Cemex employees immediately near the tower, and none witnessed the accident. However, after a Cemex employee heard screaming, he and another employee looked to the platform and observed that Rodriguez's leg was pinned by the platform; they assisted Rodriguez until EMS arrived to transport him to a nearby medical center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following Rodriguez's accident, upon the recommendation of Alton Ray Crumley, a supervisor at the Plant, Cemex implemented safety measures at the Plant to help prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future. For example, Cemex made the decision to only allow one truck at a time to use the tower. Then, signs were posted warning that only one truck at a time could use the tower. Later, Cemex redesigned its facilities. At the time of this suit, Cemex used a tower design that only allowed one truck to use the tower at a time, referred to as a \"separate single access platform.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rodriguez filed a lawsuit against Union Logistics, Armendariz, and Cemex. In his claim against Cemex, Rodriguez alleged that Cemex had created a \"premises defect\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   on its property, which was not open and obvious, and that Cemex had failed in its duty to eliminate the defect and/or to warn invitees of the dangerous condition. In his claim against Armendariz, Rodriguez alleged that Armendariz's negligence in failing to secure the platform in the upright position before exiting the Plant was the proximate cause of his injuries. In his claim against Union Logistics, Rodriguez alleged that it had failed to provide him with a safe work environment and failed to adequately train and supervise its employees. After the trial court granted Rodriguez's motion for partial summary judgment with respect to his claim against Armendariz, Rodriguez went to mediation with both Armendariz and Union Logistics, and settled with those two defendants for $20,000, leaving only his claim against Cemex pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cemex's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsequently, Cemex filed a traditional motion for summary judgment contending that Rodriguez had no evidence to support its claim that Cemex owed him a duty of care that it had breached. In its motion, Cemex characterized Rodriguez as being an employee of an independent contractor arguing that a premises owner only owes a duty to an employee of an independent contractor on its premises to either rectify or warn the employee about a hidden defect the owner knew or should have known existed on its premises. Cemex argued that the \"irrefutable summary judgment evidence\" established that there was no defect, \"hidden or otherwise,\" on its premises that caused Rodriguez's injuries, and that instead, Armendariz's negligence was the sole cause of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his response to Cemex's motion for summary judgment, Rodriguez argued that the hidden defect was the lurking danger posed by the dual use nature of the tower itself, and the fact that the tower could become unstable by the actions of one driver while another was using it. Rodriguez further argued that he had raised a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Cemex had \"actual knowledge\" of this allegedly dangerous condition on its property based on evidence that Cemex was aware that several prior incidents had occurred at the Plant during which the tower had become destabilized. Rodriguez attached two incident reports, documenting two other instances that occurred at the Plant in March and May of 2012, in which drivers had failed to secure the platform in the upright position, and had dragged the platform with them as they attempted to exit the Plant, one of which occurred the day before Rodriguez's accident. According to the reports, which Crumley filled out in both instances, no one was hurt and there was no structural damage to the platform, although the driver's truck involved in the incident of May 2012 had sustained property damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rodriguez also attached excerpts from Crumley's deposition testimony, as well as that of another Cemex employee, Jeremy Joseph, who both testified about their knowledge of the prior incidents. In his deposition, Joseph testified that he believed it was fairly common for drivers to become \"entangled with the platform,\" thereby causing the tower to become unstable, and that he believed such incidents occurred as often as every month, or at the least, every six months. In his deposition, Crumley also acknowledged that, although no one had been injured in the prior incidents, the platform appeared to have been damaged or bent from previous incidents of this nature. In addition, both Crumley and Joseph acknowledged that they had been aware of the risk of injury posed by allowing two trucks to use the platform at the same time, and that it would have been safer to allow only one truck at a time to\n   use the tower. Crumley further acknowledged Cemex could have taken \"additional actions\" to safeguard against the prospect of future injuries prior to the time of Rodriguez's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rodriguez argued that this evidence raised a material question of fact regarding whether Cemex was aware that it had created an \"obvious risk of unreasonable harm\" on its premises by allowing two drivers to use its platform at the same time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued that, \"[h]aving a metal platform weighing thousands of pounds spinning around poses an obvious risk of unreasonable harm,\" and that Cemex had failed to exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate that risk before Rodriguez's accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Trial Court's Judgment and Rodriguez's Motion for Rehearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the trial court granted Cemex's motion for summary judgment, Rodriguez filed a \"motion for reconsideration or new trial,\" attaching the same items of evidence described above to his motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his motion, Rodriguez argued that Cemex owed him \"multiple duties,\" such as the duty to provide a \"safe workplace,\" and not just the duty to warn of known, hidden defects. He further argued that even if Cemex only owed him a duty with respect to known, hidden defects, he had presented sufficient summary judgment evidence to raise a fact question with respect to whether Cemex had breached that duty by failing to warn him about the danger the dual use platform posed and failed to rectify that defect until after his accident occurred. At the hearing, the attorneys primarily argued over whether there was a known defect on the premises, and if so, whether it was hidden, or alternatively, whether it was open and obvious to Rodriguez at the time of his accident. Counsel for Rodriguez argued that prior incidents with the tower were known to Cemex, but not to Rodriguez. Rodriguez's counsel further argued that Rodriguez had no way of knowing about the prior incidents and/or about the danger the platform posed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After holding a hearing on Rodriguez's motion, at which no new evidence was presented, the trial court denied Rodriguez's motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, Rodriguez asserts two issues challenging the merits of the court's summary judgment ruling and a third issue challenging the court's subsequent denial of his motion for new trial. In Issue One, Rodriguez asserts that the court erred in granting Cemex's motion for summary judgment based on a no-duty defense that was abolished in\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Highland Park.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Issue Two, Rodriguez asserts that summary judgment evidence demonstrated the existence of a pre-existing, concealed defect on the premises. We construe these first two issues as challenging the court's ruling on whether Cemex owed\n   Rodriguez a duty as a matter of law; and, if so, whether the evidence established a genuine issue of material fact on Cemex's breach of duty. As for Issue Three, Rodriguez argues that the trial court abused its direction in denying his motion for new trial in which he re-urged his opposition to the summary judgment. Because we believe that Cemex owed a duty to Rodriguez to either rectify or warn about known, concealed defects on its premises, and because we believe Rodriguez provided sufficient summary judgment evidence to raise a question of material fact for the jury to decide whether Cemex breached that duty, we agree that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. Given our conclusion, we do not reach Issue Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A defendant moving for traditional summary judgment pursuant to Rule 166a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure must state the specific grounds for the motion and must negate at least one essential element of the plaintiff's cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Stierwalt v.

As set forth above, foreseeability is required to establish proximate cause, but it is also a key part of the analysis for determining whether a dangerous condition existed on the property for purposes of bringing a premises defect case. As the Supreme Court has recognized, in order to impose liability on a landowner in a premises defect case, a condition on its property must pose an \"unreasonable risk of harm,\" which in turn exists \"when there is a 'sufficient probability of a harmful event occurring that a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen it or some similar event as likely to happen.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 80 S.W.3d at 556 (citing\n   <em>\n    Seideneck v.

This principle is illustrated in our sister court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 80 S.W.3d at 600. In that case, the County had created a potentially dangerous condition on its roadway, due to the lack of lighting on a dangerous stretch of the road, which caused the plaintiff to lose control of his vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 80 S.W.3d at 600.

Therefore, although the County might not have been able to foresee that a third-party's conduct would combine with the dangerous conditions on the roadway to cause the plaintiff's death,\n   the court nevertheless held that the County could be held liable as it was nevertheless aware of the general potential for danger that existed on its roadway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 600-601 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walmart Stores, Inc. v.

In particular, both Crumley and Joseph acknowledged in their deposition testimony that they had been aware of the risk of injury posed by allowing two trucks to use the platform at the same time, and that it would have been safer to allow only one truck at a time to use the tower. Further, despite this knowledge, Cemex continued to operate the tower in the same manner, providing no warning to its users and taking no precautions to ensure that it was used in a safer manner until after Rodriguez's accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Cemex argues, however, that these prior incidents only constituted a \"handful\" of cases, and that \"tens of thousands\" of independent contractors had safely utilized the platform over the years. In addition, Cemex finds it significant that not all of the prior incidents happened in the same way as Rodriguez's accident occurred, i.e., by drivers failing to secure the platform, and that instead, some of the prior accidents occurred when drivers struck the platform. Cemex appears to believe that because of the limited number of prior incidents and the fact that some of them occurred in a different manner, this should preclude a finding that a defect existed at the Plant and/or that there was a condition at the Plant that posed a foreseeable risk of harm to its users. We disagree with both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We find it insignificant that not all the accidents occurred in the exact same way. As set forth above, the Supreme Court has recognized that in order to establish the element of \"foreseeability\" in a premises case, it is sufficient if the evidence demonstrates that a \"general danger\" was foreseeable, and that the premises owner need not anticipate the exact manner in which an injury might occur.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 80 S.W.3d at 556 (citing\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

The fact that the incidents may have occurred in slightly different ways does not negate the fact that these prior incidents all caused the platform to become unstable, thereby creating a risk that other drivers using the platform at the same time could have been injured. As such, this evidence supported a finding that a foreseeable risk of injury existed to users of the dual use platform as it existed at the time of Rodriguez's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In addition, we believe that Rodriguez presented evidence of a sufficient number of prior incidents occurring at the Plant to satisfy this foreseeability factor. While the absence of any prior reports may support a finding that a premises owner did not have knowledge of a dangerous condition on its premises or that an injury was not foreseeable, we know of no cases imposing a requirement that a certain number of reports must have been made in order to support such a finding.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brinson Ford, Inc. v.

Although no one was hurt in those prior incidents, even Cemex's own employees testified that it was foreseeable that harm or injury could eventually befall a driver using the tower under these circumstances, and that it failed to take any action to rectify the danger until after Rodriguez's accident. Therefore, we conclude that the evidence of the prior incidents was sufficient to raise a question of fact for the jury regarding whether Cemex knew or should have known that the design and/or the manner in which it was using the tower constituted a danger to its users, and that it was foreseeable that a user could suffer injury as a result thereof.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greater Houston Transp.

The Significance of Rodriguez's Deposition Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Cemex also contends that, despite the evidence of the prior incidents, the trial court properly granted summary judgment because Rodriguez allegedly admitted in his deposition testimony, as did his employer, Tony Franco, that there was no defect at the Plant, whether hidden or otherwise. Cemex then concludes that this deposition testimony precludes a jury finding that a dangerous condition did in fact exist on the premises. We disagree with both Cemex's characterization of the deposition testimony, as well as its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   During their depositions, Franco and Rodriguez were both asked if they were aware of any defects with respect to the tower on the day of Rodriguez's accident. Cemex finds it significant that neither Franco nor Rodriguez were able to point to anything that was broken or defective on the platform on the day of Rodriguez's accident, and that instead, they testified that the platform appeared to be operating as intended on the date of the injury. Rodriguez's theory of liability, however, was not based on the allegation that the platform was broken, and was instead based on the claim that it was the design and manner in which Cemex routinely utilized the platform prior to his accident, i.e., by allowing two drivers to utilize the tower at the same time, which constituted the dangerous condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained above, when the design of a structure on a property constitutes a foreseeable and unreasonable danger to its users, this is sufficient to support a claim that a dangerous condition existed on the premises.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyckoff v.

A Jury Question Remained on the Issue of Whether the Dangerous Condition at the Plant was Open and Obvious\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   And finally, the parties debate over whether the alleged defect on the premises was open and obvious, or whether it was a concealed defect for which Cemex had the duty to either rectify or provide a warning. Cemex contends that the summary judgment evidence established that any defect on the premises was not concealed from Rodriguez, pointing out that Rodriguez himself testified at his deposition that he was aware of how the platform operated, and that he was an experienced driver who had used this and other similar platforms in the past. Cemex also points out that Rodriguez had been to the Plant approximately 20 times prior to his accident in the two weeks leading up to his accident, and was therefore presumably aware of the \"dangers associated\" with working on the platform. Cemex therefore concludes that this established that the potential danger posed by the platform was or should have been \"open and obvious\" to Rodriguez, and that it therefore owed no duty to Rodriguez to warn of any such potential danger. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we recognize that in some instances, regardless of whether a plaintiff had actual knowledge of a danger, a court may nevertheless find that a danger was open and obvious, as a matter of law. For example, a danger may be said to be open and obvious, as a matter of law, when a plaintiff is injured while working in an inherently dangerous environment, where the danger posed would have been obvious to anyone taking on the task.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

Islas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401433\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/228/649/#p651\">\n    228 S.W.3d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 651 (Tex. 2007) (danger posed to an employee who was injured while cleaning out a rotating drum on a cement truck was open and obvious);\n   <em>\n    Wilhelm v.

Similarly, when an employee is working in an area without certain safety equipment and the lack of such equipment is apparent, common sense also dictates that in most instances, the dangers of doing so will be open and obvious as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179514\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/211/#p217\">\n    257 S.W.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (landowner owed no duty to warn independent contractor's employee of the danger of using a ramp that had no handrails where such danger was open and obvious);\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

The mere fact that Rodriguez may have understood how the platform generally operated did not conclusively establish that he understood the potential danger posed by its use, i.e., that the entire tower could become unstable when another driver was using it, thereby creating a danger to him. In particular, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Rodriguez was aware of the prior incidents in which drivers had become entangled with the platform and/or had dragged the platform with them, or of the property damaged caused by such incidents. As Cemex recognizes, Rodriguez's first trip to the plant was only two weeks before his accident, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that during those two weeks, he personally witnessed any incidents of this nature, or that he had been told that any such incidents had previously occurred. Moreover, as set forth above, the record indicates that there were no warning signs at the Plant cautioning drivers about the possibility that the tower could become unstable in the event of an accident, or warning them that only one driver at a time should use the tower due to this possibility. As well, Cemex admitted that there were no Cemex employees in the area of the tower at the time of the accident, who could have provided Rodriguez with a warning, or otherwise helped him avoid the dangers posed by the dual use nature of the tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We therefore conclude that the summary judgment record did not conclusively establish that Rodriguez had actual knowledge of the dangers posed by the dual nature design and use of the tower, or that a reasonable person in his position would have appreciated the potential danger that it posed. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Rodriguez, as we must, we cannot conclude that the danger posed by the tower was open and obvious as a matter of law, and instead, we conclude that a question of fact remained on that issue for a jury to resolve. Accordingly, we sustain Issue One and Issue Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Cemex's favor on Rodriguez's premises liability claim, and we therefore reverse the trial court's granting of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with our opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We take the facts from the parties' summary judgment evidence, recognizing that these facts have not yet been established at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The owner of Union Logistics is Narcisso Antonio Franco Estrella but he is referred to as Tony Franco throughout our record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    At his deposition, Franco testified that he \"work[ed]\" for Cemex, and that 100 percent of his business was based on providing services to Cemex.
