Susano, Jr., J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This litigation finds its genesis in a water pipeline break that caused damage to residential property. At the time of the break, Joseph and Martha Mosakowski were the title owners of the damaged property. Matthew Tolliver, who was purchasing the property under a contract for deed, resided in the home. Mr. Tolliver filed a complaint against Tellico Village Property Owners Association, Inc. (defendant) alleging negligence and breach of contract. The Mosakowskis were later joined to the suit as co-plaintiffs. Pursuant to a court order, the Mosakowskis filed their own complaint, which contained similar factual allegations and asserted the same causes of action as alleged in Mr. Tolliver's complaint. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Mosakowskis' negligence claim. The defendant also filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims asserted by Mr. Tolliver and the Mosakowskis. Mr. Tolliver consented to the entry of an agreed order granting summary judgment to the defendant as to all of his claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mosakowskis, however, contested defendant's motions. Ultimately, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the Mosakowskis' negligence claim because the court determined that the statute of limitations had expired. In a separate order, the court granted the defendant summary judgment on the Mosakowskis' breach of contract claim because the court determined that there was no consideration for the alleged contract. The court denied summary judgment as to the Mosakowskis' negligence claim because the court's order dismissing that claim rendered the issue moot. The Mosakowskis appeal. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of the negligence claim. Although the court erred by dismissing the negligence claim pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6), we find that ruling to be harmless because summary judgment was proper under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56. Finally, we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that on July 16, 2014, a water pipeline break caused damage to their residential property in Tellico Village. As previously noted, Mr. Tolliver resided in the home. He was in the process of purchasing the property from the Mosakowskis under a \"contract for deed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 9, 2015, Mr. Tolliver filed a complaint against defendant seeking damages for the loss of personal and real property. He alleged that defendant was liable in negligence for failing to properly maintain the water pipeline. Mr. Tolliver also alleged that defendant was liable for breach of contract. Specifically, Mr. Tolliver alleged that representatives of defendant promised the Mosakowskis that defendant\n   would pay for all repairs to the property, a commitment that defendant failed to honor. Mr. Tolliver claimed to be a third-party beneficiary to this alleged oral contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although Mr. Tolliver's complaint stated that the Mosakowskis were \"necessary parties,\" his complaint did not name them as such. Months later, Mr. Tolliver filed a motion to amend his complaint, a proposed amended complaint, and a motion to join the Mosakowskis as parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Tolliver's proposed amended complaint did not name the Mosakowskis as co-plaintiffs. Instead, the amended complaint simply reiterated the allegation that \"the Mosakowskis are necessary parties in order for the Court to give full relief and Plaintiff moves the Court [to] join them in this case.\" On June 13, 2016, the trial court entered an order providing that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   upon stipulation of the parties, [Mr. Tolliver's] Motion to Amend Complaint and Motion to Join Third Part[ies] are GRANTED. [Mr. Tolliver's] Amended Complaint is deemed filed, and counsel for [Mr. Tolliver] shall have a summons issued and process served upon Joe and Martha Mosakowski to join them as parties to this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Capitalization in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 23, 2016, the Mosakowskis were served with a summons and Mr. Tolliver's amended complaint. Inexplicably, the summons named the Mosakowskis as defendants. Accordingly, on May 22, 2017, the Mosakowskis filed a \"motion to realign the parties.\" In their motion, the Mosakowskis claimed to hold legal title to the property in question and sought \"to be aligned as Plaintiffs seeking recovery.\" The Mosakowskis were \"realigned\" as plaintiffs pursuant to an agreed order entered on July 27, 2017. Shortly thereafter, the trial court entered another agreed order that directed the Mosakowskis \"to file a Complaint in this matter within 14 days from the entry of the Court's Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the court's order, the Mosakowskis filed their own complaint on August 23, 2017. The pleading was styled as a \"complaint\" and the caption listed only \"Martha Mosakowski and Joseph Mosakowski\" as plaintiffs. However, the complaint was filed under the same docket number as the civil action initiated by Mr. Tolliver. The Mosakowskis' complaint contained the following factual allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The Plaintiffs, Martha and Joseph Mosakowski (hereinafter referred to as \"Mosakowskis\"), own property upon which they built and house located at 210 Wahahu [sic] Lane, Loudon, Tennessee. The Mosakowskis hold legal title to this property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. At all times pertinent hereto, Matthew Tolliver leased the property with an option to purchase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. The Defendant, Tellco [sic] Village Property Owners Association (hereinafter referred to as \"Tellco [sic] Village POA\"), is an organization created by developers and owners of Tellco [sic] Village to protect, inspect, repair and maintain all common areas and public\n   utilities, to include water pipelines throughout Telco [sic] Village.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4. On July 16, 2014, a section of the underground water pipelines referred to above, burst. Several thousand gallons of water erupted from the ground and flooded the Mosakowskis' yard and house causing extensive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5. Upon information and belief, the water pipelines along Wahahu [sic] Lane have broken on several occasions previously. Tellco [sic] Village POA has knowledge of the deteriorating or defective nature of these water pipelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   6. Representatives of Tellco [sic] Village POA assured the Mosakowskis that they would pay for damage, but have failed to follow through with that agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Count I of the complaint alleged that \"[a]t all times pertinent hereto, [defendant] and the Mosakowskis had entered into a contractual agreement,\" and that defendant had breached the same. Count II alleged that defendant was liable in negligence for breaching its \"duty to maintain, repair, service, troubleshoot and generally keep the water pipelines in good and working order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 16, 2017, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Mosakowskis' negligence claim. First, defendant argued that the Mosakowskis lacked standing to sue. Defendant also argued that the Mosakowskis' complaint was filed beyond the three-year period of the statute of limitations. The Mosakowskis argued that they did have standing and that their complaint should relate back to the filing of Mr. Tolliver's original complaint pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 20, 2017, defendant also filed a motion for summary judgment \"on all claims asserted by the Plaintiffs, Matthew Tolliver, Joe Mosakowski, and Martha Mosakowski[.]\" With respect to the negligence claim, defendant argued that plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence of defendant's specific duty of care or evidence of how defendant breached that duty of care. With respect to the breach of contract claim, defendant argued that plaintiffs failed to present any evidence of consideration for the alleged oral contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After defendant filed its motion for summary judgment, the trial court entered an agreed order stating that Mr. Tolliver and defendant \"have announced to the Court that they are in agreement that [defendant's] Motion for Summary Judgment filed on October 20, 2017 should be granted as to Tolliver, and that Tolliver's remaining claims against [defendant] for breach of contract and negligence should be dismissed with prejudice.\" The Mosakowskis, however, filed a memorandum of law in opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment. In their memorandum, the Mosakowskis attempted to clarify that their breach of contract claim was supported by the breach of an alleged oral contract\n   <em>\n    as well as\n   </em>\n   defendant's articles of incorporation and bylaws, which arguably operate as a written contract. For the first time, the Mosakowskis attached defendant's articles of incorporation and bylaws as an exhibit. The Mosakowskis also attached two reports prepared by defendant's third-party water loss control company purporting to show that defendant had prior notice of leaks in the community's water pipeline system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After several hearings on defendant's motions, the trial court contemporaneously entered two orders. In one order, the court found that the Mosakowskis had standing to sue; the same order, however, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the Mosakowskis' negligence claim because the court determined that the statute of limitations had expired. The court found that the Mosakowskis' complaint did not relate back to the filing of Mr. Tolliver's original\n   complaint. In the other order, the court granted summary judgment on the Mosakowskis' breach of contract claim because the court determined that there was no evidence of consideration for the alleged oral contract. The court declined to consider defendant's articles of incorporation and bylaws as evidence of a breach of contract because the Mosakowskis' complaint did not put the defendant on notice of that theory of recovery. The Mosakowskis appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Mosakowskis raise the following two issues, which we have restated slightly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss the negligence claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If we determine that the trial court erred in dismissing the Mosakowskis' negligence claim on statute of limitations grounds, defendant asks us to consider whether it was harmless error because the negligence claim would have been dismissed on summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We begin by considering whether the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss the negligence claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired. The Supreme Court has stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [a] Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) motion tests only the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint, not the strength of the plaintiff's proof.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Highwoods Props., Inc. v.

Thus, courts ruling on a Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) motion \" 'must construe the complaint liberally, presuming all factual allegations to be true and giving the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.' \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Webb v.

Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Here, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs' cause of action accrued on July 16, 2014, the date of the alleged water pipeline break. Thus, plaintiffs were required to \"commence[ ]\" their action by July 16, 2017. Mr. Tolliver filed his original complaint on December 9, 2015; however, the Mosakowskis did not file their complaint until August 23, 2017, one week after the statute of limitations had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Mosakowskis argue that their complaint should relate back to filing of Mr. Tolliver's original complaint pursuant to Rule 15 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.01 provides, in pertinent part, that \"a party may amend the party's pleadings ... by leave of court; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires....\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03 further provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [w]henever the claim or defense asserted in amended pleadings arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party or the naming of the party by or against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and if, within the period provided by law for commencing an action or within 120 days after commencement of the action, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant first argues that the Mosakowskis' complaint is not an \"amended pleading\" within the meaning of Rule 15.03. Instead, defendant contends that the Mosakowskis' complaint \"was an original pleading meant to initiate the Mosakowskis' own private cause of action for their own damages....\" In support of this argument, defendant points out that the pleading is labeled as a \"complaint\" and that Mr. Tolliver is not referenced as a co-plaintiff in the caption or the body of the pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant's argument is without merit. The Mosakowskis' decision to style their pleading as a \"complaint\" and their failure to name Mr. Tolliver as a co-plaintiff likely stems from their desire to comply with the trial court's instruction \"to file a Complaint in this matter within 14 days from the entry of the Court's Order.\" In any event, \"[i]t is well established that the courts of this state look to the substance rather than the form of pleadings in determining their nature and effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Barrett v.

Accordingly, despite its title and caption, we conclude that the Mosakowskis' pleading was, in substance, an amendment to Mr. Tolliver's original complaint and was therefore an \"amended pleading\" within the meaning of Rule 15.03.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Estate of Sutton\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , No. E2013-00245-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206669385\">\n    2013 WL 6669385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App., filed Dec. 17, 2013),\n   <em>\n    perm. app. denied\n   </em>\n   (Tenn. 2014) (holding that a pleading was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an amendment to an existing complaint, in part, because the pleading was filed \"under a new docket number\" and the person filing the pleading \"did not request that she be joined [as a party].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The question then becomes whether the Mosakowskis' amendment should relate back to the filing of Mr. Tolliver's original complaint. The first sentence of Rule 15.03 provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [w]henever the claim or defense asserted in amended pleadings arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03. This requirement is easily satisfied. The Mosakowskis' claims arise from the same alleged water pipeline break that occurred on July 16, 2014, in Tellico Village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The second sentence of Rule 15.03 sets forth additional requirements for the relation back of \"[a]n amendment changing the party or the naming of the party by or against whom a claim is asserted....\" The second sentence of Rule 15.03 applies here because the pleading under consideration adds the Mosakowskis as additional plaintiffs (\"part[ies] by ... whom a claim is asserted[.]\"). Such amendments only relate back\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   if the foregoing provision is satisfied and if, within the period provided by law for commencing an action or within 120 days after commencement of the action, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Tenn.

These additional requirements seem to be particularly adapted to the addition and substitution of new\n   <em>\n    defendants.\n   </em>\n   We have consistently held, however, that Rule 15.03 also permits the relation back of amendments adding or substituting proper party\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   , even after the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lane v.

There is a definite identity of interest between the original plaintiff and the new plaintiff in that East Ridge is pled to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Osborne. Consequently, the three primary considerations in determining whether the amended complaint relates back to the original complaint have been sufficiently satisfied to allow the amendment. Although the defendant must now defend a claim which was thought the mere passage of time had barred, statutes of limitations do not afford such an automatic insulation from suit by such a mechanical procedure.

The defendant also had notice \"that a legal claim existed in\" the\n   Mosakowskis because Mr. Tolliver's complaint alleged that the Mosakowskis held legal title to the property and that they were necessary parties to the lawsuit. Defendant even consented to the entry of an agreed order joining the Mosakowskis as parties. Defendant argues, however, that it did not have notice that \"a legal claim ... was in effect\n   <em>\n    being asserted by\n   </em>\n   \" the Mosakowskis until the filing of their amendment. We disagree. Defendant had notice that the Mosakowskis would eventually assert a claim against it as early as May 25, 2016, when defendant orally stipulated that the Mosakowskis should be joined as parties. If there was any doubt about whether the Mosakowskis would actually \"assert\" their legal claims, that doubt was eliminated on May 22, 2017, when the Mosakowskis filed a motion \"to be aligned as Plaintiffs seeking recovery.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is true that the Mosakowskis waited several months before actually filing their amendment to Mr. Tolliver's complaint, \"[b]ut neither limitations nor laches affords such an automatic insulation in so mechanical a way.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Williams\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1211693\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/405/234/#p236\">\n    405 F.2d at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant complains that the Mosakowskis' amendment was filed three months prior to trial and after the close of discovery. As a result, defendant claims that it \"was foreclosed from being able to conduct discovery on the Mosakowskis' newly-asserted claims.\" We are not persuaded that the timing of the Mosakowskis' amendment prejudiced defendant. As in\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Osborne\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Tolliver's \"original complaint sufficiently identifies the property allegedly damaged by defendant[ ] so as to prevent any unfair prejudice to the defendant[ ] in bringing in the new plaintiff who had record title to the land.\" Also like\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Osborne\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , the Mosakowskis' amendment alleged identical \"theories of recovery\" - negligence and breach of contract. The Mosakowskis' amendment did not allege materially different facts or allege any additional damages. Defendant could not have been prejudiced by the relation back of an amendment that merely re-alleged the same facts, the same causes of action, and the same damages. Consequently, the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Osborne\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   test is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The third prong of the\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Osborne\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   test is whether \"there is an 'identity of interest' between the original party plaintiff and the new party plaintiff.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9930105\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/561/160/#p164\">\n    561 S.W.2d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An identity of interest exists when the plaintiff sought to be added is so closely identified with the original plaintiff that permitting the new party to enter will not be prejudicial to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lane\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202325620\">\n    2013 WL 2325620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12. Again, we perceive no reason why the joinder of the Mosakowskis or the relation back of their amendment would prejudice defendant in any way. Mr. Tolliver and the Mosakowskis both have an interest in the same parcel of real property. Under our precedents, the Mosakowskis, as record title owners, are entitled to all damages arising out of a meritorious claim and must hold any damages in excess of their interest in trust for the benefit of Mr. Tolliver, the equitable owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Parker v.

Defendant cites cases from other jurisdictions which have held that a trial court's premature dismissal for failure to state a claim is harmless error when summary judgment would have otherwise been appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Amasia Acoustics, LLC v.

Ct. App., filed Dec. 9, 2008). The parties have not cited, and we have not identified, any Tennessee cases applying the harmless error doctrine in this way. Nevertheless, we agree that premature dismissal under Rule 12.02(6) is harmless error if, at the time of the trial court's ruling, (1) there was a pending motion for summary judgment, (2) the non-moving party had a full and fair opportunity to respond, and (3) summary judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment shortly after filing its motion to dismiss. The Mosakowskis submitted a response in opposition to defendant's motion that included additional discovery materials purporting to establish the existence of genuine issues of material fact. The trial court also held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, if summary judgment was appropriate as a matter of law, then the trial court's dismissal of the negligence claim pursuant to Rule 12.02(6) was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04. The Supreme Court\n   has ruled that \"when the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial,\" as is the case here,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   the moving party may satisfy its burden of production either (1) by affirmatively negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party's evidence at the summary judgment stage is insufficient to establish the nonmoving party's claim or defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Rye v.

Although the pleadings assert a \"breach of contract\" claim, the only factual allegations that support such a claim are the alleged conversations between defendant's representatives and the Mosakowskis. After reviewing the record, it is clear that the first time the defendant's articles of incorporation were directly mentioned was in the Mosakowskis' response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In our view, the Mosakowskis' proof of the defendant's articles of incorporation and bylaws materially varies from the allegations made in their pleading. This case was commenced on December 9, 2015 when Mr. Tolliver filed his original complaint. There was no indication that any of the plaintiffs were alleging breach of a written contract until almost two years later when the Mosakowskis filed their response to defendant's motion for summary judgment. This came after the close of discovery and approximately one month before trial. Such short notice of an entirely new theory of recovery would certainly prejudice defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Town of Franklin v. Hermitage Engineering Company\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , this Court noted that \"where one brings a suit on a written contract he cannot recover on proof of a verbal contract, or where one sues on an express contract he cannot recover on an implied contract, on account of variance in the pleading and proof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1930%20WL%201717\">\n    1930 WL 1717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Tenn.

Ct. App. 2010) (\"[A] plaintiff may not raise a new theory of recovery for the first time in response to the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Rather, the proper procedure would have been to seek to the amend the complaint....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In a last ditch effort to save their new theory of recovery, the Mosakowskis observe that paragraph three of their amendment includes language nearly identical to the defendant's articles of incorporation. We are not persuaded that\n   such an indirect and tangential reference to the articles of incorporation was sufficient to put defendant on notice that the Mosakowskis were alleging breach of a written contract. Moreover, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 10.03 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Whenever a claim or defense is founded upon a written instrument other than a policy of insurance, a copy of such instrument or the pertinent parts thereof shall be attached to the pleading as an exhibit unless the instrument is (1) a matter of public record in the county in which the action is commenced and its location in the record is set forth in the pleading; (2) in the possession of the adverse party and this fact is stated in the pleading; (3) inaccessible to the pleader or is of such nature that attaching the instrument would be unnecessary or impracticable and this fact is stated in the pleading, together with the reason therefor. Every exhibit so attached or referred to under (1) and (2) shall be a part of the pleading for all purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 10.03. Thus, when a plaintiff seeks to recover on a theory that the defendant breached a written contract, the rules of civil procedure require a heightened pleading standard; the plaintiff must\n   <em>\n    attach\n   </em>\n   the written instrument unless certain exceptions apply. Here, the only potentially relevant exception would be (2). This exception, however, does not apply. Although defendant would have certainly been in possession of its own articles of incorporation and bylaws, that fact was not \"stated in the pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093877\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/398/630/#p661\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to consider the defendant's articles of incorporation and bylaws as evidence of breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   We now turn to the alleged oral contract. The Mosakowskis' amendment stated that \"[r]epresentatives of [defendant] assured the Mosakowskis that they would pay for damage, but have failed to follow through with that agreement.\" The Mosakowskis also point to Mr. Tolliver's deposition, in which he stated: \"To the best of my knowledge, everybody I talked to said, you know, they're going to fix it; it will be no problem. You know, they'll take care of everything.\" On appeal, the Mosakowskis insist that the alleged statements by defendant's representatives are evidence of defendant's \"pure acceptance of responsibility.\" The Mosakowskis claim that these statements are admissible into evidence pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 803 (1.2) (admissions by party-opponent). According to the Mosakowskis, these alleged statements \"raise a genuine issue of material fact as to liability\" and \"[a] trier [of] fact could determine that the statements constitute admissions by the Defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Mosakowskis' focus on the rules of evidence is misplaced. Although the admissibility of evidence is a threshold issue at the summary judgment stage, the\n   <em>\n    ultimate\n   </em>\n   issue is not whether the statements are admissible or even whether a jury could interpret those statements as defendant's \"pure acceptance of responsibility.\" Rather, the issue is whether defendant's alleged statements, if true, created an enforceable contract supported by consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \"[C]onsideration exists when the promisee does something that it is under no legal obligation to do or refrains from doing something which it has a legal right to do.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Brown Oil Co., Inc. v.

Based on this evidence, the trial court concluded that the Mosakowskis never agreed to give up anything in exchange for defendant's alleged promises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In our view, the trial court erred in making that determination at the summary judgment stage.
