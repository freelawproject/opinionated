PALAFOX, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, Socorro Independent School District (SISD or District) challenges the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. SISD asserts that the doctrine of governmental immunity deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over Appellee James Hamilton's claim for breach of a separation agreement. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hamilton was employed for many years by SISD after having been hired in October of 1996. On April 14, 2014, Hamilton entered into a term contract to work as the head orchestra director at William D. Slider Middle School for the 2014-2015 school year. By its terms, the employment contract ended on May 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By affidavit, Hamilton (who was over 40 years of age at the time) asserted that the principal of the school informed him he was going to recommend the non-renewal of his contract for the 2015-2016 school year. Upon hearing of the non-renewal, Hamilton then anticipated he would file a lawsuit against SISD for age discrimination. After some negotiations, however, he signed a \"Separation Agreement and Release of Claims,\" on April 16, 2015, which was also signed by the Superintendent of Schools for SISD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hamilton asserted that\n   he entered into the agreement \"in exchange for paid administrative leave, unemployment compensation, and a neutral reference.\" Hamilton further asserted that, among its other terms, the settlement released his rights to any federal or state law claims including claims for discrimination under Federal and Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By its terms, the agreement purported that it resolved all claims and causes of action of any kind whatsoever arising out of Hamilton's employment with SISD. SISD acknowledged that the circumstances presented an involuntary work separation and SISD would not argue waiver or release if Hamilton filed an application for unemployment insurance benefits. The parties further agreed that Hamilton would remain on administrative leave with pay up until the effective date of his resignation. Hamilton agreed to submit his irrevocable letter of resignation effective May 30, 2015. SISD agreed to provide a neutral reference of Hamilton to prospective employers. As specified, the neutral reference would be limited to Hamilton's beginning and ending dates of employment, positions held, and salary. The parties also agreed that no report would be made to the Texas Education Agency or the State Board for Educator Certification and Hamilton would give up any privileges he had pursuant to Chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code. The agreement stated that its terms were contractual, and its purpose was \"to compromise disputed claims, avoid litigation, and buy peace[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For valuable consideration, the agreement expressly provided that both parties agreed to abide by the following release and discharge of claims and causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Release\n   </em>\n   . For valuable consideration stated above, both parties agree to fully release and discharge each other, and each other's past, present, and future trustees, employees, representatives, and assigns, in both their individual and official capacities, from all claims, including administrative claims, causes of action, rights and obligations arising under the federal or state constitutions, laws or regulations, or board policies regarding any acts or events occurring before the date of execution of this Agreement, whether or not such actions could have been brought in this case or arise out of the facts of this case including without limitation any claims or causes of action arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act or any other state or federal equal employment opportunity law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nearly a year later, on April 13, 2016, Hamilton filed an original petition alleging that SISD breached the settlement agreement by giving negative references when he applied for teaching positions at local school districts. Hamilton's petition asserted that he had fulfilled his obligation under the agreement by releasing SISD from liability of all claims regarding any acts or events occurring before the date of the execution of the agreement. Hamilton alleged causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and fraudulent inducement. Responding, SISD filed a general denial and pleaded several affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 30, 2018, SISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction and no evidence motion for summary judgment. As a local governmental entity, SISD asserted that Hamilton's claims were barred by immunity which SISD had not waived. SISD also asserted that Hamilton had offered no factual basis\n   for his alleged breach of contract, fraud, or fraudulent inducement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Responding, Hamilton first included a procedural history of the case in which he affirmatively informed the trial court of his intent to proceed solely on his breach of settlement claim and to abandon his other two causes of action as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff hereby waives his fraud [sic] fraudulent inducement claims. The parties have agreed to limit the May 16, 2018 hearing to Defendant's Plea to the Jurisdiction and therefore this response will be limited to the plea to the jurisdiction issues. The Parties agreed that the Motion for Summary Judgment would only be heard after the Court has signed an order on the Plea to the Jurisdiction and that additional discovery is necessary for a response to the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As jurisdictional evidence in support of his breach of settlement claim, Hamilton attached (1) his own affidavit; (2) the separation agreement and release of all claims; (3) his original petition; (4) his 2014-2015 employment contract; and (5) pro-forma contracts and non-renewal documents from SISD. Hamilton's affidavit included his assertion that he anticipated filing a lawsuit for age discrimination against SISD before he negotiated the settlement agreement with SISD. Later, when the trial court held a hearing on SISD's plea, Hamilton confirmed he had waived his fraud claims and the parties agreed they were proceeding solely on the breach of contract claim. After argument from both sides, the trial court denied SISD's plea to the jurisdiction directed at the breach of contract cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This interlocutory appeal followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   SISD appeals the trial court's order denying its plea to the jurisdiction asserting that the doctrine of governmental immunity applies to it as a political subdivision of the state and protects it from Hamilton's breach of contract suit. Responding, Hamilton asserts that waiver of immunity applies to his breach of contract claim based on multiple reasons. First, Hamilton asserts that he contractually released a class of claims for which immunity had been waived when he entered into a separation agreement with SISD, and thus, SISD cannot assert immunity against his allegation that SISD has breached the separation agreement. Second, Hamilton asserts that the separation agreement itself qualifies as a contract on which immunity has been waived by the Legislature. Third, Hamilton asserts that waiver should apply given that he relinquished due process rights by entering into the separation agreement. Fourth, Hamilton asserts that equitable principles support waiver of immunity under the circumstances of this case. Finally, Hamilton asserts that SISD waived immunity by its conduct in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction is a mechanism by which a party contests the trial court's authority to decide a case.\n   <em>\n    Bland Indep.

Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   given that these cases not only differ factually from the circumstances in this instance, but also because they are not controlling. Viewing the evidence favorable to Hamilton, as we must, Hamilton established that he had anticipated filing an\n   age-discrimination claim prior to reaching a settlement agreement with SISD only days after he was informed of his involuntary separation of employment. Thus, at the time the parties signed the separation agreement and release of claims, deadlines had not yet passed for him to comply with jurisdictional prerequisites of certain statutory claims. Based on the terms of the separation agreement itself, we can reasonably infer that SISD knew of its exposure to Hamilton's age discrimination claim as this claim, for example, was expressly included among others for which the district sought and obtained a release and discharge from Hamilton. By negotiating for a release of discrimination-related claims, SISD contractually precluded Hamilton from initiating and fulfilling his 180-day filing prerequisite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.202 (claimant must file complaint with TWC or EEOC no later than 180th day after the date alleging an unlawful employment practice has occurred). Beyond merely resolving his separation of employment, the agreement that SISD entered provided that the parties had agreed that Hamilton would fully release and discharge SISD for all claims including those that could be brought under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In other words, like in\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   , SISD had concerns about being exposed to statutorily recognized claims when Hamilton entered into the agreement with the school district. Following the controlling authority of\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, we conclude that the District could not nullify the legislative waiver of immunity by entering into a separation agreement that included a release and discharge provision contractually barring Hamilton from initiating statutory claims including one for age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311985\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/87/518/#p521\">\n    87 S.W.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"when a governmental entity is\n   <em>\n    exposed to suit\n   </em>\n   because of a waiver of immunity, it cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an agreement on which it cannot be sued\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12659613\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/573/212/#p221\">\n    573 S.W.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   provides that a governmental entity cannot create immunity for itself by settling a claim for which it lacks immunity only to assert immunity from suit in a subsequent action to enforce the government's agreement.\");\n   <em>\n    Travis County, Texas v.

(\"County is not immune from [claimant's] suit for breach of the Settlement Agreement, which settled viable claims under the Whistleblower Act.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the agreement in this instance reflects that SISD acknowledged its exposure to a class of claims on which immunity had been waived by the Legislature (i.e., an age-discrimination claim pursuant to TCHRA) at a time when those claims remained viable, SISD could not nullify the waiver of immunity by simply entering into a release and separation agreement that precluded Hamilton from timely pursing such claims then later asserting that governmental immunity applied to a claim that SISD had breached the separation agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311985\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/87/518/#p521\">\n    87 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   521 ;\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086563\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/198/#p205\">\n    414 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   204-05 ;\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351874\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/232/790/#p800\">\n    232 S.W.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore hold that because a waiver of immunity was statutorily established on Hamilton's then-viable age-discrimination claim when he entered into the settlement agreement, Hamilton's later claim of breach of the separation agreement was not barred by governmental immunity. Accordingly, we overrule SISD's sole issue based on Hamilton's first argument and there is no need for us to reach his remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Hamilton's counsel stated in his oral argument that Hamilton was notified of the non-renewal of his contract on April 8, 2015, or eight days before he signed the settlement agreement and release of claim.
