The jury assessed Lara's punishment at 10 years in prison for each count. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Eight judgments were signed, one for each count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lara filed one notice of appeal, showing her desire to appeal from \"the judgment of conviction and sentence\" rendered against her in Trial Court Case No. \"15,026-Counts 1-8.\" The appeal therefore bears one case number, Court of Appeals No. 10-17-00326-CR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lara's appointed appellate counsel filed a brief challenging only the judgment and sentence for Count IV. Because Lara did not challenge the judgment for Counts I through III and V through VIII, a brief bringing any alleged error or an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   -type motion to withdraw and a supporting brief as to Counts I through III and V through VIII must be filed in this proceeding within 30 days from the date of this order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). If counsel files a motion to withdraw, counsel should also file a motion to sever as to any or all counts as to which the motion applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirven v.
