Following a bench trial, the trial court found Millett guilty of murder in the first degree and armed criminal action after he shot and killed a man at a gas station. Millett presents two points on appeal, both alleging that the motion court erred in denying his Rule 29.15\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion because trial counsel was ineffective. Point One contends that trial counsel failed to properly obtain Millett's informed consent to waive a jury trial. Point Two asserts that trial counsel failed to object to the State's aggressive and argumentative questioning of Millett during cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    All Rule references are to Mo. R. Crim. P. (2014).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
