Rxpress is a compounding pharmacy, which means it mixes and alters medications to create its own drugs. The compounding-pharmacy industry has grown rapidly and become very lucrative, especially through the sales of high-priced designer drugs. But as the industry has grown, it has suffered from increased scrutiny and controversy. In 2013, Congress passed legislation to improve oversight of compounding operations. Compounding Quality Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353b (2013). And in 2015, in response to concerns about compounding pharmacies' marketing tactics, Texas enacted legislation allowing state regulators to obtain pharmacy financial records. Act of May 22, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch. 599, \u00a7 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%202012\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 2012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified at TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7 556.051 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The national media took notice when Tricare, a military pharmacy-benefits provider, blamed compounding pharmacies for a significant rise in their outpatient-drug costs. The pharmacies were accused of shady practices such as cold calling military retirees, suggestively inquiring into their need for pain care, and then selling them compounded drugs. Instances of falsified Tricare billing, as well as compounding pharmacies paying kickbacks to marketers and doctors in exchange for prescriptions, have resulted in increased legislative and judicial scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rxpress did not escape the controversy. In September 2015, it sued Ruth Haynes, its former bookkeeper, for falsely representing that she was a certified public accountant and for causing Rxpress to incur over $ 12 million in unnecessary federal income taxes. In her responsive pleadings, Haynes alleged Rxpress paid kickbacks to physicians, schemed with other\n   physicians to circumvent anti-kickback laws, and committed tax evasion and stock fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2016, the Halls sued their estranged business partners, Scott Schuster and Dustin Rall, for fraud, theft, breach of fiduciary duty, and other torts. The allegations included charges that Schuster and Rall wrongly diverted millions of dollars of partnership property to themselves. In their filings, the Halls admitted that early in the venture's history-around 2013-they discovered that Rxpress had been illegally charging commissions for prescription sales, but they had since then taken steps to correct their actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also in January 2016, Xpress Compounding sued Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy-benefit manager, to prevent Prime from removing Xpress from Prime's pharmacy network. Prime responded that it terminated its contract with Xpress due to internal auditing results. According to Prime, Xpress had a ninety-one percent error rate for audited prescriptions, suffered invoice shortages and billing inconsistencies, refilled unauthorized prescriptions, and manipulated billing to avoid clinical-review requirements. And in February 2016, Ancillary Medical Services Management sued the Halls for embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and other torts involving Ancillary's investment in Rxpress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, Department of Defense agents, under a search warrant issued by a federal magistrate in the Northern District of Texas, raided the home of Nathan Halsey, a pharmaceutical marketer, on February 5, 2016. The warrant authorized the agents to search for and seize \"all communications\" between \"Nathan Halsey, Britt Hawrylack, Matthew Hawrylack, Dustin Rall, Scott Schuster, Richard Hall, Lewis Hall, Jr., and any other associate of Rxpress Pharmacy, Rxpress Laboratories, Tactical Health Care Partners, and Tiger Racing Team that\" related to, among other things, \"the submission of claims for reimbursement for any health care service, prescription drug, or testing, or the facilitation of payment to recruiters, marketers, doctors, beneficiaries or others for referral to Rxpress Pharmacy, Rxpress Laboratories, Tactical Health Care Partners, and Tiger Racing Team.\" The search warrant also directed agents to communications that \"show or demonstrate connections or relationships such as ownership, control, responsibility, direction, or authorization within Rxpress Pharmacy, Tactical Health Care Partners, and Tiger Racing Team.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February and March 2016, Krause wrote, and the News published, a series of articles about the compounding industry, including several that featured Rxpress. The first, \"North Texas Pharmacy in Federal Probe is Accused of Paying Kickbacks to Doctors,\" ran on February 5 and focused on Rxpress. Noting that \"[f]ederal authorities are investigating\" Rxpress, it drew largely from the Haynes and Schuster/Rall lawsuits as well as the Halsey search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next article, \"Texas Pharmacy Regulators Have New Law to Scrutinize Financial Ties to Doctors,\" appeared on February 9. In it, the News described the new Texas law and concerns in Texas and across the nation that physicians were receiving inappropriate financial incentives for prescribing compounded medications. It further stated that Rxpress was \"being investigated for possible violations of the anti-kickback law by the Department of Defense due to its use of Tricare money\" and noted that the investigation could focus on either of two federal anti-kickback laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another article, appearing on February 24, detailed the indictment of another Metroplex-area compounding pharmacy. It noted that this case was the \"first federal indictment in North Texas in connection with the government's large-scale criminal investigation into compounding pharmacies.\" It added that Rxpress was \"under investigation in connection with similar allegations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a final article, \"North Texas Compounding Pharmacy Under Federal Scrutiny was Booted from Private Network over Fraud Concerns,\" the News reported on Rxpress's suit against Prime and quoted Prime's filings alleging it terminated its contract with Rxpress due to audit findings \"consistent with ... fraud, or at a minimum, inaccurate record keeping.\" The article referred to the Haynes lawsuit, highlighting accusations that Rxpress paid illegal kickbacks to physicians, and to the Ancillary lawsuit, noting allegations that the Halls had used their \"ill-gotten gains\" to pay for luxuries like two jets, exotic vacations, and real estate. All in all, the articles portray Rxpress as a deeply troubled business venture under pressure from both civil lawsuits and a federal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rxpress sued the News for defamation for publishing statements that \"[f]ederal authorities are investigating [Rxpress].\" Rxpress further charged that, by including the claim that Rxpress was under investigation in its separate coverage of other pharmacies' wrongdoing, the News had implied that Rxpress was guilty of misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The News moved to dismiss the claims under the Texas Citizens Participation Act. It argued that the Halsey search warrant conclusively established Rxpress was indeed under investigation. The News added that Rxpress could not meet its burden to show that the articles were not substantially true and that the articles' reporting of third party allegations in civil lawsuits and other official proceedings was both true and privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, Rxpress insisted that it was not under federal investigation. As support, it submitted a declaration by Richard Hall in which he denied knowledge of any investigation involving Rxpress and Tricare. He knew Rxpress was not under investigation, he testified, because when he asked enforcement officers whether it was, they told him it was not. Hall further relied on an expert report by Michael Heiskell, a criminal-defense attorney. Heiskell opined that the search warrant did not support any conclusion that Rxpress was under or the subject of a federal investigation into healthcare fraud or any other criminal violation. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The News then filed an interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court of appeals held that the articles have at least two gists.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n    524 S.W.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, \"a person of ordinary intelligence could conclude that one gist of the publications was that Rxpress was under federal investigation for violating criminal laws aimed at prohibiting fraud in the healthcare context, including Tricare.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n    at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, \"federal investigators were cracking down on fraud in the compounding pharmacy industry, including in North Texas, not only by making arrests but also by continuing\n   to investigate compounding pharmacies, including RXpress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The News primarily argued to the court of appeals that the search warrant establishes its substantial-truth defense under section 27.005(d) of the Act. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.005(d) (\"[T]he court shall dismiss a legal action against the moving party if the moving party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence each essential element of a valid defense to the nonmovant's claim.\"). But the court of appeals concluded that the search warrant creates dueling inferences and noted that the inference that Rxpress was under investigation \"is but one reasonable\n   <em>\n    inference\n   </em>\n   to be drawn from the four corners of the search warrant,\" but \"not the only reasonable inference to be drawn.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n    524 S.W.3d at 377-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An equally reasonable, if not much stronger, inference,\" the court continued, \"is that\n   <em>\n    Halsey\n   </em>\n   was under investigation by the federal government,\n   <em>\n    not [Rxpress].\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After holding the News had not established its substantial-truth defense, the court of appeals turned to whether Rxpress had satisfied its burden to prove a prima facie case of defamation. Incorporating its previous discussion on the Halsey search warrant, the court of appeals maintained that \"the search warrant is itself some evidence that [Rxpress was] not under federal investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, the court leaned on the Hall declaration, overruling the News's personal-knowledge and hearsay objections.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 379. Rxpress, the court of appeals held, had met its burden to state a prima facie case of defamation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After reviewing the civil lawsuits and declaring they did not have much-if anything-to do with healthcare fraud, the court of appeals concluded that the News had selectively incorporated statements about fraud in the lawsuits and juxtaposed them against reports about investigations into other compounding pharmacies. This, the court stated, cast Rxpress in a worse light than did the civil proceedings themselves.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n    at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held, therefore, that Rxpress had met its burden to establish a prima facie case that the gists were not substantially true.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385637\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/369/\">\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We granted the News's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Texas Citizens Participation Act is a bulwark against retaliatory lawsuits meant to intimidate or silence citizens on matters of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p586\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (Tex. 2015). A defendant in a case that \"is based on, relates to, or is in response to a party's exercise of the right of free speech\" may move for dismissal under the Act. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.003(a). Dismissal requires two steps.

As both alleged meanings arise from the text of the articles, and nothing outside the articles is required to understand them, we classify them as \"textual defamation[s].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tatum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657376\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/614/#p623\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining textual defamation as \"defamation that arises from the statement's text without reference to any extrinsic evidence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Though the first meaning-that Rxpress is \"under investigation\"-is plainly and expressly set out in the articles, the second meaning-that Rxpress actually violated healthcare laws-is implied.

The News does not dispute that these meanings, if shown to arise from false statements of fact, are capable of defaming Rxpress. But the News does not concede that it made any false statements. And it contends that the official-proceeding\n   privilege and the third-party-allegation rule, codified in the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, mean the second alleged defamatory meaning-the implication that Rxpress has violated the law-is not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We first consider whether, under the Act, Rxpress has satisfied its burden to establish-by clear and specific evidence-a prima facie case for every essential element of the defamation claim, including falsity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

According to Rxpress, the Halsey search warrant is clear and specific evidence that it was not \"under investigation.\" Rxpress insists that as the search warrant was directed at and generally concerns Halsey, who has never been employed by Rxpress, it shows Halsey was under investigation-not Rxpress. But the News responds that the warrant expressly sought communications between Halsey on the one hand and, on the other, the Halls \"and any other associate of Rxpress.\" The sought-after communications concerned \"insurance reimbursements\" and anything that might \"show or demonstrate connections or relationships ... within Rxpress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the search warrant, which concerned possible violations of federal healthcare fraud laws, was directed at Halsey, it expressly focused on obtaining information about Rxpress. By its own terms, the warrant sought all communications among Halsey, the Halls, and other Rxpress owners and associates that related either to payments made by Rxpress or to aspects of Rxpress's \"ownership, control, responsibility, direction, [and] authorization.\" The court of appeals concluded the warrant did not establish Rxpress was under investigation-a holding we do not reach today. But even if the court of appeals were correct, we struggle to see how a search warrant seeking documents and communications on Rxpress's owners and operations, in the context of an inquiry into possible healthcare fraud, is clear and specific evidence that Rxpress was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"under investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We agree with the News that the Hall affidavit also does not point to falsity. A witness may testify to a matter only if the evidence \"support[s] a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" TEX. R. EVID. 602. And hearsay-an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted-is inadmissible. TEX. R. EVID. 801, 802. The relevant portions of the Hall affidavit contain inadmissible hearsay and double hearsay: \"We know this because we inquired, through counsel, directly of the enforcement officers ... about whether any such investigation was occurring and we learned unequivocally, that it was not.\" Moreover, the portions of the affidavit that purport to\n   be within Hall's personal knowledge are matters that Hall could not have personally known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even an executive \"with his ear to the ground\" is unlikely to have personal knowledge of a sealed Department of Defense investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only explanation Hall gives for how he knew Rxpress was not under investigation is the inquiry to and response by the enforcement officers. Even assuming those officers would discuss a sealed federal investigation if asked about it by the person under investigation, Hall cannot rely on these statements as the basis for his personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kerlin v.

At best, the Hall affidavit is evidence that one of Rxpress's owners was not aware of an investigation. That's it, and that's not enough.

Because Rxpress has not met-and, under these circumstances, cannot meet-its burden under the Act to show a prima facie case for defamation, the News is entitled to dismissal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The court of appeals held that Rxpress satisfied its burden under the Act to defeat the News's motion to dismiss. Because that holding was incorrect, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. We further remand this cause to the trial court for entry of a judgment of dismissal and a determination of costs and fees to be awarded to the News under the provisions of the Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.009.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Justice Busby did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
