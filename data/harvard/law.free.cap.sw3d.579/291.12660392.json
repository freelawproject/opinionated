After an evidentiary hearing, the motion court found that, due to untimely filing of his initial 29.15(b) motion, Muhammad had waived his right to proceed under Rule 29.15; and also found that, were his claims not barred, they nonetheless failed on the merits. On appeal, Muhammad argues that the untimely filing of his initial 29.15(b) motion should have been excused due to third party interference. He further maintains that the motion court erred in denying his claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to fully develop a defense that Muhammad was misidentified as the shooter and for failing to argue that Muhammad acted in self-defense. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Muhammad was tried before a jury in the Jackson County Circuit Court on four separate charges alleging that, on May 19, 2011, he shot and killed Mohamed Hussein, and that he shot at, but did not injure, Anwar Ali, at a park in Kansas City, Missouri. The jury found Muhammad guilty and the trial court imposed concurrent sentences of 30 years for second degree murder, 15 years for assault in the first degree, and five years on each of the two armed criminal action charges. As directed by Rule 29.07\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , after sentencing,\n   the trial court confirmed with Muhammad's trial counsel that Muhammad had been advised of the rights afforded him under Rule 29.15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A signed acknowledgement of defendant's rights under Rule 29.15 was filed on October, 17, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On direct appeal, Muhammad was initially represented by appointed counsel. On September 22, 2014, appointed counsel moved to withdraw; and on the next day Muhammad's private counsel (referred to herein as \"Attorney J.\") filed his entry of appearance, which stated: \"Because the appellant is no longer indigent, he consents to the public defender's forthcoming motion for leave to withdraw.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Court affirmed Muhammad's convictions in his direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The motion court appointed counsel, an amended motion was filed, and the State filed its response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his testimony at the motion hearing, Muhammad indicated that Attorney J. told him that he had up to 180 days after the issuance of the mandate to file his initial motion; that Attorney J. said he would come to the prison to assist Muhammad in filing the motion; and that he relied on Attorney J.'s advice in determining when to file his initial 29.15(b) motion. At the motion hearing, Attorney J. confirmed that he had incorrectly advised Muhammad that he had 180 days from the issuance of the mandate to file his Form 40 post-conviction motion. Attorney J. testified that he told Muhammad that he would \"help in any way [he could]\" to get his initial 29.15(b) motion filed; and \"even told [Muhammad] that [he] would make arrangements to meet with him at the prison to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The motion court issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and a Judgment denying relief.

Instead, he asserts that his appellate counsel actively interfered by giving him incorrect advice regarding the time to file his motion. In particular, Muhammad contends that, if counsel had not provided erroneous information regarding the filing deadline, he would have timely prepared and filed his Rule 29.15 motion.

The Form 40 admonition indicates: \"The movant is required to include in this motion every claim known to him for vacating, setting aside or correcting the conviction and sentence or it will be waived or abandoned. Be sure to include every claim.\" Muhammad claims that this misstates the law because Missouri Courts have found the initial brief described in Rule 29.15(b) to be \"relatively informal\" and that a movant meets the requirements of the rule if it provides notice that the movant is seeking relief under Rule 29.15.\n   <em>\n    Bullard v.

In this matter we have no record before us to note whether counsel had a conflict, whether that conflict (if any) was waived, and whether any such conflict prejudiced Muhammad. Muhammad also speculates that by letting the deadline lapse, Attorney J. avoided the possibility that Muhammad would raise a claim that his representation on the direct appeal had been ineffective. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Muhammad had any issues with Attorney J.'s efforts on direct appeal; and no such claims were raised by appointed post-conviction counsel in Muhammad's amended 29.15(g) motion. Attorney J.'s forthright admission at the evidentiary motion hearing suggests that, quite to the contrary, he simply erred, and did not seek to excuse or conceal his error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Propst v.
