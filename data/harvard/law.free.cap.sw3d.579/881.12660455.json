V, sec. 10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Standing Order, June 16, 1988 (effective July 1, 1988). This Court affirms the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 26, 2004, Movant was involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of his passenger. Over the next several months, Victim conducted the investigation of the accident, which criminally implicated Movant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 20, 2005, at approximately 12:20 p.m., Movant borrowed his grandmother's red Pontiac Grand Am (hereinafter, \"the red car\"), which had a bright yellow sticker on the trunk near the driver's side. Between 1:45 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. that afternoon, various witnesses noticed a red car with a bright yellow sticker affixed to the driver's side of the trunk parked on the wrong side of the road a few hundred feet from Victim's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 4:03 p.m. that day, Victim returned home, backed his patrol car into his driveway, and radioed dispatch he was ending his shift. As Victim exited his vehicle, he was shot from behind with a high-powered rifle that penetrated his Kevlar vest. The bullet severed Victim's spinal cord at the neck, immediately paralyzing him. Victim fell backward and suffered fractures to his skull and ribs upon impact with the pavement. The killer then approached Victim, who was still alive, and shot him twice\n   more with a shotgun into his face and shoulder. The recovered rifle bullet was deformed, but ballistics experts determined it belonged to the .22 to .24 caliber class of ammunition that would fit a .243 caliber rifle. Investigators later learned that, around 7 p.m. on the evening of Victim's murder, Movant's wife gave Movant's uncle a box of .243 caliber bullets and stated, \"[Movant] said you'd know what to do with them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Movant returned the red car to his grandmother between 4:15 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. that same day. Investigators calculated it took approximately eighteen minutes to drive from Movant's grandmother's house to the location where the red car with the yellow sticker had been parked near Victim's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two highway patrol investigators interviewed Movant at his residence that evening. Movant immediately denied killing Victim and stated he spent all day working around his house with his neighbor, Sylvan Duncan (hereinafter, \"Sylvan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, Movant again met with investigators and elaborated on the alibi. Movant claimed he was visiting relatives, including his grandmother, and he watched from his living room as Sylvan pushed brush. Movant stated he knew Victim was investigating him for the fatal accident and, without prompting, declared he did not know where Victim lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that day, Movant visited his grandmother and instructed her to tell the police he had been home all day the day Victim was shot. When his grandmother told Movant she would not lie for him, he put his finger over her mouth and said, \"I was home all day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Police arrested Movant on March 23, 2005, for leaving the scene of the car accident that resulted in his passenger's death. The state subsequently charged Movant with leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident, first-degree murder for Victim's death, and armed criminal action. The state proceeded to trial only on the first-degree murder charge and sought the death penalty. Movant was represented initially by several public defenders, including Thomas Marshall (hereinafter, \"Marshall\" and, collectively, \"the first trial team\"). Movant later obtained private counsel and was represented at trial by Brad Kessler (hereinafter, \"Kessler\"), David Bruns (hereinafter, \"Bruns\"), and Mollyanne Henshaw (hereinafter, \"Henshaw\" and collectively, \"trial counsel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state theorized Movant killed Victim to stop the fatal car accident investigation. Movant's defense was it was ridiculous for him to believe, simply by killing Victim, law enforcement would halt its investigation into the accident. Trial counsel also argued the police improperly directed all their investigative attention toward him rather than pursuing other possible perpetrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a five-day guilt phase proceeding, the jury found Movant guilty of first-degree murder. During the penalty phase, the state submitted four statutory aggravators pursuant to section 565.032.2: (1) Victim was a \"peace officer\" and the \"murder was committed because of the exercise of his official duty;\" (2) Movant was depraved of mind when he killed Victim and, \"as a result thereof, the murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman;\" (3) Victim was murdered \"for the purpose of avoiding ... or preventing a lawful arrest;\" and (4) Victim was a\n   \"potential witness in [a] past or pending investigation ... and was killed as a result of his status as a ... potential witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury found the first, third, and fourth statutory aggravators were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury did not find unanimously the circumstances in mitigation outweighed those in aggravation. However, the jury was unable to agree which punishment to recommend. After overruling Movant's motion for new trial, the circuit court imposed a death sentence pursuant to section 565.034.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Movant appealed and raised nine points of error. This Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment and conducted an independent proportionality review pursuant to section 565.035.3. Movant filed a timely Rule 29.15 motion for post-conviction relief, alleging several claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, made credibility determinations, and denied Movant relief. Movant now appeals, raising seventeen claims of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court reviews the denial of post-conviction relief to determine whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.

Two months before serving on the jury, Juror 58 published a 184-page book, which he described as a fictionalized autobiography. The book contains six pages chronicling the protagonist's brutal and graphic revenge murder of a defendant who killed the protagonist's wife in a drunken-driving accident. The protagonist viewed the defendant as escaping justice in the court system because the defendant received only probation following his conviction. The book's front and back covers contain illustrations of blood spatter. The back cover states the protagonist's life changed forever when his wife was killed and her murderer was set free. The cover states the protagonist \"sought vengeance\" and \"seeks justice\" and \"knows he will die fighting the system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Point I - Failure to Question Juror 58 during Voir Dire\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Movant argues the motion court clearly erred in denying his claim trial counsel were ineffective for failing to question Juror 58 when he volunteered he was a published author. Movant claims questioning Juror 58 about the book's contents would have uncovered grounds to strike him for cause. Movant claims he was prejudiced because the book's contents demonstrated Juror 58 could not serve fairly and should have been struck for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A defendant has a constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial.

Kessler reviewed the book overnight and presented arguments concerning Juror 58's fitness to serve as a juror the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Kessler read excerpts into the record and argued the excerpts demonstrated Juror 58 was not truthful when he answered questions during voir dire. Kessler asked the circuit court to question Juror 58 on the record about the book's contents and his personal beliefs. Kessler also requested the circuit court question all of the jurors about any effect Juror 58's personal beliefs and opinions had on jury deliberations. The circuit court denied the request to question Juror 58 because it found no evidence of juror misconduct and believed questioning Juror 58 might improperly taint the whole jury. Kessler then moved for a mistrial, arguing he would have to concede ineffectiveness for failing to inquire about the book during voir dire. The circuit court overruled the motion but advised Movant he could question the jurors, if necessary, after the trial. Juror 58 later was removed from the jury by the consent of the parties and did not participate in the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his motion for new trial, Movant argued the circuit court erred in failing to declare a mistrial after the book's contents were revealed. Movant alleged Juror 58 failed to disclose he wrote a book about the criminal justice system. Movant further alleged Juror 58 failed to inform the circuit court during voir dire he believed the court system was weak and vigilante justice was an appropriate remedy. Movant argued the book constituted evidence Juror 58 was not completely truthful about his views about the death penalty and his experiences with the criminal justice system. The circuit court overruled Movant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On direct appeal, Movant argued the circuit court should have sustained his motion for a mistrial or motion for new trial because the book's contents were so close to the facts of Movant's case and revealed such an inherent bias it must have meant Juror 58 lied during voir dire when he stated he could be fair and impartial.\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, [Movant's] argument that Juror 58's assurance of his impartiality was false is premised on the assumption that Juror 58 shared the views expressed by the protagonist in his novel and tried to hide that fact from the court and counsel so that he could be seated on the jury. This is inconsistent with the fact that it was Juror 58 himself who brought his book, and his son's police work, to the attention of the court and counsel so they could include these issues in their remaining line of questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    at 200-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the post-conviction evidentiary hearing, Juror 58 testified he was excited about having his first book published, and he brought at least four copies with him to the hotel. Juror 58 described the book as \"a love story\" with themes in which \"[s]ome of them are very violent, some are heart rendering, some will make you laugh, some will make you cry and some will make you feel anger.\" Juror 58 admitted many of the chapters were filled with his own true life experiences or those of someone he served with in the military. Juror 58 described the book as a fictionalized autobiography, but he denied the graphic contents happened to him. Juror 58 went into great detail outlining which plot points were based on his personal experience and which ones were fictionalized. Juror 58 was questioned extensively about the book's themes and disavowed he personally held any of those ideas because it was not his personal belief the court system was not good. Further, he denied relating or expressing the book's themes to other jurors. Juror 58 was adamant the book had no bearing on his decision and no bearing on anyone else as far as he knew. Juror 58 said it became clear to him Movant was guilty only after his grandmother testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Bruns testified one of his concerns during voir dire was to weed out potential jurors who were so pro-law enforcement they could not be fair. When Juror 58 mentioned his son was a police officer and he was a published author, Bruns' attention was drawn to the fact he had a law enforcement family member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Kessler admitted Juror 58 was not asked any follow-up questions after he revealed he was a published author. Kessler explained, \"[O]ne of the reasons I didn't ask any further questions at the time because, I mean, in 2008, '09, '10, self-publishing just sort of meant that ... it was a vanity project\" and the book was not distributed widely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the central issue\n   concerned contradictory ballistics evidence, Kessler did not see a problem with Juror 58 being a self-published author or see a reason to question him about it. Instead, Kessler testified he noticed Juror 58 had some military experience, his son was a police officer, and they both had knowledge about guns. Kessler remembered conceding ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to follow up with Juror 58 after reading the book at trial and stated he never stated that on the record before. Kessler explained he said he was ineffective to try to force the circuit court to allow trial counsel to question Juror 58 about the book or remove him from the jury. Kessler testified had he asked follow-up questions about the book, he would have moved to strike Juror 58 for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The motion court found it was reasonable for trial counsel to focus their attention on Juror 58's relationship with his police officer son and the impact that might have had on his ability to be a fair and impartial juror rather than on Juror 58's participation in a hobby or profession that had no bearing on his suitability as a juror in this particular case. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Trial counsel articulated strategic reasons why they chose not to question Juror 58 about being a published author. Trial counsel explained the case involved the murder of a law enforcement officer and contradictory ballistics evidence. Trial counsel questioned Juror 58 regarding his son being a police officer and his knowledge of guns, which were crucial parts of their trial strategy in selecting jurors and in presenting their theory of the case. \"It is not ineffective assistance of counsel for an attorney to pursue one reasonable trial strategy to the exclusion of another, even if the latter would also be a reasonable strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Clayton v.

After careful review of the book, Juror 58 accurately described the overall storylines within the book as \"[s]ome of them are very violent, some are heart rendering, some will make you laugh, some will make you cry and some will make you feel anger.\" However, even if this Court rejected Juror 58's primary characterization of his book as \"a love story,\" mere authorship of a book expressing unfavorable views of the justice system over the course of six pages does not prove Juror 58 personally held the beliefs espoused in his book rendering him unfit to serve on the jury. It is worth noting this Court found in Movant's direct appeal \"\n   <em>\n    a degree of factual congruity between the novel and the facts of the trial\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    not exist.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 200-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although Kessler admitted he was ineffective for failing to question Juror 58 about being an author, the record does not support a finding that, had Kessler discovered the book's contents and questioned Juror 58 about them that Juror 58 would have been struck for cause absent some showing the book reflected his personal beliefs. Juror 58 stated during voir dire he could be fair and impartial in a case in\n   which a law enforcement officer was killed because he \"has his own mind\" in listening to the facts. At the evidentiary hearing, Juror 58 testified he did not hold the personal beliefs in the book. Movant presented no evidence to contradict Juror 58's testimony. Hence, Movant cannot demonstrate he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to question Juror 58 about the book.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glass v.

The motion alleged the circuit court erred in refusing trial counsel's request to hold a hearing to question Juror 58 about the book's contents and his beliefs. The motion further argued the circuit court erred in refusing trial counsel's request to hold a hearing to question all of the jurors about the effect Juror 58's personal beliefs and opinions had on the jury's guilt phase deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On April 29, 2009, the circuit court issued a letter to the attorneys stating, \"I want to determine whether the state or [Movant] will be requesting (or subpoenaing) any juror in this case to testify about any issue raised at trial or in pending motions.\" The circuit court advised the attorneys to make arrangements for a conference if either side planned to question any juror at the post-trial hearing. On May 22, 2009, the circuit court held the hearing on Movant's motion for new trial. Kessler stated the defense did not intend to call any additional witnesses, including Juror 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On direct appeal, Movant argued the circuit court committed reversible error for failing to conduct its own inquiry sua sponte into whether extraneous information or prejudicial materials were part of the jury's deliberations. This Court found Movant's claim without merit, stating, \"Not only did neither counsel take the judge up on this offered opportunity to question Juror 58 about whether he had discussed his novel with other jurors, defense counsel specifically waived any right to such a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Trial counsel both testified, after the jury could not agree on punishment, they believed they were in a better position to argue for a life sentence, which would be the ultimate goal for any reasonable trial counsel after the jury's guilty verdict. Kessler testified he considered it a victory that the jury could not agree on punishment in light of everything that transpired. Bruns testified the trial judge had \"been good\" to them during the trial and believed-perhaps naively-that not \"opening the can of worms\" regarding the juror misconduct issue would inure to Movant's benefit. Finally, Kessler had significant trial experience and never had a trial judge impose a death sentence after the jury could not agree on punishment in cases he tried. Even though trial counsel's strategy failed in hindsight, the record clearly demonstrates trial counsel evaluated their options, drew upon their experience, and chose to forego \"opening the can of worms\" regarding Juror 58's alleged misconduct in exchange for attempting to persuade the circuit court to impose a life sentence to save Movant's life. Trial counsel's decisions were reasonable under all of the circumstances. The motion court did not clearly err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Point III - Circuit Court's Timely Disclosure Regarding Juror 58's Book\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Movant argues the motion court clearly erred in denying his claim the circuit court failed to timely disclose Juror 58 brought his book to the sequestered jury. Movant\n   argues the circuit court had an affirmative duty to apprise trial counsel of Juror 58's misconduct in a timely fashion. By failing to apprise counsel timely, Movant argues he was deprived of an opportunity to demonstrate prejudice warranting a mistrial or ordering a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the April 29, 2009, letter, the circuit court informed the attorneys, \"[R]egarding the 'book' referred to at trial, I have been advised that the same juror gave a copy of his book during the week of trial to the [sheriff].\" At the motion for new trial hearing, Kessler stated the parties were unaware the circuit court had a copy of the book until he received the April 29, 2009, letter, which was after the motion for new trial was due. The circuit court explained the sheriff brought in the book after the guilty verdict and gave it to his administrative assistant. The circuit court stated, \"At that time I didn't know what the books was or its contents.... It was after the argument that I realized that it was the same book.\" The circuit court later confirmed it did not receive the book until after the guilty verdict was returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, the trial judge testified that, when the parties appeared the morning after the guilty verdict to discuss Juror 58's book, he did not know if he told the attorneys he received a copy of the book. The trial judge did not remember having a conversation with court personnel about the book. The trial judge also did not remember if the April 29, 2009, letter was the first time he informed the parties he had received a copy of the book during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Bruns and Kessler testified they did not know the trial judge had a copy of the book before they brought it to his attention, and they were told nothing until the April 29, 2009, letter. Kessler stated this constituted another ground to examine Juror 58 because he violated the circuit court's directive not to bring anything crime-related to the trial. Kessler testified he would have included this allegation in the motion for new trial had he known the circuit court had a copy of the book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The motion court found Movant merely established the trial judge had the ability to know about the book prior to trial counsel addressing the issue. The motion court found Movant failed to prove any misconduct or prejudice from the trial judge's actions in violation of his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Initially, this Court notes Movant's point on appeal raises different legal arguments than those presented for the motion court's consideration in his Rule 29.15 motion. Movant's motion alleged the trial judge failed to disclose timely he learned before the guilt phase deliberations Juror 58 had given the book to the sheriff and the trial judge questioned the sheriff about the book. Movant's motion further accused the trial judge of: (1) considering information not on the record; (2) prejudging the issue by considering the statements from the sheriff and other court personnel regarding the book; and (3) failing to recuse himself. Movant's motion does not allege the trial judge failed to disclose Juror 58 brought his book to the sequestered jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"In actions under Rule 29.15, any allegations or issues that are not raised in the Rule 29.15 motion are waived on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Nevertheless, the Western District reviewed the claim on the merits, explaining, \"[A]s the circuit court granted [the movant] an evidentiary hearing on the claim, denied the substantive claim, and this [c]ourt agrees that the substantive juror misconduct claim must also fail on the merits, we will also address the substance of [the movant's] juror misconduct claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655499,12655500\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/538/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655499,12655500\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/538/366/\">\n    at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, this Court will address the merits of Movant's claim only because it presents the same procedural posture as\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   in that the motion court heard evidence on the issue, denied the substantive claim, this Court agrees the claim fails on the merits, and it raises a challenge to the propriety of Movant's capital murder guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this point, Movant alleges Juror 58 committed intentional juror misconduct and violated the circuit court's directive about bringing his book to the sequestered jury and sharing it with the other jurors. \"This Court presumes bias and prejudice occurred if a juror intentionally withholds material information. Accordingly, a finding of intentional nondisclosure of a material issue is tantamount to a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule mandating a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The issue remains whether Juror 58 intentionally disregarded the circuit court's directive concerning bringing certain personal materials while sequestered and to what extent, if any, Juror 58's conduct prejudiced Movant's right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The jury was sequestered during trial. The circuit court appointed a jury coordinator to assist the jurors during sequestration. The jury coordinator prepared a jury information packet, which the parties were invited to review for any objectionable material. Trial counsel requested the jury should not have \"crime stories, CSI-kind of things that lead them to believe ... we should have to come up with ... these extraordinary defenses and alibis -- or that the [s]tate has to come up with this extraordinary scientific evidence.\" As part of a lengthy discussion regarding what to expect during sequestration, the circuit court gave the following directive to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   You will be able to bring books with you, even movies with you, to trial. The cautionary note on there, the only one the attorneys ask that I mention, avoid movies and books about trials, particularly periodicals or legal documents. That's normally something, again, the law has to be supplied by the judge, not due to your independent research and investigation. So general movies, avoiding crime shows and issues of that nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Movant offered testimony from several jurors and court personnel at the evidentiary hearing regarding their interactions with Juror 58 and his book. Juror 3 testified\n   Juror 58 gave him his card, which stated Juror 58 was the book's author. Juror 3 asked Juror 58 about being an author, and Juror 58 said he wrote a book and had it with him. Juror 3 looked at the book, read the back cover, and returned it. Juror 3 never saw other jurors with a copy of the book or reading the book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Juror 50 testified Juror 58 gave her a copy of his book. Juror 50 read two or three pages but \"there was something that made [her] think maybe [she] shouldn't be reading this\" and she returned the book to Juror 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Juror 117 and her husband operated a gift shop specializing in Native American items. Juror 58 visited their shop several weeks before the trial and spoke with Juror 117's husband about possibly carrying the book in the shop. After Juror 117 arrived at the courthouse to serve on the jury, her husband gave her a copy of Juror 58's book. Juror 117 put the book in her backpack, and she pulled it out later that evening. Juror 117 read the introduction, skimmed through the book, and put it away because she was too tired to read. Juror 117 testified she never looked at the book again during the trial. Juror 117 stated, if she had read the back of the book before putting it in her backpack, she would not have brought it with her because she thought it fell under the circuit court's directive not to bring books about trials or crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A Howell County sheriff testified he was the supervisor of court security for the courthouse where Movant's trial took place. After a day in court, Juror 58 approached the sheriff at the hotel, talked to him about writing a book, and asked the sheriff if he wanted to read it. Juror 58 gave the sheriff a copy of the book. The sheriff testified he either read or glanced at the forward. The sheriff was concerned and brought the book's contents to the circuit court's attention through the court's administrative assistant. The sheriff testified the circuit court questioned him approximately an hour after he gave the book to the administrative assistant. The sheriff did not see any other copies of the book. The sheriff never heard the jurors talking about writing a book or publishing a book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The administrative assistant testified she did not remember how the book came into the circuit court's chambers, but the sheriff received the book from Juror 58. The administrative assistant described the book as \"fairly graphic in some of its content.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The jury coordinator testified that shortly after being chosen for the jury, Juror 58 approached her and asked her if she liked to read. Juror 58 told her he wrote a book and handed her a copy. The jury coordinator noted Juror 58 was proud to have written the book, so she took a copy, put it in her bag, but never opened or read it. The jury coordinator did not see other copies of the book during the week of the trial nor did she observe Juror 58 give the book to anyone else. The jury coordinator was called into the trial judge's chambers after trial counsel raised the issue regarding the book's dissemination to other jurors. The trial judge spoke to her about the alternate jurors but did not question her about the book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The trial judge testified he did not see a copy of the book until after the jury reached its guilty verdict, and he believed his administrative assistant placed it on his desk before she left for the day. The trial judge stated he glanced at the book, intended to return the book to Juror 58, and planned to speak to the trial attorneys about the book the next morning. Trial counsel met in the trial judge's chambers the next morning to discuss removing Juror\n   58. The trial judge did not know if any of the attorneys saw the book on his desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Juror 58 admitted he gave copies of his book to Juror 3, the sheriff, the jury coordinator, and possibly one other female juror. Juror 58 handed the copies out at night after the jury returned to the hotel. Juror 58 did not remember the circuit court telling them to avoid bringing books about trial and crimes with them. After being read the circuit court's directive, Juror 58 felt he complied because his book was not about jury trials, but was \"a love story\" with only one chapter about the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The motion court found the circuit court's directive did not have the same legal significance as a Missouri Approved Instruction (hereinafter, \"MAI\"). The motion court further determined the evidence did not establish intentional misconduct but \"at most a miscommunication about what the court intended.\" Movant argues these findings trivialize and demean the circuit court's directive because it was intended to ensure the jurors complied with other MAIs related to the jury's duty to determine the facts only from the evidence presented in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The motion court found the trial court's directive was similar to the informational pamphlet given to the jurors in\n   <em>\n    State v. Storey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987252\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/901/886/\">\n    901 S.W.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 1995). In\n   <em>\n    Storey\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued the circuit court plainly erred in distributing an information pamphlet-which he equated to jury instructions-to the jury and argued trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987252\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/901/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987252\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/901/886/\">\n    at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court explained the informational pamphlet was not an instruction because \"[a] jury instruction is a 'direction given by the judge to the jury concerning the law of the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987252\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/901/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   856 (6th ed. 1990) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, trial counsel sought the directive to prevent the jurors from being exposed to materials that would cause them to require the parties to put on \"these extraordinary defenses and alibis -- or that the [s]tate has to come up with this extraordinary scientific evidence\" instead of being guided by the evidence and instructions presented. The circuit court's lengthy discussion about how sequestration would work and its directive regarding what jurors could bring with them did not amount to formal jury instructions concerning the law of the case. Moreover, even taking into account the very limited exposure three jurors had to the book, nothing in the book can be construed as requiring either of the parties to put on extraordinary defenses, alibis, or scientific evidence, and Movant does not argue as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Movant argues it is irrelevant whether Juror 58's conduct constituted intentional misconduct because Juror 58's conduct and the book's alleged influence over the other jurors is akin to those in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Unlike the jurors in\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   three jurors had very fleeting exposure at best, to Juror 58's book over the course of a week-long sequestration. Juror 58 denied any discussion took place with any of the jurors about the book's themes. This testimony is corroborated by the other jurors and court personnel. None of the jurors read the book in its entirety. Rather, the jurors testified they read a few pages from the introduction or skimmed the cover and refrained from any further exposure due to their belief it fell within the circuit court's directive. The sheriff and jury coordinator both testified they never saw any juror with the book or saw them reading or heard them discussing the book. There was no evidence any of the jurors read the pertinent parts of the book concerning the criminal case, the defendant's lenient sentencing, or the graphic description of how the protagonist avenged his wife's murder. Hence, there was no evidence the sequestered jury was distracted by the book to the point it could not give due and fair consideration of the facts, thus distinguishing this case from\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \"While every party is entitled to a fair trial, as a practical matter, our jury system cannot guarantee every party a\n   <em>\n    perfect\n   </em>\n   trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Fleshner v.

While the circuit court's directive did not amount to a formal jury instruction, this case illustrates how a lay juror may misunderstand or misinterpret the parameters of acceptable materials to bring while sequestered. When trial counsel sought to question Juror 58 about his conduct, the circuit court denied the request because it found no evidence of juror misconduct. \"As the trial court presides over the entirety of a trial, it is familiar with the circumstances surrounding a juror's misconduct.

On direct appeal, this Court found nothing in the trial record supported the argument Juror 58 lied about being able to be fair and impartial, or he was willing but reluctant to impose the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Movant has not adduced any evidence contradicting this finding. Further, this Court rejected the idea Juror 58's assurances of impartiality were false because Movant assumed Juror 58 shared the views expressed by the protagonist in his book and tried to hide that fact from the court and trial counsel so he could be seated on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Movant argues prejudice is presumed but further alleges he was prejudiced because he did not have a full panel of jurors who could consider a life sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"[A] person who cannot be impartial due to an improper predisposition is unfit to serve on the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6901486\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/276/#p287\">\n    448 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   299 (citing\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406916\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/196/28/#p41\">\n    196 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   41 ). \"A prospective juror may be excluded for cause only if the juror's views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his or her duties as a juror in accordance with the instructions and oath.\"\n   <em>\n    Middleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9137570\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/103/726/#p734\">\n    103 S.W.3d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   During the death qualification voir dire, Juror 3 stated he would not consider sentencing until after the verdict. Juror 3 was asked, \"Does the fact [Victim] ... has the status of a law enforcement officer then change your deliberation in the second stage? Would you say that you automatically would be more inclined to give the death penalty simply because it was the murder of a law enforcement officer?\" Juror 3 answered, \"I probably would be more inclined.\" Kessler explained the state had to prove an aggravating circumstance existed beyond a reasonable doubt during the penalty phase and a finding Movant killed Victim would prove one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. Juror 3 stated, \"I respect law officers and what they have to do. I guess I would feel that's more of a crime than just an average --.\" Kessler responded, \"Okay. And that's fair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Kessler later asked Juror 3 if he was \"more inclined to say that the person deserves the death penalty, and, therefore, that's the only punishment you're going to give meaningful consideration to?\" Juror 3 answered, \"I can't say that I would be more inclined because it would bother me. I respect law officers, but, I mean, I could be impartial.\" Kessler reiterated, \"You would consider that as an aggravating circumstance,\n   but it wouldn't automatically make you vote for the death penalty?\" to which Juror 3 responded, \"No, it would not.\" Juror 3 stated he would stand up to law enforcement or Victim's family and friends and base the verdict on the evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Neither Bruns nor Kessler had any recollection of Juror 3 or why they chose not to strike him. The motion court found no evidence in the record suggested a motion to strike Juror 3 would have been successful because his voir dire testimony was clear he could be impartial on the issue of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   When examining the entire context of Juror 3's statements, this Court cannot say trial counsel were ineffective for failing to seek to strike him for cause. While Juror 3 initially stated he \"would probably be more inclined\" to vote for the death penalty, subsequent questioning revealed he could be impartial and would follow the circuit court's instructions. Juror 3 stated he would not only consider the death penalty for murdering a law enforcement officer, he could be impartial, and he would be able to stand up to law enforcement and Victim's family if the verdict did not include the death penalty. Hence, the record does not demonstrate Juror 3 would not consider the entire range of punishment, apply the proper burden of proof, or otherwise follow the circuit court's instructions. Trial counsel were not ineffective for failing to move to strike Juror 3.

Movant alleged Howard would have testified a Browning .243 rifle could not have fired the fatal shot that killed Victim, and the shotgun wadding recovered from the scene was from a 10-gauge shotgun, not a 12-gauge shotgun. Movant argues this testimony would have countered the state's evidence he used a Browning .243 rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun to shoot Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"Ordinarily the choice of witnesses is a matter of trial strategy and will support no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6942456\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/432/741/#p760\">\n    432 S.W.3d at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Howard's expertise was not in firearm and toolmark identification. Howard did not examine the evidence or bullets from this case independently. Instead, Howard's opinions were formed after reviewing the work of Jason Crafton (hereinafter, \"Crafton\"), a Missouri highway patrol ballistics expert who testified for the state at Movant's trial. Howard did not testify whether he examined the work of the other ballistics expert, John Dillon (hereinafter, \"Dillon\"), who testified for the state and disagreed with Crafton's trial conclusions. Howard offered no testimony regarding the shotgun wadding at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   At trial, Crafton testified the bullets recovered from Victim and Movant's home were fired from the same gun, finding they shared the same class characteristics. Crafton could not pinpoint a specific caliber but opined it was a range of .22 to .24 caliber. Crafton further found the shotgun wadding components were consistent with a 10- to 12-gauge shotgun. Crafton excluded all of the firearms recovered from Movant's home as the murder weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Marshall testified Howard told the first trial team the shotgun wadding was \"almost certainly a 10-gauge,\" which was helpful to the defense because there was no evidence Movant ever owned a 10-gauge shotgun. Marshall stated Howard told him a Browning .243 rifle could not have fired the bullet recovered from Victim's body. The first trial team turned over its entire file to trial counsel, including Howard's information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Bruns testified he and Kessler discussed whether to call their own ballistics expert, but after looking at the state's experts, they decided against it. Kessler testified he was responsible for preparing the ballistics evidence for trial. Kessler admitted he did not contact Howard and never considered calling another ballistics expert to testify. Kessler explained, because he had two expert witnesses testifying for the state who disagreed with one another, he planned to emphasis those differences during cross-examination. Kessler noted even if Howard told him the toolmarks from the Browning .243 rifle were different from the toolmarks on the recovered bullets, he would not have considered calling Howard to testify. Kessler stated he had bad experiences in the past with cross-examination of his own ballistic witnesses. Kessler stated he would rather cross-examine two experts on the same side and get them to contradict each other than have his own \"hired gun.\" The trial transcript reflects Kessler implemented this strategy of pointing out the contradictions between Crafton and Dillon during his cross-examination of both witnesses and throughout the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The motion court found trial counsel's testimony that they reviewed the first trial team's entire file was credible. The motion court discounted the weight of Howard's testimony concerning his certifications and found he was not as experienced or knowledgeable as the state's ballistics experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The motion court also rejected Howard's testimony excluding the Browning .243 rifle in lieu of Crafton's trial testimony that no exact firearm can be excluded unless the individual firearm is tested specifically. \"This Court will not challenge the motion court's determination of [an expert witness's] credibility as it could make the best observation [of the witness] or trial counsel's strategic decision not to call a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Forrest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7302486\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/290/704/#p708\">\n    290 S.W.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). Moreover, these findings refute the heart of Movant's argument trial counsel's strategy did not address the state's theory a Browning .243 rifle was used to kill Victim.

However, the state called other witnesses who knew Movant and testified he inherited a rifle from his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Sanders testified at the evidentiary hearing he did not see Movant bring a Browning .243 rifle with him when Movant came to live with Sanders after Movant's father died. Sanders did not know what rifles Movant had at the time of the murder. Bruns testified he prepared and presented mitigating evidence during the penalty phase. Bruns stated it was \"tenuous\" whether they would have asked Sanders about Movant inheriting a Browning .243 rifle during his mitigation testimony. Kessler testified he spent a lot of time with Sanders leading up to the trial, and the information about inheriting the rifle would not have come in during mitigation because it would have challenged the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Movant correctly notes trial counsel did not testify specifically about their strategic reasons for failing to call Sanders during the guilt phase to rebut the state's witnesses who testified Movant inherited a Browning .243 rifle. However, Kessler testified if Movant would have taken the stand during the guilt phase, Movant was prepared to admit ownership of a .243 caliber rifle. In anticipation of Movant testifying, Henshaw stated during her opening statement Movant \"will acknowledge that at one time he owned a lever-action .243 [rifle].\" Hence, trial counsel employed a trial strategy allowing for the possibility\n   of Movant testifying on his own behalf and offering a viable defense. By not calling Sanders, trial counsel were pursuing a defense strategy that would not undermine Movant's credibility if he chose to testify, which was reasonable.

Both ballistics experts testified the bullet recovered from Victim belonged to the .22 to .24 caliber class of ammunition, which included a Browning .243 caliber rifle. Finally, Kessler testified, if Movant would have taken the stand, Movant was prepared to admit ownership of a .243 caliber rifle, and this fact was mentioned in the defense's opening statement.

The Duncans lived on the same road as Movant and his grandmother. Carol and Movant's grandmother had been friends for many years. On the day of the murder, Movant was supposed to help Sylvan move some brush off of his property, but Movant did not show up. Sylvan saw Movant's truck at Movant's home when he went to move the brush but saw Movant's truck leave between 2 and 3 p.m. Carol told police Movant's grandmother's red car was gone from her house around 12:45 p.m. or 1 p.m. Carol stated she could see Movant's grandmother's driveway from her kitchen window and she saw the red car in the driveway \"no more than three hours later.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   At 4:30 p.m., the Duncans went for a walk for approximately thirty minutes. Movant was in his truck driving when the Duncans stopped and spoke to him.

Movant told the Duncans Victim had been shot in the face and \"I heard that you could just take the flap -- his face and just pull it back and then lay it back over.\" Carol told Movant someone would have had to have been \"awfully close to do something like that,\" to which Movant replied, \"Not if you were using turkey loads.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   During opening statements, Henshaw told the jury the Duncans would testify. Henshaw stated the Duncans would testify that, at the same time the state alleged Movant was in his grandmother's red car parked near Victim's home, they observed the red car through their kitchen window because it had been returned. Henshaw stated the Duncans stopped and spoke to Movant later that afternoon, as Movant was driving home in his pickup truck at the same time the state alleged Movant was fleeing the scene. However, when the defense rested, Kessler stated on the record they were not calling the Duncans to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Duncans testified at the evidentiary hearing, largely repeating their deposition testimony.

Because there was a hole in the timeline, Kessler did not want to put on any witness who offered an imperfect alibi. Kessler described Carol's account as \"unsure or she couldn't be as sure\" about the timeline, and he did not believe Sylvan would hold up under cross-examination.

Linn gave statements to police and was deposed prior to trial. Linn stated she lived approximately a half-mile north of Victim's home. On the day of the murder, Linn stated she saw an older red car with a loud muffler driving near the dumpster situated near Victim's home. Linn described the driver as a stranger with shaggy brown hair, a sunken face, and clean-shaven. Linn was later shown a photo array that included Movant but she did not identify Movant as the driver. Linn admitted Victim detained her for a driving while intoxicated charge a day or two before he was murdered. Linn also conceded she could not remember much from this time\n   because she was a heavy drinker. The first trial team provided these materials to trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Although Linn was not called as a witness at trial, a police officer testified he showed Linn a photo array and she did not identify Movant as the driver of the red car she observed near Victim's home. During closing argument, Kessler argued the state was hiding the ball because it did not present Linn's testimony about observing the same red car as the other witnesses, but not identifying Movant as the driver. Bruns testified trial counsel considered calling all potential witnesses, including Linn, but he could not remember why she was not called. Bruns acknowledged avoiding impeachment would be a reason not to call a particular witness. Bruns noted Kessler was free to use Linn's statements during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The motion court found Movant failed to present any evidence to support his claim regarding Linn's testimony, hence the claim was deemed abandoned. At the outset of the evidentiary hearing, Movant formally waived claim 8(c) only with respect to presenting testimony from Linn's son, not Linn herself. Movant intended to depose Linn for the evidentiary hearing, but no post-conviction deposition was filed. However, Linn's pretrial deposition was offered as an exhibit and was before the motion court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Even if this Court found the motion court erred in finding this claim abandoned, Movant would not be entitled to relief because he was not prejudiced by this error. When examining Linn's pretrial deposition, it is clear her testimony would be undermined severely due to her admission her memory of the events was impaired by heavy drinking. Linn would be subjected to impeachment, which Bruns testified would be a reason not to call her to testify. Further, trial counsel were able to use the most helpful portion of Linn's statement when questioning the police officer and during closing argument, while avoiding Linn's impeachment. Trial counsel were not ineffective for failing to call Linn to testify at trial.

Movant claims Hart's deposition and written statements indicate she saw the yellow sticker from the front of the car when the sticker was located on the back of the vehicle.

When she arrived, she saw a red car with a yellow sticker on it and told her husband, \"That's it.\" Hart stated she was \"100 percent sure\" it was the \"exact same car\" she saw parked near Victim's residence.

Henshaw had no recollection of Hart's testimony or a reason why she did not impeach her testimony. Henshaw could not articulate a strategic reason for failing to impeach Hart's testimony, but she explained part of the strategy during opening statement was to concede Movant drove his grandmother's red car that day. Although trial counsel did not attempt to impeach Hart's testimony with her previous statements, they attempted to bring out discrepancies in her testimony by calling her husband. Kessler indicated \"it did not go well.\" Hence, trial counsel made an attempt-albeit an unsuccessful one-to impeach Hart's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \"Reasonable choices of trial strategy, no matter how ill-fated they appear in hindsight, cannot serve as a basis for a claim of ineffective assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406916\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/196/28/#p41\">\n    196 S.W.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, impeachment would not undermine Hart's trial testimony she was \"100 percent sure\" the red car she saw at the command center was the same red car she saw parked near Victim's home, regardless of where the yellow sticker was placed. Movant has not demonstrated the outcome of the trial would have been different had trial counsel impeached Hart's testimony regarding the yellow sticker's location.

Movant argues the prosecutor's comment was a reference to his right to remain silent and implicated Movant knew why the red car was parked at Victim's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   During Hart's trial testimony, the prosecutor asked her, \"Do you know why [Movant's grandmother's] car would be across from where [Victim] was murdered --?\" to which Hart responded, \"No.\" The prosecutor then commented, \"Someone does.\" The circuit court stated, \"Keep the comments to yourself. I've already warned defense counsel.\" Trial counsel did not object to the comment, did not ask the jury to be instructed to disregard it, or request a mistrial. The circuit court later instructed the jury Movant had the right not to testify and the jury could draw no adverse inference from his failure to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Movant raised this claim in his direct appeal, arguing the circuit court committed plain error in not sua sponte granting Movant a mistrial because the words\n   \"someone does\" constituted a direct comment about his failure to testify. This Court rejected Movant's claim, finding the comment was not a direct comment nor did it need to determine whether it was an indirect comment because Movant had \"fallen far short\" of showing his comment had a decisive effect on the jury.\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086999\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/179/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 189-190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , the New Jersey Supreme Court vacated a guilty plea, in part, due to trial counsel's ineffectiveness for failing to object at sentencing to a seventeen-minute victim impact video from the police officer victim's funeral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394. The video was scored to popular and religious music, professionally produced, included a television news segment about the victim's funeral, had three poems scrolling over photographs, and ended with a photograph of the victim's headstone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 381. The New Jersey Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Undoubtedly, concerns over prejudicial victim-impact statements, including photographs and videos, are less pronounced when a judge rather than a jury is imposing sentence. Nevertheless, judges, no less than jurors, are susceptible to the wide range of human emotions that may be affected by irrelevant and unduly prejudicial materials. We are fully aware that judges, who are the gatekeepers of what is admissible at sentencing, will have viewed materials that they may deem non-probative or unduly prejudicial. We have faith that our judges have the ability to put aside that which is ruled inadmissible. However, both the bar and bench should know the general contours of what falls within the realm of an appropriate video of a victim's life for sentencing purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 392 (internal citation omitted). After examining several cases from other jurisdictions, the New Jersey Supreme Court held, \"An overly lengthy video, baby photographs of an adult victim, and a video scored to religious and pop music do not advance any legitimate objective....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394. The court also noted the photograph of the victim's headstone and the television segment about the victim's life did \"not project anything meaningful about the victim's life as it related to his family or others at the time of his death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In this case, the video montage presented to the jury was compiled by Victim's family, was four minutes in length, set to music, and contained photographs from Victim's childhood through adulthood. While there are some similarities to the video in\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , Victim's video was significantly shorter, not produced professionally, and did not contain photographs of Victim's headstone, poems, a variety of music, or television news coverage. Hence, this Court declines Movant's invitation to find\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   dispositive, especially given the New Jersey's Supreme Court's recognition it could not \"set forth an exhaustive catalogue of what is and is not permissible in a video, other than to say how\n   <em>\n    this video\n   </em>\n   exceeded permissible bounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Bruns gave strategic reasons for not objecting to the victim impact evidence presented during the penalty phase.

Because the postconviction hearing demonstrates counsel had no valid strategic reason for failing to voir dire Juror 58 and for choosing not to question other jurors about when and how they were exposed to his violent novel, I would find both failures constituted ineffective assistance that may have affected the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   In explaining why they did not question Juror 58 about his novel during voir dire, defense counsel stated at the postconviction hearing that they focused on Juror 58's statements his son was a police officer and he had a knowledge of guns and therefore, did not further question Juror 58 regarding his novel. Like the motion court, the principal opinion says this was not ineffective because this questioning was closely aligned with the counsel's trial strategy, which the principal opinion explains as using voir dire to uncover pro-law enforcement bias and knowledge about firearms.

Counsel could, and should, examine the potential juror about all of the revealed biases. It is not reasonable to pick only one disqualifying or biasing issue to examine further. Yet, that is what counsel admitted they did here. Because they wanted to follow up on Juror 58's son's employment as a police officer, they chose not to question him about his novel. This choice was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The principal opinion states that finding counsel's voir dire ineffective would be equivalent to adopting a rule that \"a potential juror's employment as an author, standing alone, establishes the juror has 'multiple sources of bias.' \" The dispositive fact here is not that Juror 58 was an author. What is relevant here is that Juror 58, on his own initiative, approached the bench during a break to inform the court he had not revealed as yet during voir dire that he was a published author and he thought \"maybe I should be coming out with fact [sic] as well.\" When a venireperson feels strongly enough that a piece of information may be relevant for consideration in voir dire that he himself suggests it to the court on his own initiative, defense counsel is ineffective in failing to investigate what made the venireperson believe the information needed to be disclosed.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11357051\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/85/628/#p632\">\n     85 S.W.3d 628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 632 (Mo. banc 2002)\n   </em>\n   , is unavailing. As in that case, the failure here to conduct a basic investigation of the juror's bias was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   This error was compounded by counsel's rejection of the circuit court's offer to allow counsel to call Juror 58 and other jurors during the hearing on the motion for new trial. The failure to follow up during voir dire and by calling jurors in support of the motion for new trial meant the record before the circuit court and this Court on appeal did not support grant of a new trial, resulting in the conviction being affirmed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The principal opinion states the decision not to call jurors in support of the motion for new trial was reasonable in that counsel believed, because the jury was unable to agree whether to impose the death penalty, the trial judge was unlikely to impose death, as they had never had a trial judge impose a death sentence when the jury could not agree on punishment. In other words, counsel filed a motion for new trial but chose not to support it with testimony in the hopes the judge would give a favorable ruling on death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   If counsel believed errors in the trial merited a new trial, they had a duty to file a proper and supported motion for new trial. They failed to meet their duty by filing a motion they admittedly chose not to fully support with facts. Moreover, if what counsel wanted was to have the judge decide punishment while knowing the jury deadlocked, they could have requested the judge and State consent to doing just that even if a new trial were granted. Failing to investigate juror misconduct, however, was\n   not an option. Yet counsel made the decision to forego any questioning of Juror 58 or the other jurors about whether they were exposed to Juror 58's novel and the extent of that exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \"[S]trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgment supports the limitations on investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2002)\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   While counsel may have believed the better chance of avoiding a death sentence lay in their hope the judge would continue to \"be good\" to them rather than in raising prejudicial juror misconduct from Juror 58's deliberate exposure of the other jurors to his novel, this belief was not reasonable as counsel had no idea of the seriousness of the exposure of the other jurors to the virulently anti-defendant violent rhetoric of the book. \"The mere assertion that conduct of trial counsel was 'trial strategy' is not sufficient to preclude a movant from obtaining post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkes v.

By that point they minimized their exposure to the novel, but this Court long has recognized, in the context of voir dire, a juror cannot be the judge of his or her own qualifications.\n   <em>\n    Beggs v.

Further, the dissenting opinion would have this Court adopt a rule that a potential juror's employment as an author, standing alone, establishes the juror has \"multiple sources of bias,\" which must be explored for trial counsel to conduct an effective voir dire. However, this proposed rule is based solely upon having the benefit of hindsight regarding the contents of Juror 58's novel. The dissenting opinion cannot point to any of Juror 58's voir dire testimony that revealed \"multiple sources of bias\" simply from Juror 58's status as a published author. Accordingly, there was nothing to prompt trial counsel's further exploration, especially when also presented with Juror 58's knowledge about guns and his son's law enforcement background, which were germane to the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    Movant argues his case is akin to\n    <em>\n     Knese\n    </em>\n    , in which trial counsel was found ineffective after admitting he wholly failed to read the juror questionnaires revealing strong opinions about the death penalty prior to voir dire.\n    <em>\n     Knese\n    </em>\n    , 85 S.W.3d at 632-33.\n    <em>\n     Knese\n    </em>\n    does not aid Movant's argument.
