The preliminary facts in this case are the same as those in <em>Legerton </em>v. <em>Chambers, ante, </em>p. 601, [163 Pac. 678], this \u2018day decided. There was interposed in this case, a defense additional to that presented in the case referred to, whereby the auditor showed that there had been filed with him an abstract of a judgment rendered against petitioner in the justice\u2019s court of Los Angeles Township in the sum of $299.77. It is stipulated by counsel that this matter may be submitted upon the briefs and authorities filed in this and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the case of <em>Legerton </em>v. <em>Chambers. </em>The trial judge by his judgment determined that petitioner was a duly elected superior judge and a <em>de jure </em>officer from the nineteenth day of November to the fifth day of December, and that he was entitled to his salary as such. He determined the facts as to the filing of the abstract of judgment, in favor of the county auditor <em>\u2022 </em>but in the conclusions of law attached to the finding, declared \u201cthat the provisions of section 710 of the Code of Civil Procedure in so far as said provisions affect the salary of a judge of the superior court are unconstitutional. \u2019 \u2019 What is said in the opinion in the case of <em>Legerton </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>disposes of this appeal in favor of the appellant, and it will be unnecessary to repeat what has been in that opinion declared as our view of the law. Petitioner being held to have acted only as a <em>de facto </em>officer, under the authorities cited he is not entitled to collect the salary. We are furnished with no argument either attacking the constitutionality of section 710 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or opposing such a position. Prom a careful reading of the section, however, there occur to us no constitutional grounds upon which it may be concluded that the officers\u2019 salaries subject to the process of garnishment thereunder are salaries of officers other than judges of the superior court. In the absence of argument or citation of authority, it is unnecessary to express any final conclusion as to that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The judgment is reversed, with direction to the superior court to enter upon-the findings made a judgment in favor of the defendant auditor. Appellant to have his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
