It is grounded solely in the contention that the finding of the trial court that the defendant had agreed to deliver twenty and not ten shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of the stock in question is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence, which, upon that phase of the case, is in pronounced conflict; and we are requested by the appellant to weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses. This, of course, under the familiar rule, we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
