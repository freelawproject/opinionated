It appears, however, that the land for which condemnation was sought herein was surveyed prior to the creation of the said forest reserve. This case ought, therefore, to have been grouped with Pacific Power Company (a Corporation), Plaintiff and Respondent, <em>v. </em>The State of California, John Doe, and Richard Roe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Defendants and Appellants, <em>ante, </em>p. 175, decided at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">For the reasons stated in the said latter opinion, the judgment rendered herein is set aside and the judgment rendered in the superior court is affirmed. The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on January 22, 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
