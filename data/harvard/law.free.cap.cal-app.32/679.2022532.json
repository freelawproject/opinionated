The action was to recover the sum of $4,726.51, alleged as an unpaid balance due from the defendant to the plaintiffs upon a contract for the erection of a hotel building in the city of San Bernardino. Various installment payments were made to the contractors while the building was in course of construction, amounting to $52,350. The contract provided that no payment should be made except upon the production of the certificate of the architect, and the contention of the appellant is that, not only was there a failure on the part of the plaintiffs to show that the building had been constructed as required by the specifications, but that there was a failure also to produce an architect\u2019s certificate evidencing the fact of final completion and the right of the plaintiffs to receive complete payment. The court upon sufficient evidence, as is disclosed by the bill of exceptions, found that there had been a substantial completion under the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>and specifications, and the appellant, therefore, must rest his claim for reversal of the judgment upon the fact that the plaintiffs failed to present the architect\u2019s certificate, which it is contended was a necessary prerequisite to the right to demand the money sued for. While the contract did specifically provide that the architect\u2019s certificate should be produced before any payment should be made on the work, it appears that the appellant, the owner, of his own motion, disregarded this requirement as to all of the payments, except the last,, and that he made seventeen payments without any objection to the lack of a certificate. The supervision architect testified: \u201cI prepared the first certificate and handed it to Mr. Bucher. He said: \u2018I have already given the money.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think much about that, and the next time I brought the certificate he told me he had paid that money and something ahead. I said, \u2018this is peculiar if you are going to pay checks without the certificates, \u2019 and I thought if Mr. Bucher was going to keep making these payments, I wouldn\u2019t draw the certificates, and from that time on I drew no further certificates. I. am not positive I spoke to Mr. Bucher about it. He made this remark: \u2018They need the money, and I have it in the bank, and they might as well have it; I am not using it.\u2019 That is the understanding he gave me. He had the money and he wanted them to have it so they could be using it.\u201d We think these facts clearly show a waiver on the part of the owner of the requirement for the production of the architect\u2019s certificates, especially as the further fact was shown that he did not at the time he refused to make the final payment base his objections upon the failure of the contractors to furnish him with such certificate. The main controversy arose over the heating plant, which was shown by testimony to have been substantially completed according to specifications. However, it did not work satisfactorily, and the owner had changes made\u2014a different burner installed; in fact, the final arrangement in regard to the heating plant was considerably different from that which was first constructed according to the plans. In <em>Knarston </em>v. <em>Manhattan Life Ins. Co., </em>140 Cal. 57, 63, [73 Pac. 740], speaking of the right of a party to waive a condition made for his benefit, the court said: \u2018\u2018This waiver may be established by evidence of an express waiver, or by circumstances from which such waiver may be inferred.\u201d Laying aside the question of waiver for a moment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>there is another reason why appellant is not in a position to complain: The court found that there was a completion of the work, and in that ease there was no legal ground left upon which an architect\u2019s certificate might be refused. Where a certificate is refused without cause, the contractor may not be forever debarred from collecting his money. This court so declared in <em>Machinery &amp; Electrical Co. </em>v. <em>Young Men's Christian Assn., </em>22 Cal. App. 416, [134 Pac. 724], when it was said: \u201cIt may be admitted that where an architect refuses to issue a certificate to a contractor showing that the latter is entitled to be paid, where no substantial reason exists for such refusal, the contractor may recover the amount agreed to be paid, notwithstanding that the contract specifically provides that payment shall be made only upon the production of the certificate of the architect.\u201d Respondents suggest further that in order to avail the appellant of the objection based upon the failure of the architect to furnish the certificate, that objection should have been presented in the answer, and that the answer contains no averment of that kind. Under the view we have taken of the ease, it is unnecessary to give any consideration to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Conrey, P.
