It was also alleged that the deposition was not duly authenticated. The record before us now shows that the witness who gave her deposition was duly sworn, and the deposition also appears to be duly authenticated; and upon an examination of the record we believe that the evidence as shown by that deposition sufficiently supports the \u25a0 award of the commission. For these reasons the award will be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
