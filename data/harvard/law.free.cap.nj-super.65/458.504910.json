J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AF6\">Plaintiff sues defendant for negligence in the operation of an automobile alleged to have caused him personal injuries and property damage. Plaintiff was driving his car on a thoroughfare which terminated in a \u201cT\u201d intersection on College Farm Eoad near Hew Brunswick. He had turned left into the top of the \u201cT\u201d when his car was in collision with that of the defendant which was coming toward the intersection along the top of the \u201cT\u201d from plaintiff\u2019s left. Plaintiff\u2019s left turn was thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>across the path of defendant\u2019s prospective course of travel. There was a jury verdict of no cause for action.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Plaintiff raises but a single point of trial error on this appeal. This relates to the charge of the court to the jury concerning plaintiff\u2019s duty of care in relation to the defense of contributory negligence. Plaintiff cites the following language as objectionable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cWith reference to a left turn, involving, as it does, a movement across the path of other traffic, the risk of harm is ordinarily increased beyond that which exists when a car is proceeding along a direct course. Hence, with respect to a left turn, a reasonably prudent man would seek an opportune moment for the turn, and would exercise an increased amount of care in proportion to the increased danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Accordingly, the law provides that a person seeking to make a left turn has the duty to seek an opportune moment, and to exercise the degree of care in proportion to the increased danger involved in the turn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The language in question is basically part of the charge in a U-turn situation recommended by the Supreme Court, in <em>Ambrose v. </em>Cyphers, 29 <em>N. J. </em>138, 149, 150 (1959), as preferable to the customary charge that a driver making a U-turn, or a left turn at an intersection, is under a duty of great care and must seek an opportune moment to make such a turn. The entirety of the charge recommended in <em>Ambrose </em>was given here. Plaintiff argues that a left turn into a \u201cT\u201d intersection is not justifiably assimilable to the rule governing the situation of a U-turn or that of a left turn at an ordinary intersection where the driver is crossing a line of traffic coming from the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">It is clear to us that the difference between a left turn at a \u201cT\u201d intersection and that at an ordinary intersection is only one of degree of increase of hazard, not one as to the kind of increase. There is an appreciable increase of hazard in either type of maneuver. See <em>B. 8. </em>39 :4-l26, as amended, which provides, in part, that no person shall \u201cturn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway * * * unless and until such movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>can be made with safety/\u2019 cited in <em>Ambrose v. Cyphers, supra </em>(29 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>147).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The standard \u201chigh degree of care\u201d rule was applied in an intersectional left-turn situation in <em>Oliver v. Leonardo, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>210 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947). The relative courses of the two vehicles involved were the same there as here; and the court\u2019s statement that the party making the left turn was doing so \u201cin the face of approaching traffic\u201d was obviously in reference to traffic coming from his left, as in the case before us. The case is consequently authority against plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We find nothing exceptionable in the charge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
