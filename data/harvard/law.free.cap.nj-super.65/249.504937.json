A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ArS\">Respondent appeals from a judgment of the County Court affirming a judgment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division in favor of petitioner. The factual findings of the County Court are fully set forth in its reported opinion, 60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>424 <em>(Law Div. </em>1960). Our review of the record leads us to the same factual findings and we deem it unnecessary to reiterate them herein. We join with the County Court and the Division in concluding that petitioner came to his injuries because of his voluntary participation in the skylarking activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The appeal is based entirely on the narrow ground that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-7.1 bars from recovery an employee who is injured as a result of horseplay or skylarking, which is instigated by him, or in which he takes part.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In the very recent ease of <em>McKenzie v. Brixite Mfg. Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1961), the Supreme Court held expressly to the contrary and in that respect adopted the views expressed by us in the same case, 61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>461, 467-468 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960) (reversed on other grounds). This, of course, is dispositive of the appeal <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Appellant did not raise the question of whether an injury suffered, as here, in the course of a skylarking activity not customary in the work routine, and thus not within the actual or constructive knowledge of the employer, is compensable as an incident of the employment. Compare <em>McKenzie v. Brixite, supra, </em>the rationale of which, on this feature of the case being that where an employee is injured by skylarking, whether he be an instigator thereof, or a participant therein, or not, he is entitled to recover if the practice of such skylarking be known to and acquiesced in by the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ployer, since such knowledge and acquiescence result in the activity\u2019s becoming an <em>incident </em>of the employment. Nor, as distinguished from the <em>McKenzie </em>case, did appellant herein brief the issue as to whether the acts of Diaz constituted a consequential deviation from the duties of the employment and, if so, the relation of such deviation to compensability where the deviation is not a common practice acquiesced in by the employer. See <em>R. R. </em>l:7-l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Since the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in <em>McKenzie v. Brixite, supra, </em>respondent by memorandum has requested that counsel now be permitted to argue the additional point, first above mentioned. Counsel asserts therein that he urged on the oral argument that there was no proof in the case of a \u201cskylarking custom known to the employer.\u201d We have no recollection that such argument was tendered but, if so, it was irrelevant to the statement of question involved on the appeal as set forth in respondent\u2019s brief, which, as we have noted, dealt exclusively with the construction of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>R. R. </em>1:7-1 (c) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the brief shall contain \u201ca statement of the questions involved\u201d and that such requirement is \u201cto be considered in the highest degree mandatory, admitting of no exception.\u201d Obviously, if this stringent rule is to be enforced, the court must decline to hear argument of a point not included in the statement unless it appears that such action is likely to result in a manifest denial of justice. See <em>R. R. </em>1:27.1. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Moreover, the question which counsel now seeks leave to argue is so broadly phrased as to be in conflict with <em>R. R. </em>l:7-l(c), <em>supra. </em>It is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cThat petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of believable evidence that he suffered an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">This extremely broad statement sheds no light whatever on the precise facets of the petitioner\u2019s proofs which are chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>lenged, or the respects in which they are deficient. Thus, the proposed \u201cstatement of the questions\u201d falls squarely within the interdiction of <em>United Board &amp; Carton Corp. v. Britting, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>340, 342-343 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), certification denied 33 <em>N. J. </em>326 (1960), in which Judge Gfaulkin analyzed the requirements of <em>R. R. </em>1:7\u20141(c), <em>supra, </em>and <em>R. R. </em>1:7-1 <em>(e) </em>relating to the subdividing of each question \u201cinto as many parts as there are points to be argued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
