A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">The issue presented for our determination is whether two eoncededly \u201cexcess\u201d automobile liability carriers, called upon to contribute to a settlement or judgment, should share equally rather than in proportion to their respective applicable policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Plaintiff instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking resolution of this question in its favor. Its demand for relief was granted, by way of a determination that <em>\"inter se </em>coverage afforded by the plaintiff and the defendant are concurrent, and that, in any settlement or judgment, the plaintiff and defendant will share equally up to their respective limits of liability, irrespective of what those limits might be.\u201d Defendant appeals from that substantive conclusion, in addition to alleging that the question is not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The facts are not in dispute. The Community Service Station, while repairing the vehicle of one William B. Knight, Jr., had supplied him with an automobile as a temporary substitute. The liability policy on this car was carried by Employers Liability Assurance Corp., Ltd. (\u201cEmployers\u201d). On December 28, 1957, while the vehicle was being operated by James Knight, Jr., with the permission of his uncle, William B. Knight, Jr., riding as a passenger, it was involved in a collision with another automobile driven by Mary M. Herbert. Her father, Charles H. Herbert, the owner of the car, was a passenger, along with her sister, Carol G. Herbert. As a result of the accident, both William B. Knight, Jr. and Charles Herbert died, and the Herbert girls sustained severe personal injuries. Shortly after the filing of the pleadings in the instant matter, suit was instituted on behalf of Mr. Herbert\u2019s estate and the Herbert sisters against James Knight, Jr., Community Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Station, and the executrix of the estate of William B. Knight, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The involvement of plaintiff (\u201cHartford\u201d) and defendant (\u201cSelected\u201d) arises out of policies issued by them to James Knight, Jr. and William B. Knight, Jr., respectively, covering automobiles owned by the two men. The Hartford policy protects relatives of the named assured with respect to a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile; the Selected policy covers, by its terms, named and additional assureds while operating a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d automobile. It is conceded by each company that its policy covers this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Employers has accepted its responsibility as primary carrier, providing coverage to the limits of its policy for all three defendants in the IJerbert-Knight action. Hartford and Selected, having stipulated that they are \u201cexcess\u201d carriers under the terms of their policies, focus their respective legal contentions on the following clause, contained in identical form in each of their instruments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cOther Insurance: If the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by Section I of this policy, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, the insurance with respect to a temporary substitute automobile or non-owned automobile shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Defendant urges that the quoted provision evidences an intention that where a non-owned or temporary substitute automobile is involved, the contribution of the carriers should be pro-rated on the basis of the liability limits in their respective policies. Plaintiff counters this contention by submitting that the issue has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding for equal sharing of the loss in Cosmopolitan <em>Mutual Insurance Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>28 N. <em>J. </em>554 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">We consider, preliminarily, the contention that this action was brought prematurely. The Declaratory Judg-</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ment Act, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:16-50 <em>et seq., </em>is a remedial device designed to expedite tlie definitive establishment of private rights and duties and thereby forestall the emergence of costly and cumbersome trial proceedings. See <em>National-Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co. v. Camden Trust Co., </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>16 (1956). The worthy purposes of the act amply justify the liberal construction accorded it since the establishment of our new court system by the 1947 <em>Constitution. Ibid., </em>21 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>22; <em>Utility Blade &amp; Razor Co. v. Donovan, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>566 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); also see <em>R. R. </em>4:92A; <em>Bor chard, Declaratory Judgments </em>(2 <em>d ed. </em>1941), <em>pp. </em>316, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">As this court has previously remarked, \u201cno more fertile ground exists for the use of the declaratory judgment procedure than in the field of insurance * * <em>Condenser Service &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. v. American Mutual Liability Insurance Co., </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>31, 38 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); see <em>Annotation, </em>142 <em>A. L. R. </em>8-76 (1943). This is an area in which the construction of contractual language\u2014a function for which the declaratory judgment machinery is tailor-made\u2014is a constantly recurring event. To avoid overburdening the judiciary with purely hypothetical questions, however, the parties to the action must demonstrate possession of truly adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality. See <em>Condenser Service \u00a3 Engineering Co., Inc. v. American Mutual Liability Insurance Co., supra; </em>and cases cited therein at <em>p. </em>39 of 45 <em>N. J. Super.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The complaint asked relief in the form of: (1) a declaration that both plaintiff and defendant are carriers for any liability in excess of the coverage offered by Employers, and (2) a determination of the basis upon which the two carriers would contribute to any settlement or judgment in excess of the liability limits of the primary carrier. Defendant, by way of its answer, denied that plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought, contesting Hartford\u2019s right to an equal division of any payments made by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\"other insurance\u201d clause. At the hearing on plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the parties stipulated that any judgment or settlement in the Herbert-Knight action would exceed the liability limits of the primary carrier, Employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">It would thus appear that the questions raised by the parties herein are both real and immediate. The existence of the Herbert suit, in which settlement negotiations, not to mention trial, are or undoubtedly soon will be undertaken, the assertion of a substantial legal right\u2014 premised on a specific contractual clause\u2014by plaintiff and the express denial thereof by defendant, the stipulation amounting to an admission that the interests of these parties will be vitally affected by the outcome of the Herbert litigation\u2014all combine to demonstrate the existence of a concrete, contested issue. Defendant\u2019s assertion that a determination on the merits of its status <em>vis-a-vis </em>plaintiff will hinder its settlement negotiations with the Herberts would seem to be self-answering. The desire to bargain with a fist-full of undetermined rights may be appropriate at the poker table, but not in our law courts under modern concepts of open litigation. We conclude that a justiciable controversy has been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The parties\u2019 substantive assertions are focused primarily on the effect of the holding in <em>Cosmopolitan Mutual Insurance Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., supra. </em>In <em>Cosmopolitan, </em>the Essex County News Company had rented a truck from the IJ-Drive-It Company and, while being driven by one of the former\u2019s employees, the truck collided with another vehicle. Cosmopolitan was the News Company\u2019s insurer and its policy extended coverage to any non-owned or hired vehicles used in Essex\u2019s business, with the proviso that the extended coverage \"shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d The U-Drive-It Company was insured by Continental, whose policy\u2014under an omnibus clause\u2014covered any lessee and his driver: the instrument, however, likewise labelled its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>coverage as \u201cexcess\u201d over \u201cany other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured <em>* *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Suit for reimbursement was instituted by Cosmopolitan, which had settled the claim of the party involved in the collision with the truck. The Supreme Court, having certified to the trial court, was faced with the question of which carrier was primarily liable. The court reviewed the exhaustive litigation in this area, see <em>Annotation, </em>69 <em>A. L. R. 2d 1122 </em>(1960); <em>2 Richards, Insurance, (5th ed., Freedman, </em>1952), \u00a7 182, <em>pp. </em>651-52; 29A <em>Am. Jur., Insurance, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1715, 1716, <em>pp. </em>794-95, and concluded that although both policies provided they would be \u201cexcess\u201d insurance, there could be no \u201cexcess\u201d coverage in the absence of a \u201cprimary\u201d carrier. It was therefore held that the excess insurance provisions, being mutually repugnant, were inoperative and that the general coverage provisions of each policy applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Having determined that both insurers should share the burden of liability, the court proceeded to consider the formula by which the apportionment would be made. Its conclusion that the parties should contribute in equal proportions\u2014rather than in relation to their liability' limits or premiums received\u2014is in our opinion dispositive of the conflicting contentions herein by Hartford and Selected. Of controlling significance is the court\u2019s construction of Condition Ho. 14 of the Cosmopolitan policy, almost identical to the provisions in the Hartford and Selected instruments, and reading as follows (28 <em>N. J., supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>556\u2014557) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cIf the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the Company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, the insurance under this policy with respect to loss arising out of the maintenance or use of any hired automobile insured on a cost of hire basis or the use of any non-owned automobile shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The coart rejected Continental's plea for proration, stating that \u201cneither policy expressly provides for * * * prorating where a hired or non-owned vehicle is involved,\u201d and characterizing the above-qnoted policy clause as \u201c* * * provid[ing] for pro-rating in other [than where a non-owned or hired vehicle is involved] circumstances.\u201d (28 <em>N. J., supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation is, of course, conclusive of the meaning to be placed upon the Hartford and Selected provisos. Moreover, it recommends itself to us as a logical reflection of the insurers\u2019 intentions in inserting this clause into their policies. A limitation was sought in instances of primary liability by means of the prorating feature. Once the conditions of an accident\u2014 <em>i. e., </em>the fact that the assured was operating a \u201cnon-owned\u201d or \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d vehicle\u2014result in activation, as here, of the excess coverage proviso, the connection between the policy liability limits and the proportion of responsibility to be borne by each carrier becomes too remote to warrant proration on that basis. It was therefore contemplated, in our opinion, that the prorating feature would drop out at this stage. In the absence of such a provision, the liability of Hartford and Selected is joint and several. 2 <em>Richards, Insurance, supra, </em>\u00a7 175, <em>p. </em>637.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Defendant urges that the absence of a primary carrier in <em>Cosmopolitan, </em>with the result that both of the \u201cexcess\u201d insurers were in effect elevated to that position, distinguishes the present ease, where the existence and liability of a primary carrier are conceded. We perceive no distinction in principle. In both cases, the competing insurers occupy co-ordinate status. In <em>Cosmopolitan, </em>as adjudged; here, as conceded by the parties. The crucial factor, in our view, is that both Hartford and Selected are on the same level of liability. Their respective duties to contribute are to be invoked at the same point\u2014when the coverage of the primary carrier is exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
