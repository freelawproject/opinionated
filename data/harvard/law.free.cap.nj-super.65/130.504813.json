A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">In June 1955 the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation made an award in favor of petitioner William T. Barry (Barry) and against respondent Wallace J. Wilck, Inc. (Wilck). In January 1958 Barry filed an application in the Division, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-27, for a review of the award on the ground that his disability had increased. Barry failed to prosecute his application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>so Wilck gave notice that on July 23, 1958 it would move to dismiss it. On July 21, 1958, in response to the notice, Barry\u2019s counsel wrote Deputy Director Medinets that Barry \u201cdoes not wish to proceed with his petition for increased disability * * * we, therefore, do not oppose the respondent\u2019s Motion to dismiss this petition. We are proceeding with a petition on behalf of the petitioner in an effort to obtain for him the benefits afforded by the 1% Fund.\u201d Accordingly, by order dated October 16, 1958 Deputy Director Medinets granted the motion and dismissed the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On September 17, 1959 Barry\u2019s attorney served notice upon Wilck that on October 8, 1959 he would \u201cmove to set aside the dismissal.\u201d The notice gave no reasons, nor was the motion supported at any time by any affidavit or other proof. Merely upon counsel\u2019s oral argument, and over WilcFs objection, Deputy Director Napier ordered the dismissal set aside and the application reinstated. Wilck then appealed to the County Court, which dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order. The opinion of the County Court is reported in 61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>299 (1960). Wilck thereupon secured from this court, pursuant to <em>B. B. </em>2:2-3, leave to \u201cappeal from the Order of the Essex County Court dismissing respondent\u2019s appeal.\u201d Pursuant to that leave, the case is now brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Wilck contends that, now that the case is here, it is immaterial whether the Counfy Court did or did not have jurisdiction over it. In either event, says Wilck, we should decide the merits, for, if the County Court did not have jurisdiction, this eouj't does: and if it had jurisdiction, we should not only reverse the County Court but decide the meritorious legal questions as well. <em>Temple v. Storch Trucking Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>42, at <em>p. </em>45 (1949) ; <em>cf. Pfahler v. Eclipse Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corp., </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>156, 159 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), affirmed 21 <em>N. J. </em>486 (1956); <em>R. R. </em>1:5-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The meritorious grounds of appeal, says Wilck, are that (1) the application for increased benefits was not made \u201cwithin two years from the date when the injured person last received a payment\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-27), and hence the Division had no jurisdiction to entertain the application, or, <em>a </em>fortiori&gt; to reinstate it; (2) Deputy Director Hapier had no jurisdiction to set aside the dismissal, because the statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-54) expressly provides that only the deputy \u201cbefore whom the matter was heard,\u201d or the Commissioner of Labor, may do so, and (3), in any event, \u201cgood cause\u201d for the reinstatement was not shown. <em>Nemeth v. Otis Elevator Co., Inc., </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Barry, on the other hand, contends that neither the County Court nor this court may entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation. He says that, in the case at bar, we have only the power to affirm or reverse the dismissal of the appeal by the County Court, and, if we affirm, we have no power ourselves at this time to consider the merits. It is therefore essential that we first consider the jurisdiction of the County Court and of this court with reference to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Th\u00e9 question of the jurisdiction of the County Court has been raised in several recent cases, with conflicting results. Compare <em>Skislak v. Continental Mining and Smelting Corp., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>157 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), and <em>Nemeth v. Otis Elevator Co., Inc., </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>373 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1958), reversed 55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959) (but this point was not raised on appeal), with <em>Barclay v. Linden Flight Service, Inc., </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>434 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1959). See also Bronstein, \u201cJudicial Review of New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases,\u201d 77 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>181, 185, <em>n. </em>33 (1954); <em>King v. Western Electric Co., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>442 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939), affirmed 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>129 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940); <em>Pfahler v. Eclipse Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Ho appellate court decision prior to <em>Shislak, supra, </em>decided whether an appeal lay to the County Court or the Common Pleas from an interlocutory order of the Division. In <em>Shislak </em>the former Supremo Court held that the Pleas did have jurisdiction of such appeals; but the authority of the case is greatly weakened by the fact that it was reversed, albeit on other grounds, in 1 <em>N. J. </em>167 (1948), and by the further fact that it purported to follow <em>Ruoff v. Blasi, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>47 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936), affirmed 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>314 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1937), which, however, involved an appeal not from an interlocutory but from a final order. <em>Cf. Jaudel v. Schoelzke, </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>171, 176 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>King v. Western Electric Co., supra, </em>an application for increased disability had been dismissed, and afterwards the OTder of dismissal was vacated on the employee\u2019s motion. The employer appealed to the Pleas, but, since there the employee \u201cstipulated for the entry of an order of reversal\u201d (122 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>446), jurisdiction was apparently neither questioned nor decided, but merely assumed by the Pleas. However, the employee thereafter filed another petition for increased disability, and, when the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss it was denied, the employer again appealed to the Pleas. This time \u201cJudge Elanagan ruled that such interlocutory orders were not appealable under the statute and he accordingly dismissed the appeal Tor lack of jurisdiction\u2019.\u201d (122 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>446.) The Supreme Court then granted <em>certiorari, </em>not to review the action of the Pleas but that of the Bureau, and reversed. However, the Supreme Court expressed no opinion on the question of the jurisdiction of the Pleas. <em>Cf. King v. Western Electric Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>199-200 <em>(C. P. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In <em>Halloran v. Haffner, </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>241. <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), the employer moved to dismiss a petition, challenging the jurisdiction of the Bureau over his person. After his motion was denied, \u201cthe employer not only filed a notice of appeal therefrom to * * * [the Appellate Division], but also instituted a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>for a review thereof in the Law Division of the Superior Court. By order of the Appellate Division, further proceedings before the Law Division were stayed <em>(p. </em>246). The Appellate Division said (at <em>pp. </em>246-247) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201cThe employer contends that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear and decide this appeal. Prior to September 15, 1948, * * * review of an order entered in the Division denying a motion for dismissal of a claim petition, based on the ground that the Division lacked jurisdiction, was * * * by means of a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the former Supreme Court, even though no final judgment of the Division be involved <em>(Deslauriers Column Mould Co. v. Jackson, </em>3 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>258 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925)). Pursuant to the mandate contained in our 1947 <em>Constitution (Art. </em>VI, <em>Sec. </em>V, <em>par. </em>4), our new Supreme Court provided in <em>Rule </em>3 :S1 for procedure in lieu of prerogative writs. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">We are satisfied that <em>Rule </em>3:81-8 was intended to provide an appeal, as a matter of right, to the Appellate Division from any state administrative agency in any case in which, under our former practice, a review by our former Supreme Court was available by means of a prerogative writ. While the language used in <em>Rule </em>3:81-8 is not free from ambiguity, we construe \u2018action,\u2019 as used in this rule, to include any proceeding not included in \u2018final decision\u2019 but still one which was reviewable under our former practice by means of a prerogative writ. This court does have jurisdiction to hear and decide this appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In <em>Pfahler v. Eclipse Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corp., supra, </em>the employer had appealed to the County Court from the Division\u2019s denial of its motion to dismiss the petition because it had been filed out of time. The County Court affirmed, and the employer appealed. Speaking for the Appellate Division, Judge Speakman questioned whether there was any longer an appeal \u201cas a matter of right\u201d to the Appellate Division, as <em>HaUoran </em>had held, \u201cin view of the 1954 amendments to <em>R. R. </em>2:2-3(b) and <em>R. R. </em>4:88\u20148,\u201d and also whether the appeal had been properly taken to the County Court. He said (38 <em>N. J. Super., p. </em>159):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201cPrior to the change brought about by the adoption of the Constitution of 1947, the former Supreme Court held that it could re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>view by <em>cerliorari </em>the determination of the then Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau in denying a motion to dismiss a claim petition as having been filed out of time, even though not a final judgment, since the matter was one of jurisdiction. <em>Deslauriers Column Mould Co. v. Jackson, </em>3 N. <em>J. Misc. </em>258 (1925). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cHowever, no objection was inierposed to the appeal to the County Court, and none has been made here. Since there can be no question that this court would ultimately have power to review the jurisdictional question, we proceed to a consideration of the matter on the merits without further comment upon the route traveled to arrive at this destination except to say that our action in so doing is not to be taken as an ax&gt;proval of the procedure followed. See <em>Temple v. Storch Trucking Co., </em>3 N. <em>J. </em>42 (1949), at <em>page </em>45.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In <em>Nemeth v. Otis Elevator Co., Inc., supra, </em>the County Court held that it did have jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders, while in <em>Barclay v. Linden Flight Service, Inc., supra, </em>the County Court held it did not. In the case at bar the trial judge said, and we agree, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201c* # s The County Court is not a court of general appellate jurisdiction. Whatever power it has to hear and determine appeals from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division is derived from <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-00, which provides, in part, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u2018Either party may appeal from the judgment of the director, deputy director, or referee, to the County Court, etc. * * *. The judgment entered in the County Court on any such appeal shall be conclusive and binding and proceedings thereon shall only be for the recovery of moneys thereby determined to be due. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">The use of the word \u2018judgment,\u2019 without any qualifying or amplifying language, and in the context found, imports the idea of \u2018final judgment.\u2019 Clearly, it deals with the final disposition of the issues raised in a proceeding. It is unreasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended to convey the idea that all intermediate and interlocutory orders made by the Division in the course of its processing a compensation claim should bn appealable as a matter of right. This would encourage piecemeal appeals and could embarrass the disposition of a cause by vexatious recourse to the appellate tribunal. It would seem anomalous, too, that there should exist a right of appeal to the County Court from an interlocutory order, when, as a matter of rule, further appeal to the Appellate Division depends upon the exercise of the discretionary power of that Court. * * \u00ae\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">As we have pointed out, we find no record of any case prior to <em>Skislak </em>in which the court held that the Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Pleas or the County Court had such jurisdiction, nor (except, as noted, in <em>King) </em>in which the Pleas assumed such jurisdiction. On the other hand, as was noted in <em>King, supra, </em>Judge Elanagan held that the Pleas did not have such jurisdiction. More significant is the fact that the old Supreme Court reviewed such orders by <em>certiorari </em>directed to the Bureau, which it would not have done (except, perhaps, under unusual circumstances) if an appeal lay to the Pleas. <em>Halloran v. Haffner, supra; King v. Western Electric, supra; Stone v. Dugan Brothers of N. J., </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>13 <em>(App. Div. </em>1948); <em>Licker v. J. G. Martin Box Co., 127 N. J. L. </em>136, 139 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); <em>Breen Iron Works v. Richardson, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>305 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed 117 <em>N. J. L. </em>150 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936); <em>Allord v. Henry Muhs Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>1230 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932), affirmed opinion below 111 <em>N. J. L. </em>237 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933); <em>Katz v. Zepela, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>258 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932), affirmed opinion below 110 <em>N. J. L. </em>14 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933); <em>Deslauriers Column Mould Co. v. Jackson, 3 N. J. Misc. </em>258 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925). <em>Cf. Penn. R. R. Co. v. N. J. State Aviation Commission, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>132 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), reversed on other grounds 2 <em>N. J. </em>64 (1949); <em>Staubach v. Cities Service Oil Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>157 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Erom the foregoing we conclude that, unless the situation has been changed by the rules adopted since 1948, the Pleas did not have, and the County Court does not now have, jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders. We turn, therefore, to the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The Supreme Court has said that it'has no jurisdiction to govern the proceedings within the Division by rule. <em>Mulhearn v. Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>356 (1949). Indeed, when our new rules were first adopted, in 1948, there was no rule expressly governing appeals from judgments of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division. The forerunner of <em>R. R. </em>5:2-5 was not adopted until 1950. Until that time such appeals were left entirely to the governance of <em>R. S. </em>34:15-66. Substantively, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>review of the proceedings of the Division is still based upon said statute; <em>B. B. </em>5:2-5 merely regulates the mechanics of such review. Bronstein, \u201cJudicial Beview of New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases,\u201d <em>supra. </em>When, following the County Court decision in <em>Nemeth, supra, </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>373 (1958), it was proposed to amend <em>B. B. </em>5:2-5 \u201cto provide that an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order or determination of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division unless leave to appeal is requested and granted,\u201d the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Buies rejected the proposal, in its report dated March 19, 1959, on the ground that \u201cthe nature of the review in the County Court of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division is a matter of statute and not rule.\u201d The statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-66) now provides, \u201cNothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to review any matter through a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ. * * *\u201d Similar language was contained in the forerunners of the present statute. <em>L. </em>1945, <em>c. </em>74, <em>p. </em>397, \u00a7 17. In addition, the Superior Court has, of course, succeeded in general to the jurisdiction of the old Supreme Court in prerogative writ cases. <em>N. J. Const. </em>1947, <em>Art. </em>VI, \u00a7 5, <em>par. 4; Appeal of Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>398, 411-412 (1956). <em>Cf. Halloran v. Haffner, supra; Pfahler v. Eclipse Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We shall assume, without deciding, that the Supreme Court, under <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>240 (1950), <em>cert. </em>denied, 340 <em>U. S. </em>877, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>638 (1950), does have the right to forbid this court to review interlocutory orders of the Division, and to give that power exclusively to the County Court. Barry insists that the Supreme Court went even farther, when it adopted the new rules, and forbade any review by any court of interlocutory orders of the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Barry argues that \u201c[t]he type of review [by the old Supreme Court] as evidenced in the case of <em>King v. Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Electric Co., </em>[stipra] is no longer countenanced\u201d because <em>R. R. 1:2-12(a), R. R. </em>4:88-8(a) and <em>B. B. </em>2:2-3(a) specifically exclude workmen\u2019s compensation appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><em>B. B. </em>1:2-12(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cAppeals to the county court from an order or determination of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation shall be governed by Buie 5:2-5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>B. B. </em>4:88-8(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201cBeview of the final decision or action of any state administrative agency, other than those governed by Buies 5 :2-5 and 5 :2-9, shall be by appeal to the Appellate Division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\"><em>B. B. </em>2:2-3(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cThis court shall have the power to permit in its discretion an appeal to be taken from any interlocutory order or judgment or from an interlocutory decision or action of any state administrative agency (other than those governed by Buies 5:2-5 and 5:2-9) when, in the opinion of the court, the grounds of appeal are substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\"><em>B. B. </em>5:2-5 by its very terms governs appeals \u201cto the county court from a judgment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division.\u201d If the County Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order, then, obviously, such an appeal is not \u201cgoverned by\u201d <em>B. B. </em>5 :2-5, is therefore not excepted from <em>B. B. </em>4:88-8 or from <em>B. B. </em>2:2-3, and is to the Appellate Division, upon leave first granted pursuant to 4:88-8(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">\u201cLeave to review an interlocutory decision or action of state administrative agencies may be granted by the Appellate Division under the conditions set forth in Buie 2:2-3.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">As a parallel we point out that, before <em>B. 8. </em>34:15-66 was amended to give the County Court jurisdiction to review compensation awards arising out of accidents which occurred out of the State, the forerunners of <em>B. B. </em>5:2-5 did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>govern sneli appeals and the Appellate Division had jurisdiction over them, even though no statute or rule so provided. <em>Kelly v. Hackensack Water Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>528, 531 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). <em>Cf. Pitchenick v. New York Folding Box Co., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>206, 207 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942), affirmed 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>399 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We are well aware that an argument can be made, based upon the history of the quoted rules, that the Supreme Court (a) deliberately chose to withhold from the Appellate Division the power to review interlocutory orders of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division, or (b) did so through oversight. If so, and if the County Court has no such power, no such review is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The right to review an interlocutory order in a proper case is so important to litigants, and so essential to a modern system of jurisprudence, that it is inconceivable that the Supreme Court would deliberately block all possibility of such review without clearly saying so. Iteview of interlocutory orders was a part of our jurisprudence long before workmen\u2019s compensation, <em>Mowery v. Camden, 49 N. J. L. </em>106 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1886), and, after workmen\u2019s compensation was adopted, such review was extended to interlocutory orders of the Bureau. The reasons for this were well stared in <em>Breen Iron Works v. Richardson, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>305 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed 117 <em>N. J. L. </em>150 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936). There a workmen\u2019s compensation petition had been dismissed, without objection by petitioner. Over a year later application was made and granted to reopen the case, and the employer appealed. The employee argned, among other things, that <em>certiorari </em>should not have been granted because the order was interlocutory. The Supreme Court set aside the reopening, saying, as to this point (115 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>309) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201c* * \u201c the rule, as laid down by the late Mr. Justice Dixon in <em>Mowery v. Camden, supra </em>(at <em>p. </em>109), Is that \u2018when the purpose is to review the proceedings of a special tribunal, on complaint of irregular procedure in matters legally brought within its jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>a <em>certiorari may </em>legally issue before final decision, but ordinarily <em>should not </em>be allowed until then, for haply the tribunal may correct its own error in time. When the design is to reverse proceedings of special tribunals in matters not legally brought within their jurisdiction, then the writ of <em>certiorari </em>may legally, and ordinarily should, be allowed when asked for, either before or after final decision, because each step in such proceedings is an unlawful vexation of the party prosecuted, against which this writ is his sole protection.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><em>Cf. Appeal of Pennsylvania Railroad Co., supra, </em>30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>411-413; <em>Swanson v. Swanson, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>169 (1951); <em>Belvidere v. Waldron, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>587-588 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Protection of the litigant against \u201cunlawful vexation\u201d obviously is as essential today as when <em>Breen </em>was decided. Hence we reject the notion that the Supreme Court, <em>sub silenlio, </em>abolished all review of interlocutory orders of the Division. Indeed, Bronstein stated, in \u201cJudicial Review of New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases,\u201d <em>supra, </em>that (under the 1954 rules) both the County Court and the Appellate Division had such jurisdiction. He said (77 <em>N. J. L. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>185, <em>n. </em>33) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cBeing formerly cognizable by writ of <em>certiorari, </em>prerogative writ actions are matters of right under the new Constitution. <em>W. J. Const. Art. </em>6, \u00a7 5, <em>par. </em>4 (1947) ; <em>JR. R. </em>4:88-1. The existence of the direct appeal from the Bureau to the Appellate Division where the jurisdiction of the Bureau is in issue was apparently overlooked in the 1954 Supreme Court Rule 5:2-5(f) which amended <em>R. R. </em>5:2-5 by eliminating the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to award counsel fees on direct appeal from the Bureau. The note to the Tentative Draft Revision of the Rules dated May 11, 1953, page 399, justifies the change by reason of <em>L. </em>1953, o. 33 which eliminated the need for direct appeal where the accident occurred out of the state. As a result counsel fees on direct appeal from the Bureau to the Appellate Division on issues \u2022of jurisdiction of the Bureau are again in a vacuum as in <em>King v. Western Electric, </em>18 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>199, 12 <em>A. 2d </em>151 <em>(C. P. </em>1940) ; <em>Lange v. Eureka Printing Works, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>76, 158 <em>A. </em>106 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932). Petitioners are better advised, therefore, to appeal through the County Court, while respondents should try the direct appeal wherever a jurisdictional question is in issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">But the unlimited right to appeal from interlocutory orders is even more vexatious and inconsistent with modern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>jurisprudence than the complete absence of the right to appeal such orders would be. As the trial judge pointed out, if the County Court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders, the rules contain no limitation upon the litigant\u2019s exercise of that right. That militates strongly against the construction contended for by Wilek, for it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court intended, by the rules, to give the right to litigants to repair to the County Court at will, following every step in the proceedings in the Division. We are confident that if the Supreme Court had intended to so provide it would have done so by clear and emphatic rule, and would not have left it to the dubious fortunes of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Wilek argues that subdivision (f) of <em>II. B. 5:2-o </em>proves, by implication, that the County Court does have jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders. That subdivision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cThe comity court may, in its discretion, allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing- party on appeal from an order or determination of the division of workmen\u2019s compensation for his services in the county court, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, and the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Wilek argues that under this rule the County Court may allow a fee only when the appeal is to it, or to the Appellate Division or the Supreme Court from its judgment. That was the construction placed upon <em>R. S. </em>34:15-67 (repealed by <em>L. </em>1953, c. 33, <em>p. </em>599, \u00a7 59) but that was because of the detailed provisions of that statute, which narrowly confined the right to fees. <em>Stetser v. American Stores Co., </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>275, 277 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1940); <em>King v. Western Electric, </em>18 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>199 <em>(C. P. </em>1940); <em>Lange v. Eureka Printing Works, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>76 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931) ; <em>Township of Roxbury v. Plumstead, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>1034 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932). It was repeatedly stated that the right to a counsel fee in appeals in workmen\u2019s compensation cases was wholly a creature of statute, and the statute was construed literally. For example, in <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Von Volkum, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>464 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944), affirmed 132 <em>N. J. L. </em>344 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945), the employer had applied for <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court to review a judgment of the Pleas affirming an award. The employee opposed the application and it was denied. The Pleas then gave employee\u2019s counsel a fee for resisting the application. On appeal the Supreme Court reversed, saying <em>(p. </em>465) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201cThe pertinent statute is <em>R. S. </em>34:15-67 as follows: \u2018In cases where the judgment of the court of common pleas is <em>reviewed Toy the supreme court </em>by <em>certiorari, </em>the court of common pleas may allow a reasonable attorney fee to the party prevailing on the <em>certiorari </em>for his services on the <em>certiorari, </em>which fee shall be taxed in the costs and become a part of the final judgment in the cause, and may be recovered against the unsuccessful party.\u2019 The italics ours. The fees are to counsel prevailing on <em>certiorari </em>and not to counsel who succeeds in opposing the issuance of the writ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Before the writ issues there can be no review. The refusal of <em>allocatur </em>is a denial of review. Since there is no review no one can prevail in the review. Changes in statutes, however desirable, must be made by the Legislature and not by the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">This gap in the statute was closed by <em>L. </em>1945, <em>c. </em>97, <em>p. </em>438, amending said <em>B. S. </em>34:15-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Similarly, it will be seen that all of the cases which dealt with the allowance of fees, prior to the adoption of our new practice, were bottomed upon a literal reading of <em>R. S. </em>34:15-67. In addition to the cases cited above, see <em>Comparri v. James Readding, Inc., </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>591 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); <em>Toner v. International, etc., Ironworkers, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>511 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); <em>Natural Products, &amp;c., Co. v. Court of Common Pleas, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>373 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>Yeager v. Brown Bros., Inc., </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>463 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944), affirmed 132 <em>N. J. L. </em>361 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">But <em>B. B. </em>5:2-5(f) is much broader than <em>B. S. </em>34:15-67 was, and is free of its limitations. Moreover, being a rule it may be construed much more flexibly than we could construe a statute. In <em>Minter v. Bendix Aviation Corp., </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>128 (1957), Minnie Minter, claiming to be the widow of the deceased employee, obtained an award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Thereafter, another woman appeared who claimed to be the widow. Bendix, the employer, interpleaded the award, but the interpleader was contested by Minnie Minter and, as a result, was dismissed. Bendix then appealed to the Appellate Division. Minnie Minter contested the appeal. Even though the merits of her claim still remained undetermined by virtue of the action taken by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201ccounsel for Minnie Minter request [ed] the direction to the Bergen County Court to allow a reasonable fee for services rendered in the interpleader proceedings in the Chancery Division and the appeal by Bendix to the Appellate Division, as well as an additional interpleader * * * filed by Bendix in the federal district court.\u201d The court allowed a fee saying, at <em>p. </em>137 (emphasis ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\"><em>\u201cR. R. </em>5:2-5(f) permits an allowance to the prevailing party for services rendered \u2018in the county court, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, and the Supreme Court.\u2019 This recjuest is inherently fair. Winnie has prevailed upon the initial issue of fraud in the instant proceeding and the interpleader action instituted by Bendix was intimately related with that issue for it was there that the employer charged fraud and succeeded in obtaining a hearing upon that contention. <em>Although the rule literally does not encompass services rendered in the Chancery Division of the Superior Court, its fundamental purpose to alleviate the financial burden of injured workers or their dependents in prosecuting compensation claims by competent counsel applies to this case. </em>The brief foray in the federal district court may be disregarded for there the petition of interpleader was dismissed by the consent of all parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Under the construction placed on <em>R. R. </em>5:3-5(f) in <em>Minter, </em>that rule probably is broad enough to authorize the County Court to allow a fee to the successful employee\u2019s counsel for resisting a direct appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, to this court from an interlocutory order of the Division. However, we need not determine this question at this time, for here the question of such fees will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>arise, since judgment will be for the employer. But even if <em>B. B. 5:2-5 </em>(f) is not broad enough to allow a fee in such circumstances, we agree with the trial judge, for the reasons stated above, that the County Court has no jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We are aware of the fact that what is now <em>B. B. </em>5:2-5(f) was adopted in almost identical words as Rule 5:2-5 in 1950, and that on January 1, 1952 that rule was amended in the fashion described in <em>Monaco v. Albert </em>Maund, <em>Inc., </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>443, 445 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). The court said (at <em>pp. </em>445-446):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cPrior to the amendment of <em>Buie </em>5:2-5 on January 1, 1952, there was no provision for the allowance of any counsel fee for services rendered on appeal in a case such as this where the accident happened outside the State and the appeal was directly from the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation to the Appellate Division. However, if the accident happened inside the State, the County Court was and is authorized to allow to the prevailing party on appeal \u2018a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 for services rendered on appeal in the County Court, the Appellate Division and the Supreme Court. <em>Buie </em>5:2-5; <em>B. S. </em>34:15-67 (as amended <em>L. </em>1945, c. 97, \u00a7 1). To correct the inequity then existing, under which the successful appellant in an out-of-State accident case could not receive any allowance for services rendered on appeal, <em>Buie </em>5:2-5 was amended on January 1, 1952, to provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u2018When the original appeal from the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is to the Appellate Division, the Appellate Division may, in its discretion, allow a reasonable counsel fee to the prevailing party on appeal, for his services in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court and the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">But that amendment was necessary not because <em>Buie </em>5 :2-5 was not broad enough, prior to the amendment, to permit a County Court to allow such a fee when the accident happened in New Jersey <em>(cf. Comparri v. James </em>Readding, <em>Inc., supra), </em>but because <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-66 (as it read prior to <em>L. </em>1953, <em>c. </em>33, \u00a7 57) gave no County Court jurisdiction over any step in a workmen\u2019s compensation litigation arising out of an out-of-state accident. When <em>L. </em>1953, c. 33, \u00a7 57 was passed, giving jurisdiction over appeals in such cases to the County Court of the county in which the Division hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>was held, the sentence which had been added to <em>Buie </em>5:2-5 on January 1, 1952 was no longer needed, because by virtue of said <em>L. </em>1953, c. 33, \u00a7 57, there was an identifiable County Corxrt to allow such fees. Said amendatory sentence was therefore then eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Wo hold, further, that we do have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and to consider its merits. Before we do so, we must dispose of a procedural question which is that the leave which we granted was to appeal from the judgment of dismissal of the County Court, and not to appeal from the order of the Division. However, under the circumstances, we shall treat the case as if we had granted the latter. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-4; <em>R. R. </em>1:27D; <em>Lepore v. Ajamian, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>214 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). <em>Cf. Grogan v. William J. Scully, Inc., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>174 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>Pfahler v. Eclipse Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We have enumerated heretofore the grounds of appeal which relate to the merits. We shall deal only with the third, namely that \u201cgood cause\u201d was not shown for setting aside the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>Nemeth v. Otis Elevator Co., supra, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493, we held that, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-54, no dismissal may \u201cbe reopened without a showing of excuse for the default as well as merit.\u201d In <em>Nemeth </em>petitioner submitted an affidavit in support of his application to reopen, the contents of which we found inadequate. Here petitioner submitted no affidavit or other proof showing either excuse or merit. Passing that, we find that what petitioner asserted before the deputy, and repeats here, establishes neither merit nor excuse for the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Petitioner admits that his petition was \u201cdismissed with the consent of the petitioner\u2019s counsel after a revaluation of his case. At this juncture it was decided that petitioner would attempt to recover under the 1% Fund.\u201d However, after the dismissal petitioner\u2019s attorney learned that his recourse to said Fund was barred by the passage of time, and he filed the application before us, not with the expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tion of obtaining any material increase in tbe award, bnt in the hope of getting something, however small, so that the time in which to proceed against the Fund would start running again. We hold, following Nemeth, that this does not establish \u201cgood cause.\u201d The reinstatement of the petition is therefore set aside and the dismissal reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">It is therefore unnecessary to decide the other two points raised by appellant on the merits. The case is remanded to the Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> Ultimately she failed to prevail on the merits, but her counsel received his fee. <em>Cf. Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>469, 477 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
