On the return of the postea the plaintiff moves for judgment, and insists, he is entitled to costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-7\"><em>Wood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-8\"><em>J. S. Green, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvE\">said, It is incumbent on the plaintiff to make out this point. Costs are due by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">*The act giving costs is to be found in <em>Rev. Laws </em>168 ; and to the first section there is this proviso, that such costs are not to exceed the fees stated and allowed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">Under this law, if the plaintiff recovered any amount, he was entitled to costs, and hence no doubt, many suits were brought in the Supreme Court for small amounts, to the great trouble of the court and at the great expense of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-11\">In the year 1797, the legislature passed another law, <em>Rev. Laws </em>309. The very title shews the object; to <em>prevent </em>suits under a certain sum being brought in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-12\">The evil then was the bringing of suits in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-13\"><em>Sea. </em>1. The plaintiff must recover 200 dollars before he should be entitled to costs with but two exceptions. 1. When the title to land may come in question. 2. Cases removed by habeas corpus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-14\">It is insisted that the case now before the court, is within the exception, and that the plaintiff is entitled to costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The act is to be so construed as to effect the object of the legislature. The plaintiff' is to shew that this case is within the exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">1. What is the meaning of the word <em>title. </em>This has been settled in the case in 6 <em>Halst. </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">The title must not then have necessarily come in question here. Por I hold that the correct view of the subject is expressed in page 65 of 6 <em>Halst.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">1. The pleadings do not shew it; the plaintiff merely sets forth his <em>possession, </em>complains of an injury to that possession, the grass, &amp;c. \u2014 no title set up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">2. Uothing in the evidence on the trial; and here the question is not what was offered, but what was essential for the plaintiff to offer, and the correct rule is laid down in page 67 of 6 <em>Halst.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">Possession alone was necessary to be proved against a wrong doer, <em>p. </em>70, <em>Justice Drake.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-10\">Deeds were offered by the plaintiff and defendant, but not necessarily; the defendant did not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s title, or his right to the soil;. the defendant\u2019s deeds were offered t\u00f3 shew *that he had a right to erect a dam, not on plaintiff\u2019s land, but his own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-11\">Plow is this court now to say that the title did come in question ? It does not- appear by the record ; it does not appear by the certificate of the judge who tried the cause; it must be at the trial of the cause, he must find and certify. <em>Rev. Laws </em>666. This is the only way in which this court can take legal knowledge of this matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-12\">Another view will show the plaintiff is not entitled to costs. This matter was cognizable before the court for the \u00bfrial of small causes. 6 <em>Halst. </em>63, shows the jurisdiction of that court; and we find in the act constituting that court, in <em>see. </em>43, <em>p. </em>341, <em>Rev. Laws, </em>that the plaintiff is not entitled to costs unless he recovers more than 100 dollars. This is not only intended to protect this court but to save to that court its proper jurisdiction, and in this view, the case in 6 <em>Halst. </em>is a full authority.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AjqN\">The plaintiff is entitled to costs. The defendant set up a right to overflow this land; and to prove it produced a succession of deeds, including all the lands which the waters drowned by a dam of a certain height. Under these deeds he claimed title to overflow as he had done; and it became a question whether he had overflowed according to the deeds or beyond them; the latter appearing to the jury to be the truth, they rendered a verdict against him. The title then was actually brought in question by the defendant. Though in this action title does not necessarily come in question, yet it may, by evidence of title given by the defendant under the general issue; and when it does, the fact may be ascertained by the oral or written certificate of the judge. <em>Rev. Laws </em>666, <em>sec. </em>1,-relates to the action of trespass only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
