Tlie mere omission of the justice to stale the place to which the cause was adjourned, is not sufficient evidence to siiew that the judgment was rendered at a different place. \u25a0</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>Hornblower,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF2a\">moved to reverse a judgment of a justice of the peace rendered in favor of Martin, and relied upon two reasons. 1. Because tlie justice adjourned the cause for the purpose of taking time to consider of his judgment, without fixing on any hour or place to which lie so adjourned, and without duly notifying the defendant. 2. Because the justice adjourned the cause and rendered judgment in the absence of the defendant, without duo notice to the defendant of such adjournment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>*The only evidence in support of these reasons was the transcript of the justice\u2019s docket, which after stating the appearance of the parties, and that they rested their case, proceeded thus : \u201c After hearing the witnesses and allega-</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">tions of the parties, I postponed the giving judgment for one week at the same time of day.

The parties attended and went to trial; after which, the justice, in their presence adjourned to a subsequent day, naming the hour. The presumption is that the adjournment was to the same place.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
