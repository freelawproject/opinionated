P. Bell, one of the directors, he had given him notice of the motion, not under an impression that notice was necessary, but as a mere act of courtesy, that the company might have an opportunity of opposing it if they thought proper, and it appeared the notice had produced this effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\"><em>The court </em>desired the counsel to look into the question of notice and stir the case again the next morning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\"><em>Saxton </em>said that upon examination he was satisfied that notice was not necessary at common law; that in England notice was required only in two particular cases; in the one \u2022case by a rule made by the judges of 3L B. directing three days\u2019 notice to be given to the other side of an application to a judge at chambers for a certiorari to remove an indictment out of London or Middlesex, <em>5 Viner, </em>351; <em>Let. H. pl. </em>7; <em>Raym. </em>74; in the other, by the stat. 12 <em>Geo. 2, C. </em>18, <em>S. </em>5, directing six days\u2019 notice, in writing, to be given to the parties as well as a recognizance to be entered into, previous to the granting of certioraris to remove any conviction, judgment, order, or other proceeding .before any justice or justices of the peace, Court of General or Quarter Sessions of the Peace; 4 <em>Viner, </em>353; 1 <em>Bac. </em>367; <em>Let D.; 5 Term Rep. </em>279; that this rule had not been adopted or notice required by our statute; <em>Rev.

We are of opinion, however, that the court may, in their discretion, grant a certiorari in the first instance, upon motion, \u00f3r if from the peculiar circumstances of the case, they should consider it necessary, direct a rule to shew cause. This is a novel case, of great importance, many questions may arise as to the most correct course of proceeding, the court therefore think it proper to direct a rule to shew cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
