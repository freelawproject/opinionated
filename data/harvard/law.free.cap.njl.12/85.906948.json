Otherwise the writ of certiorari will be a very inefficient remedy. We have allowed rules in analogous cases, on certiorari to justices of the peace, and to the Courts of Common Pleas on appeals. The same course ought to be adopted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Let the rule be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
