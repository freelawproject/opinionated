After hearing argument, w\u00e9 continued the cause to enable the Supreme . Court of Illinois to advise us whether its affirmance of petitioner\u2019s conviction was intended to rest on an adequate independent State ground or 'whether decision of the claim under the Fourteenth Amendment was necessary to its judgment inasmuch as it was urged on behalf of Illinois that the constitutional claim was not properly before, the Illinois Supreme Court on writ of error, but must be pursued in Illinois by habeas corpus. 334 U.
