Counts 1 through 13 charged that Foster engaged in sexual acts with a female who had not attained the age of 12, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Counts 14 through 41 charged that Foster engaged in sexual acts with a female between the ages of 12 and 16, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a). The different counts corresponded to the different dates of the offenses. Foster admitted that, at least monthly over a four-year period, he engaged in vaginal intercourse and oral sex with his daughter, who was under age 12 at the time the relationship started, and that he told her he would begin a relationship with her younger sister if she did not cooperate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">Prior to sentencing, Foster moved to admit his mental evaluation into evidence. The court admitted the report, which detailed molestation Foster suffered as a child and the remorse he felt over the instant conduct. The report also opined that there was little likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-17\">The probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report, listing each count as a separate group because each involved a separate harm. After applying the appropriate enhancements and reductions, and determining the multiple count adjustments, the total adjusted offense level was 38. Because Foster had a criminal history category I, the resulting guidelines range was 235 to 293 months imprisonment, and the statutory maximum under \u00a7 2241(c) was life imprisonment. The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>bation officer noted that the guidelines did not take into account the complete conduct because it did not account for the number of offenses and disregarded many of the groups.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Foster made no objections to the guidelines calculations. He did, however, call the court\u2019s attention to his mental evaluation as mitigating evidence. The district court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on counts 1 through 13, with concurrent 180-month sentences on counts 14 through 41. After considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court found that the guidelines range was not sufficient punishment and deterrence, and it considered that many of the groups had not been taken into account in calculating the guidelines range. The court determined that the repeated nature of the conduct and Foster\u2019s characteristics, coupled with the need to protect society, provide just punishment, and give Foster the opportunity for treatment and counseling, warranted a sentence of life imprisonment. Foster objected to the sentence and the court\u2019s imposition of an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">On appeal, Foster argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because the court did not properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as the likelihood of recidivism or his history and characteristics and essentially ignored the mental evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 462, 166 L.Ed.2d 329 (2006); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cAfter the district court has accurately calculated the [guideline range, it may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence that we review for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1244. Foster bears the burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Foster does not argue that the court incorrectly calculated his guidelines range and challenges only whether the ultimate sentence imposed was reasonable. Upon review, we conclude the sentence imposed was reasonable. First, the court explained that it had considered the mental evaluation, in addition to Foster\u2019s history, the need to protect society and provide adequate punishment, and the frequency and duration of the offenses. Moreover, the court considered that the guidelines calculations did not include all of the counts, and, therefore, did not adequately reflect the offenses. Thus, the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Foster was convicted of 41 counts of engaging in sexual acts with his own daughter over a four-year period. Given the nature and gravity of these offenses, we conclude that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 790 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming upward variance in light of the gravity of the offenses). Foster has not met his burden to prove otherwise. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-12\">.
