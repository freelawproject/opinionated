At the time of the revocation hearing, Griffin was facing state charges of selling marijuana at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>workplace. He had previously violated the conditions of supervised release, resulting in the court\u2019s modification of his supervised release and his confinement for ninety days in a community corrections center. Griffin argues that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to give its reason for imposing the maximum sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In Griffin\u2019s case, the Chapter 7 policy statement advisory range was 51-60 months. Because Griffin did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to explain the reason for his sentence, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Nov. 3, 2006 (No. 06-7631), we held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. <em>Crud-up </em>mandates a two-step analysis. First, the appellate court must decide whether the sentence is unreasonable, either procedurally \u2014 for example, if the district court gave an inadequate statement of reasons or failed to make a necessary factual finding \u2014 or substantively, which could be the case if the court relied on an improper factor or rejected policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 438 (citing <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the sentence is unreasonable, the appeals court must decide whether it is plainly unreasonable, using the same definition of plain as in \u201cplain error\u201d analysis, that is, \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (quotation and citation omitted). While the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements, statutory requirements, and the factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2000), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Here, the district court did not explicitly state its reason for imposing a sentence of sixty months, the maximum sentence permissible under \u00a7 3583(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the court imposed a sentence within the Chapter 7 advisory policy statement range of 51-60 months. The court\u2019s comments during the hearing reveal its concerns that prior incarceration and drug treatment had not kept Griffin from again selling drugs, and that Griffin\u2019s continued drug activity might cause harm to others. To the extent that the court\u2019s failure to state its reasons for the sixty-month sentence renders the sentence unreasonable, we conclude that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Griffin suggests that the court failed to consider that a five-year sentence is excessive for his offense. However, when imposing a revocation sentence, the district court is not authorized to consider whether the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)) (certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors may not be considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>review of revocation sentence). Griffin also suggests that the court may have imposed the sentence out of a mistaken belief that he still required treatment for drug addiction. However, Griffin\u2019s attorney informed the court that Griffin had overcome his addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The sentence was within the advisory Chapter 7 policy statement range, and Griffin does not claim that the district court failed to consider any pertinent \u00a7 3558(a) factors. Therefore, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">.
