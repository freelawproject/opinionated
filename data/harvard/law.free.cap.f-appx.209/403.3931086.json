He contends that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his sentence was based on facts found by the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence. He also contends that he was sentenced under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The record reflects, however, that Longoria was sentenced under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines scheme, which requires the sentencing court to calculate the guideline range in the same manner as before <em>Booker </em>and to make factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
