He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition to challenge his sentence, and he now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. He argues that he should be permitted to pursue \u00a7 2241 relief in accordance with the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and because he is actually innocent of his sentence. He relies on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in support of his substantive sentencing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">McNairy has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his purported \u00a7 2241 petition was best construed as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Det. Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir. 1990). McNairy likewise has not shown that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
