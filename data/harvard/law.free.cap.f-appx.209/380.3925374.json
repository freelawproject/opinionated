Woldu contends that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because he established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">Woldu does not challenge the denial of his application for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, these issues are waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). Further, the BIA\u2019s determination that Woldu failed to establish past persecution is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-19\">However, in considering Woldu\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution claim, the IJ relied on Woldu\u2019s past treatment in Eritrea to support his determination that there was no basis for Woldu\u2019s alleged fear of future persecution. Further, the IJ and BIA failed to address relevant evidence presented by Woldu to support this claim. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision fails to reflect meaningful consideration of all the relevant and substantial evidence supporting Woldu\u2019s fear of future persecution claim. <em>See Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584-85 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s removal order is VACATED, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. This court does not, however, intimate what conclusion the BIA should reach on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In light of the foregoing, Woldu\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
