The Guideline range of imprisonment was 70 to 87 months. After departing upward one criminal-history category, the district court determined the resulting 84-to-105-month sentencing range was still insufficient and imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>non-Guideline sentence (upward deviation) of 120 months. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In imposing the criminal-history-category upward departure, the district court considered: Thomas\u2019 criminal conduct not counted under the Guidelines; the obscenity charges both dropped and pending against him; his attempt to use a victim\u2019s identity to obtain $50,000 in credit from American Express; the hardships imposed on victims of identity theft; his theft of $50,000 from his mother and the resulting hardship on her; his having been charged with only three counts, despite having committed numerous separate mail-fraud and money-laundering offenses and that he could have been charged with many separate theft offenses under state law; and the likelihood of recidivism based on his criminal history. The district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to depart upward. Its reasons for doing so advanced the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), were authorized by \u00a7 3553(b), and were justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 310 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">With regard to the upward deviation, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Guidelines only advisory), the district court properly calculated the post-departure Guideline range of imprisonment and explained in detail, both orally and in its written reasons for judgment, why it was imposing the sentence. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. The court\u2019s written reasons, as well as those articulated at sentencing, reflect appropriate concern for \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The extent of the upward deviation advances the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2) in that it reflects the seriousness of Thomas\u2019s crimes against the victims, protects the public from further crimes by Thomas, and affords adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A-C). The district court appropriately considered factors that both receive insufficient weight under the Guidelines and reflect the concerns of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (allowing departures for factors not adequately considered by Guidelines). Therefore, the sentence is <em>not </em>unreasonable under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
