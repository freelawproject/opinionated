Gary\u2019s motion for IFP is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Gary brought suit against several employees of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, alleging that he wrongfully was shot in the leg by one of the employees after he began a robbery of the restaurant but \u201cchanged his mind.\u201d Gary also named as defendants several law-enforcement agents; however, he does not appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Even were this court to accept Gary\u2019s assertion that he submitted evidence sufficient to support his claim that the McDonald\u2019s defendants conspired with state actors to protect the employee who shot him from criminal liability, Gary had no federal constitutional right to have the employee criminally prosecuted. <em>See Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir.1990). Gary thus fails to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 583 (5th Cir.1995). The motion for IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Gary previously filed a civil rights complaint that was dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Gary v. Collins, </em>6:91cv530 (E.D.Tex. May 26, 1992). The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as two strikes. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Because he has accumulated three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), Gary is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
