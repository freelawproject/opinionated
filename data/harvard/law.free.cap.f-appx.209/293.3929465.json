He challenges his sentence alleging that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment in calculating his criminal history points and in sentencing him under the mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 233-34, 125 S.Ct. 738. \u201cTo establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred in his sentencing, [a defendant] must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts that he admitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">White argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment in calculating his criminal history points. White does not contest any of the facts of the prior convictions used to calculate his score. Because he alleges factual determinations are essential to the calculation of his criminal history category, he claims his guideline range should be calculated using the lowest criminal history category of I.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">White\u2019s challenge to his criminal history calculation under <em>Booker </em>is unavailing. In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court instructed that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts <em>about </em>a prior conviction that are not evident from \u201cthe conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Here, White does not contest any facts about his prior convictions used to arrive at his criminal history score. Indeed, the district court was not called upon to consider any facts regarding the convictions. Thus, the court\u2019s determination as to the criminal history category did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation when nature and separateness of predicate offenses for career offender status were undisputed); <em>cf. United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 843 (4th Cir.2005) (finding that district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts <em>about </em>prior conviction to determine that it was crime of violence violated Sixth Amendment). Because White\u2019s guideline calculation was based on facts admitted by him and not on judicial fact-finding, his sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">White also makes a summary challenge to his sentence based on the court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. Although there is no Sixth Amendment error in this case, White was sentenced under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, the imposition of a sentence under the mandatory guidelines scheme was error. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 267-68, 125 S.Ct. 738. This court explained that sentencing under a mandatory scheme is \u201ca separate class of error ... distinct from the Sixth Amendment claim that gave rise to the decision in <em>Booker, </em>and it is non-constitutional in nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 553 (4th Cir.2005). The court recognized that \u201c[tjhis error may be asserted even by defendants whose sentences do not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Because White raised a timely <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), objection at sentencing, he has preserved his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, this court reviews White\u2019s claim for harmless error, which places \u201cthe burden ... on the <em>Government </em>to show that such an error did <em>not </em>affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. \u201cThe Government can make such a showing if the sentencing court indicated that it would not have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory (rather than a mandatory) Guidelines regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d 248, 266 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416) (King, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Here, there is no indication that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence had the sentencing guidelines been advisory. We conclude, based on the court\u2019s statements at sentencing, that imposition of White\u2019s sentence under the mandatory guidelines scheme was harmless error. <em>See Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We therefore affirm White\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
