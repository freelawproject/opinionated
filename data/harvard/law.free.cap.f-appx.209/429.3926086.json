United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426 (5th Cir.2005). However, \u201ca \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To proceed under the saving clause of \u00a7 2255, Bell must show that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Bell must make a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has not been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Bell\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim thus does not satisfy the mandates of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Bell\u2019s argument that he is entitled to \u201cmandamus jurisdiction\u201d fails because he has not shown that either the district court or this court had a duty to grant the relief he requests. <em>See In re Stone, </em>118 F.3d 1032, 1034 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
