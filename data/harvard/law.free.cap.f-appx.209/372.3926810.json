He argues the following: (1) the district court\u2019s non-Guideline sentence was plainly erroneous; (2) the charged conduct on which the jury could not reach a verdict should not have been used to determine his sentence; (3) the district court clearly erred in awarding a two-level enhancement pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 for abuse of position of trust; and (4) the district court clearly erred in awarding a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Baker did not object to the district court\u2019s upward deviation, and, therefore, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006). Baker cannot show plain error with regard to the district court\u2019s finding that he committed the charged offenses on which the jury could not reach a verdict because \u201cquestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Furthermore, the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict on counts two and three of the indictment did not prevent the district court from sentencing Baker based on the charged conduct. <em>See United States v. Cathey, </em>259 F.3d 365, 369 (5th Cir.2001). Therefore, the district court did not give significant weight to an improper factor when upwardly deviating, and its reasons for the deviation were not inconsistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Baker has shown no error on the part of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Baker\u2019s suggestion that the district court failed to give adequate reasons for its deviation is inadequately briefed and is therefore waived. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir. 2000). Baker\u2019s argument that the charged conduct on which the jury could not reach a verdict should not have been used to determine his sentence is foreclosed by <em>Cathey, </em>259 F.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">We hold that Baker\u2019s use of a patrol car, or police-type vehicle, to distribute the marijuana was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement. <em>See United States v. Deville, </em>278 F.3d 500, 508 (5th Cir.2002). We further hold that the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Baker perjured himself on the witness stand, thereby warranting a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.4(b)); <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). The enhancements were therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
