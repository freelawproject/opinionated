The district court determined that Dixon\u2019s claims would be properly raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that Dixon could not proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Dixon, through counsel, asserts that his 210-month sentence exceeded the statutory maximum pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He maintains that he is challenging the legality of his detention rather than his conviction because he should have been released from prison in 2000. Dixon also contends that he should be allowed to proceed under the \u00a7 2255 savings clause because <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>are mere extensions of established law, because he is serving time for a nonexistent offense, and because his <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>claims were foreclosed at the time of his direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The district court properly determined that Dixon\u2019s claims should be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Dixon\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause is unavailing in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
