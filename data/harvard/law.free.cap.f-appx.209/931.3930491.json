Huff Asset Management Co., LLC (\u201cHuff\u2019) appeals from the dismissal of Huffs Third Amended Complaint and denial of leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint against Kohlberg Kravis Roberts <em>&amp; </em>Co. and various related entities (collectively, \u201cKKR\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">This case originated in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, in August 1999, when Huff filed an action against KKR on behalf of certain beneficial owners of 10senior subordinated notes issued by Bruno\u2019s (\u201cNotes\u201d), a supermarket chain owner. In the original complaint and its amended successors, Huff repeatedly asserted Alabama state law claims for fraudulent transfer, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and conspiracy. Thereafter, the case had long and torturous procedural history, which gives rise to the present appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During this extended odyssey, Huff has filed three amended complaints and sought leave to file a fourth. The main issue in the case pertained to whether the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77p and 78 bb(f) (\u201cSLUSA\u201d), preempts Huffs state law claims. Any federal claims Huff might have had against KKR expired before Huff filed its first action in August 1999, due to the three-year statute of repose then set forth in SLUSA. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">After much litigation pertaining to amended complaints, bankruptcy, and the preemptive effect of SLUSA, Huff filed a Third Amended Complaint, again asserting only state law claims, which Huff argued were outside the ambit of SLUSA. KKR moved to strike the Third Amended Complaint on the grounds that it failed to adhere to a previous order entered by Judge Karon Bowdre on October 22, 2002, which dismissed Huffs Second Amended Complaint and granted Huff leave to \u201cassert any applicable federal claims it may have under SLUSA.\u201d <em>Huff v. Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1218, 1227 (M.D.Ala.2002). Judge Bowdre then on December 12, 2002 issued an order setting a briefing schedule on the Third Amended Complaint, noting the existence of an \u201cissue of law, namely whether the Notes in Question are \u2018covered securities\u2019 so that the claims involving those Notes are preempted by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.\u201d Briefing on the Third Amended Complaint was completed on April 7, 2003. But in April 2005, before the court had ruled on the Third Amended Complaint, Huff sought leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint decreasing the number of plaintiffs to 46 noteholder clients. This amendment would arguably have removed Huffs claims from the reach of SLUSA, since SLUSA only governs actions filed by 50 or more plaintiffs. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77p(f)(2)(A)(i)(I),(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Judge Virginia Emerson Hopkins, to whom the case had then been assigned, denied Huffs proposed amendment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>February 7, 2006, and simultaneously struck Huff\u2019s Third Amended Complaint. Judge Hopkins held that the state law claims in Huffs Fourth Amended Complaint violated Judge Bowdre\u2019s October 22 order, were untimely, and that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome on KKR and a waste of judicial resources for the court to continue to entertain Huffs attempts to avoid the reach of SLUSA.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Hopkins explicitly reserved decision on whether the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint would fall within the reach of SLUSA and, just as Judge Bowdre had, granted Huff leave to amend in order to \u201cassert any applicable federal claims it may have under SLUSA.\u201d Reiterating that it recognized that it had no such claims, Huff instead moved for reconsideration of Judge Hopkins\u2019 and Judge Bowdre\u2019s orders. The motion was denied, the case dismissed with prejudice, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">From this long procedural history, four issues arise on appeal. Huff argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying Huffs Motion to File a Fourth Amended Complaint; (2) the district court erred as a matter of law in striking Huffs Third Amended Complaint; (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying Huffs motion to reconsider the district court\u2019s 2002 Order finding that Huffs case was a \u201ccovered class action\u201d; and (4) the district court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the case \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d We hold that the district court\u2019s reasons for denying the motion to file the Fourth Amended Complaint constitute an abuse of discretion. Because that complaint, if allowed, would supersede all prior complaints, we need not reach the final three questions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">The district court denied Huffs motion for leave to amend on essentially three grounds<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>: (1) the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint contravened Judge Bowdre\u2019s October 22 order granting leave to amend in order to plead federal causes of action; (2) it would be \u201cunduly burdensome on KKR\u201d and a waste of judicial resources; and (3) Huffs proposed amendment was \u201cuntimely.\u201d We address each in turn, noting that \u201cleave to amend should be liberally granted when necessary in the interest of justice,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), and that \u201cunless there is a substantial reason to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1319 (11th Cir. 1999).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">The first ground on which the district court relied was that \u201cHuffs proposed Fourth Amended Complaint is improper in light of the Court\u2019s holding that SLUSA preempts the state law claims Huff is attempting to assert in the complaint.\u201d The \u201cholding\u201d to which the court referred was Judge Bowdre\u2019s October 2002 Order, which granted Huff leave to plead any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>federal causes of action arising under SLUSA. Judge Bowdre\u2019s order, however, limited Huff to federal claims <em>only if </em>Huff elected to pursue its case based on SLUSA-defined \u201ccovered securities.\u201d This order cannot be interpreted to preclude all state law claims. Indeed, Judge Bowdre recognized the possibility of existing state law claims when on December 12, 2002, she directed the filing of briefs addressing the \u201cissue of law, ... whether the Notes in question are \u2018covered securities\u2019 so that the claims involving those Notes are preempted by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.\u201d The Fourth Amended Complaint would reduce the number of plaintiffs below fifty, thus apparently eliminating any question of whether the case involved \u201ccovered securities.\u201d This would thus remove it from the reach of the federal securities laws and from the ambit of Judge Bowdre\u2019s order. The district court committed an error of law in misinterpreting that order. Its denial of leave to amend based on that error was an abuse of discretion. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 100,116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The second reason on which the district court relied was that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome on KKR and a waste of judicial resources for the court to continue to entertain Huffs attempts to avoid the reach of SLUSA.\u201d This holding was apparently based on the court\u2019s flawed reading of Judge Bowdre\u2019s order, and its correspondingly erroneous conclusion that the Fourth Amended Complaint would be \u201cexclusively comprised of barred claims.\u201d As explained above, the Fourth Amended Complaint contained claims that were not \u201cbarred\u201d by Judge Bowdre\u2019s order. Moreover, we perceive no undue burden on KKR when the litigation \u2014 though long-lived \u2014 had not yet progressed beyond the pleading stage. There has been no discovery, nor a trial date set, and the claims presented in the new complaint do not differ in substance from those raised previously. Nor can we perceive a \u201cwaste of judicial resources\u201d where no federal judges have yet considered the substance of Huffs complaints against KKR, nor has any judge found the Third or Fourth Amended Complaints to be preempted by SLUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">The third reason offered by the district court was the \u201cuntimely\u201d nature of the motion to amend. This, too, is an insufficient reason to deny the motion. Although this case has had an undeniably long procedural history, the delays to which it has been subject have generally been no fault of Huffs. The removals to bankruptcy court, for example, and corresponding stays were beyond Huffs control. The \u201cpassage of time, without anything more, is an insufficient reason to deny leave to amend.\u201d <em>Floyd v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>872 F.2d 1462, 1490 (11th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>499 U.S. 530, 111 S.Ct. 1489, 113 L.Ed.2d 569 (1991); <em>see also Bryant, </em>252 F.3d at 1164 \u2014 65 (where \u201cthe district court did not give any reason, other than the mere passage of time, to support its conclusion that allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint would prejudice the defendant\u201d the court \u201cshould have allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint.\u201d). Moreover, the district court still had not ruled on that Complaint two years later when Huff moved for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Huffs motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. These related entities were affiliated entities of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, certain individuals who were partners in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and officers and/or directors of Bruno's, Inc., and two companies that rendered opinions for Bruno\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\">. In the seven years since the case was originally filed, it has come before five federal judges and a variety of state judges. In its wandering travels, the case has encountered two bankruptcy courts and the Alabama Supreme Court, and numerous motions for dismissal and reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b959-14\">. That period was amended in 2002 to extend the statute of repose period to five years, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(i)(2), but Huff concedes that this amendment does not apply here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. The district court also found that \"Huff's assertion that it is not the real party in interest to this action\u201d represented simply a \"desire to change its tactics\u201d and \"not a sufficient justification for a substitution of parties\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17. It is unclear whether the district court intended this as a separate ground for denying leave to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">. At oral argument before this Court, KKR argued that the Fourth Amended Complaint should be dismissed on other grounds, such as futility and preemption. Because these arguments were not developed and district court did not rely on them, we express no opinion as to their ability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b960-13\">. We review a denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). However, \"a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b961-6\">. While the Third Amended Complaint was pending, parallel litigation in the Alabama state courts <em>(\u201cHuff II\") </em>eventually reached the Alabama Supreme Court, which ruled in April 2004 that Huff\u2019s state law claims against certain underwriters and accountants involved in the Notes' issuance were preempted by SLUSA. <em>BT Secs. Corp. v. W.R. Huff Asset </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number><em>Mgmt. Co., </em>891 So.2d 310, 315-17 (Ala.2004). After the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in Huff II, Huff moved for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint, before the district court had ruled on Huff\u2019s Third Amended Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
