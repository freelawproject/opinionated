He contends that in light 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) the district court erred when it applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b) and imposed a mandatory minimum total offense level of 17. Because Nunez properly raised this issue in the district court, we review <em>de novo </em>that court\u2019s decision of it. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">Statutory law provides that a person convicted of manufacturing, and possession with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants regardless of weight shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 5 years nor more than 40 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(vii). In addition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), sometimes known as the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision, allows relief from a sentence for certain crimes without regard to any statutory minimum, if the specific requirements set out in that statutory provision are met. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">The sentencing guidelines should be applied sequentially. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1(a)-(i); <em>United States v. Houser, </em>70 F.3d 87, 91-92 (11th Cir.1995). Chapter Two of the sentencing guidelines recommend a base-offense level of 16, based on an offense involving between 10 and 20 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), and (c)(12). Under Chapter Three, if a defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, a district court should decrease his offense level by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). In addition, if a defendant qualifies for a two-level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(a), and the government moves for it, a district court may decrease the offense level by one. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">Section 5C1.2 requires a district court to sentence a defendant in certain drug-possession cases, including in the case of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, \u201cwithout regard to any statutory minimum sentence\u201d if the defendant meets five criteria. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). <em>United States v. Fi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number><em>gueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282 (11th Cir. 2000). There is no dispute that Nunez met all five of those criteria. Section 5C1.2(b), however, provides that in the case of a defendant: (1) who meets the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2(a); and (2) for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years, the offense level applicable <em>from Chapters Two </em>(Offense Conduct) and <em>Three </em>(Adjustments) shall be <em>not less than level 17. </em>U.S.S.G.(emphasis added). That is the provision that made the difference in this case and about which Nunez complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The district court did not err in applying \u00a7 5C1.2(b) to set Nunez\u2019s offense level at 17. As we have already said, the district court was required to consult and apply the guidelines in a sequential order. <em>See Houser, </em>70 F.3d at 91-92. Because Nunez not only met all the criteria in \u00a7 5C1.2(a), but he was also a defendant for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence was at least five years, \u00a7 5C1.2(b) did apply. The text of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b) unambiguously instructs that in these circumstances an offense level of no lower than 17 must be set after Chapter Three is applied. The net effect on the final sentence in some cases is the same as disallowing a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, or disallowing any other reduction that would have caused the offense level to fall below 17. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b). That is simply the way the guidelines work, and there is nothing in them that prohibits it.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Nor does 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) prohibit the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b). While that statutory subsection does provide for a safety value to allow for sentencing below the otherwise applicable statutory minimum, it specifically provides for \u201cimpos[ing] a sentence pursuant to the guidelines,\u201d and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b) is part of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
