They argue that the BIA erred in finding that they failed to show 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States and in finding that their removal would not result in extreme hardship to their children and Luis\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), the Attorney General has the authority to cancel removal of inadmissible aliens who show, inter alia, continuous physical presence in the United States for a period of 10 years and where \u201cremoval would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(A) &amp; (D). Because cancellation of removal is governed by \u00a7 1229b, the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) is implicated in the instant case. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-15\">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this title....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)(emphasis added). Because it involved the exercise of discretion, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s hardship determination. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir. 2004). Although review of the BIA\u2019s finding regarding the lack of continuous physical presence is not jurisdictionally barred, all four of the requirements of \u00a7 1229b must be satisfied to qualify for the cancellation of removal. <em>See Berzosa-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>162 Fed.Appx. 275, 279-80 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore decline to consider the petitioners\u2019 challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding on continuous physical presence. To the extent that the petitioners present a constitutional due process argument, this court retains jurisdiction. <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 278 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, as the record reveals that the BIA gave \u201cmeaningful consideration of the relevant substantial evidence\u201d supporting the petitioners\u2019 claims, the petitioners have made no showing that the decision to deny their application for cancellation of removal violated their right to due process. <em>See Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
