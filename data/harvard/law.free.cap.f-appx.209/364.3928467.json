This court recently held that California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) qualifies as an \u201caggravated assault\u201d within the meaning of the comment to \u00a7 2L1.2, and thus it is an enumerated offense. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 412-14 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Robles-Enriquez, </em>194 Fed.Appx. 189, 190-91 (5th Cir.2006). We are bound by precedent, and therefore, the enhancement must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">Franco-Islas also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Franco-Islas\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Franco-Islas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Franco-Islas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">CONVICTION AND JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
