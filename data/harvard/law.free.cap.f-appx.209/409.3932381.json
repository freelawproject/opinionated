Malone argues that the district court erred in not effecting service of process on the defendants who remained in the litigation and against whom he stated an excessive force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-24\">This court may hear appeals only from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>interlocutory decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, nonfinal judgments certified as final under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), or some other nonfinal order or judgment to which an exception applies. <em>Clark v. Johnson, </em>278 F.3d 459, 460 (5th Cir.2002). Jurisdiction over Malone\u2019s appeal does not lie under \u00a7 1291 because the district court\u2019s judgment did not end the litigation on the merits against all parties. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 373-74, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981). Because the district court\u2019s dismissal of Malone\u2019s unexhausted claims and excessive force claims against only certain of the defendants is not \u201ceffectively unreviewable\u201d on appeal, jurisdiction also does not lie under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Finally, jurisdiction does not lie under \u00a7 1292, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1292(a), and the district court did not certify the judgment as final under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); therefore, jurisdiction also cannot rest on that basis. <em>See Clark, </em>278 F.3d at 460. We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain Malone\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
