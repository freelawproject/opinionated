In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ture and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The district court entered its order denying the motion for reduction of sentence on August 11, 2006. Harris filed the notice of appeal on August 31, 2006,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Harris has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> In calculating the file date of his notice of appeal, we have given Harris the benefit of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) and Fed. R.App. P. 4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
