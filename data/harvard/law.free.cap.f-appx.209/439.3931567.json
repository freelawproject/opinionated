Crawford appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-18\">Crawford first argues that his Due Process and Ex Post Facto rights were violated by the application of an advisory guidelines scheme to his case pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As he concedes, this argument, which is reviewed for plain error only, is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-25\">Crawford also contends that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the use of his prior convictions to calculate his sentence. Like Crawford\u2019s first argument, this claim is reviewed for plain error only and, as he concedes, it is foreclosed. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
