He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by 16 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his 1995 Texas conviction for sexual assault of a child under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(c)(1); he argues that the offense was not sexual abuse of a minor because the term \u201cchild\u201d in the Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A) &amp; (c)(1) includes a person younger than 17. As Flores-Morales concedes, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852 n. 3 (5th Cir.2003). In view of this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-08 (5th Cir.2000), Flores-Morales cannot establish that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement was clear or obvious error. <em>See Vega, </em>332 F.3d at 852 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">Flores-Morales challenges \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Flores-Morales\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Flores-Morales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Flores-Morales acknowledges the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>but raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
