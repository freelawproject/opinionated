Lerma contends that the district court violated the law of the case doctrine on remand by again applying the crime of violence sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). He further contends that even if the district court\u2019s ruling was not error, his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">The district court properly considered two different guidelines ranges, with and without the contested sentence enhancement, and determined that the particular facts of Lerma\u2019s case warranted a 48 month sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006). The alternate non-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable considering the \u201ccase-specific factors\u201d cited by the district court. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 528 (5th Cir. 2006). Thus, it is unnecessary to address Lerma\u2019s argument regarding the imposition of the crime-of-violence sentence enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">Lerma also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His eonstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>tional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lerma contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lerma properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, and that he raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
