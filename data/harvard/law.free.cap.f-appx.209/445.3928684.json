Lopez argues for the first time on appeal that the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), renders \u00a7 841(a) &amp; (b) facially unconstitutional because Congress intended drug quantity and type to be a sentencing factor and the statute cannot be rewritten by the courts to correct the alleged unconstitutionality simply by treating drug quantity and type as elements of the offense. She correctly concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). She raises it only to preserve further review by the Supreme Court. We are bound by our precedent absent an intervening Supreme Court decision or a subsequent en banc decision. <em>United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
