Acosta-Licea argues that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(n) based upon his Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. As Acosta-Licea concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 455-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006), and although he argues that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was incorrectly decided, <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Acosta-Licea\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Acosta-Licea contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Acosta-Licea properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
