No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Saldrriaga-Palacio was arrested on a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat carrying 89 bales of cocaine that weighed approximately 2,000 kilograms. He filed a financial affidavit claiming indigence; and the district court appointed a lawyer to represent him. Later, the district court granted a motion by Roy Kahn to substitute himself as Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s privately-retained lawyer. The government then filed a motion requesting a hearing about the source of legal fees paid to Kahn on behalf of Saldrriaga-Palacio. In its motion, the government argued that, because Saldrriaga-Palacio initially claimed to be indigent, the criminal enterprise directing the cocaine delivery for which Saldrriaga-Palacio was arrested might be paying for his lawyer, which would create a conflict of interest requiring Kahn\u2019s disqualification. A magistrate judge granted the government\u2019s motion for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">At the hearing, Kahn explained that a Colombian lawyer contacted him on behalf of Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s \u201cUncle Walter,\u201d who wanted to pay Kahn to represent Saldrriaga-Palacio. The magistrate concluded that Kahn appeared to have a conflict of interest about how he was retained and that his representation of Saldrriaga-Palacio cast doubt on the fairness of the pending legal proceedings. The magistrate disqualified Kahn from representing Saldrriaga-Palacio. Saldrriaga-Palacio appealed the magistrate\u2019s decision to the district court; and while this appeal was pending, he again was assigned a court-appointed lawyer. Before the district court ruled on his appeal of the magistrate\u2019s disqualification order, Saldrriaga-Palacio pleaded guilty to both counts in his indictment without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">On appeal, Saldrriaga-Palacio first argues that the district court abused its discretion in disqualifying his privately-retained lawyer, which denied his Sixth Amendment right to the lawyer of his choice. He contends that his uncle, and not a third-party criminal enterprise, was paying his legal fees to Kahn and that no conflict of interest existed through Kahn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>representation. Saldrriaga-Palaeio also asserts that the district court did not review in a timely manner his appeal of the magistrate\u2019s order disqualifying Kahn.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The government responds that Saldrriaga-Palaeio waived his challenge to the magistrate\u2019s disqualification order when he knowingly and voluntarily entered an unconditional guilty plea. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see also United States v. Patti </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a defendant waived right to appeal denial of motion for a judge\u2019s recusal by entering an unconditional guilty plea). \u201cA defendant who wishes to preserve appellate review of a non-jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty can do so only by entering a \u2018conditional plea\u2019 in accordance with [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 11(a)(2).\u201d <em>Pierre, </em>120 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Here, the record reflects that Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily and that, although his appeal of the magistrate\u2019s order disqualifying Kahn was pending at the time of his guilty plea, Saldrriaga-Palaeio did not enter \u2014 or attempt to enter \u2014 a conditional plea that preserved his right to pursue an appeal of the disqualification order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, by entering an unconditional guilty plea, Saldrriaga-Palaeio waived his appeal of the magistrate\u2019s order disqualifying Kahn; and we will not consider whether Kahn\u2019s disqualification was an abuse of the magistrate\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Saldrriaga-Palaeio next argues that his 210-month sentence was unreasonable. He contends that, because his co-defendants \u2014 with the exception of the captain of the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat \u2014 received 135-month sentences, the district court failed to avoid sentencing disparities in calculating his sentence. Saldrriaga-Palaeio also asserts that the district court did not consider that he (1) was at the lowest level of the smuggling operation, (2) received little compensation for his work on the boat, and (3) was uneducated, poor, young, and unsophisticated. In addition, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable because he was denied the lawyer of his choice at sentencing, when he withdrew an objection to the district court\u2019s application of a sentencing enhancement for firearm possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Saldrriaga-Palaeio was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); so we review his sentence for reasonableness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential\u201d; and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We conclude that Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court sentenced him to the lowest point of his Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">In addition, in sentencing Saldrriaga-Palacio, the district court noted the section 3553(a) factors and commented in particular on Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s age, his educational and work background, and the seriousness of his offense. The district court concluded that the sentence imposed was not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. The district court was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). And we note that not being represented by the defendant\u2019s choice of lawyer is not a section 3553(a) factor. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). Nothing in the record convinces us that Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. Because we conclude that Saldrriaga-Palacio has waived a challenge to the magistrate\u2019s disqualification order, we deny as moot his motion for consideration of sealed documents related to the magistrate\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b978-8\">. We are not persuaded by Saldrriaga-Palacio's arguments that (1) before accepting his guilty plea, the magistrate should have explained that Saldrriaga-Palaeio was waiving his right to appeal the disqualification order and (2) his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was unaware that an unconditional plea waived his right to appeal the disqualification order. Nothing in Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 required the magistrate to inform Saldrriaga-Palaeio about a conditional guilty plea. And we conclude that Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s contention that his court-appointed lawyer had a conflict of interest in representing him \u2014 because this lawyer had a financial interest in remaining Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s counsel and therefore was not motivated to appeal the magistrate\u2019s disqualification order \u2014 is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b979-7\">. The government asserts that, although Saldrriaga-Palacio asked the district court to sentence him below his Guidelines range based on application of the section 3553(a) factors, his failure to object after sentencing\u2014 either that his sentence was unreasonable or that the district court did not consider properly the section 3553(a) factors in determining his sentence \u2014 indicates that we should review Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence only for plain error. We need not decide this issue because, even under a reasonableness standard, Saldrriaga-Palacio\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
