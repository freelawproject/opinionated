Hoffpauir argues the district court erred when it (1) admitted testimony regarding an anonymous letter sent to the Port St. Lucie Police Department (PSLPD), and (2) refused to give a jury instruction on \u201cmere presence.\u201d We affirm her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b996-14\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 732, 163 L.Ed.2d 576 (2005); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction requested by the defense is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dulcio, </em>441 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b996-18\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Admitted Testimony Regarding the Anonymous Letter.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-19\">Hoffpauir argues the admission of Agent Grenier\u2019s testimony that the PSLPD received an anonymous letter reporting a methamphetamine lab at Hoffpauir\u2019s residence violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause. U.S. Const. Amend. VI; <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial hearsay evidence at trial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. <em>Crawford, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1374. The Confrontation Clause does not, however, bar the use of non-hearsay testimonial statements. <em>Id. </em>at 1369 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>The Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Here, Agent Grenier\u2019s testimony regarding the anonymous letter was admitted to explain the reason police obtained a search warrant for Hoffpauir\u2019s residence, and not for the truth of the matter asserted. Such a statement, admitted for the limited purpose of establishing the background of an officer\u2019s actions, is not hearsay. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>741 F.2d 1338, 1340 n. 2 (11th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Vitale, </em>596 F.2d 688, 689 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the evidentiary ruling of the district court was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Refused to Give Defendant\u2019s Proffered Jury Instruction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Hoffpauir next argues the trial court erred in refusing to give her requested jury instruction that her mere presence at the scene of the crime was insufficient to establish she participated in the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The denial of a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction constitutes reversible error if the defendant can show the instruction: \u201c(1) was a correct statement of the law; (2) was not adequately covered in the instructions given to the jury; (3) concerned an issue so substantive that its omission impaired the accused\u2019s ability to present a defense; and (4) dealt with an issue properly before the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1139 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Hoffpauir\u2019s proposed instruction does not meet this test. To convict Hoffpauir of intent to manufacture, the government had to prove she \u201cknowingly and willfully intended to commit the offense of manufacturing methamphetamine.\u201d To convict her of possession of pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, the government had to prove she \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessed pseudoephedrine ... and had the intent to manufacture methamphetamine.\u201d And to convict her of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of methamphetamine, the government had to prove she \u201cknowingly or intentionally possessed methamphetamine ... with the intent to distribute it.\u201d The district court\u2019s jury instructions correctly defined \u201cknowingly\u201d as doing an act \u201cvoluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident.\u201d They also correctly stated that in order to find possession, the jury had to find Hoffpauir either had \u201cdirect physical control\u201d of the substances or the \u201cpower and intention to ... take control.\u201d These instructions are sufficient to preclude conviction for mere presence. <em>See United States v. Rojas, Sr., </em>537 F.2d 216, 219-220 (5th Cir.1976). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give Hoffpauir\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. Hoffpauir's proposed jury instruction read: Mere presence at the scene of a crime and even knowledge that a crime is being committed are not sufficient to establish that a defendant participated in, directed or aided and abetted the crime. You must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was a knowing participant and not merely a knowing spectator.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
