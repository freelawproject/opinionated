This opinion is filed by a quorum of the panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">William Glenn Castevens pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). He was sentenced to forty months in prison. Castevens appealed his sentence, and we affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion. We now grant Castevens\u2019 petition for rehearing and, dispensing with briefing and oral argument, modify our prior opinion in light of <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411 (4th Cir.2006), so as to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Castevens asserts that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. After <em>Booker, </em>we held that treating the guidelines as mandatory was plain error. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215-17 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). We declined to presume prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 217-22, and held that the \u201cprejudice inquiry, therefore, is ... whether after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, ... the judgment was ... substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we held that a defendant who makes an objection at sentencing based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), has preserved his claim of statutory error (mandatory application of the guidelines) under <em>Booker. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 415. The appeals court is obliged to review the claim for harmless error, and the burden is on the government to show that the Booker error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In this case, the district court announced an alternative <em>\u201cBlakely </em>guideline range\u201d of 21-27 months and stated that it would impose a sentence of twenty-four months if that range applied. <em>See White, </em>405 F.3d at 224. Given this alternative sentence, the government cannot show that the error in treating the guidelines as mandatory did not affect Castevens\u2019 substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 223 (noting that substantial rights inquiry is the same under plain or harmless error and that only difference is which party bears burden of proof). We conclude that the government has not proven that Castevens\u2019 substantial rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Accordingly, we vacate Castevens\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing. We leave intact our previous conclusion that Castevens\u2019 placement in criminal history category IV did not violate the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
