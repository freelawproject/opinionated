Ha argues that the district court clearly erred in en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>hancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and that his guilty plea was rendered involuntary when the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We first address Ha\u2019s breach argument, which we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Saling, </em>205 F.3d 764, 766 (5th Cir.2000). In Ha\u2019s plea agreement, the Government retained sole discretion to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, and Ha does not argue that the Government\u2019s refusal to do so was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Bonilla, </em>11 F.3d 45, 46 (5th Cir.1993). Furthermore, the Government\u2019s conduct was not inconsistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>See United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1295 (5th Cir.1994). In light of the foregoing, Ha has not borne his burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 367 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Ha\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, which the Government seeks to enforce and which the record establishes was entered into knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, Ha\u2019s challenge to the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement is barred by his appeal waiver and is dismissed. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
