The Government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Farahkhan\u2019s motion to modify. As the Government notes, \u201c\u00a7 3582(b)(2)(B)\u201d does not exist. A district court may modify the imposed term of imprisonment under limited circumstances. \u00a7 3582(c). Because Farahkhan\u2019s motion did not fall under any of the provisions of \u00a7 3582(c), it was unauthorized and without jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). To the extent that the district court construed the motion as an attempted successive \u00a7 2255 motion, dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was proper because Farahkhan had not received permission from this court to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Farahkhan is hereby warned that any further repetitious or frivolous filings, including those attempting to circumvent statutory restrictions on filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, may result in the imposition of sanctions against him. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
