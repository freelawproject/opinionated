Martinez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government contends that Martinez waived the right to assert this question in his plea agreement. We assume, arguendo only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Martinez contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez concedes as much, but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
