Nunez-Gonzalez\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is denied because Nunez-Gonzalez has not shown \u201ca conflict of interest or other most pressing circumstances or that the interests of justice otherwise require relief of counsel.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Fifth Circuit Plan under the Criminal Justice Act \u00a7 5(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Nunez-Gonzalez argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 37-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Nunez-Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Nunez-Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL DENIED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIR-MANCE GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
