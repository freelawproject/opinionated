He was awarded degenerative disability benefits by the administrator (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of the NFL\u2019s retirement plans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board acknowledged that injuries sustained during his football career had caused Webster eventually to suffer total and permanent mental disability in September 1995, four years after his retirement, but denied him the more lucrative benefits reserved for those whose disabilities begin while they are still actively playing football.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">Webster\u2019s estate sued the retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (2000), claiming that the Board abused its discretion in setting Webster\u2019s total disability date at September 1995. The district court ruled that the Board first abused its discretion by ignoring the unanimous medical evidence that established March 1991 as the onset date for Webster\u2019s total and permanent disability, and second in refusing to toll the Plan\u2019s limitations period for filing a claim for disability. The Plans<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appealed both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>While recognizing that the decisions of a neutral plan administrator are entitled to great deference, we are nevertheless constrained to find on these facts that the Board lacked substantial evidence to justify its denial here. In particular, the Board ignored the unanimous medical evidence, including that of its own expert, disregarded the conclusion of its own appointed investigator, and relied for its determination on factors disallowed by the Plan. Because we also find that Webster\u2019s mental incapacity should have tolled the limitations period, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u201cIron Mike\u201d Webster played center in the National Football League (\u201cNFL\u201d) for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1974 to 1988, collecting four Super Bowl rings during that era. J.A. 628-29. After becoming a free agent, Webster started for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1989 and played as a backup center in 1990 before retiring from active play in March 1991. J.A. 629. In total, Webster played 245 games, the most ever by a center, and at one point played six years without missing a single offensive down. J.A. 622-24. Webster was designated an All-Pro nine times during his career and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Webster endured numerous blows to the head as a center. J.A. 622. The center is the player in the middle of the offensive line and is responsible for snapping the football between his legs to the quarterback to begin each offensive play. Defensive players are permitted to rush at the quarterback as soon as the football is snapped. The center is particularly vulnerable because he must right himself after the snap to protect the quarterback from the oncoming defensive rush. Of particular danger to offensive linemen in Webster\u2019s era was the \u201chead slap\u201d technique, in which defensive linemen would begin their quarterback rush by striking the offensive linemen on the sides of the helmet to daze them. J.A. 676. Though made illegal by an NFL rule change in 1977, use of the head slap and other violent techniques by defensive linemen continued. J.A. 683-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">After playing sixteen years and sustaining multiple concussions, Webster retired from football in March 1991. His remaining eleven years of life were plagued by a series of failed business ventures and stunted career attempts. In fact, the parties agree that none of these attempts at gainful employment succeeded. J.A. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">First, Webster was hired to work as a football analyst for NBC in July 1991. J.A. 629. After auditioning in two preseason games, he moved back to Wisconsin and did not continue this work. J.A. 647. Webster also tried his hand as an investor. In May 1992, for example, he invested in \u201cWebster Asset Management, Ltd.\u201d and in \u201cTerra Firma Development Trust,\u201d which owned real estate in Pittsburgh. J.A. 479, 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Webster made a number of representations about his employment status in 1993 and 1994. For example, he told a doctor in May 1993 that he was working \u201cas a financial investment advisor and real estate manager.\u201d J.A. 266. He told another doctor during a hospital stay in June 1993 that he was running \u201cseveral self-owned business [sic] in Pittsburgh,\u201d J.A. 277, and that he was part-owner of Olympia Steel, J.A. 294. In August 1993, he applied for a credit card, calling himself the manager of Distinctively Lazer for the previous six months and representing that he earned $80, 000 per year. J.A. 458. In September 1993, Webster told a doctor that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was employed full-time. J.A. 264. In October 1993, Webster and two others registered the name \u201cTins, Totes and Tees\u201d for a business to conduct retail sales. J.A. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">It is undisputed, however, that none of these business ventures generated income. Tax records, social security records, and Webster\u2019s own affidavit show that his only income during 1991-1993 consisted of his final payments from the Chiefs in 1991, deferred payments from the Steelers in 1992, and fees of $10,000 for card-signing and appearances in 1992 and 1993. J.A. 704-49. In fact, an associate of Webster\u2019s at Distinctively Lazer told the Board\u2019s investigator, \u201cI think there was something mentally wrong with Mike. His business thinking was very poor.\u201d J.A. 700-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Webster returned to football in 1994 as a strength and conditioning coach for the Chiefs. The Assistant General Manager of the Chiefs indicated that Webster was hired \u201cas a favor\u201d and that he was not \u201cdoing very well during this time period and ... may have been living in his car.\u201d J.A. 699. Webster later averred that as a strength and conditioning coach he had no \u201cspecific coaching duties but was there supposedly to help out if necessary.\u201d J.A. 709. In November 1994, Webster showed up at a friend\u2019s house, stating that he \u201cwas tired of sleeping in his car.\u201d J.A. 652. The friend, citing Webster\u2019s \u201cstrange habits,\u201d allowed him to stay for a few months. J.A. 653. Webster left the coaching position at some point in 1995, having earned a total of about $30,000 from the Chiefs for his services. J.A. 409. Webster\u2019s former teammates told the Board\u2019s investigator that beginning in 1995 through 1997, Webster did not appear well, with some \u201ccharacterizing his behavior as strange or paranoid.\u201d J.A. 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Webster was mostly unemployed after 1995, earning essentially nothing until his death in 2002. The Board\u2019s investigator summarized Webster\u2019s post-retirement history by noting that he found no \u201cevidence that any of [his business ventures] succeeded.\u201d J.A. 519. He concluded, \u201cIt is unclear whether any of these ventures were successful and whether or not Mr. Webster\u2019s health has affected his ability to operate these business ventures.\u201d J.A. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Webster had contacted the Board on five occasions in 1995 and 1996, sometimes only days apart, each time seeking an application for filing a disability claim. J.A. 206-210, 215, 218. Not one of these applications was ever completed. Webster was diagnosed in 1998 with brain damage resulting from multiple head injuries he incurred while playing football. In the spring of 1999, Webster finally completed an application for disability benefits under the NFL retirement plans. We now examine the language of those plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The Plans provide for four types of benefits for players who suffer a total and permanent (\u201cT &amp; P\u201d) disability as a result of football, two of which are relevant here. An applicant may qualify for \u201cActive Football\u201d benefits if \u201cthe disability(ies) results from League football activities, arises while the Player is an Active Player, and causes the Player to be totally and permanently disabled \u2018shortly after\u2019 the disability(ies) first arises.\u201d J.A. 110 (Plan \u00a7 5.1(a)). A lesser benefit, styled \u201cFootball Degenerative,\u201d is available provided that \u201cthe disability(ies) arises out of League football activities, and results in total and permanent disability before the later of (1) age 45, or (2) 12 years after the end of the Player\u2019s last Credited Season.\u201d J.A. 110 (Plan \u00a7 5.1(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Common to both types of benefit, then, is the requirement that an applicant prove that he suffered a T &amp; P disability as a result of playing football. An applicant \u201cwill be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled if the Retirement Board finds that he has become totally disabled to the extent that he is substantially prevented from or substantially unable to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit.\u201d J.A. 111 (Plan \u00a7 5.2). However, \u201c[a] Player will not be considered to be able to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit ... merely because such person is employed by the League <em>or an Employer </em>... <em>oris employed out of benevolence.\u201d </em>Plan \u00a7 5.2 (J.A. 112) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>J.A. 93 (Plan \u00a7 1.13) (defining \u201cEmployer\u201d as \u201ca member Club of the League\u201d). The Board may require an applicant \u201cto submit to an examination by a competent physician or physicians selected by the Retirement Board and may be required to submit to such further examinations as, in the opinion of the Retirement Board, are necessary to make an adequate determination respecting his physical or mental condition.\u201d J.A. 112 (Plan \u00a7 5.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">To be eligible for the higher Active Football benefits, an applicant must also show that he became disabled while an Active Player, which disability became T <em>&amp; </em>P \u201cshortly after\u201d it first arose. Each of these elements is defined further in the Plan. A player remains an \u201cActive Player\u201d upon retirement until the July 15 following his retirement or the first day of the next preseason training camp, whichever is later. <em>See </em>J.A. 91 (Plan \u00a7 1.1). An applicant becomes T &amp; P disabled \u201cshortly after\u201d the disability first arises for purposes of the definition of Active Football benefits according to a three-tiered scheme of presumptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">A player who becomes totally and permanently disabled no later than six months after a disabOity(ies) first arises will be conclusively deemed to have become totally and permanently disabled \u201cshortly after\u201d the disability(ies) first arises, ... and a Player who becomes totally and permanently disabled more than 12 months after a disability(ies) first arises will be conclusively deemed not to have become totally and permanently disabled \u201cshortly after\u201d the disability(ies) first arises____ In cases falling within this six-to twelve-month period, the Retirement Board will have the right and duty to determine whether the \u201cshortly after\u201d standard is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">J.A. 111 (Plan \u00a7 5.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Even if an applicant otherwise would succeed in earning Active Football or Football Degenerative benefits from the onset date of his T &amp; P disability, a limitations provision, added to the Plan and effective for claims received on and after November 1, 1998, may prevent him from recovering certain time-barred benefits. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">[N]o total and permanent disability benefit ... \u25a0 will be payable with respect to any month or other period of time that precedes by more than forty-two (42) months the date the Plan Director first receives a written application or similar letter requesting such benefit, provided that such written application or similar letter begins the administrative process that results in the award of the benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtU\">J.A. 151 (Plan \u00a7 5.7). Section 5.7 also includes a tolling provision, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">The forty-two month limitations period in each of the above sentences will be tolled for any period of time during which such Player is found by the Retirement Board to be physically or mentally incapacitated in a manner that sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>stantially interferes with the filing of such claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Webster applied for Active Football benefits and, in the alternative, Football Degenerative benefits in the spring of 1999. In support of his claim, Webster submitted his post-retirement medical records and the reports of Dr. Fred Krieg, Dr. James Vodvarka, and Dr. Jonathan M. Himmelhoch.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Webster\u2019s medical records revealed that he sought medical treatment for certain physical ailments between March 1991 and September 1995. In late 1992, for example, Webster began to suffer from an \u201cextensive lymphedema,\u201d or fluid collection resulting in swelling, \u201cinvolving both lower extremities.\u201d J.A. 273, 276. In May 1993, a CT scan revealed a likely lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph nodes. J.A. 274-75. Webster checked into a hospital in June 1993 under the care of Dr. Stanley Marks, a hematologist and oncologist. A treatment regimen orchestrated by Dr. Marks led to improvement in Webster\u2019s physical condition over the subsequent several months. J.A. 264, 269-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Webster then saw Dr. Robert Conn, a cardiovascular specialist, for an echocardiogram in January 1994. J.A. 295. Dr. Conn noted in a contemporaneous letter that \u201cMr. Webster is capable of most <em>physical </em>activities that would be relevant to his age and recreational desires.\u201d J.A. 295-96 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Webster followed up with Dr. Marks on September 5, 1996. Dr. Marks noted that Webster\u2019s \u201clife has really deteriorated recently and he is living out of his car. His income has been nominal. He has major problems with depression and obsessive compulsive behavior and is currently being treated with Ritalin and Paxil.\u201d J.A. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Later that day, Webster met with Dr. Jerry Carter, a psychiatrist, because some of his former teammates had \u201cencouraged him to have an evaluation\u201d after Webster was found sleeping in a local train station. Webster told Dr. Carter that he had been living in hotels and in his car for the previous three-and-one-half years. Webster also insisted that he need only overcome his reclusive tendencies and then his mood and ability to function \u201cwould improve considerably.\u201d Webster recounted a tumultuous childhood, a history of low self-esteem, and that he was living only for his periodic visits with his children in Wisconsin. J.A. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Webster then saw Dr. Vodvarka, an osteopath and practitioner of internal medicine, in late 1997. J.A. 300-03. Dr. Vodvarka recognized that Webster might be suffering from post-concussion syndrome. J.A. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">Webster retained an attorney, Mr. Robert P. Fitzsimmons, to assist him in applying for disability benefits. Fitzsimmons referred Webster to Dr. Krieg, a psychologist, to determine whether Webster was disabled. In November 1998, Dr. Krieg diagnosed Webster with brain damage\u2014 that is, dementia resulting from his football-related head traumas. J.A. 227. Dr. Krieg observed that \u201calthough it is [to] Mr. Webster\u2019s advantage to have \u2018done poorly\u2019 on this evaluation, he really tried throughout the interview to make himself look as good as possible, covering up certain information.\u201d J.A. 225. Dr. Krieg concluded that Webster \u201chad become disabled to the extent that he is substantially unable to engage in any occupation or employment at this time.\u201d J.A. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">Webster was reevaluated by Dr. Vodvarka, who opined in an open letter dated March 1999 that Webster \u201cwould have been able to prove total disability at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>time he was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers\u201d because of his dementia and cognitive dysfunction. J.A. 253, 257. Dr. Vodvarka linked Webster\u2019s mental ailments to the head injuries suffered during his years of football, and concluded that Webster \u201cwill never be able to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit.\u201d J.A. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Webster also met with Dr. Himmelhoch, a psychiatrist, in a series of six sessions beginning in March 1999. J.A. 315. Dr. Himmelhoch opined, in a letter to the Plans dated June 22, 1999, that Webster suffered from \u201ctraumatic or punch drunk encephalopathy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d resulting from football, leaving him totally and permanently disabled. J.A. 317-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Finally, Webster submitted an affidavit stating that he had been unable to perform any productive work for the Chiefs during his coaching tenure in 1994 and 1995 because of the crippling nature of his brain damage. J.A. 709. He explained that \u201c[sjince completing my football playing years, I have been unable to obtain or keep any type of meaningful and/or gainful employment because of the problems I have experienced from my brain injury.\u201d J.A. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Responding to Webster\u2019s application, the Board required Webster to be evaluated by a neurologist of its choosing, Dr. Edward Westbrook, on June 21, 1999, pursuant to Plan section 5.2. On a form provided by the Board for his completion, Dr. Westbrook answered the question \u2018When did present disability occur?\u201d with \u201c3/91 or before.\u201d J.A. 362. In an accompanying letter dated October 28, 1999, Dr. West-brook indicated that though Webster offered only a \u201cpoor history,\u201d he was able to determine that Webster was \u201ccompletely and totally disabled.\u201d J.A. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">On the same date that Dr. Westbrook\u2019s report issued, the Board awarded Webster Football Degenerative benefits prospectively without setting an onset date for his T &amp; P disability and tabled Webster\u2019s application for Active Football benefits \u201cto allow [a] neutral physician to review additional medical information and make [a] final report.\u201d J.A. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Webster appealed the decision, which appeal was denied on May 8, 2000 by the Board. J.A. 397-99. First, the Board diminished the significance of its own medical expert\u2019s report because the report only indicated when Webster became disabled, not when he became <em>totally and permanently </em>disabled. Second, the Board discounted Dr. Vodvarka\u2019s assessment that Webster was totally and permanently disabled as of 1988. Because Webster played two more seasons after 1988 with the Chiefs, the Board concluded that Dr. Vodvarka must have misinterpreted the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cT <em>&amp; </em>P disability.\u201d Finally, the Board chided Webster for failing to submit sufficient evidence showing that he did not work from 1991 onward. J.A. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Webster appealed again. This time, to respond to the Board\u2019s concerns, Webster submitted supplemental reports from Drs. Krieg and Himmelhoch, each of whom concluded, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that Webster was totally and permanently disabled as of March 1991. J.A. 580, 608. Webster also submitted a report from Dr. L. Charles Kelly, an osteopath, setting Webster\u2019s T &amp; P disability date at March 1991. J.A. 422-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">To strengthen the appeal, Webster\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Westbrook, the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>neutral physician, to opine as to the onset date of Webster\u2019s T &amp; P disability. Dr. Westbrook wrote to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">It is clear that the patient had significant trouble playing football in 1990 and officially retired in 1991. It would appear on that basis that he was completely and totally disabled as of the date of his retirement and was certainly disabled when he stopped playing football sometime in 1990.... He has remained completely and totally disabled for any occupation beginning in approximately 1990 and will not be expected to improve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">J.A. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Board responded on October 31, 2000, by again requesting additional documentation to prove Webster\u2019s lack of income during the critical 1991 to 1996 period. Webster submitted records from the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers, corroborating his assertion that he earned nothing after his retirement other than his coaching salary from the Chiefs. J.A. 714-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Not satisfied with this response, the Board also hired a private investigator to delve into the details of Webster\u2019s employment history. The investigator found evidence that Webster was nominally involved in various business ventures as detailed above, but concluded that he \u201cwas unable to find any evidence that any of them succeeded.\u201d J.A. 695. While the investigation was underway, Webster died of a heart attack, on September 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The Board finally denied Webster\u2019s application for Active Football benefits on March 17, 2008, and set the onset date for his T &amp; P disability at September 1, 1996. In setting this date, the Board gave the following reasons: (1) Webster\u2019s work as a broadcaster for two games in 1991, his series of failed business ventures from 1992 to 1994, and his work as an assistant coach for the Chiefs in 1994 and 1995 demonstrated his ability \u201cto engage in any occupation ... for remuneration or profit\u201d; and (2) the medical evaluation in 1996 by Dr. Marks stating that Webster\u2019s life \u201chas really deteriorated recently\u201d implies that Webster was not mentally disabled during his 1993 visit to Dr. Marks. J.A. 555. The Board made no reference to either the findings of its own medical expert or the other medical evidence that expressly set the onset date of Webster\u2019s T &amp; P disability at March 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Webster\u2019s estate appealed the Board\u2019s March 2003 decision. In July 2003, the Board affirmed by letter its previous determination, disavowing the medical reports of Dr. Krieg, Dr. Vodvarka, Dr. Himmelhoch, Dr. Kelly, and its own Dr. Westbrook because so much time had passed between 1991 and 1997, when the first of these doctors evaluated Webster for brain damage. J.A. 612-16. Noting that these assessments were not performed \u201ccontemporaneous[ly] with the suggested onset date\u201d of Webster\u2019s T &amp; P disability, the Board deemed such ex post pronouncements as \u201cspeculative and conclusory.\u201d J.A. 614-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The Board also cited for the first time the 42-month limitation provision in Plan section 5.7 that disallows establishment of an onset date for T &amp; P disability earlier than 42 months prior to the filing of the application, unless the applicant\u2019s mental incapacity substantially interfered with the filing of the claim. J.A. 615. Finding that Webster had offered no proof of \u201csubstantial interference,\u201d the Board found that the limitations provision barred the recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of any benefits prior to January 1, 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> J.A. 616. This letter of denial marked the Board\u2019s final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Webster\u2019s estate filed an ERISA complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking money damages and declaratory relief under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and (a)(3). Both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the Plaintiffs motion, but denied the Plans\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In finding that the Board abused its discretion by denying Webster Active Football benefits, the district court noted that \u201c[ejach specialist who examined Webster\u2019s neurological status concluded that he was totally and permanently disabled under the terms of the Plan by March 1991.\u201d <em>Jani v. Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Ret. Plan, </em>No. 04-1606, 2005 WL 1115250, at *6 (D.Md. April 26, 2005). The court further found the lack of diagnosis of mental impairment in 1993 by Dr. Marks, an oncologist, to be insufficient to provide \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to justify denial of Active Football benefits to Webster. <em>Id. </em>The court also cursorily held that because \u2018Webster had been incapacitated by brain damage since 1991, the Plan\u2019s limitations period does not apply to his disability claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The Plans timely appealed, arguing that the Board\u2019s denial of Active Football benefits was a reasoned exercise of discretion supported by substantial evidence and, in the alternative, that the Plan\u2019s limitations provision barred recovery of benefits prior to January 1, 1996. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Because the Plans grant the Board \u201cfull and absolute discretion, authority and power to interpret ... the Plan,\u201d J.A. 121 (Plan \u00a7 8.2), we review the Board\u2019s decision under the deferential abuse of discretion standard<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rather than de novo. <em>See Smith v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>369 F.3d 412, 417 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 111, 109 S.Ct. 948,103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)). The Board\u2019s discretion, however, is not unfettered. Its exercise must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Bernstein v. Capi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>talCare, Inc., </em>70 F.3d 783, 788 (4th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (noting that this definition obtains widely \u201cin varying statutory situations\u201d). It is thus \u201cmore than a mere scintilla,\u201d <em>id., </em>but \u201cless than the weight of the evidence,\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Because a fiduciary must present substantial evidence to justify a denial of benefits, it logically follows that a fiduciary appears to abuse its discretion when, in denying benefits, it ignores unanimous relevant evidence supporting the award of benefits. <em>Cf. Pikulas v. DaimlerChrysler, </em>397 F.Supp.2d 883, 892-93 (E.D.Mich.2005) (finding an abuse of discretion when a fiduciary denied benefits despite the unanimous evidence of three examining doctors agreeing that the claimant was unable to work); <em>Giannone v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>311 F.Supp.2d 168, 177-78 (D.Mass.2004) (finding an abuse of discretion when a fiduciary denied benefits, citing the opinion of a non-examining physician, which was contrary to the unanimous opinion of several treating physicians, the fiduciary\u2019s own investigator, and the claimant\u2019s medical history). Similarly, a plan fiduciary abuses its discretion by crediting a doctor\u2019s earlier, incomplete evaluation but ignoring the same doctor\u2019s later, more comprehensive opinion. <em>Donovan v. Eaton Corp., Long Term Disability Plan, </em>462 F.3d 321, 329 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We have required benefits administrators to follow unanimous evidence in other contexts in which we employ an abuse of discretion standard as well. For example, in <em>Stawls v. Califano, </em>596 F.2d 1209 (4th Cir.1979), a case involving a social security disability benefits claim, the administrator denied the applicant\u2019s claim for T &amp; P disability benefits because it found that she was unable to prove that her T <em>&amp; </em>P disability began prior to 1962 and was continuously present thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. The administrator ignored the medical opinion of one psychiatrist that the applicant\u2019s schizophrenia was indeed continuously disabling, rather than intermittently so, and the medical opinion of another psychiatrist that the disability began prior to 1962. The second psychiatrist, though he had treated the applicant since 1954, had lost his contemporaneous notes. He nevertheless opined in 1976 that the applicant had been disabled prior to 1962. The applicant challenged the denial of benefits in court, and this court ultimately remanded the dispute to the benefits administrator, demanding an explanation for \u201cwhy the uncontradicted evidence of the psychiatrists should not suffice to afford recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, even though the second psychiatrist\u2019s ex post and undocumented opinion might have been less weighty were there conflicting medical opinions, it remained uncontradicted and could not therefore be ignored. <em>See id.; see also Martin v. Sec\u2019y of Dept. of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>492 F.2d 905, 907-08 (4th Cir.1974) (holding in a social security disability benefits case that the mere \u201copinion evidence of the non-examining Social Security doctor\u201d is not \u201csubstantial enough to sustain [a denial of benefits] when (a) the claimant\u2019s subjective evidence of disability, (b) the expert medical opinion of examining physicians, (c) claimant\u2019s vocational history, and (d) the objective medical facts, are all to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Similarly, our jurisprudence under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (2000), allows a claimant to establish total disability by offering uncontradicted reasoned medical evidence. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>e.g., Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c)(4) (1997)). It is only \u201c[i]f the evidence is contradicted [that] we must determine whether the ALJ conducted an appropriate analysis of the evidence to support his conclusion.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>138 F.3d at 529; <em>see also Curry v. Beatrice Pocahontas Coal Co., </em>67 F.3d 517, 521 (4th Cir.1995) (finding that three medical opinions did not constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d sufficient to justify a denial of benefits because the doctors had not opined \u201cwithout equivocation\u201d on the dispositive question \u2014 whether the claimant \u201csuffered] <em>no </em>respiratory or pulmonary impairment of any kind\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">With the foregoing guidance as to what constitutes substantial evidence in mind, we turn to a consideration of the facts on which the Board here based its decision. We do so mindful of the fact that the Board has the discretion to define \u201cT &amp; P disability\u201d in any reasonable and consistent manner. <em>See </em>J.A. 121 (Plan \u00a7 8.2(a)); <em>Booth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>201 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The Plans proffer two principal justifications for the Board\u2019s denial of Active Football benefits. First, the Plans argue that Webster could not possibly have been \u201csubstantially unable to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit,\u201d J.A. 111 (Plan \u00a7 5.2), because he was actually employed between 1991 and 1996. The Plans cite Webster\u2019s stint as a broadcast analyst for two games in 1991, his work as a strength and conditioning coach for the Chiefs in 1994-95, and his ongoing self-employment from 1991 to 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Not one of these ostensible occupations provides substantial evidence that Webster was not \u201csubstantially unable to engage in any ... employment\u201d between 1991 and 1996. First, Webster need only show that he suffered T &amp; P disability \u201cshortly after\u201d his disability first arose upon retirement. Thus, his two-game dalliance ending within six months of retirement does not disprove that he suffered T &amp; P disability \u201cshortly after\u201d retirement. <em>See </em>J.A. 111 (Plan \u00a7 5.1). In any case, the medical evidence suggests that his stunted broadcasting career was in fact merely an audition that failed as a result of his diminished cognitive capabilities. Second, Webster\u2019s coaching position with the Chiefs is excluded from Board consideration by the plain language of the Plan itself. <em>See </em>J.A. 112 (Plan \u00a7 5.2). Section 5.2 provides, \u201cA Player will not be considered to be able to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit ... merely because such person is employed by an Employer,\u201d that is, by a team, \u201cor is employed out of benevolence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Webster was \u201cemployed by an Employer,\u201d and, moreover, was \u201cemployed out of benevolence,\u201d the Plan twice deprives Webster\u2019s brief coaching spell of any conclusive value. Finally, Webster\u2019s occasional representations in the early 1990s that he was gainfully employed and that his various sinecures demanded his \u201cfull-time\u201d attention evaporate in the absence of any evidence to show that Webster ever earned a single dollar from or contributed anything other than his name to these enterprises. \u201c[Ujnable to find any evidence that any of them succeeded,\u201d the Board\u2019s own investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>gator refutes its conclusion that Webster was able to work after retirement. <em>See </em>J.A. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Second, the Plans direct us to the evaluations of Webster by various doctors during the critical period that tended to show he was \u201cgenerally in good health.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 46. Not one of these doctors, however, was either asked, or for that matter was qualified, to comment on Webster\u2019s <em>mental </em>health. That a cardiologist reported, for example, that \u201cWebster is capable of most <em>physical </em>activities that would be relevant to his age and recreational desires\u201d proves nothing regarding the state of Webster\u2019s brain damage at the time. <em>See </em>J.A. 285 (emphasis added). Webster has never argued before the Board, nor does his estate argue now, that he was unable to work because of a <em>physical </em>disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Plans lean heavily on the reports of Dr. Marks in particular to prove that Webster was mentally fit in 1998 and 1994, but by September 1996 had suffered a drastic reduction in mental wellness. In examining Webster for pain in his armpit in 1993, Dr. Marks, a hematologist and oncologist, did not record any observations about Webster\u2019s mental state. However, in 1996, Dr. Marks reported that Webster\u2019s \u201clife has really deteriorated recently.\u201d J.A. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The Plans ask us to infer from this change in scope between Dr. Marks\u2019s two reports that Webster was not T <em>&amp; </em>P disabled by dint of brain damage in 1993. The Plans assert that had Webster in fact been brain damaged in 1993, \u201cnone of the above trained physicians would have missed it.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 46. Similarly, the Plans question the lack of any contemporaneous medical evidence between 1991 and 1996 showing that Webster was brain damaged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">The Board\u2019s own expert, however, opined directly on the question of when Webster\u2019s T &amp; P disability began. Dr. Westbrook wrote to the Board, \u201c[Webster] was completely and totally disabled as of the date of his retirement and was certainly disabled when stopped playing football sometime in 1990.\u201d J.A. 565.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">Thus, the Plans ask us, in short, to do two things: first, to disregard the testimony of the Board\u2019s own medical expert (in addition to <em>all </em>the others) because it was not \u201ccontemporaneous,\u201d a fact of which it had to have been aware when it engaged him, and second, to hold that the <em>absence </em>of contemporaneous evidence is itself \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d As inclined as we are to defer to the Board\u2019s discretion, the law does not permit such a leap of faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">We are not unsympathetic to the Board\u2019s desire to protect Plan assets in the context of claims of mental disability that may be susceptible of misdiagnosis. However, the Board is not without recourse in this situation. As we have discussed, the Plan itself provides the Board with tools to resolve precisely this type of scenario \u2014 an applicant submitting medical evidence that is substantial but which the Board does not find dispositive. The Board availed itself of one such option by enlisting Dr. Westbrook to examine Webster for mental disability. When Dr. Westbrook returned his reports concurring with Webster\u2019s doctors and opining that Webster had become T <em>&amp; </em>P disabled by 1991, the Board was faced with unanimous, albeit ex post, evidence supporting Webster\u2019s claim. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Board still harbored qualms about the strength of Webster\u2019s evidence, it could have easily \u201crequired [him] to submit to such further examinations as, in the opinion of the Retirement Board, are necessary to make an adequate determination respecting his ... mental condition.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 112 (Plan \u00a7 5.2). Instead, the Board truncated its medical investigation and chose to ignore not only the views of Webster\u2019s experts but also that of its own.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In sum, the Board has offered no relevant medical or employment evidence to contradict the unanimous medical opinion of examining experts, even though those opinions were open to challenge. Because these expert opinions at least establish a presumption that Webster is entitled to Active Football benefits, and the Board did not rely on substantial evidence to contradict them, we conclude that the Board abused its discretion in denying Webster Active Football benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Stawls, </em>596 F.2d at 1213 (remanding and demanding an explanation for \u201cwhy the uncontradicted evidence of the psychiatrists should not suffice to afford recovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Plans urge us in the alternative to bar recovery of any benefits that accrued prior to January 1, 1996, pursuant to the Plan limitations provision. Section 5.7 provides that \u201cno total and permanent disability benefit ... will be payable with respect to any month or other period of time that precedes by more than forty-two (42) months\u201d the T <em>&amp; </em>P benefits application date. J.A. 151 (Plan \u00a7 5.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Webster\u2019s estate concedes that Plan section 5.7 applies to his application, but insists that the limitations period should be tolled from March 1991 onward because of Webster\u2019s brain damage. The Plan requires that the limitations period \u201cwill be tolled for any period of time during which such Player is found by the Retirement Board to be physically or mentally incapacitated in a manner that substantially interferes with the filing of such claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the issue before the court is whether the Board abused its discretion in finding that Webster was not \u201cmentally incapacitated in a manner that substantially interfere[d] with the filing of [his] claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The Board is entitled to interpret the terms \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d and \u201csubstantially interferes\u201d in any reasonable manner. <em>See </em>J.A. 121 (Plan \u00a7 8.2(a)); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Booth, </em>201 F.3d at 342. In its letter denying Active Football benefits to Webster, however, the Board did not define either term nor did it explain why the tolling provision should not apply to Webster\u2019s application.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the Board merely relied on the failure of Webster\u2019s attorney to argue expressly for the limitations period to be tolled. <em>See </em>J.A. 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">It would require delicate parsing, however, to decide that the medical and employment evidence that supports a finding of T <em>&amp; </em>P disability on these facts does not also support a finding of mental incapacity that substantially interfered with the filing of Webster\u2019s claim. We cannot hold, then, that any further burden of production lay upon Webster to invoke investigation into whether the tolling provision should apply to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">That is not to say that \u201cmental incapacity\u201d and \u201cmental T &amp; P disability\u201d are coextensive. To equate the terms would, as the Plans warn, render surplusage the words \u201cor mentally\u201d in the provision tolling the limitations period whenever an applicant is \u201cphysically or mentally incapacitated.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 151 (Plan \u00a7 5.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Plans argue instead that there is a higher standard for proving \u201cmental incapacity\u201d than for proving \u201cT <em>&amp; </em>P disability.\u201d To put it differently, the Plans argue that all mentally incapacitated applicants would suffer from a T &amp; P mental disability, but not all applicants suffering from a T <em>&amp; </em>P mental disability would be deemed mentally incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">We need not decide whether one standard is higher or the two are merely different. Instead, we need only recognize that in some cases, an applicant suffering from a mental condition that is T <em>&amp; </em>P disabling would be incapacitated to the extent that his condition \u201csubstantially interferes\u201d with his filing of a claim. Webster\u2019s history presents just such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The Plans point to Webster\u2019s numerous requests for disability applications from the Board in 1995 and 1996 as evidence that he was not mentally incapacitated. These requests, however, were at times submitted only days apart. J.A. 206-210, 215, 218. Not one of these applications was ever completed. Contrary to the Plans\u2019 assertion, these staccato requests weigh significantly <em>in favor </em>of a finding of mental incapacity that \u201csubstantially interfered\u201d with Webster\u2019s ability to file a claim. For the tolling provision to have any meaning, it must extend to protect applicants such as Webster, who was so disabled that he could not even open his own mail, <em>see </em>J.A. 604, let alone complete any of the several benefits applications he requested without first securing significant assistance from an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Moreover, had Webster been successful in returning any one of these applications, even without any supporting documentation, the limitations provision would never have attached to his case. <em>See </em>J.A. 151 (Plan \u00a7 5.7) (calculating the 42-months limitations period backwards from the date the Board \u201cfirst receives a written application or similar letter requesting\u201d the benefit and requiring only that such letter \u201cbegin[] the administrative process that results in the award of the benefit\u201d). The limitations provision was only added to the Plan effective November 1, 1998, a mere six months prior to the date that Webster finally managed to submit an application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Plans finally insist that it would have been illogical for the Board to have found Webster mentally incapacitated from 1991 to 1998 because he was apparently well enough in 1999 to submit an application. This argument has only superficial appeal. The Plans appear to read the word \u201csubstantially\u201d to mean \u201ccompletely\u201d in the phrase \u201cmentally incapacitated in a manner that substantially interferes with the filing of [a] claim.\u201d Such an interpretation cannot be reasonable, however, or the tolling provision would <em>never </em>apply to an applicant who is permanently mentally incapacitated. That is, under the Plans\u2019 interpretation, the fact that an application is <em>ever </em>submitted is evidence that the applicant is not, at that time, suffering from incapacity that \u201csubstantially interferes\u201d with the filing of a claim. Instead, we have held that the Board must interpret the tolling provision to give meaning to each word. <em>See de Nobel, </em>885 F.2d at 1188. The Plans\u2019 suggested reading of the tolling provision is thus unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">At bottom, the evidence of Webster\u2019s brain damage tends to show not only that he was T &amp; P disabled, but that he was \u201cmentally incapacitated in a manner that substantially interfere^]\u201d with the filing of his claim. J.A. 151 (Plan \u00a7 5.7). The Board has not presented substantial evidence on which to deny Webster the protection of the provision tolling the limitations period. We therefore hold that the Board abused its discretion in applying the limitations provision to bar Webster\u2019s claim for Active Football benefits retroactive to March 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The Plans finally ask us to vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Webster\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They advance only one argument on appeal supporting the request \u2014 that attorney\u2019s fees and costs are inappropriate because Jani should not have prevailed on the merits. Because the Plan failed to make any other argument, the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs should be upheld provided that Webster\u2019s estate remains \u201ca prevailing party\u201d on a substantive issue on appeal. <em>See Martin v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., </em>115 F.3d 1201, 1210 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201c[0]nly a prevailing party is entitled to consideration for attorneys\u2019 fees in an ERISA action.\u201d). Webster\u2019s estate has prevailed on appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>we therefore uphold the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Because there is nothing in this record on which to uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Webster\u2019s application for Active Football benefits, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. The NFL enrolls all players in the Bert BelJ/Pete Rozelle NFL Retirement Plan (the \"Plan\u201d) and the NFL Player Supplemental Disability Plan (together, the \"Plans\u201d). J.A. 98 (Plan art. 2). The operative language determining eligibility for benefits is found in the Plan. The NFL Player Supplemental Disability Plan, in contrast, operates to augment the size of benefits awards after eligibility has been established under the Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\">.

The Board\u2019s denial letter referred to January 1, <em>1995 </em>as the retroactivity cutoff date. Presumably, the Board intended to utilize the limitations provision to bar recovery of any benefits prior to January <em>1,1996.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In any case, the parties disagree on which date Webster filed his application for purposes of applying the limitations period. Because we hold that the 42-month rule was tolled here, however, the exact application date is of no moment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">. The Plans seem to argue for an even higher level of deference than that typically afforded ERISA fiduciaries, because of the knowledge and skill required to assess football injuries in particular. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 45 (\"The Board believes that the complexity of the Plan here and the unique medical and occupational issues faced by professional football players present special challenges to a decision maker, and that experience with meeting those challenges is important.\u201d). To be sure, special knowledge is indeed helpful in making benefits determinations in football, as it is in <em>any </em>industry. The deferential abuse of discretion standard obtains in part precisely because courts cannot have expertise in every industry. <em>See Berry v. Ciba-Geigy, </em>761 F.2d 1003, 1006 (4th Cir.1985) (\u201d[T]he standard exists to ensure that administrative responsibility rests with those whose experience is daily and continual, not with judges whose exposure is episodic and occasional.\u201d). That our knowledge of football-related disability pales in comparison to the Board\u2019s knowledge, however, does not militate to bestowing a higher standard than abuse of discretion. Instead, the Board is entitled to the same abuse of discretion review afforded to knowledgeable fiduciaries of any ERISA plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">.

The Board discredited Dr. Westbrook\u2019s opinion setting an onset date for Webster\u2019s TPD, choosing instead to credit only Dr. Westbrook\u2019s earlier opinion that did not provide such a date.

The Plans claim that the Board customarily invokes its right to utilize a neutral physician only to determine <em>whether </em>an applicant is T &amp; P disabled, not <em>when </em>he became T &amp; P disabled. This claim is belied by the record. In eight other cases of T &amp; P disability due to brain damage, the Board appointed a neutral physician to examine the applicants. J.A. 757-808. In every such case in which the neutral physician offered a clear, conclusive assessment of the applicant\u2019s disability, the Board chose to follow that neutral recommendation. <em>Id. </em>In one case in particular, the Board \"based the ... effective date [of disability] on the ... report of the Plan neutral psychiatrist.\u201d J.A. 786-92. Thus, the Plans cannot now escape the uncontradicted opinion of Dr. Westbrook that Webster became T &amp; P disabled by March 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\">. Webster\u2019s estate argues further that the Board abused its discretion because its \"decisionmaking process was [not] reasoned and principled.\u201d <em>See Booth, </em>201 F.3d at 342. Five years and repeated meetings passed between the Board\u2019s initial tabling of Webster\u2019s claim for Active Football benefits and its final decision to reject Webster's last appeal. Webster\u2019s estate insists that the delay arose while the Board was seeking to rationalize its predetermined decision to deny Webster\u2019s claim. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 49. The Plans, on the other hand, cite this time period as evidence of careful deliberation. Because we find that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, we need not endorse either of these characterizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">. In their reply brief, the Plans for the first time propose a definition for \"incapacitated,\u201d declaring that a person is incapacitated only \u201cif 'the mind was so affected as to render him wholly and absolutely incompetent to comprehend and understand the nature of the transaction.' \" Reply Br. at 21 (quoting <em>Ortelere v. Teachers\u2019 Ret Bd., </em>25 N.Y.2d 196, 303 N.Y.S.2d 362, 250 N.E.2d 460, 464 (1969)). This dilatory attempt to cabin the breadth of the term \"incapacitated\u201d is to no avail. First, the Board\u2019s discretion to interpret and define Plan terms does not allow the Plans to contrive ex post interpretations on appeal. Second, the proffered definition renders surplus-age the Plan language \"in a manner that substantially interferes with the filing of such a claim.\u201d That is, if \"incapacitated\" means <em>\u201cabsolute </em>incompetence], \u201d then when the Board finds that an applicant is \"mentally incapacitated,\u201d it would necessarily also find that such incapacity \"substantially interfered] with the filing of [his] claim.\u201d We cannot accept such a definition that would render other Plan language of no moment. <em>See de Nobel v. Vitro Corp., </em>885 F.2d 1180, 1188 (4th Cir.1989) (warning that a benefits decision cannot be reasonable if it \"render[s] some language in the plan documents 'meaningless' <em>\u201d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">. In ERISA actions, a district court has wide latitude in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See \u00a7 1132(g)(1); <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Pettit, </em>164 F.3d 857, 865 (4th Cir. 1998). The district court here found significant that the Board ignored the opinion of its own medical doctor and the \"overwhelming evidence supporting Webster\u2019s claim, ... relying instead on Webster\u2019s oncologist\u201d to make the definitive neurological determination. <em>Jani v. Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Ret. Plan, </em>No. 04-1606, at *3-4 (D.Md. November 7, 2005). Because the district court thus found that the Board\u2019s \"decision indicates culpable conduct, if not bad faith,\u201d it awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Webster\u2019s estate. <em>Id. at </em>*4 \u2014 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
