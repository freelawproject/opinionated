He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on his Texas prior conviction for kidnaping under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, his claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Gonzalez has not shown that the district court\u2019s increase in his offense level based on his prior Texas kidnaping conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 was a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-75 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005); <em>Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 162-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Gonzalez argues that his sentence at the bottom of the applicable advisory sentencing guideline range is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because it is excessive in relation to the seriousness of his offense. Gonzalez\u2019s disagreement with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s assessment of the seriousness of his offense does not establish that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">Gonzalez argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 46-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
