Thompson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Thompson has filed a pro se supplemental brief. In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, 759 </em>F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">The district court entered judgment on April 18, 2005. The notice of appeal was filed on October 5, 2005. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Because Thompson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
