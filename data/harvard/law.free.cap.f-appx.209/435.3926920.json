He argues that the district court erred by increasing his sentence on the basis of facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the district court was not operating under a mandatory guidelines regime when it sentenced Rendon, the district court was authorized to find pertinent sentencing facts. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 516-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Rendon also contends that the district court wrongly considered the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory despite the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This assertion is unsupported by the record. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
