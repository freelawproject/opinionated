He asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him within the advisory guidelines range when similarly-situated defendants receive downward departures for entering early pleas in districts that have fast-track early disposition programs. According to Ramos, the district court\u2019s failure to consider this disparity under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) renders his sentence unreasonable. We recently rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Nov. 13, 2006) (No. 06-7792).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Ramos also asserts that the district court\u2019s failure to specifically address the sentencing disparity issue under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) is reversible error. The district court did not plainly err. When a defendant is sentenced within the properly-calculated guidelines range, we \u201cinfer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finally, Ramos asserts that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision in \u00a7 1326 causes it to be unconstitutional. Ramos\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramos contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
