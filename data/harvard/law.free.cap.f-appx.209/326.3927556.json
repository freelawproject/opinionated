Williams appealed. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting his opinion that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in imposing a twenty-four month sentence. The Government did not file a reply brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Williams did not file a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">We recently held in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), that we review sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>unreasonable.\u201d In this case, Williams\u2019s sentence was not above the statutory maximum of two years of imprisonment, the court considered the Chapter 7 advisory policy statement range, and the court stated a proper basis for sentencing Williams to twenty-four months of imprisonment. <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 437. Specifically the court noted Williams\u2019s poor adjustment to supervised release and his repeated violations. Because Williams\u2019s sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, we find that his sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform Williams, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Williams requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Williams. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
