No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-24\">In February 2004, a United States Coast Guard helicopter intercepted a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat off the coast of Columbia in international waters. The boat was carrying approximately 89 bales \u2014 over 2000 kilograms \u2014 of cocaine. Defendant and three other co-defendant crew members were arrested. One of Defendant\u2019s codefendants was identified as the captain; another was identified as the overseer of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">Defendant pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement. At sentencing, Defendant objected to the failure of the PSI to award him a mitigating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Defendant presented no supporting evidence for a role-reduction at sentencing; nonetheless, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>argued that a minor role adjustment was warranted because he had no ownership interest in the boat or cocaine, he was neither the captain nor the overseer, and he had no control over the amount of cocaine. The district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection; it concluded that Defendant was \u201csimilarly situated to all the others, and his role was critical in being one of the crew members aboard the vessel carrying 2000 kilograms of cocaine. No small amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court clearly erred when it failed to grant him a minor role adjustment. In support of his minor participant argument, Defendant focuses on the fact that he was merely a crewman with no special skills and seeks to highlight the larger roles played by the captain and overseer: two of the other three co-defendants. According to Defendant, he was \u201cnonessential;\u201d his participation was \u201cnegligible and rudimentary\u201d and less than that of the average participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Section 3B 1.2(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines allows for a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the sentencing court determines that the defendant was a minor participant in the offense. A minor participant is a participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5.). In <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999), we set out two measurements that inform the sentencing court\u2019s mitigating-role-in-the-offense determination: (1) the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940. About the first measurement, De <em>Var\u00f3n </em>counsels that \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. About the second measurement, De <em>Var\u00f3n </em>counsels that this relative culpability inquiry includes \u201conly those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first measurement is the most important and, in many cases, may end the inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">\u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d De <em>Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 939. A very substantial amount of drugs was involved. That Defendant was one of only four crew members shepherding such a large drug quantity weighs against a role mitigation. See <em>id. </em>at 943. The district court concluded that Defendant was similarly situated to the other crew members and described his role as \u201ccritical.\u201d Defendant presented no evidence; he failed to show that his culpability was sufficiently distinguishable from other participants to warrant mitigation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court committed no clear error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>in refusing to grant Defendant a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\"> We accept that the boat\u2019s captain played a larger role than that of Defendant; the captain received a role enhancement at sentencing. That the captain merited an upward role adjustment does not mean that the others on the boat were not each average participants in the offense conduct. And, even assuming arguendo that the overseer played a larger role, \u201d[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\" <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
