Rodriguez Calderon argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level adjustment for sophisticated means under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). He argues that printing checks using a computer program available for purchase by anyone at a local office supply store, sending a check in the mail to purchase coins, and walking a check into a financial institution to open an account did not constitute sophisticated means. Even though certain aspects of Rodriguez Calderon\u2019s scheme were not sophisticated, the offense as a whole involved sophisticated means. <em>See United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340 (5th Cir.1996). Rodriguez Calderon has failed to show that the district court erred in imposing a two-level increase based on his use of sophisticated means during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
