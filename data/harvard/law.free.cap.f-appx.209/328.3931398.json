On appeal, Burr argues that the district court erred by accepting the facts as stated by the probation officer in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of the facts as alleged in the PSR. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998) (stating review standard); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 6A1.3 (a) (2005) (noting that a court may consider relevant information in the PSR, outside rules of evidence, as long as \u201cthe information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-21\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
