On appeal, Edinson argues that the district court erred by (1) failing to find that he was entitled to a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), and (2) imposing a sentence that was unreasonable, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After review, we affirm Edinson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">We have \u201clong and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this standard of review remains unchanged. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level decrease if the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role cannot be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. In determining whether a role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">\u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43. We have noted that \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">Based on Edinson\u2019s participation in the transportation of cocaine from Colombia, the district court properly concluded that his role was \u201cessential,\u201d irrespective of the fact that he was not the captain of the vessel in this case. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43. The district court held Edinson accountable only for his own conduct, namely, his involvement with trafficking the 2,500 kilograms of cocaine, which we consider a material factor in determining a minor-role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940, 943. Furthermore, although Edinson alleges that his involvement was minor as compared to the other crew members, he failed to establish that his responsibilities aboard the vessel were less vital to the enterprise than those of other crew members, with the exception of the captain. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940; <em>Boyd, </em>291 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">Sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines system are reviewed for reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Talley,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c\u2018In reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). While the district court must be guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, there is no requirement that the district court engage in a detailed, step-by-step analysis of every factor. \u201c[N]othing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In fact, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Prior to imposing sentence, the district court heard Edinson\u2019s arguments about, <em>inter alia, </em>his remorse, his injury during his arrest, his impoverished background, and his purportedly minor role in relation to his co-defendants. Moreover, the district court specifically stated that in imposing sentence it \u201cconsidered the advisory guidelines, as well as the sentencing factors set forth in Title 18, Section 3553(a)(1), including the nature and circumstances of this offense.\u201d The district court ultimately sentenced Edinson to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the low end of the guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Edinson\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. The district court acknowledged that it considered Edinson\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The district court was not required to explicitly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329, bu` it nevertheless commented on Edinson\u2019s background and history, the seriousness of the offense, the need for deterrence, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the \u201csubstantial quantity of cocaine\u201d involved, all of which are 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)(2). Moreover, while a guidelines-range sentence is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable, and Edinson was sentenced to the low end of the guidelines range. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">We reject Edinson\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because his co-defendants were given lower sentences. While \u00a7 3553(a)(6) speaks of \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d the provision is more concerned with unjustified differences across judges or districts than between co-defendants in a single case. <em>United States v. Boscarino, </em>437 F.3d 634, 638 (7th Cir. 2006). \u201cDisparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001). As we have previously recognized, \u201cto adjust the sentence of a co-defendant in order to cure an apparently unjustified disparity between defendants in an individual case will simply create another, wholly unwarranted disparity between the defendant receiving the adjustment and all similar offenders in other cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1193, 1198 (11th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>In sum, Edinson has failed to show that his 135-month sentence is unreasonable when viewed \u201c \u2018in its entirety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 750 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-8\">. The government contends that Edinson\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence should be reviewed only for plain error because Edinson failed to raise the argument before the district court. We need not decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>this issue, because Edinson\u2019s argument fails under either standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">. Indeed, we note that the record appears to reflect that Edinson\u2019s co-defendants had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>yet been sentenced at the time of Edinson\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
