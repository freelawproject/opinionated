He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he qualifies for relief under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Price asserts that he could not have raised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), on direct appeal because this case was not decided until after he had filed his direct appeal. He also contends that the failure to consider his claim would violate the Suspension Clause or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Section 2255 provides the primary means for collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Id. </em>at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">The Third Circuit discussed and relied on <em>Bailey </em>in affirming Price\u2019s conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Price, </em>76 F.3d 526, 528 (3d Cir.1996). Accordingly, Price has not met his burden to show that he may proceed under the savings clause because the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Price\u2019s assertion that the failure to consider his claim violates due process or the Suspension Clause also lacks merit. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 346-47 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
