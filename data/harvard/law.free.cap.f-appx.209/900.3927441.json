We find no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Blanco was arrested after a Georgia Department of Family and Children Services caseworker and a Hall County, Georgia, Sheriffs Office investigator responded to a referral concerning Lilliana Valdez (\u201cValdez\u201d), a 15-year old woman with whom Blanco was living at the time. When they arrived at Valdez\u2019s reported residence and received no response to persistent knocking, the caseworker and investigator entered the home to ensure the safety of two children, whom the investigator had observed through a window. After entering the residence, the investigator observed a sawed-off shotgun hanging by a nail in the bedroom and a rifle propped against the wall directly below the shotgun. Approximately one and half hours later, Blanco and Valdez returned to the residence, and the investigator arrested Blanco and charged him with cruelty to children and statutory rape. Further investigation revealed that the shotgun and rifle had been stolen in 1999 in Minnesota and that Blanco\u2019s brother was a suspect in the burglary case. Blanco later admitted that his brother had given him the firearms in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Blanco, a Mexican citizen who had entered the country illegally, ultimately pled guilty to the single-count indictment for knowing possession of a sawed-off shotgun by an illegal alien, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5). The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on a total offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI did note certain evidence that could justify a downward departure per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b), as Blanco\u2019s criminal history level might substantially over-represent the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">At the sentencing hearing, Blanco requested a downward departure to a criminal history category of II, based on over-representation of his criminal history. Blanco also presented mitigating evidence pursuant to the section 3553(a) factors; this evidence included his arrival in the U.S. at a young age, his work ethic, his use of the shotgun for rodent control rather than criminal activity, his nonviolent history, and his responsibility for Valdez\u2019s young children. Based on these factors, Blanco requested a 24-month sentence with three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">In denying Blanco\u2019s request for a downward departure and announcing the 37 month sentence, the district court emphasized the dangerous nature of the shotgun and noted that it was punishing Blanco on the weapons charge alone, not for the circumstances surrounding his arrest. The court stated that it \u201cha[d] taken into consideration not only the Guidelines,\u201d but also had \u201ctaken into consideration 3553(a)\u201d and \u201call of the elements set forth there for sentencing\u201d in arriving at what it considered a \u201creasonable sentence ... consistent with other sentencing in this district for similar offenses.\u201d The court recognized\u2014 even \u201cbought,\u201d in part \u2014 Blanco\u2019s arguments, but explained that the purported mitigating factors could not overcome the seriousness of the weapons offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">On appeal, Blanco argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to give weight to certain mitigating factors encompassed in section 3553(a). He contends that this error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>evidenced by the court\u2019s failure to reject specifically Blanco\u2019s arguments based on the section 3553(a) factors and by the court\u2019s heavy reliance on factors \u2014 such as the illegality and inherent dangerousness of the weapon \u2014 already captured by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). As we have noted, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Contrary to Blanco\u2019s assertions, a review of the record shows that the district court in this case properly considered Blanco\u2019s arguments and the section 3553(a) mitigating factors in imposing a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range. The court was not required to analyze and accept or reject each of Blanco\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). As in <em>Scott, </em>the court here recognized Blanco\u2019s arguments concerning his youth and his lack of citizenship. The court also questioned Blanco about his relationship with Valdez and the care of her children, another factor on which Blanco relied. When coupled with the court\u2019s statement that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors, the transcript more than adequately proves proper consideration of section 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>at 1330 (noting that such a \u201cstatement alone is sufficient in post-<em>Booker </em>sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The district court\u2019s reliance on the illegality and dangerous nature of the weapon \u2014 both of which are accounted for in the Guidelines determination \u2014 was not erroneous, as the court did take the section 3553(a) factors into account and was ultimately case-specific. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (11th Cir. 2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable where the court expressly acknowledged that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors and \u201cultimately decided to give considerable weight to the Guidelines in this case\u201d). Thus, Blanco has failed to show that the sentence imposed, which fell within the applicable Guidelines range, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">We conclude that the district court complied with <em>Booker </em>and imposed a reasonable sentence after considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). Blanco\u2019s sentence is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. Blanco received one criminal history point for a 2003 misdemeanor for inadmissibility at entry. He received two points for the statutory rape of Valdez. An additional two points were assessed because Blanco committed the statutory rape offense while on probation for the 2003 charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
