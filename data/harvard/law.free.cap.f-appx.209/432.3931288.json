He argues that the dismissal was erroneous because his complaint alleged a deprivation of property claim under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">Affording the dismissal de novo review, <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (2005), we hold that Robinson is prevented by the <em>ParratP-Hudson</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine from pursuing a confiscation of property claim in federal court because Texas has adequate post-deprivation remedies for the confiscation of prisoner property. <em>See Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 383 (5th Cir.1983). Robinson\u2019s complaint was therefore frivolous and failed to state a claim. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327-29, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-23\">Robinson\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claim and our dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Robinson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
