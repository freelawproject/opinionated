Johnson\u2019s only contention on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir. 2000). Withdrawal of a guilty plea is not a matter of right. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991)). The defendant bears the burden of showing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of his guilty plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). \u201c[A] challenges ... the fairness of the Rule 11 proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992) (en banc). An appropriately conducted Rule 11 proceeding, however, raises a strong presumption that the guilty plea is final and binding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Courts consider six factors in determining whether to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or otherwise involuntary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">(2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence; (3) whether there has been a delay between entry of the plea and filing of the motion; (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of counsel; (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government; and (6) whether withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-15\"><em>Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d at 424 (citing <em>Moore, </em>931 F.2d at 248 (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">With these factors in mind, we have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s decision, and the briefs of the parties on appeal. We conclude that Johnson did not demonstrate a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his guilty plea, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
