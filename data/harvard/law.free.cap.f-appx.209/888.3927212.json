Accordingly, the court concluded that Reliance did not violate the ERISA by terminating Griswell\u2019s benefits pursuant to the exclusion and was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">When addressing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that governed the district court\u2019s disposition.\u201d <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>our review, we must view \u201call facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to [] the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., </em>234 F.3d 501, 507 (11th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is warranted if the evidence shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">On appeal, Griswell argues, among other things, that the district court improvidently granted summary judgment because (1) he did not receive notice of the \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d exclusion because he never received a copy of the insurance policy; (2) Reliance waived the exclusion by initially paying LTD benefits, before it discovered Griswell\u2019s pre-existing condition; and (3) the court misinterpreted the meaning of the phrases \u201ccontributed to\u201d and \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d in the insurance policy. The district court analyzed each of these arguments, as well as the others Griswell asserts in this appeal, in a thorough and well-reasoned 38-page opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The district court concluded that Griswell could not avoid application of the exclusionary provision based on his lack-of-notice argument because Reliance was under no obligation to provide a copy of its policy, which was summarized in a summary plan description (\u201cSPD\u201d). The court noted that it was the responsibility of Gris-well\u2019s employer, who was not a party to this suit, to provide a copy of the SPD and to the extent that the employer had not provided a copy of the SPD, Griswell could not recover against Reliance for the omission. Moreover, the district court, applying our precedent on the matter, rejected Griswell\u2019s waiver argument based on his failure to show voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. <em>Glass v. Omaha Life Ins. Co., </em>33 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir.1994) (defining \u201cwaiver\u201d in the context of the ERISA as the \u201cvoluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known right\u201d). Notably, Reliance did not discover Griswell\u2019s pre-existing condition in a timely manner due in large part to Gris-well\u2019s failure to disclose it on his initial application for benefits. It was only after Reliance, in the course of investigating the claim, sent Griswell a \u201cPre-Existing Condition Questionnaire\u201d that it learned of the 1977 back injury for which Griswell had been treated during the 6-month period just prior to the effective date of his coverage with Reliance. Finally, the district court held that because Griswell was treated for the same conditions and symptoms both during the 6-month \u201clook back\u201d period and as part of his treatment in connection with his disability claim, the plain and unambiguous terms of the \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d provision excluded Griswell from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The district court fully addressed Gris-well\u2019s appellate arguments and he has shown no reversible error in the entry of summary judgment in favor of Reliance based on the \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d exclusion, which plainly bars coverage here.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-12\">. In the district court, Griswell urged the district court to review the denial-of-benefits decision using a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, while in this appeal, he contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>\"heightened arbitrary and capricious\u201d standard controls. <em>See Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1137-38 (discussing standards of review applicable to an ERISA pan\u2019s denial of benefits). Under either standard, we discern no error in the district court's review of the decision to deny Griswell LTD benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
