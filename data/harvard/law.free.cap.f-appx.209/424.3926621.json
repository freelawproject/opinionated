As the district court explained, Burton\u2019s claims that the defendants conspired to violate his constitutional rights in obtaining his state court conviction are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), which held that a prisoner\u2019s lawsuit is barred whenever a judgment in the prisoner\u2019s favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. Burton argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint with prejudice. In <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994), however, we squarely held that it was not error to dismiss a complaint pursuant to <em>Heck </em>with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">We caution Burton that both the district court\u2019s and this court\u2019s dismissals count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d <em>383, 388 </em>(5th Cir.1996). <em>Once </em>Burton accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
