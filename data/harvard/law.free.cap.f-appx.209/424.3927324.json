Albert, </em>No. C05-1762TSZMJB, 1-2 (W.D.Wash. Nov. 5, 2005) (unpublished). This appeal was therefore improvidently docketed as if Johnson were proceeding IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s IFP status is decertified, and the appeal is dismissed. Johnson has 15 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court, should he wish to reinstate his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-21\">IFP DECERTIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
