On appeal, he contends that one of his prior convictions \u2014 a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea to robbery successfully discharged by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>deferred adjudication \u2014 should not have been counted against him. Like the district court, we disagree and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The career-offender provision of section 4B1.1 applies if the defendant has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The guideline refers to section 4B1.2 for a definition of \u201ctwo prior felony convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under section 4B1.2, comment, (n. 1), the term \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d means \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The last clause of the definition does not appear to exclude diversionary dispositions from the ambit of prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As Joshua notes, this issue of law is technically novel in the Fifth Circuit. One of our decisions has assumed, without the point being explicitly raised, that a deferred adjudication that otherwise meets the requirements for a felony conviction under the career offender guideline will be counted. <em>See United States v. </em>Kates, 174 F.3d 580, 584 (5th Cir.1999). Other decisions have held in related sentencing situations that deferred adjudications should be counted as prior felony convictions. <em>United States v. Valdez-Valdez, </em>143 F.3d 196, 201 (5th Cir.1998) (defendant\u2019s guilty plea to a deferred adjudication was a \u201cprior felony\u201d for purposes of the guideline governing illegal-reentry offenses, section 2L1.2); <em>United States v. Cisneros, </em>112 F.3d 1272, 1282 (5th Cir.1997) (deferred adjudication is a \u201cprior conviction\u201d for purposes of the statutory sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Moreover, this court has equated a Texas deferred adjudication with a \u201cprior conviction\u201d in regard to the firearms sentencing guideline, whose interpretation mirrors the guideline in this case. <em>United States v. Stauder, </em>73 F.3d 56, 56-57 (5th Cir.1996). In <em>Stauder, </em>the court noted that although the guideline for firearms offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, used the term \u201cconviction,\u201d it referred specifically to the criminal-history provisions, which include deferred adjudications in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. Similarly in this case, section 4B1.2, comment, (n. 4) incorporates the diversionary-disposition provisions of section 4A1.2. And under that guideline, a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is counted even if a conviction is not formally entered, section 4A1.2(f), because this result \u201creflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\u201d Section 4A1.2, comment. (n.9).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Not only does the direction of our cases, as well as the plain language of the guidelines, support including a deferred adjudication in the career-offender provision, but authorities from other circuits have already arrived at this conclusion. <em>See United States v. Pierce, </em>60 F.3d 886, 892-93 (1st Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>910 F.2d 760, 761 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">For these reasons, we agree with the district court\u2019s interpretation of section 4B1.1 and AFFIRM the sentence. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
