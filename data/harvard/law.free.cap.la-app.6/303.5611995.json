Ency. Law, page 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Vincent vs. M. L. &amp; T. R. R. &amp; S. S. Co., 48 La. Ann. 935, 20 South. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Considering the question as to whether or not the negligence of, the defendant was of such nature as would bar it from pleading contributory negligence and of taking advantage of the' negligence of the plaintiff, this doctrine, insofar as it relates to the negligence of the operators of trains at crossings, is confined to the situation of the place, as where the crossing is in a city or other populous district which the operators of the trains are presumed to know is being constantly used by the public; in ' such cases the operators of trains may well be presumed to be conscious of the probable consequences of the omission of proper precautions and in this manner held to have been wanton or reckless; but in the present instance, the crossing was not in a city or populous district; .it was not a \u201cpublic crossing\u201d in the sense that it was a part of the public road, and the evidence shows that it was seldom used and then only by the employees of the Lee Lumber Company, and we are of the opinion that the defendant, although it did not exercise due precautions and was guilty of negligence in operating its train over the crossing, the situation of the place was not such as to render its omissions wanton or reckless, and to' bar it from taking advantage of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff..</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">For the reasons assigned, it is therefore ordered, adjudged' and decreed that the' former opinion and judgment rendered \u2019 herein be reinstated and made the judg^ ment of this court, and that plaintiff\u2019s demands be rejected at his cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
