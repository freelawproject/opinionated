In the case of Albany Bank against the same defendants the amount claimed is for $500.00, with like interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Through inadvertence the judgment was rendered in this case for the principal amount of $500.00 instead of $1900.00, the amount demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">The judgment will therefore be corrected in reference to the main amount claimed, and, as corrected, will be affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the amount decreed below against defendants for the sum of $500.00 be and is hereby increased to the sum of nineteen hundred ($1900.00) dollars with same rate of interest and attorney\u2019s fees as was decreed below; and as thus amended and corrected the judgment appealed from be affirmed in all other respects. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
