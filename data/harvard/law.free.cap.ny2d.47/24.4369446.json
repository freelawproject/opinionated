The judgments declared the \"Rules with respect to Personal Investments by Employees of the Public Service Commission and Public Service Department\u201d promulgated by the chairman unconstitutional. In essence, those rules prohibit commission employees, their spouses and minor children from owning any interest in certain business concerns whose performance is related, at least in part, to companies regulated by the commission. A limited class of employees and their families are entitled to apply for an exemption from the operation of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The threshold issue presented is whether the authority to promulgate these rules was delegated to the chairman by/ the Legislature. Should that inquiry be answered in the affirmative, the remaining question is whether the exemption procedures contained in the rules articulate objective standards so that an aggrieved employee may seek meaningful judicial review of an adverse determination by the chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The orders of the Appellate Division should be modified. Under the code of ethics for State officers and employees (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 74) and its enabling legislation (Executive Law, \u00a7 74), the Legislature has recognized that the task of implementing and defining the ethical considerations set forth in the statute are to be vested in the person ultimately responsible for the performance of the commission\u2019s functions \u2014its chairman (see Public Service Law, \u00a7 3; 48 NY Jur, Public Utilities, \u00a7 10, p 457). While it is true that an administrative agency possesses no inherent legislative power, it may constitutionally exercise its authority by promulgating rules within the boundaries of its legislative delegation. Those rules prohibiting commission employees and their families from investing in certain companies are well within the legislative delegation and are therefore valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">However, that portion of the rules pertaining to the right of an employee to secure an exemption from their operation vests that decision in the unfettered discretion of the chairman. As presently drafted, this segment of the rules contains no criteria to guide the chairman in determining whether to grant an exemption, thereby circumventing the procedural safeguards available to those applying for an exemption through judicial review. Thus, because of the lack of guidelines any denial of an exemption by the chairman was arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law. Accordingly, the rules may not be applied, in their present form, to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>employees who have heretofore sought an exemption until such time as a valid exemption rule is promulgated or the chairman determines that no exemptions from the operation of the rules are warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Seeking to avoid both actual conflicts of interest and the very appearance of conflicts by employees of the Public Service Commission and Department of Public Service, respondents adopted eight rules governing the personal investments of these employees and their immediate families. The rules prohibit these persons from holding any interest, direct or indirect, in five categories:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 1, companies subject to the jurisdiction of the commission; Rule 2, out-of-State utility companies not subject to the jurisdiction of the commission; Rule 3, manufacturers and suppliers of major electric utility equipment; Rule 4, companies which sell utility fuels; and, Rule 5, suppliers and manufacturers of telephone terminal equipment or specialized communications carriers. Rule 6 authorizes any person employed by the commission before the effective date of the rules to seek an exemption from the operation of Rules 2 through 5 on behalf of himself, his spouse or unemancipated children. Rules 7 and 8 deal with enforcement and violations of Rules 1 through 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Following the effective date of the rules, each of the petitioners sought exemptions. Those requests were initially rejected by the secretary of the commission and then by the chairman upon administrative appeal. These article 78 proceedings ensued. In support of their contentions that the rules are invalid, petitioners argue that the Legislature has not delegated the chairman authority to regulate the outside investments of commission employees and that the promulgation of the rules constituted an administrative usurpation of legislative prerogatives. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Initially we note that, aside from the separation of powers and delegation arguments raised by petitioners, no one contends that the commission does not have a vital interest in regulating the outside investments of its employees (cf. <em>Rapp v Carey </em>44 NY2d 157, 165; <em>Evans v Carey, </em>40 NY2d 1008). The real problem in any of these situations is to strike the delicate balance between the interest of the employee in managing his or her investment portfolio or outside business activities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the interest of the administrative body in promoting the efficiency of the services it must necessarily perform through human agencies. By statute (Executive Law, \u00a7 74, subd 2, par [c]), that determination is vested with the chairman, whose expertise in both the nature of duties of commission employees and the problems inherent in the functioning of the agency render him particularly well suited to accomplish this task. Although the commission is free to strike a different balance, if it so chooses, the approach that has been taken is sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It is fundamental that employees of any State agency must administer the law in accordance with the will of the Legislature, rather than in accordance with their own will or with an eye toward the viability of their investments. They are charged with the duty of administering the law without bias or favoritism and in complete disregard of their own personal interests. The major point of the rules now under attack is to eradicate this possibility by ensuring that such favoritism, however subtle or unconscious that partiality may be, is eliminated. Equally important, there is yet another consideration underlying the administrative judgment. It is not only essential that the commission and its employees in fact avoid basing their decisions on personal financial considerations, it is also critical that they appear to the public to be avoiding that evil. Connotations of favoritism, whether justified or not, inevitably arise where those who regulate have a direct or indirect interest in that which they regulate. Resort to any other path would effectively erode the public\u2019s confidence in its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Irrespective of the wisdom or advisability of the rules, it must be determined whether the chairman was delegated the power to promulgate them by the Legislature. For in the absence of such delegation, the administrative action would constitute an unauthorized exercise of legislative power in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine <em>(Rapp v </em>Carey, 44 NY2d 157, 162, <em>supra; Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641, 646; <em>People ex rel. Ingenito v Warden &amp; Agent of Auburn Prison, </em>267 App Div 295, 299-300, affd 293 NY 803).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> It is elementary that ours is a system in which the governmental powers are distributed among three branches\u2014 the executive, legislative and judicial (NY Const, art III, \u00a7 1; art IV, \u00a7 1; art VI). It is equally obvious that one of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>branches may not arrogate unto itself the powers residing wholly in another branch <em>(Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579). Although oftentimes combining legislative, executive and judicial functions, administrative agencies are but creatures of the Legislature and are possessed only of those powers expressly or impliedly delegated by that body <em>(Finger Lakes Racing Assn. v New York State Racing &amp; Wagering Bd., </em>45 NY2d 471, 480; <em>Matter of City of Utica v Water Pollution Control Bd., </em>5 NY2d 164, 168-169).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">That the Legislature cannot delegate its lawmaking power to an administrative agency is a principle firmly rooted in the system of government ordained by our Constitution. At the same time, however, there is a manifest distinction between the legislative power to be exercised only by that body and an ancillary power to implement the policies enacted into law (see, generally, <em>Martin v State Liq. Auth., </em>43 Misc 2d 682, 686, affd 15 NY2d 707). The cornerstone of administrative law is derived from the principle that the Legislature may declare its will, and after fixing a primary standard, endow administrative agencies with the power to fill in the interstices in the legislative product by prescribing rules and regulations consistent with the enabling legislation (see, e.g., <em>Matter of Bates v Toia, </em>45 NY2d 460, 464; <em>Packer Coll. Inst. v University of State of N. Y., </em>298 NY 184, 189-190). Indeed, the difficulty and complexity of most of these policy determinations mandates that the legislative body be permitted to provide for the implementation of basic policy through the use of specialized agencies concentrating upon one particular problem at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Thus, it is not necessary that the Legislature supply administrative officials with rigid formulas in fields where flexibility in the adaptation of the legislative policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute the very essence of the programs. Rather, the standards prescribed by the Legislature are to be read in light of the conditions in which they are to be applied <em>(Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641, 646, <em>supra; Matter of Sullivan County Harness Racing Assn. v Glasser, </em>30 NY2d 269, 276-277). Indeed, some areas are simply incapable of statutory completion. In the context of this case, it is obvious that even the most prescient of legislative bodies might exhaust its ingenuity in an attempt to proscribe all conflicts of interest only to find that in a particular case it has omitted an area in which the conflict between public obligations and private interests would be particularly egregious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(see <em>Matter of Trustees of Vil. of Saratoga Springs v Saratoga Gas, Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>191 NY 123, 147; <em>Fritz v Gorton, </em>83 Wn 2d 275, app dsmd 417 US 902).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It is necessary, therefore, to examine the purpose of the enabling legislation, its factual background and history to ascertain whether respondents have been delegated the power to promulgate these rules. In enacting the code of ethics (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 74), the Legislature recognized that, inasmuch as improper conflicts of interest \"may arise in so many different forms and under such a variety of circumstances\u201d, it was not only impractical but \"unwise and unjust to proscribe them by statute with inflexible and penal sanctions\u201d (L 1954, ch 696, \u00a7 1). Instead, it chose to couch the code of ethics in broad terms, prescribing the standards for officers and employees of all State agencies. In clear and unmistakable terms, the code declares the public policy of the State \u2014 to prevent even the appearance of the slightest taint of impropriety from infecting the decision-making process in our government. Particularly relevant to the rules promulgated by the chairman is subdivision 2 of section 74 which provides: \"No officer or employee of a state agency * * * should have any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any business or transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of any nature, which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest\u201d (see, also, Public Officers Law, \u00a7 74, subd 3, pars f-i; Public Service Law, \u00a7 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It is evident that in enacting this statutory scheme the Legislature recognized the varying duties and responsibilities of the multitude of State agencies would render it impractical to prescribe a rigid formula applicable to all. It is equally obvious that the statutes were not intended simply as a guide to the conscience of State employees. The provisions of the code of ethics are not merely innocuous platitudes or beneficient bromides relating to the standard of conduct that those charged with the public trust should follow. Were this the case, there would be no provision in the code empowering an agency to remove employees who violate their ethical duties (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 74, subd 4) nor any statute empowering an administrative agency to promulgate rules and regulations consistent with the legislative scheme (Executive Law, \u00a7 74, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>subd 2, par [c]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the Legislature has delegated to the chairman the authority to promulgate rules with respect to conflicts of interest and must decline petitioners\u2019 invitation to prohibit administrative action in an area consistent with the accomplishment of the commission\u2019s ultimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Having concluded that the chairman had authority to promulgate the rules, it is necessary to address petitioners\u2019 contention that the denials of their requests for an exemption from the operation of the rules were arbitrary and capricious. The commission quite properly recognized that comprehensive prophylactic rules, if rigidly enforced without any opportunity for relief in special circumstances, might result in serious injustice to an individual employee without any corresponding public benefit. Although not required to do so, the chairman adopted a policy which provides for individual exemption from the operation of the rules in areas consistent with the public interest. Having chosen to make this procedure available to commission employees, however, the chairman was bound to articulate objective standards against which an ultimate determination could be measured <em>(Matter of Levine v Whalen, </em>39 NY2d 510, 518-519). Inasmuch as there were no standards of that character set forth to guide the chairman in deciding whether to grant an exemption, the denial of petitioners\u2019 applications was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The safeguard against arbitrary administrative action lies in the promulgation of adequate standards in the exemption procedure itself to insure meaningful judicial review should an employee deem himself aggrieved upon the denial of an exemption. Protection of the individual employee against the exercise of arbitrary administrative power demands both procedural safeguards within the agency and outside checks upon the exercise of untrammeled administrative discretion (see CPLR 7803, subd 3). In reviewing applications for exemptions, the sole consideration contained in the rules is whether the holdings of a spouse or child are minimal enough to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>what the commissioner determines to be good cause. The flaw in this procedure lies in the fact that the rules do not provide any objective standards sufficient to invoke judicial review upon the denial of an exemption since there is no way of determining what guides were intended by the agency to govern its decision. While it is certainly not fatal that the decision is left to the discretion of the chairman, an administrative agency is forbidden from exercising its discretionary power without first detailing standards or guides to govern the exercise of that discretion (see <em>Holmes v New York City-Housing Auth., </em>398 F2d 262; cf. <em>Environmental Defense Fund v Ruckelshaus, </em>439 F2d 584, 598; <em>Soglin v Kauffman, </em>418 F2d 163).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">That is not to say, of course, that the chairman must lay down any hard and fast rules with respect to when any exemption would be available. Foisting such an obligation upon the agency would suffer the same infirmity as petitioners\u2019 attempt to bind the chairman\u2019s power to formulate rules in an area which the Legislature itself recognized as incapable of statutory completion. But where, as here, the rules delegate unfettered discretion to the chairman with inadequate safeguards against the exercise of arbitrary power or simple unfairness, a denial of a requested exemption is arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> In sum, Rules 1 through 5 were promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of power by the Legislature and are valid. Inasmuch as the exemption procedure is fatally flawed as presently drafted, however, they may not be enforced against any employee who has heretofore sought to be exempted from their operation. These persons are released from the operation of the rules, however, only until such time as the chairman adopts an exemption provision which comports to the requirements stated herein or until it is determined that no exemption from the requirements of the rules are warranted in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Accordingly, the orders of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur with Chief Judge Cooke.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Orders modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Rules with respect to Personal Investments by Employees of the Department of Public Service and the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Rule 1.
