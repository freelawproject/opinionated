This suit is brought to recover these charges due on May 1, 1912, and May 1,1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\">\u201cThe affidavit of defense avers that the charges imposed by the ordinance of April 19,1901, are unreasonable and void, because they are greatly disproportionate to any expense which could be reasonably and fairly incurred by the plaintiff in the exercise of the police power and that from the facts set forth in the affidavit such reasonable charge would not exceed one-fifth of the amounts charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">\u201cTo this the plaintiff has replied that the question of reasonableness is not open to inquiry in this proceeding, because the defendant has obligated itself by contract to pay to the plaintiff annually one dollar per pole and two dollars and fifty cents per mile of wire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">\u201cThe question presented therefore is, has the defendant so contracted?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">\u201cIt is not necessary to reason this question ab integro, because this case either trains with Cochranton Borough v. Cochranton Telephone Co., 41 Pa. Superior Ct. 146, or with Johnstown Telephone Co. v. Southport Borough, 47 Pa. Superior Ct. 468, and is, therefore, governed by precedent. In the first case the company by its predecessor accepted the provisions of a specified ordinance and agreed thereto. This ordinance fixed the license charges. It was held that this constituted a contract, and that the amount of the charges thus agreed upon was not open to be questioned for unreasonableness. In the latter case, the company agreed to be \u2018governed by all the legal ordinances of a general nature now in force or that may hereafter be enacted.\u2019 There was an ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>previously passed fixing the amount of license charges. It was held that the company had not contracted itself from questioning the reasonableness of the charges. In our case there is no agreement to pay charges ordained by any particular ordinance. It is to pay the charges authorized by law and ordinances now in force. If the charges be unreasonable, they were not authorized by law,' nor were they in force. The charges to be paid are designated as lawful charges. If they are unreasonable they are not lawful. We are of opinion that the case is ruled by the latter case, which is followed in Kittanning Borough v. American Natural Gas Co., 239 Pa. 210, and plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment is therefore refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-4\"><em>Edward P.

Company\u2019s Petition, 203 Pa. 354.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AaC\">October 9, 1916:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b307-3\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ALu\">Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the order of the court below discharging a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The facts as developed by the statement of claim and the affidavit of defense and the law applicable thereto are very clearly and satisfactorily summarized in the opinion filed by Judge Broomall of the court below, which will appear in the report of this case, and fully vindicate the action of the court. We deem it necessary to add but a single suggestion. The affidavit of defense distinctly avers that the defendant had, prior to the institution of this action by the plaintiff, at No. 201 March Term, 1913, of the court below, filed a petition, under the provisions of the Act of April 17, 1905, P. L. 183, for the purpose of having the license fees in question adjusted according to law. The result of that proceeding ought to determine the validity of the charges imposed by the ordinance in question. The specifications of error 'are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The appeal is dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff, but without prejudice, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
