His will was dated September 28,1898. He devised his entire estate in trust for his wife Ann during life or widowhood. At the death or marriage of his wife he provided by Item 5 of his will as follows: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my nephew-Andrew' Woods.....the Coal Bank Farm containing 106 acres and should he die without issue the same shall lapse to,the residue of my estate and be distributed as provided in this will.\u201d After making other bequests and devises he provided as follows: \u201cAll the rest residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatever nature and kind, or wheresoever situate at the death of my wife Ann, I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the same to my nieces and nephews.\u201d He then names ten, including Andrew Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Ann Riley survived her husband and died September 26,1912. Andrew Woods survived her, and at her death entered into possession of the land in dispute and continued in such possession until June 1, 1913, when he died testate and the appellants claim under his will. The appellee claims one-tenth of the land under the residuary clause of John Riley\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The question before ns then is: Did Andrew Woods take merely a life estate under his uncle\u2019s will, or was there vested in him an estate in fee simple?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">As the intent of the testator is the cardinal rule for the construction of a will so we turn to it for guidance. After the death or marriage of his wife he says, \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my nephew, Andrew Woods, the Coal Bank Farm.\u201d Without more this would undoubtedly vest an estate in fee in Andrew Woods. Do the. added words \u201cand should he die without issue the same shall lapse to the residue of my estate\u201d change the quality of the estate, he having survived the widow, which was the time fixed by the testator for the distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the estate ? It will be noted that Andrew Woods was one of the residuary devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The learned court below concedes that \u201cif the will of John Riley had been made before the Act of July 9, 1897, he would probably have held that \u00c1ndrew Woods, having survived Ann Riley, took an absolute estate in fee simple, because he did not die without issue before her who had a life estate.\u201d In this he would be sustained by the authority of Mayer v. Walker, 214 Pa. 410, 444; and Nicholson v. Brown, 238 Pa. 356, 360. The Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 213, provides as .follows: \u201cIn any gift, grant, devise or bequest of real or personal estate the words \u2018die without issue,\u2019 or \u2018die without leaving issue,\u2019 or \u2018have nq issue,\u2019 or any other words which may import either a want or failure of issue of any person in his lifetime, or at the time of his death, or an indefinite failure of his issue, shall be construed to mean a want or failure of issue in the lifetime or at the death of such person, and not indefinite failure of his issue, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the deed, will or other instrument in which such gift, grant,\u2022 devise or bequest is made or contained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In Dilworth v. Schuylkill Land Imp. Co., 219 Pa. 527, 531, it is said: \u201cThe act, therefore, appears to mean that if words are used which in themselves leave it doubtful whether the failure of issue intended is definite or indefinite, they shall mean definite failure of issue, unless something else in the. instrument shows that, they are not so intended.\u201d Where, however, such contrary intention appears from the will, the words shall be construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and give a vested absolute estate and the act does not apply to the use of the words: Siegwarth\u2019s Estate, 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We are of the opinion that the testator intended Andrew Woods to take an estate in fee tail dependent upon his not dying without issue btefore the period of distribution had arrived. He gave the farm to Andrew Woods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>absolutely and added an executory devise over on condition that he died without issue. The clause provides that \u201cthe same shall lapse to the residue of my estate and be distributed as is provided in this will.\u201d He had fixed the period of distribution \u201cat the death or marriage\u201d of his widow and when she died Andrew Woods was alive, and the farm devised to him was not a part of the residuary estate and so could not be distributed \u201cas provided in this will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">The intention of the testator was to give- an absolute estate, conditioned upon the devisee surviving the widow, or the date of her marriage and his not dying without issue before that time. To make an estate, absolute in inception, defeasible by an artificial canon of construction would be contrary to the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We are of the opinion that the Act of 1897 is not applicable to the language used by the testator and that the devisee took an estate in fee simple on the death of the testator\u2019s widow in 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is herewith entered for the defendants below with costs of suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
