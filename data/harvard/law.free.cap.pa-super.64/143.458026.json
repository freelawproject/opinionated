There must be an actual abandonment of matrimonial cohabitation with intent to desert and this must have been wilfully and maliciously persisted in without cause for two years. Separation is not necessarily desertion for it may occur without wilfulness or malice. The learned trial judge reached the conclusion from a consideration of the evidence that the appellant had failed to present a case of wilful and malicious desertion and with that conclusion we agree. Soon after the marriage of the parties the husband took his wife to his parents\u2019 home to live. Immediately afterward his mother left home for an extended visit and the respondent was put in charge of the house. The family consisted of the complainant\u2019s father and brother, the complainant, his wife and their baby which was born about that time. The young wife took care of her baby, managed the household and lived pleasantly until after the return of the' complainant\u2019s mother when her condition commenced to be uncomfortable. Objection was made to having the baby brought down to the dinner table in the evening and the respondent therefore remained in her room with the child at that time. Criticism was made of the manner in which work was done on one occasion and an attitude exhibited by the mother-in-law which created a condition of nervousness and unrest in the respondent who was nursing her baby and engaged in the work of the. house. The following quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tation from the evidence of the complainant\u2019s mother throws light on the situation: \u201cQ.\u2014There was no affection lost between you was there? A.\u2014I don\u2019t think I ought to answer that. I don\u2019t think any mother would have much affection for a girl forced upon her. Do you?\u201d As does also this: \u201cQ.\u2014Didn\u2019t you have a little difficulty with her? A.\u2014Once I did; I told her something\u2014I don\u2019t remember what it was; once only\u2014it didn\u2019t last two minutes. Q.\u2014Do you remember of stamping your foot at her? A.\u2014Yes, I frequently stamped my foot at her. When I wanted anything done, I stamped my foot and said \u2018Go and do it quick.\u2019 \u201d It is not surprising that where the feeling of the complainant\u2019s mother was not of a cordial and affectionate character the respondent would experience discomfort and unrest. In such a state of mind and soon after the criticism of her conduct by the mother-in-law the respondent told her husband that she could not stand the treatment any longer and said to him: \u201cI will either have to stay here and go down with a nervous breakdown or will have to go home.\u201d To which he replied as testified to by the respondent: \u201cJust suit yourself about it.\u201d Thereupon on the 3d of December of the year in which they were married she went to her parents\u2019 home with the baby. Two days afterward the complainant wrote tp her this letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\">\u201c12/5/12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">\u201cMrs. Effie McCampbell,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201c731 Florence Ave.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cAvalon, Pa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cMy Dear Mrs. McCampbell:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cThis is a statement of my willingness to provide the comfortable home and support for you, as heretofore, according to my means. J. H. E. McCampbell,\u201d a copy of which he made and retained. He never communicated with her otherwise after .she left him nor did he call to- see or inquire after Ms child.- In reply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>complainant\u2019s letter tbe respondent sent to him the following :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\">\u201cDecember 11, 1912.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u201cDear Eeid :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cI am willing to live with you in the comfortable home which you speak of in the. letter which you wrote to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cIf you will provide that home I will be glad to go with you wherever it is. But want that home to be separate from our relations. Your wife,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cEfitie MoN. McCAMPBELL,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At5\">but no reply to it was received. The respondent declared her desire to live with her husband in a home of their own and only objected to a residence in a room in the home of his father. No effort was made to procure any other place hor did the complainant take any steps to modify the conditions existing there or to relieve the mind of his wife in regard to the discomfort she experienced. Having the care of her young child and a part at least of the housekeeping to look after she was entitled to consideration from her husband and this she seems not to have had for the letter which he wrote to her creates a strong impression that he was then laying grounds fon the proceeding which he afterward brought. It cannot be considered a communication likely to influence his wife to return to the place which she considered so unsatisfactory. The complainant is a dentist by profession and the evidence shows his income, to be sufficient to maintain a home. His disposition to' assist in maintaining his father\u2019s home is creditable to him but his first obligation is to his wife and child, and it is at least due to her that he make an effort to create a situation which will have a tendency to make their married life happy. A careful examination of the evidence convinces us that complainant has failed to present such evidence as would warrant a decree in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
