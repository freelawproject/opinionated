The money rental was $900 per year. The lease also contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-10\">\u201cIt is understood and agreed further that the City of Pittsburgh is also to pay all taxes or assessments made against said property by the city and make all improvements at its own cost and expense.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-11\">The authority for making said contract is found in the following ordinance or resolution:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-12\">\u201cNo. 121\u2014Resolved, by the Select and Common Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>cils of the City of Pittsburgh, that the lease for all those certain lots or pieces of ground situated corner of Vickroy, Maria and Magee streets in the Sixth Ward of the City of Pittsburgh made by John Bindley, attorney in fact and agent for heirs of Edwin Bindley, deceased, to the City of Pittsburgh at the rate of nine hundred ($900) dollars per annum, for a term of one (1) year, shall be and the same is hereby approved, the payment of said rent to be made from appropriation No. 30, Bureau of Highways and Sewers. In Councils March 18, 1907. Passed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-3\">At M. L. D. No. 68 January Term, 1913, of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, the city filed an assessment of $764.16 against the said premises, in the name of John C. Bindley as owner, for the grading, paving, curbing and changing of grade of Vickroy street. On February 10, 1913, a writ of scire facias was issued upon said lien, and on May 2, 1913, a judgment was entered for $801.46. At M. L. D. No. 21 July Term, 1913, of the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, the city filed a lien against said property in the name of John C. Bindley, as owner, in the sum of $25,\" with interest from November 21,1912, for the construction of a sewer on Seitz street. On May 22, 1913, a writ of scire facias was issued upon said lien, which was served on John A. Fuller, superintendent in possession, being an employee of the defendant, and the premises were posted. On March 31,1915, the plaintiffs paid the amount of said judgment, together with interest thereon, $92,04, and costs, $31.08, and on the same day they paid the amount of said sewer lien, together with interest, $3.54, and costs amounting to $30.10. The total amount of the sums so paid was $983.22. Said payment was made by the plaintiffs under protest and under threat by the defendant that process would be issued for the collection of said claims, and the payment was made for the purpose of preventing a sale of said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">This suit was brought to recover the moneys so paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>upon the ground that the defendant in said lease had undertaken to pay all such claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-3\">The defendant filed an affidavit of defense, in which it alleged three reasons why the plaintiffs could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">First.

Titusville, 175 Pa. 512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">The municipal liens were proceedings in rem and the plaintiffs not only were not bound to set off the damages suffered by them by reason of the city\u2019s breach of the contract in failing to pay the assessments .but they could not do so, there being no such right given by the acts of assembly relating to municipal claims: Scranton v.

These judgments were paid by the plaintiffs without execution, and afterwards they brought this action to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">. The use of the word \u201cassessment\u201d in the foregoing paragraph, included an assessment for grading, paving, curbing^nd construction of sewers: Griffen, Smith &amp; Co. v. Ph\u0153nix Pottery Co., 14 W. N. C. 266; Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v. Von Storch, 196 Pa. 102. It is not synonymous with the word \u201ctaxes\u201d: Pray v. The Northern Liberties, 31 Pa. 69; Pettibone, et al., v. Smith, 150 Pa. 118. Nor was it the intention to use it in such sense in the lease. Council approved the lease by a resolution which is sufficiently clear to identify the lease in question, and such approval embraced all the covenants contained in it. We do not regard the covenant \u201cto pay for all assessments\u201d as a defense by way of a set-off \u00a1in the proceeding by the city on the scire facias for .the sewer assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"ATc\">\u201cThe foundation of set-off\u201d or equitable defense \u201cis the preyention of circuity of action,\u201d and the \u201cgeneral rule is that, cross demands must be between the same persons and in the same rights, so that actions may be maintained thereon each against the other\u201d: Hibert v. Lang, 165 P.a. 439. There must be mutuality of dem\u00e1nd, both as regards the quality of the right and the identity of the parties: Stuart v. Commonwealth, 8 Watts 74. In not every instance where the right of action exists may it be said that the right of set-off will be allowed; ..The.quality of the matter proposed to be set off may be.of.-such character as to be sustainable pnly by separate action. The remedy here provide^ is.stqjmtoix tp.enforce a species, of taxation. It is justified, as., a of public policy. The property owner is permittethonly such defenses am thorized by statute: Scranton v. Jermyn, 156 Pa. 107. It may be, said, generally, as1 to liens of this kind, assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>by tbe municipality, any defense arising directly from tbe subject-matter of tbe improvement will be. allowed. Thus, in assigned claims, damages for the careless or. unskillful manner in which the public improvements are constructed may be set off: Charlton v. Allegheny City, 1 Grant <em>208; </em>Philadelphia, to use, v. Bilyeu, 47 Pa. Superior Ct. 148. Claims for materials may be set off: York City, to use, v. Miller, 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 407. There is a distinction between claims enforced by use-plaintiffs and those sued for by the municipality: Pepper v. Philadelphia, 114 Pa. 96. \u201cIt is almost universally held that in an action for taxes set-off of an indebtedness of the state or municipality to the tax debtor will not be allowed, the statutes of set-offtbeing construed in the light of public policy as not allowing the remedy in proceedings for this purpose, nor is such a claim subject to compensation\u201d: 34 Cyc. 656. The same should be true as to municipal liens for improvements. It can readily be seen how a defense such as here proposed, in a proceeding depending on statute, with an appropriation of funds for a specific amount by a legal body from money usually secured by an issue of bonds as the basis of its action, might involve the city in many collateral questions which would work a great injustice to and seriously interfere with its rights. The city depends on the amount realized from the bonds and the assessments due from property owners to pay for the improvement. This money could not be diverted by The city and it must be if this defense were allowed: Major v. Aldan Borough, 209 Pa. 247; Pittsburgh v. Harrison, 91 Pa. <em>206; </em>Brientnall v. Philadelphia, to use, 103 Pa. 156; Erie City v. Butler, 120 Pa. 374. If the city owed several months\u2019 rent this could not be used as a set-off to a lien for taxes: McCracken v. Elder, 34 Pa. 239; Hopper v. Pittsburgh, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 41, 45: Tagg v. Bowman, 99 Pa. 376-379. Nor should it be to a lien for municipal improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is for a breach of the covenant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the lease. This condition arose when the breach occurred and not before. No right of action existed until they were compelled to pay. A set-off cannot be allowed until the counter right of action has accrued: Pennell v. Grubb, 13 Pa. 551. The city did not violate the contract until it exacted the money from the plaintiffs. The set-off was not complete when the scire facias was sued out.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Considering the questions in the light of public policy, and as affecting an important feature of municipal administration, claims arising from independent transactions for set-off against liens for public improvements sued on by the municipality, should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
