The judgment was entered based on an order granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment regarding a settlement agreement (Agreement) involving attorney fees that contained a standard general release. Defendants contend summary judgment was improperly granted because the Agreement is unenforceable. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants entered into a contract with J.T. Holmes to purchase a home in Lafayette. They waived contingencies under the contract, but discovered prior to close of escrow that there were matters with the house that had not been disclosed. They terminated the contract and sought to recover their deposit of $116,220, but Holmes refused. Their attorney, David Bowie (who also represented them below and in this appeal), negotiated an agreement to recover half of their deposit, or $58,110, but they refused to accept this resolution because they wanted to recover the entire deposit. Bowie declined to represent them for that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, defendants hired the law firm of Morgan Miller Blair (MMB), which represented them for approximately two and a half years in connection with the failed real estate transaction. Defendants made claims against Holmes, including claims for consequential damages, that proceeded to\n   arbitration. Holmes advanced counterclaims, including claims for breach of contract and fraud. MMB represented defendants in the arbitration and in two related lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 24, 2011, as the matters were approaching final resolution, MMB informed defendants that they owed $431,141.92 in unpaid legal fees. MMB provided defendants with a draft settlement agreement, whereby the firm agreed to accept a discounted payment of $331,000 for its legal services. The draft includes an affirmative representation that the parties each had received the advice of independent counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 26, 2011, Robin\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sent MMB revisions to the draft settlement agreement. The revised draft retains the provisions regarding consultation with independent counsel. It also adds a provision stating that \"Clients further contend that Law Firm failed to adhere to the Clients' direction on one or more occasions and further question the Law Firm's handling, strategy and representation of Clients in various ways.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 6, 2011, Robin sent an e-mail to Steven Holland, an MMB attorney who presently is counsel for plaintiff in this matter. The e-mail states: \"My attorney\n   is asking for the original contract we signed with MMB. Do you have that? If so, can you scan and send please.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 17, 2011, Holland sent defendants an e-mail with a revised draft settlement agreement attached. The parties negotiated further revisions to the draft over the following weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 23, 2011, Kris sent an e-mail to Holland stating, in part: \"Robin is still seeking final approval from our attorney which he expects to hear back from tomorrow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 27, 2011, Robin e-mailed Holland stating, in part: \"I am in Florida currently, and have not been able to get feedback to my satisfaction from David Bowie due to his schedule. I am trying to communicate electronically with him today and tomorrow, but do not anticipate being able to close with him until early next week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 28, 2011, the arbitrator in the real estate dispute issued a final arbitration award, awarding Holmes $116,250 on his breach of contract claim, and $75,000 in attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 4, 2011, defendants executed the Agreement. Defendants also submitted substitution of attorney forms, identifying Bowie as their new\n   legal representative. Under the terms of the Agreement, defendants agreed to pay MMB a total of $150,000 in two $75,000 payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Agreement contains mutual general releases. Each party agreed to fully release and discharge the other \"from any and all rights, liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, losses, costs, attorneys' fees and/or expenses ... which they or either of them, respectively, had, now have, or may after the signing of this Agreement have, against such Released Parties based on or arising out of the Dispute, the attorney-client relationship between Clients and Law Firm, and/or any other source, from the beginning of time to the Effective Date of this Agreement.\" The parties also explicitly waived all claims against each other \"whether now known or unknown, and whether now existing or which may result in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties further certified that they had been advised of and understood the provisions of Civil Code section 1542 ( section 1542 ), and agreed to expressly waive its protections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also warranted that, in executing the agreement, they had relied on their attorney of choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 20, 2012, Robin sent an e-mail to Holland stating that he anticipated receiving payment on a project in May, which would allow him to make the first settlement payment. It is undisputed that no payments were ever made. MMB dissolved as a law firm in the summer of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 8, 2016, MMB's assignee, plaintiff Property California SCJLW One Corporation, filed a complaint for breach of contract and to enforce the terms of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 1, 2016, defendants filed their answer to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 18, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication. Plaintiff attached declarations of Holland and Christopher J. Hunter, another former MMB attorney, in support of its motion, as well\n   as a separate statement of undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants filed their opposition on July 5, 2017. They asserted the agreement was unenforceable for lack of consideration because MMB and Holland had committed legal malpractice. Defendants also claimed the Agreement was subject to rescission because their signatures were fraudulently induced, and because MMB and Holland had failed to disclose their own malpractice exposure in violation of their ethical duties and in violation\n   of multiple provisions of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. In their response to plaintiff's statement of facts, they admitted the Agreement had required them to pay MMB $150,000. They also admitted they had failed to make any payments under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With their opposition, defendants attached the declarations of Robin, Kris, Bowie, and Charles A. Koss, an expert witness hired by defendants to \"analyze the legal representation of [defendants] by [MMB in the underlying real estate matter], as well as the facts and circumstances surrounding the apparent execution of a purported Settlement Agreement at the conclusion of the matter.\" Plaintiff filed evidentiary objections to all four declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 19, 2017, the trial court issued a tentative ruling requesting further briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's summary judgment motion was heard on September 13, 2017. Defendants have not provided to this court a reporter's transcript of that hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 13, 2017, the trial court filed its order granting plaintiff's motion. In its ruling, the court sustained several of plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the declarations submitted by defendants, including its objection to the entire declaration of Koss. A judgment for $150,000, plus $81,460.20 in interest, was filed that same day. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)

Plaintiff showed the existence of the Agreement, which provided that MMB agreed to accept $150,000 in settlement of its claim that it was owed in excess of $381,538 for legal services. Plaintiff showed that MMB performed its obligation under the agreement by accepting the compromise in lieu of any other monies claimed due, and by cooperating in the orderly transition to new representation. Plaintiff also provided evidence defendants failed to pay the $150,000 owed to MMB, and that plaintiff has been damaged in this amount.

Because it made this finding, the court concluded that plaintiff's specific\n   objections were moot and did not address them. As to the lack of foundation, the court observed that most of the unidentified documents Koss reviewed appear to have been unverified court filings and/or the declarations of defendants and Bowie, which the court had ruled were largely inadmissible. The court also specifically mentioned two \"startling gaps\" in Koss's opinion: (1) his \"failure to review MMB's invoices and (2) failure to seek out any information concerning defendants' reasons for rejecting the $58,000 settlement offer negotiated by Mr. Bowie, before defendants fired Mr. Bowie and hired MMB to pursue their claims more aggressively.\" We find no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Koss states that he reviewed the pleadings from the arbitration and the related court proceedings, as well as the Agreement and the declarations of Robin, Kris, and Bowie, relying on the representations made in those declarations. As the trial court indicated, he did not review MMB's invoices. Nor does the declaration reflect that he inquired as to why defendants rejected the settlement offer negotiated by Bowie. Koss opines that MMB breached the standard of care because \"it appears the legal and economic realities of the dispute were entirely misanalysed.\" He relates that defendants retained MMB solely because they wished to pursue the recovery of the entire deposit from Holmes, rather than accept half of the deposit as negotiated by Bowie. He then faults MMB for pursuing extensive litigation and by bringing multiple causes of action against Holmes, though Koss does not address whether defendants authorized MMB to pursue this strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants attack the trial court's reasoning, claiming they do not have copies of MMB's invoices,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   merely echoing Koss's conclusion that \"[t]o invoice close to $600,000 in fees for a case worth $58,110 is ludicrous.\" This simplistic view does not satisfactorily address the lower court's finding. For example, the court noted that\n   Koss \"says nothing about MMB successfully defending against the seller's claim for attorney fees; the seller sought approximately $834,000, but was awarded only $75,000.\" Defendants do not dispute this finding and other similar findings, instead arguing that disagreement with an expert's opinion is not grounds for excluding the entire declaration. However, the court was not merely disagreeing with Koss's conclusions. Instead, it was pointing out why Koss's opinions lacked foundation.

(1973)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4446447\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/33/654/#p658\">\n    33 Cal.App.3d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658-659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20269\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The issue here, however, is whether the alleged violation, failing to inform defendants of MMB's malpractice, is sufficient to nullify the Agreement. However, defendants do not cite to any authority holding that failure to comply with the ethical rules entitles a client to rescind a settlement agreement for attorney fees. Moreover, as the trial court recognized, \"[i]t makes no sense to argue that MMB concealed the theoretical possibility of legal malpractice when the release of all claims for any such legal malpractice was the consideration MMB bargained for and received in exchange for accepting less than half the fees [it] had billed defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants also allege on appeal that they were not represented by independent counsel, and were not properly advised by MMB to do so. This allegation flies in the face of the references in the Agreement's drafts and final version to independent counsel, as well as defendants' e-mail representations to Holland during the Agreement's drafting, in which they repeatedly indicated that their attorney (Bowie) was reviewing and revising the drafts. To explain this discrepancy, in his opposition declaration Robin admits he\n   <em>\n    falsely\n   </em>\n   represented that Bowie had redlined the Agreement's drafts: \"I redlined certain items within the Settlement Agreement myself and suggested it was an attorney's request to change the item\n   <em>\n    in order to have the changes accepted\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) Further, it does appear Bowie was representing defendants during this time as he admits that he \"ghost wrote\" an\n   opposition to the petition to confirm the Holmes arbitration award that was filed on October 28, 2011, 11 days prior to the execution of the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if MMB was somehow deficient in informing defendants of their right to independent counsel, a point we need not decide, defendants were obviously aware of their right and, accordingly, suffered no prejudice.\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Margulies, Acting P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Banke, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    We use the defendants' first names for clarity.
