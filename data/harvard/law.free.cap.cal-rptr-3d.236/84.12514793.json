J.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the November 4, 2014 General Election, California voters approved Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and\n   Schools Act (Proposition 47). Proposition 47 reclassified as misdemeanors certain offenses\n   that previously were felonies or \"wobblers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also added Penal Code section 1170.18,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which permits those previously convicted of felony offenses that Proposition 47 reduced to misdemeanors to petition to have such felony convictions resentenced or redesignated as misdemeanors. Section 1170.18 allows those currently serving sentences for Proposition 47 eligible felony convictions to petition to have their sentences recalled and be \"resentenced to a misdemeanor.\" ( \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) It also allows those who have already completed their sentences for Proposition 47 eligible felony convictions to petition to have their convictions \"designated as misdemeanors.\" ( \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (f).) Once an offense is resentenced or redesignated as a misdemeanor it \"shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We granted review in three cases to resolve similar issues concerning Proposition 47's effect on felony-based enhancements in resentencing proceedings under section 1170.18. In\n   <em>\n    People v. Buycks\n   </em>\n   (S231765), we address whether Proposition 47 requires the dismissal of a two-year sentencing enhancement for committing a felony offense while released on bail for an earlier felony offense (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b) ) when that earlier felony offense is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 1170.18. In\n   <em>\n    People v. Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   (S232900), we address whether Proposition 47 requires the dismissal of a one-year sentencing enhancement for having served a prior prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ) when the felony underlying that prior prison term has been reduced to a misdemeanor under section 1170.18. In the third matter,\n   <em>\n    In re Guiomar\n   </em>\n   (S238888), we consider whether Proposition 47 requires the dismissal of a failure to appear for a felony charge under section 1320.5 when the underlying felony has subsequently been reduced to a misdemeanor under the initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We conclude that Proposition 47's mandate that the resentenced or redesignated offense \"be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes\" ( \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k) ) permits defendants to challenge felony-based section 667.5 and 12022.1 enhancements when the underlying felonies have been subsequently resentenced or redesignated as misdemeanors. As explained below, under some circumstances such challenges may be brought in a resentencing procedure under section 1170.18 ; they may also be brought on petition for writ of habeas corpus, in reliance on the retroactivity\n   principle of\n   <em>\n    In re Estrada\n   </em>\n   (1965)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2335643\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/63/740/\">\n    63 Cal.2d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20172\">\n    48 Cal.Rptr. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.2d%20948\">\n    408 P.2d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   ). In the latter\n   instance, relief is limited to judgments that were not final at the time the initiative took effect on November 5, 2014. We further conclude, however, that those convicted under section 1320.5 cannot obtain similar relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant Stevenson Buycks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2013, defendant Stevenson Buycks pleaded guilty to felony possession of narcotics in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a), in case No. BA418285. The trial court ordered Buycks to enroll in a one-year, live-in treatment program in lieu of a prison\n   sentence and released him on his own recognizance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, in December 2013, Buycks was caught shoplifting at a Home Depot, resisted theft-prevention officers who tried to apprehend him, wielded a knife, escaped in a van, and then was chased by police until his van was rammed to a stop by a police car. Buycks had also abandoned his drug treatment program, and, in late December 2013, the trial court sentenced him to three years in state prison based on his earlier conviction for felony possession of narcotics in case No. BA418285.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Regarding his second case involving the Home Depot-related crimes, case No. NA097755, Buycks was charged with two counts of second degree robbery in violation of section 211, one count of petty theft by a person with three prior convictions in violation of section 666, subdivision (a), and one count of evading a police officer in violation of Vehicle Code section 2800.2, subdivision (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because he had committed these new felonies while released on his own recognizance on the earlier felony for possession of narcotics, Buycks was also charged in this second case with an on-bail (or released on own recognizance) enhancement under section 12022.1, subdivision (b). That subdivision provides: \"Any person arrested for a secondary [felony] offense that was alleged to have been committed while that person was released from custody on a primary [felony] offense shall be subject to a penalty enhancement of an additional two years, which shall be served consecutive to any other term imposed by the court.\" (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 28, 2014, Buycks entered a negotiated plea of no contest to a single count of petty theft with a prior, a felony, and evading a police officer, also a felony. He admitted he had committed those offenses while released on his own recognizance in the first felony case (\u00a7 12022.1), and that he had\n   served two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ). He was sentenced that same day to seven years eight months, which included two years for the section 12022.1 enhancement. That judgment became final 60 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the voters approved Proposition 47 in the November 4, 2014 General Election, Buycks successfully petitioned for resentencing in case No. BA418285, with the court granting his request to resentence his narcotics conviction to a misdemeanor in early January 2015. He also successfully petitioned under Proposition 47 for resentencing in his case No. NA097755, with the court granting his request to resentence his petty theft with a prior conviction to a misdemeanor in late January 2015. The resentencing court, however, rejected Buycks' argument that his section 12022.1 enhancement no longer applied because the narcotics offense for which he had been released on bail when he committed his Home Depot-related crimes was no longer a felony because of the passage of Proposition 47. The resentencing court reasoned that, at the time Buycks committed his Home Depot-related felonies, his earlier offense was still a felony and that Proposition 47 did not apply to his section 12022.1 enhancement. In resentencing defendant, the court restructured defendant's sentence to make his conviction for felony evading a police officer as the principal term and imposed a full base term of three years, the maximum possible sentence, plus the enhancements for an aggregate sentence of 7 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Buycks appealed the resentencing in this second case, contending that his section 12022.1 enhancement should not have been reimposed by the resentencing court because\n   the narcotics offense for which he had been released on his own recognizance had been resentenced as a misdemeanor.\n   The Court of Appeal agreed, concluding that when Buycks' Proposition 47 petition was granted in his second case, he was \"subject to a\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   resentencing\" in that case, and the trial court \"was required to reevaluate the applicability of section 12022.1\n   <em>\n    at that time\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We granted review on our own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant Laura Reynoso Valenzuela\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In October 2012, defendant Laura Valenzuela was convicted of the felony of receiving stolen property under section 496 in case No. JCF28616, and she was sentenced to serve a 16-month prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In September 2014, a jury in case No. JCF32712 found Valenzuela guilty of carjacking in violation of section 215, subdivision (a), reckless evasion of a peace officer in violation of Vehicle Code section 2800.2, subdivision (a), and possession of methamphetamine in violation of\n   Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a). Because all three offenses involved a \"felony for which a prison sentence or a sentence of imprisonment in a county jail\" (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ) could be imposed, these new crimes subjected Valenzuela to a prior felony prison term enhancement for her prior conviction in case No. JCF28616, requiring the court to \"impose a one-year term for each prior separate prison term or county jail term imposed ... for any [prior] felony\" (\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   .).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Valenzuela waived her right to a jury trial on her prior felony prison term enhancement allegations under section 667.5, subdivision (b), and the trial court found true an enhancement based on her 2012 receipt of stolen property conviction in case No. JCF28616. As a result, at her sentencing in October 2014, Valenzuela received a one-year consecutive term for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, with a total term of six years eight months in prison. She then filed a notice of appeal concerning this second matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the November 2014 general election, and while her appeal was still pending, Valenzuela successfully petitioned to have her conviction for receipt of stolen property in case No. JCF28616 redesignated as a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Valenzuela contended that the appellate court should reduce her narcotics offense to a misdemeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She further asserted that Proposition 47 required the appellate court to strike her one-year section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior felony prison term enhancement because her 2012 receipt of stolen property conviction in case No. JCF28616 had been reduced to a misdemeanor. The Court of Appeal refused to reduce her narcotics offense to a misdemeanor, stating that she must renew her petition in the trial court, and rejected her argument to strike the enhancement. It noted that at the time Valenzuela was sentenced, her prior conviction was still a felony, and that the purpose of section 667.5 is to punish for recidivist conduct. The Court of Appeal also concluded that nothing in Proposition 47 indicated an intent to retroactively ameliorate the collateral consequences of felonies reduced to misdemeanors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We granted Valenzuela's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Petitioner John Manuel Guiomar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In March 2014, petitioner John Manuel Guiomar pleaded guilty regarding separate\n   incidents in separate case numbers to felony second degree robbery\n   (\u00a7 211), felony burglary (\u00a7 459), and felony possession of a controlled substance ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350 ) in case No. SS130616A. Guiomar also pleaded guilty to the crime of failure to appear ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1320.5 ) while on bail for the felony possession of a controlled substance charge in case No. SS131650A. Under section 1320.5, \"[e]very person who is charged with or convicted of the commission of a felony, who is released from custody on\n   bail, and who in order to evade the process of the court willfully fails to appear as required, is guilty of a felony.\" Guiomar's aggregate sentence for all four cases was six years, with the trial court imposing an eight-month term for his section 1320.5 failure to appear conviction, to run consecutive to the other offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After passage of Proposition 47, Guiomar successfully petitioned for resentencing to reduce both his prior burglary conviction and his prior possession of a controlled substance conviction in case No. SS130616A to misdemeanors. At his May 6, 2015 resentencing hearing, Guiomar was not present but was represented by counsel. Although the resentencing court granted Guiomar's request to reduce both felonies to misdemeanors, it restructured his sentence to again reflect an aggregate sentence of six years by imposing a six-year term for the robbery. The resentencing court did not dismiss the section 1320.5 count for the failure to appear while on a bail for a felony in case No. SS131650A, and it imposed the sentence for that offense as a four-year term concurrent to the term for the other offenses. The clerk's minutes indicate that the trial court resentenced Guiomar \"pursuant to stipulation,\" although it was unclear whether that referred to his original March 2014 plea agreement or a new stipulation entered at the Proposition 47 resentencing. Guiomar unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of his sentence by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the resentencing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Guiomar then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the Court of Appeal, raising sentencing issues and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at his resentencing hearing. That petition was supplemented by his counsel, raising additional sentencing issues. The Court of Appeal issued orders to show cause on both petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court of Appeal rejected Guiomar's claim that the resentencing court lacked jurisdiction to resentence him on counts unaffected by Proposition 47. (\n   <em>\n    In re Guiomar\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456768\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/5/265/#p273\">\n    5 Cal.App.5th 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273-275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20797\">\n    209 Cal.Rptr.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Court of Appeal also rejected his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, concluding that Guiomar was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to object to the restructuring of Guiomar's sentence to impose the same six-year aggregate term because these resentencing decisions were within the court's discretion. The Court of Appeal further held that the reimposition of the section 1320.5 conviction\n   was proper because, at the time of his failure to appear, Guiomar was charged with a felony, notwithstanding the fact that the felony was ultimately reduced to a misdemeanor conviction under Proposition 47. (\n   <em>\n    In re Guiomar\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 275-277,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20797\">\n    209 Cal.Rptr.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We granted Guiomar's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addressing Proposition 47's collateral effect on enhancements and offenses attached to convictions reduced to misdemeanors, we proceed as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, we will consider the terms of and intent behind the pertinent provisions\n   of Proposition 47, including the significance of Proposition 47's mandate that the felonies reduced\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   under its provisions \"shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) From this, we conclude that the \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" provision operates prospectively-by having ameliorative effect on any new collateral consequence imposed after a successful Proposition 47 resentencing. However, because Proposition 47 is a measure designed to ameliorate punishment, the \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" language also requires felony-based section 667.5 and 12022.1 enhancements to be retroactively stricken, but only with regard to judgments\n   that were not final at the time the initiative took effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, we will examine the Attorney General's various arguments contending that Proposition 47 cannot upset felony-based enhancements already imposed, notwithstanding the fact that the underlying felony offense had been reduced to a misdemeanor under the proposition. This review leads us to conclude that Buycks and Valenzuela are entitled to relief under the initiative, but that Guiomar is not, because a section 1320.5 offense is not premised on the conviction status of the felony for which the defendant failed to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Provisions of Proposition 47\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As previously discussed, at the November 4, 2014 General Election, California voters approved Proposition 47. The measure amended portions of the Health and Safety Code and the Penal Code to reclassify certain drug possession and theft-related offenses from felonies or wobblers to misdemeanors, with limited exceptions for those offenders having certain prior convictions that are not relevant in the present matters. ( \u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).) The measure also added sections to the Government Code that assessed the annual savings generated from the act and invested those savings in various crime prevention and treatment programs. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7599 - 7599.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In addition to its reclassification of certain felonies to misdemeanors, Proposition 47 created procedures to ameliorate convictions for those currently serving a sentence for a qualifying felony, as well as those who have completed their sentences for a qualifying felony, regardless of whether those judgments are final. ( \u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (f).) These provisions are expressly retroactive in their effect by permitting persons \"who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under\" the measure had it \"been in effect at the time of the offense\" to petition to seek relief. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) For those currently serving a sentence for a qualifying felony, Proposition 47 contains a discretionary component under which the resentencing court must assess whether \"resentencing the petitioner\n   would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) For those who have completed their sentences for a qualifying felony, the resentencing court, upon receiving an application from a person with a qualifying felony conviction, \"shall designate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (g).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although no provision enacted by Proposition 47 expressly addresses whether the measure has any mitigating effect on felony-based enhancements or a felony failure to appear in which the underlying felony is reduced to a misdemeanor, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), which was enacted by that initiative, is relevant to the issue. That subdivision states, in relevant part, that a \"felony conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, uncodified sections of Proposition 47 informed voters that the act \"shall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,\" and that its\n   provisions \"shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18, p. 74 (Voter Information Guide).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proposition 47 Mitigates the Collateral Consequences of Felony Convictions Reduced to a Misdemeanor for All Purposes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Proposition 47 enabled the two defendants and the single petitioner in these consolidated matters to petition to have their various narcotics offenses and larceny-related convictions to be retroactively reduced to misdemeanors. As described above, all three successfully did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At issue, in all three of these cases, are the collateral consequences of the reduction received under Proposition 47 on each subsequent offense at issue. Our courts have characterized \"the possibility of increased punishment in the event of a subsequent conviction\" as \"a collateral consequence.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   (1992)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2307518\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/3/1352/#p1355\">\n    3 Cal.App.4th 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1355,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20159\">\n    5 Cal.Rptr.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

In all three cases before us now, each criminal litigant received additional punishment based on the circumstance that he or she was originally charged with a felony crime and sentenced as a convicted felon. Even though the resentencing courts had converted each underlying felony conviction to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, in each matter, the trial court declined to give retroactive relief for any collateral consequence attached to that underlying felony conviction for purposes of the criminal litigant's new sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But in addition to affording persons the ability to retroactively have their felony convictions be reduced to misdemeanors, Proposition 47, through section 1170.18, subdivision (k), mandates that the reduced conviction \"\n   <em>\n    shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) Subdivision (k) of section 1170.18, therefore, plainly extends the retroactive ameliorative effects of Proposition 47 to mitigate any\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   collateral consequence of a felony conviction that is reduced under the measure. And yet, subdivision (k) is silent concerning whether it also\n   <em>\n    retroactively\n   </em>\n   mitigates the already-imposed collateral consequence of a felony conviction that is subsequently reduced under the measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Attorney General agrees that the phrase \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" in section 1170.18, subdivision (k) means that those who successfully obtain resentencing of their felony convictions to misdemeanors under\n   Proposition 47 may not be\n   <em>\n    subsequently\n   </em>\n   subject to a felony-based enhancement for that reduced conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the Attorney General argues that voters did not intend for Proposition 47 to retroactively reach back to unravel a felony-based conviction or a felony-based enhancement that had already been imposed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   any successful petition for resentencing under section 1170.18, even if that judgment was not final. He contends a resentencing under section 1170.18 has only a forward ameliorative effect on any new collateral consequence that is imposed\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a successful Proposition 47 resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We disagree. As we will explain, based on established presumptions we apply to measures designed to ameliorate punishment, a successful Proposition 47 petitioner may subsequently challenge, under subdivision (k) of section 1170.18, any felony-based enhancement that is based on that previously designated felony, now reduced to misdemeanor, so long as the judgment containing the enhancement was not final when Proposition 47 took effect. In addition, finality aside, a defendant who successfully petitions for resentencing on a current Proposition 47 eligible conviction may, at the time of resentencing, challenge a felony-based enhancement contained in the same judgment because the prior felony conviction on which it was based has since been reduced to a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

We further noted that this language \"draws no express distinction between persons serving final sentences and those serving nonfinal sentences, instead entitling both categories of prisoners to petition courts for recall of sentence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 603,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514280\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/687/\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514280\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/687/\">\n    412 P.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We also observed that both the resentencing provision of Proposition\n   47 and the measure's uncodified declared purpose made evident the intent to make resentencing of all persons serving a sentence for a Proposition 47 eligible offense \"dependent on a court's assessment of the likelihood that a defendant's early release will pose a risk to public safety,\" regardless of the finality of the judgment.

Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   rule of retroactivity had no application to persons serving a sentence for a Proposition 47 eligible offense when the measure took effect because the legislation expressly contained its own retroactivity provision for this class of persons, and it treated this class in the same manner, regardless of the finality of their judgments.\n   In contrast, as enacted by Proposition 47, we agree with defendant Valenzuela that the \"for all purposes\" provision in section 1170.18, subdivision (k) contains no savings clause indicating that it applies only prospectively, nor does it contain any language indicating that it otherwise limits or subsumes the ordinary presumption long established under the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   rule.

Proposition 47's resentencing determination is premised on a universal reclassification of certain felonies to misdemeanors. The measure further allows a whole class of persons, those previously convicted of those same offenses as felons, \"who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense,\" to be retroactively resentenced as misdemeanants,\n   even if those judgments are final and the persons have already completed their felony sentences.

This is unlike the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Feyrer\n   </em>\n   , where a section 17 sentencing determination merely serves to mitigate punishment for the unique circumstances of a single individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As a result, viewing section 1170.18, subdivision (k) in context of the purposes of Proposition 47, we see no reason why our prior interpretation of the phrase \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" in the context of section 17 forecloses the application of the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    2. Punishment of recidivist offenders does not override the\n   </em>\n   Estrada\n   <em>\n    rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Attorney General further argues that enhancements under sections 667.5, subdivision (b) and 12022.1, subdivision (b), are rooted in a defendant's status as a recidivist offender, and not in the specific underlying conduct. He contends that Proposition 47 did not explicitly address and had no impact on any prior electorate's desire to punish recidivist offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   . There, we observed that \"[w]hen the court properly exercises its discretion to reduce a wobbler to a\n   misdemeanor, it has found that the felony punishment,\n   <em>\n    and its consequences\n   </em>\n   , are not appropriate for that particular defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 56 Cal.4th at p. 801,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20307\">\n    156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=299%20P.3d%201263\">\n    299 P.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.) Indeed, \"one of the 'chief' reasons for reducing a wobbler to a misdemeanor 'is that under such circumstances the offense is not considered to be serious enough to entitle the court to resort to it as a prior conviction of a felony for the purpose of increasing the penalty for a subsequent crime.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 794,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20307\">\n    156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=299%20P.3d%201263\">\n    299 P.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Rogers\n   </em>\n   (1937)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6040947\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/20/397/#p400\">\n    20 Cal.App.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400-401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20P.2d%201237\">\n    66 P.2d 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The same logic applies here. In directing that a qualifying conviction be treated as a misdemeanor \"for all purposes,\" Proposition 47 fairly contemplated the consequences of this redesignation on associated enhancements like those under sections 667.5 and 12022.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, the fact that Proposition 47 did not expressly mention recidivist offenders does not mean that voters intended to deny those resentenced under the measure any further mitigation of their punishment stemming from the collateral consequences of their original felony conviction. The information given to voters stated that the \"measure reduces\n   <em>\n    penalties\n   </em>\n   for certain offenders convicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes\" and would allow \"certain offenders who have been previously convicted\n   of such crimes to apply for reduced sentences.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) More specifically, it states that \"the measure reduces the\n   <em>\n    penalties\n   </em>\n   for the following crimes\"-listing grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 35, italics added;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This emphasis on reduced penalties\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   for these narcotics and larceny-related offenses\n   extends logically to enhancements and subsequent offenses connected to those offenses. From these particular statements in the ballot materials for Proposition 47, it follows that a reduced penalty for a crime that had previously been classified as a felony would include a penalty that takes the form of an enhancement or other recidivist-based punishment that was alleged with that same felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In fact, as previously observed (\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , fn. 6), section 1170.18, subdivision (k) contains an exception stating that \"resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm\" or prevent a conviction under provisions prohibiting certain narcotics offenders from possessing firearms. This single exception to the collateral effect of Proposition 47's resentencing provisions further suggests that the\n   measure's mandate to reduce penalties for a distinct class of narcotics and larceny-related offenses otherwise fully extends to enhancements and subsequent offenses alleged with those offenses.

This defeats petitioner Guiomar's claim for relief under Proposition 47.

Although in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   we were not confronted with a scenario in which the underlying felony charge is ultimately reduced to a misdemeanor, we discussed the apparent different legislative purposes behind sections 1320.5 and 12022.1 and rejected the contention that the application of both would constitute improper double punishment.

We recognized that the recidivist focus of section 12022.1, in requiring convictions for both offenses, reflected such offenders \"as being particularly deserving of increased punishment for their on-bail recidivism\" and as being \"more blameworthy than defendants who willfully fail to appear for felony charges that ultimately are dismissed or reduced, or result in acquittal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , at p. 584,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2075\">\n    128 Cal.Rptr.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20P.3d%20150\">\n    59 P.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In addition to section 1320.5 's purpose of deterring bail jumping, we further observed that the statutory language states that the crime applies to any person \" 'charged with\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   convicted of' \" commission of a felony while released from custody on bail.

Under section 1170.18, subdivision (k), Guiomar's \"felony conviction\" for his narcotics offense became \"a misdemeanor for all purposes,\" but that did not alter the fact that he had been\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   with a felony when he failed to appear while on bail for that felony charge.

Buycks\n   </em>\n   (S231765), the Court of Appeal properly recognized this rule, even though defendant's conviction became final just over a week before Proposition 47 took effect. (See \u00a7 1237.5; Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.308(a).) When the trial court conducted a full resentencing of defendant in the present matter for his Proposition 47 eligible petty theft with a prior\n   conviction, the Court of Appeal explained, \"it was required to reevaluate\n   the applicability of section 12022.1\n   <em>\n    at that time\n   </em>\n   ,\" considering the fact that his primary offense conviction had become a misdemeanor conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, notwithstanding the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   rule, a person may petition for recall of his or her current sentence under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), upon which the trial court, when it resentences on the eligible felony conviction, must also resentence the defendant generally and must therefore reevaluate the continued applicability of any enhancement based on a prior felony conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This application of the full resentencing rule to an otherwise final judgment is also consistent with section 1170.18, subdivision (n), which states: \"Resentencing pursuant to this section does not diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments\n   <em>\n    in any case\n   </em>\n   that does not come within the purview of this section.\" (Italics added.) This subdivision emphasizes that, when a final judgment in a case cannot be opened for resentencing under the procedures created by section 1170.18, the judgment remains final even if it contains a prison prior enhancement or an on-bail enhancement as to which the underlying felony has been reduced to a misdemeanor. But section 1170.18 's exception to this rule of finality applies not only to individual counts, but to the entire\n   <em>\n    case\n   </em>\n   in which the judgment contains at least one felony conviction qualifying for reduction to a misdemeanor under the resentencing procedures of Proposition 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Although her judgment was not final when Proposition 47 took effect, in\n   <em>\n    People v. Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   (S232900), defendant is also in a similar procedural posture in being able to claim, in conjunction with a Proposition 47 resentencing petition for her conviction for possession of methamphetamine, that her section 667.5 enhancement should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Therefore, at the time of resentencing of a Proposition 47 eligible felony conviction, the trial court must reevaluate the applicability of any enhancement within the same judgment\n   <em>\n    at that time\n   </em>\n   , so long as that enhancement was predicated on a felony conviction\n   now reduced to a misdemeanor. Such an enhancement cannot be imposed because at that point the reduced\n   conviction \"shall be considered as a misdemeanor for all purposes.\" ( \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) Under these limited circumstances, a defendant may also challenge any prison prior enhancement in that judgment if the underlying felony has been reduced to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, notwithstanding the finality of that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    2. Petition for writ of habeas corpus\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We also conclude that the collateral consequences of Proposition 47's mandate to have the redesignated offense \"be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes\" can properly be enforced by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus for those judgments that were not final when Proposition 47 took effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The relief we discuss here, under the \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" language of section 1170.18, subdivision (k), is an ameliorative provision distinct from the ameliorative provisions of subdivisions (a) and (f) of the same statute which provide express mechanisms for reducing felony convictions to misdemeanors. The effect of section 1170.18, subdivision (k), constitutes an ameliorative change to the laws governing the imposition of felony-based enhancements and other collateral consequences, as opposed to an ameliorative change to the law under which the original felony conviction was had. A petition for habeas corpus seeking to vacate a section 667.5 prior prison term enhancement on the ground that it is based on a prior felony theft conviction that has since been reduced to a misdemeanor, for example, would be invoking\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   not to establish the initiative's ameliorative effect on the prior theft conviction, but to show that section 1170.18, subdivision (k) has some retroactive effect to the extent permitted under\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   With this understanding, our courts have afforded defendants relief on petition for writ of habeas corpus involving collateral attacks on enhancements.

Buycks\n   </em>\n   (S231765), the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that because the narcotics offense for which Buycks had been released on his own recognizance had been reduced to a misdemeanor it was to \"be considered as a misdemeanor for all purposes\" under section 1170.18, subdivision (k). When Buycks' Proposition 47 petition was granted in his second case, the trial court was obligated to sentence defendant anew in that case and to reevaluate the applicability of the section 12022.1 enhancement at that time. The Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the enhancement could not be reimposed and should be stricken in light of section 1170.18, subdivision (k). Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in\n   <em>\n    People v. Buycks\n   </em>\n   (S231765) is affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    People v. Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   (S232900), the Court of Appeal held that, despite defendant's successful petition to have her underlying felony reduced to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, that measure did not relieve her of the one-year section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior felony prison term enhancement. As\n   discussed above, however, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), may affect the validity of enhancements when the underlying felony has been reduced under Proposition 47.\n   Because Valenzuela's judgment in case No. JCF32712 was not final when Proposition 47 took effect, the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   rule applies to strike her section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior felony prison term enhancement. Alternatively, because it appears that Valenzuela has a Proposition 47 eligible conviction in case No. JCF32712, if the resentencing court grants her petition to reduce that conviction to a misdemeanor, the court must resentence her anew in that case, and it will be required to reevaluate the applicability of the section 667.5 enhancement at that time. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Guiomar\n   </em>\n   (S238888), the Court of Appeal held that, despite Guiomar's successful petition to have his underlying felony reduced to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, that measure did not relieve him of his conviction of felony failure to appear under section 1320.5. As discussed above, the Court of Appeal correctly determined that Proposition 47 did not affect his status as a person charged with a felony at the time of his failure to\n   appear, and that his successful petition in case No. SS131650A to have his felony possession of a controlled substance conviction reduced to a misdemeanor did not affect the validity of his section 1320.5 conviction.
