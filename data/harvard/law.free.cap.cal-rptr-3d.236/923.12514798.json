Dale A. Reinholtsen, Hon. Gregory Elvine-Kreis, and Hon. Kelly L. Neel presiding. Gregory M. Holtz appeared on behalf of Appellant. Andrew Del Monte and Denise Del Monte appeared for Plaintiff and Respondent Del Monte Properties and Investments (\"Respondent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Having read and considered the briefs filed by the parties, and having heard argument of counsel and the parties, the Court reverses the judgment of the trial court for the reasons stated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 10, 2017, Respondent filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Appellant. Respondent alleged that it leased the premises to Appellant at a monthly rent of $600 and that it served Appellant with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit on May 5, 2017. The 3-day notice, attached as an exhibit to the complaint, demanded rent in the amount of $600, as well as a late fee in the amount of $50, for a total of $650. The lease, also attached as an exhibit to the complaint, contains the following term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   6. Late charge; returned checks:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   A. Tenant acknowledges either late payment of Rent or issuance of a returned check may cause Landlord to incur costs and expenses, the exact amount of which are extremely difficult and impractical to determine. These costs may include, but are not limited to, processing, enforcement and accounting expenses, and late charges imposed on Landlord. If any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within 5 calendar days after the date due, or if a check is returned, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, respectively, an additional sum of $50.00 as a Late Charge and $25.00 as a NSF fee for the first returned check and $35.00 as a NSF fee for each additional returned check, either or both of which shall be deemed additional Rent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   B. Landlord and Tenant agree that these charges represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord may incur by reason of Tenant's late or NSF payment. Any Late Charge or NSF fee due shall be paid with the current installment of Rent....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant filed an amended answer as well as a motion for summary judgment. The summary judgment motion was denied and the case proceeded to trial on June 6, 2017 and June 7, 2017. Andrew Del Monte testified for Respondent. Both Respondent and Appellant's counsel asked questions about the late fee. After Appellant's motion for nonsuit was overruled, Appellant testified. Appellant requested a statement of decision. The trial court found for Respondent. It ordered the lease forfeited and awarded Respondent possession of the premises, as well as \"past-due rent\" of $650 and holdover damages of $140, for a total judgment of $790. Judgment was entered on June 7, 2017. Appellant filed a notice of appeal on September 8, 2017. The trial court entered a statement of decision on September 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant submitted the following issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The 3-day notice cannot support a judgment for unlawful detainer because it contains a demand for an invalid late fee which is prohibited by Civil Code \u00a7 1671 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The late fee cannot be justified as liquidated damages because the losses caused by late payment of rent were not extremely difficult or impractical to determine, and Respondent failed to show that the amount of liquidated damages charged were\n   the result of a reasonable endeavor to approximate those losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Late Fee as Liquidated Damages\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The proponent of a liquidated damages provision in a residential lease bears the burden of proving its validity under Civil Code \u00a7 1671.\n   <em>\n    Garrett v.

Moreover, an agreement to the term setting the amount is not enough. At trial, Respondent testified about types of losses caused by late payment of rent, but this was little more than a reference to the language of the lease. Respondent did not articulate specific facts showing why the circumstances of this case justify liquidated damages to compensate losses caused by late payment. In fact, Respondent's Exhibit 1 submitted on appeal demonstrates that these losses may not be difficult to calculate. Because Respondent failed to meet its burden to show that the losses caused by late payment of rent in this case were extremely difficult or impracticable to determine, liquidated damages were not justified under Civil Code \u00a7 1671.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Late Fee Not Determined After Reasonable Endeavor to Approximate Actual Losses by Late Payment of Rent\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a separate and independent basis for this decision, Respondent failed to meet its burden to show that the late fee was the result of a reasonable endeavor to approximate actual losses caused by late payment of rent. To be valid under Civil Code \u00a7 1671, a liquidated damages clause must be the result of a reasonable endeavor to approximate actual losses caused by the breach being compensated.\n   <em>\n    In re Cellphone Termination Fee Cases\n   </em>\n   (2011)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230695\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/193/298/#p322\">\n    193 Cal.App.4th 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20726\">\n    122 Cal.Rptr.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
