A reading of the complaint reveals that despite the characterization of defendant\u2019s conduct this is an action for the breach of a contract of bailment. As such the use of interrogatories is unexceptionable. Concededly defendant did not move for a protective order within 10 days as prescribed by CPLR 3133. Special Term\u2019s ruling was made on the ground that the stricken interrogatories were palpably improper. We do not so find them. Settle order on notice. Concur \u2014 Markewieh, J.
