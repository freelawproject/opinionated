As so modified, judgment affirmed, without costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>and case remanded for hearing as herein provided. The remedy of constructive trust contravenes public policy when title is taken in the name of a veteran, upon his oral promise to later convey, in order to secure the benefits of the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 (U. S. Code, tit. 38, former \u00a7 693 <em>et seq.) </em>for one not entitled thereto <em>(Towner </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>5 A D 2d 481; <em>Badami </em>v. <em>Badami, </em>29 A D 2d 645; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>1 A D 2d 888). However, in the interests of justice, we impress an equitable lien on the property in favor of plaintiff, as hereinabove directed, for any moneys expended by her out of her own funds at the contract signing and closing and thereafter in reduction of the mortgage principal and for value enhancing permanent improvements <em>(Badami </em>v. <em>Badami, </em>supra; <em>Towner </em>v. <em>Berg, supra). </em>Hopkins, Acting P. J., Martuscello, Shapiro, Christ and Benjamin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
