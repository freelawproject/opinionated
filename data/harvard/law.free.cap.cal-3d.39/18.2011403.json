Tenzer (Tenzer) appeals from a judgment in favor of defendant Superscope, Inc. (Superscope) after the trial court granted Superscope\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The facts, as revealed by Tenzer\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">Superscope is a corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange and authorized to do business in California. Joseph Tushinsky is the president of the corporation, as well as the chairman of its board of directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Tenzer has been involved in a management capacity in the real estate and housing industries in the western part of the United States for 20 years. Although he has extensive personal and business contacts among investors in the real estate field, Tenzer is not a licensed real estate broker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Tenzer and Tushinsky served together on the board of directors of a charitable organization in Los Angeles. Sometime prior to May of 1979, they began to discuss the possibility that Tenzer should become a member of the Superscope board of directors (Board).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">On May 10, 1979, at Tushinsky\u2019s invitation, Tenzer attended a Board meeting. At this meeting Tenzer learned, for the first time, that Superscope was attempting to sell its corporate headquarters to meet pressing cashflow problems. The next day, Tenzer was elected to the Board at the corporation\u2019s annual meeting. At a Board meeting the same day, the need to sell the corporation\u2019s headquarters was again discussed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">The next meeting of the Board occurred on June 22, 1979. At this meeting, the outside directors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including Tenzer, first learned the details of Superscope\u2019s financial predicament. The Board was informed that the corporation was technically in default on over $45 million in loans and that the corporation\u2019s banks were threatening to accelerate payment on these loans. The Board was also told that a cash sale of the corporate headquarters was imperative to avoid reorganization pursuant to the federal Bankruptcy Act. The headquarters building, together with other property and facilities including a warehouse, parking lot, and adjacent undeveloped acreage, had been on the real estate market for nearly a year, but Superscope\u2019s real estate broker had not yet been able to effect a sale. The asking price for the property was approximately $16 million. At this meeting, Tushinsky ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>pressed his view that the situation was desperate and that a miracle was needed to save the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">Subsequently, Tushinsky, in a phone conversation, implored Tenzer personally to seek a suitable buyer for the property. Shortly afterwards, Tenzer became aware that Paul Amir, a Beverly Hills-based entrepreneur, was interested in negotiating a quick-closing real estate purchase for tax reasons. The Superscope headquarters appeared to be precisely the sort of property which would suit Amir\u2019s needs. Tenzer discussed the Superscope property with Amir without revealing its identity and verified that Amir might be interested in buying it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">With this information in hand, Tenzer telephoned Tushinsky. He explained that he was calling not in his capacity as a Board member, but as a finder, that he had located a potential buyer for the corporate headquarters and that, should the sale be consummated, he would expect a finder\u2019s fee of 10 percent. Tushinsky responded enthusiastically, authorizing Tenzer to discuss the matter further with his contact. Tushinsky also indicated that payment of a finder\u2019s fee was entirely proper, that the requested fee was satisfactory, and that if a $16 million sale were to close when expected, Tenzer\u2019s fee would be earned and payable upon the closing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Neither Tenzer nor Tushinsky discussed the need to reduce the finder\u2019s fee agreement to writing. Tenzer felt that their personal relationship and Tushinsky\u2019s integrity were sufficient assurance that he would be paid. In reliance upon Tushinsky\u2019s promise, Tenzer then revealed each party\u2019s identity to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">The Board accepted Amir\u2019s offer in July 1979. A contract for the sale of Superscope\u2019s headquarters to Amir was consummated in August, and the sale was ultimately closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">Tenzer was aware of other real estate opportunities for Amir, but he refrained from exploring such opportunities on Amir\u2019s behalf in reliance upon Tushinsky\u2019s promise that he would receive a finder\u2019s fee from the Superscope sale. Prior to the Board\u2019s approval of the Amir transaction, Tenzer informed it that he was entitled to a finder\u2019s fee in the event of a sale to Amir. He did not, however, reveal the amount of the finder\u2019s fee to which Tushinsky had agreed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tenzer took no part in the deliberations concerning or in the vote approving acceptance of Amir\u2019s offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>At the July 27, 1979, Board meeting at which the sale to Amir was approved, a discussion regarding the payment of finders\u2019 fees to directors was held, but a final decision on the issue was deferred to the next Board meeting on August 24, 1979. At the August meeting, a motion was made to authorize the payment of finders\u2019 fees to corporate directors. Tenzer maintains that the discussion involved only whether such fees would be approved for future transactions, and did not touch upon approval of the finder\u2019s fee arrangement he had already made with Tushinsky. He believed that the Board had ratified that arrangement when it accepted Amir\u2019s oifer in July. In any case, Tenzer participated in the August discussion and voted on the motion. Part of the discussion centered upon whether such fees were permitted under the corporate bylaws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All outside directors voted in favor of the resolution authorizing payment of finders\u2019 fees. All the \u201cinside\u201d directors (including corporate employees and members of the Tushinsky family) voted against. The resolution was defeated. Tenzer has never received a finder\u2019s fee for his services in connection with the Amir transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">Tenzer filed suit against both Super scope and Tushinsky. He alleged three \u201ccauses of action\u201d which he entitled \u201cBreach of Contract and Unjust Enrichment,\u201d \u201cEstoppel,\u201d and \u201cFraud.\u201d The complaint further alleged that, in making the promise to pay him a 10 percent finder\u2019s fee, Tushinsky had acted as the agent of the corporation, and that he made the promise fraudulently, with no intent to perform. Rather, Tenzer alleged, Tushinsky intended to cheat him by inducing him to reveal Amir\u2019s name while secretly harboring an intent to prevent payment of the agreed fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">After a hearing on the merits, Superscope\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c was granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tenzer filed a timely appeal from the judgment in favor of Superscope. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Tenzer\u2019s contentions on appeal may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">1. There is a finder\u2019s fee exception to the statute of frauds contained in Civil Code section 1624, subdivision 5. Therefore, an oral contract to pay a finder\u2019s fee in a real estate transaction is enforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">2. Even if the statute of frauds would normally preclude enforcement of an oral finder\u2019s fee contract, in this case Tenzer performed in reliance upon the agreement and Super scope retained the benefits. This should operate as an estoppel to assert the statute of frauds as a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">3. Because of Tushinsky\u2019s misrepresentations, Tenzer may maintain an action for fraud even if the underlying oral agreement is unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">4. Summary judgment was inappropriate because of the presence of triable issues of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">As explained further below, we find that, liberally construed, the papers Tenzer submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment are sufficient to raise triable issues of fact as to the second and third of these contentions. Thus summary judgment was inappropriate. (See, e.g., <em>Corwin </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 851-852 [94 Cal.Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953].) However, we find no merit in Tenzer\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">Civil Code section 1624, provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cThe following contracts are invalid, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by his agent: . . . 5. An agreement authorizing or employing an agent, broker, or any other person to . . . find a purchaser or seller of real estate ... for compensation or a commission; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">In his first cause of action, Tenzer attempts to claim damages based upon breach of an alleged oral contract employing him to find a purchaser of real estate for a commission. He does not allege that the contract was ever put in writing. Under the plain language of the statute this contract, if it was entered into, was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">Tenzer argues that precedent establishes the statute is irrelevant to his claim. He cites several cases, including <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>[106 Cal.Rptr. 761, 507 P.2d 65]; <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Dept. of Real Estate </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 286, 295 [142 Cal.Rptr. 789]; and <em>Spielberg </em>v. <em>Granz </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 283 [8 Cal.Rptr. 190], for the proposition that there is a \u201cfinder\u2019s exception,\u201d both to licensing laws and the statute of frauds. He is in error. Those cases merely stand for the principle that a finder in a real estate transaction need not be licensed as a real estate broker to collect a finder\u2019s fee. They state nothing about a finder\u2019s exception to the statute of frauds. As noted in <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Marinell </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 617 [169 Cal.Rptr. 414], the Legislature has gone to considerable lengths to clarify that finders\u2019 agreements such as this must be memorialized in writing to be enforceable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\u201cBefore 1963, the so-called oral \u2018finder\u2019s agreement,\u2019 that is an agreement merely to introduce a seller of real estate to a prospective purchaser or a purchaser to a prospective buyer, was held not to be within the statute of frauds, whether such contract was made by a real estate broker or agent or by an unlicensed person. (See <em>Heyn </em>v. <em>Philips </em>(1869) 37 Cal. 529, 531; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Wahler </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 705, 710 [285 P.2d 8].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cIn 1963, however, the Legislature amended subdivision 5 to add, inter alia, the italicized language: \u2018An agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate, . . . <em>or to procure, introduce, or find a purchaser or seller of real estate </em>or a lessee or lessor of real estate where such lease is for a longer period than one year, for compensation or a commission.\u2019 (Stats. 1963, ch. 814, \u00a7 1, p. 1843.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cIf by this amendment the Legislature intended all finder\u2019s fee agreements to come within the ambit of the statute of frauds, it failed, as was predicted in the State Bar Journal\u2019s review of 1963 legislation (38 State Bar J. 604, 649). [Fn. omitted.] The section, as amended, was interpreted to bar only oral finder\u2019s agreements between licensed brokers or agents and sellers or purchasers of property. Subdivision 5, as revised, was still held to be inapplicable to such oral agreements by unlicensed individuals. (See <em>Hasekian </em>v. <em>Krotz </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 311, 317 [74 Cal.Rptr. 410]; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Cirod, Inc. </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 761, 766 [51 Cal.Rptr. 784].) This anomaly resulted in the 1967 amendment (Stats. 1967, ch. 52, \u00a7 1 p. 953), which added the following italicized language: \u2018An agreement authorizing or employing an agent, <em>or any other person </em>to purchase or sell real estate . . . or to procure, introduce or find a purchaser or seller . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 620-621, original italics.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Tenzer also refers us to <em>Zalk </em>v. <em>General Exploration Co. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 786 [164 Cal.Rptr. 647], and a passage from <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 1, 12-13, but these decisions merely involve oral agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ments for finder\u2019s fees in nonrealty transactions, and therefore are inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We conclude that Tenzer\u2019s action based on contract would ordinarily be barred by the statute of frauds.  Tenzer asserts, however, that even if the finder\u2019s fee agreement was oral, and in violation of the statute of frauds, he has alleged facts sufficient to invoke the estoppel doctrine and thus to foreclose Superscope from relying upon the statute of frauds as a defense. In brief, Tenzer alleges that Tushinsky\u2014as Superscope\u2019s representative\u2014promised to pay him for valuable information which could have been sold elsewhere. In reliance on this promise, Tenzer surrendered Amir\u2019s name. Superscope, having profited from Tenzer\u2019s performance, now refuses to keep its end of the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The doctrine of estoppel to plead the statute of frauds may be applied where necessary to prevent either unconscionable injury or unjust enrichment. (M<em>onarco </em>v. <em>Lo Greco </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 621, 623-624 [220 P.2d 737].) On the basis of the factual contentions advanced in Tenzer\u2019s papers, Superscope has received the benefit of Tenzer\u2019s performance but relies upon the statute of frauds to avoid paying the agreed-upon price. Provided that Tenzer was not otherwise obligated to reveal this information to Super-scope\u2014a point which we consider further, infra\u2014these allegations suggest a case of unjust enrichment as that term was defined in <em>Monarco </em>v. <em>LoGreco, supra, </em>at page 624. In such cases, the doctrine of estoppel to assert the statute of frauds may be applied in the interests of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Super scope argues that, as a real estate finder, Tenzer may not invoke the equitable doctrine of estoppel. It relies upon a series of cases which have established that \u201c \u2018an estoppel to plead the statute of frauds cannot be predicated upon the . . . refusal to comply with an oral promise to pay a [real estate] commission.\u2019\u201d <em>(Keely </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 209, 212 [103 Cal.Rptr. 531], quoting <em>Herzog </em>v. <em>Blatt </em>(1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 340, 343 [180 P.2d 30]; see also <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Post </em>(1908) 154 Cal. 22 [96 P. 878]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Tilden Park Estates </em>(1958) 156 Cal.App.2d 824 [320 P.2d 109]; <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Trucco </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 229 [268 P.2d 780]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Hirschman </em>(1942) 54 Cal.App.2d 573, 574 [129 P.2d 430]; <em>Sweeley </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 381 [118 P.2d 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Superscope\u2019s reliance is misplaced. The cases it cites all involved licensed real estate brokers. The rationale for rigorous application of the statute of frauds to bar claims by licensed real estate brokers is related to the statutory licensing requirements. \u201cReal estate brokers are licensed as such only after they have demonstrated a knowledge of the laws relating to real estate transactions (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10150, 10153), and it would seem that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>would thus require less protection against pitfalls encountered in transactions regulated by those laws. In <em>Pacific Southwest Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R. R. Co. </em>[1956] 47 Cal.2d 62 [301 P.2d 825], the court stated at page 70: \u2018Plaintiff is a licensed real estate broker and, as such, is presumed to know that contracted for real estate commissions are invalid and unenforceable unless put in writing and subscribed by the person to be charged. [Citations.] Nevertheless, plaintiff failed to secure proper written authorization to protect itself in the transaction. Rather it assumed the risk of relying upon claimed oral promises of defendant, and it has no cause for complaint if its efforts go unrewarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 570, 575 [30 Cal.Rptr. 530, 381 P.2d 386]; see also <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Albertson Co. </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 592, 603-604 [53 Cal.Rptr. 25]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Tilden Park Estates, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 824, 830.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">This rationale is inapplicable to \u201cfinders,\u201d who need not be licensed brokers, or even involved in the real estate business professionally. We, therefore, decline to extend the scope of the <em>Keely </em>v. <em>Price </em>rule to unlicensed finders such as Tenzer. Tenzer is entitled to invoke the doctrine of estoppel to plead the statute of frauds. On the facts alleged, Superscope\u2019s motion for summary judgment was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Tenzer\u2019s complaint also sets forth an alternative basis for relief, seeking damages for fraud. Tenzer alleges that Tushinsky, acting for Super-scope, deliberately misled him by falsely promising to compensate him for his services as a finder. Tenzer acted in reliance upon these misrepresentations and has suffered damage. Therefore, Tenzer asserts that, regardless of whether the oral contract is enforceable, he may maintain an action in tort for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>A series of cases have held that an action for fraud cannot be maintained where the allegedly fraudulent promise is unenforceable as a contract due to the statute of frauds. The rule was stated in <em>Kroger </em>v. <em>Baur </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 801, 803 [117 P.2d 50], as follows: \u201cAppellant contends that his action is not upon the invalid agreement, but is an action for damages for fraud, upon the theory that the oral promise to pay him a commission was made without any intention of performing it and for the purpose of inducing him to waive a written memorandum. If the law can be thus nullified by the transparent device of predicating a tort action upon the invalid oral promise on the ground that the promisor did not intend to perform it, then the section might just as well be stricken from the statute. To license such a circuitous procedure to evade the provisions of such legislation would be to nullify and destroy its wholesome effect and the protection it affords against fraud.\u201d (See also <em>Keely </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d 209, 215; <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Foundation for Ocean Research </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 179 [165 Cal.Rptr. 571]; <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Arblaster </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 145, 163 [14 Cal.Rptr. 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">But the <em>Kroger </em>rule has been criticized and, in 1978, Justice Kaus\u2014then sitting on the Second District Court of Appeal\u2014invited this court to disapprove it. Today we accept his invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As Justice Kaus observed: \u201cSeveral considerations point to a demise of the <em>Kroger </em>rule .... In brief: 1. The \u2018better\u2019 rule is contra. Comment (c) to section 530 of the Restatement Second of the Law of Torts states that a misrepresentation of one\u2019s intention is actionable even \u2018when the agreement is oral and made unenforceable by the statute of frauds, or when it is unprovable and so unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\u2019 2. The broad statement of the <em>Kroger </em>rule is difficult to reconcile with the principle that a party may be estopped to assert the statute of frauds where such estoppel is necessary \u2018to prevent fraud that would result from refusal to enforce oral contracts in certain circumstances.\u2019 <em>(Monarco </em>v. <em>Lo Greco </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 621, 623.) 3. It is simply untrue that a plaintiff who undertakes to plead and prove actionable fraud is attempting to get around the statute of frauds by a \u2018transparent device. \u2019 <em>Kroger </em>seems to assume the inability of a jury to distinguish between an unkept but honest promise and one which the promisor never intended to perform. The law is otherwise. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashley </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 263-264 [267 P.2d 271].) 4. The provision of the statute of frauds which spawned <em>Kroger </em>was Civil Code section 1624, subdivision 5, relating to agreements for real estate brokers\u2019 commissions. The law has traditionally had little sympathy with the broker who has failed to sign up his client. (E.g., <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Trucco </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 229, 237-238 [268 P.2d 780].)\u201d <em>(Southern Cal. etc. Assemblies of God </em>v. <em>Shep</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>herd of Hills etc. Church </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 951, 958, fn. 3 [144 Cal.Rptr. 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In addition, the <em>Kroger </em>approach is inconsistent with the general rule \u201c \u2018that the statute of frauds, having been enacted for the purpose of preventing fraud, shall not be made the instrument of shielding, protecting or aiding the party who relies upon it in the perpetration of a fraud or in the consummation of a fraudulent scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Seymour </em>v. <em>Oelrichs </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 782 , 794 [106 P. 88], quoting 2 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 921; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Day </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 134, 138 [266 P.2d 51]; 3 Williston on Contracts (3d ed. 1960) \u00a7 533A, p. 802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Nor do we agree with the view that the <em>Kroger </em>rule is necessary to prevent the nullification of the statute of frauds. This view is perhaps based upon the notion that, when the statute of frauds clearly bars an action in contract, a disappointed promisee should not be allowed to present his claim for compensation to a jury simply by recasting his complaint to include an allegation of misrepresentation. If it were, in fact, that easy to reach a jury on a claim of fraud, we might agree. Fortunately, this is not the case. To survive a motion for a nonsuit (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581c), plaintiff in an action on a fraudulent promise must produce evidence of the promisor\u2019s intent to mislead him.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Some California cases have stated broadly that \u201c[t]he subsequent failure to perform as promised warrants the inference that defendant did not intend to perform when she made the promise. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Santoro </em>v. <em>Carbone </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 721, 728 [99 Cal.Rptr. 488]; see also <em>Jarkieh </em>v. <em>Badagliacco </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 505, 509 [170 P.2d 994].) This may suggest that proof that a promise was made and that it was not fulfilled is sufficient to prove fraud. This is not, and has never been, a correct statement of the law, and we disapprove the cases cited to the extent they suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Rather, \u201csomething more than nonperformance is required to prove the defendant\u2019s intent not to perform his promise.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashley </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 263 [267 P.2d 271]; see also <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Mead </em>(1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 75, 82 [55 P.2d 285]; <em>Justheim Petroleum Company </em>v. <em>Hammond </em>(10th Cir. 1955) 227 F.2d 629, 637; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 530, com. d.; Prosser, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 109, p. 764.) To be sure, fraudulent intent must often be established by circumstantial evidence. Prosser, for example, cites cases in which fraudulent intent has been inferred from such circumstances as defendant\u2019s insolvency, his hasty repudiation of the promise, his failure even to attempt performance, or his continued assurances after it was clear he would not perform. (Prosser, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 764-765.) How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ever, if plaintiff adduces no further evidence of fraudulent intent than proof of nonperformance of an oral promise, he will never reach a jury. The policies of the statute of frauds will not be subverted by affording plaintiffs who can prove actual fraud the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">For these reasons, we disapprove of <em>Kroger </em>v. <em>Baur </em>and its progeny. We conclude that Tenzer\u2019s papers were sufficient to raise triable issues of fact on a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In its motion for summary judgment, Superscope contended that, even if Tenzer had had a commission agreement, he acted as a real estate broker and cannot recover because he was not licensed. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10136.) Whether Tenzer acted as a broker is a question of fact, requiring an examination of his conduct after the introduction of the buyer and seller, to determine whether he participated in their negotiations. <em>(Lyons </em>v. <em>Stevenson </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 595, 605-606 [135 Cal.Rptr. 457].)  The record does not permit adjudication of this factual question on a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Finally, we address Superscope\u2019s contention that in light of Tenzer\u2019s fiduciary obligations as corporate director any reliance by him upon Tushinsky\u2019s promise was unreasonable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">At the time of the alleged agreement, Tenzer was a member of Super-scope\u2019s Board. As such, he bore a fiduciary relationship to Superscope and to all its stockholders. <em>(Remillard Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Remillard-Dandini </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 405, 419 [241 P.2d 66].)  Well-established principles of corporations law hold that a \u201cdirector cannot, by reason of his position, drive a harsh and unfair bargain with the corporation he is supposed to represent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 418.) \u201c[Directors\u2019] dealings with the corporation are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>subjected to rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or engagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the director . . . not only to prove the good faith of the transaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein. [Citation.] The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain. [Fn. omitted.] If it does not, equity will set it aside.\u201d <em>(Pepper </em>v. <em>Litton </em>(1939) 308 U.S. 295, 306-307 [84 L.Ed. 281, 289, 60 S.Ct. 238].) \u201c[Transactions that are unfair and unreasonable to the corporation may be avoided.\u201d <em>(Remillard Brick Co., supra, </em>at p. 418, see also 1 Ballantine &amp; Sterling, Cal. Corporation Laws (4th ed. 1984) \u00a7 103.01, pp. 6-20.1-6-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">As a corporate director, Tenzer is charged with the knowledge that any contract he entered into with his own corporation, even if valid and enforceable in all other respects, could be avoided at the corporation\u2019s option if it were determined to be unfair or unreasonable to the corporation. Thus, in order to prove that his reliance upon Tushinsky\u2019s promise was justifiable, Tenzer will be required to prove that the arrangement was fair and reasonable to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Establishing whether Tenzer\u2019s agreement with Superscope was fair and reasonable involves determination of the particular factual circumstances of the agreement, and application of the standards of fairness and good faith required of a fiduciary to these facts. These are functions mainly for the trier of facts. (See <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>MacBan </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 258, 276 [132 Cal.Rptr. 222]; see also <em>MacEwen </em>v. <em>Star-Kist Foods, Inc. </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1966) 251 F.Supp. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">For the guidance of the trial court in overseeing this factfinding process, we offer the following observations. In ever-increasing numbers, we derive our livelihoods from transactions in information rather than property or labor. In addition to real estate professionals, lawyers, bankers, and accountants, as well as consultants in any number of fields often sell what they <em>know </em>as much as what they <em>do. </em>Many of these same professionals serve as directors on the boards of corporations for which they also work. The ethics and wisdom of serving on the board of a corporation to which one regularly renders professional services has been questioned. (See Knepper, <em>Liability of Lawyer-Directors </em>(1979) 40 Ohio St. L.J. 341; see also Ruder, <em>The Case Against the Lawyer-Director </em>(1975) 30 Bus. Law. 41.) Yet the practice is widespread and has its defenders, who point out that corporations should not be deprived of the special skills such \u201cinterested directors\u201d can provide, and that the potential for conflicts of interest can be avoided by full disclosure and establishment of procedures to assure conscientious adherence to ethical standards of fairness. (See, e.g., Note, <em>Should Lawyers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Serve as Directors of Corporations for Which They Act as Counsel? </em>1978 Utah L.Rev. 711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Certainly it would be unfair to require such directors to surrender gratuitously to their corporations information or advice for which they would otherwise be paid in the normal course of their business. At the same time, we discern nothing oppressive in the view that corporate directors should be required, as a facet of their role as fiduciaries, to pass on information vital to the survival of their corporations which either is incidental to the directors\u2019 usual mode of earning a living or was casually acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The determination whether Tenzer\u2019s agreement with Tushinsky was fair and reasonable to Superscope involves evaluation of the specific facts surrounding the transaction. Was Tenzer dependent upon transactions of this sort for his livelihood? If so, was this fact known to Tushinsky? Was it known that, by revealing Amir\u2019s name to Superscope, Tenzer would be forgoing the opportunity to sell the same information in other quarters?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">How did Tenzer become aware of Amir\u2019s interest in a deal of this sort? Directors may be more obligated freely to disclose information which \u201cfalls into their laps\u201d than information obtained by employing the skills and resources normally used in their professions.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">How did the price Tenzer asked for his information compare to the usual commission for such information in this real estate market? Did Super-scope\u2019s bylaws specifically allow or prohibit compensation of directors for professional services? This list of questions is by no means exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The answers to these questions are also pertinent to Tenzer\u2019s claim of estoppel to plead the statute of frauds.  Estoppel is an equitable remedy and, as such, will only be applied to avoid injustice. If reliance upon Tushinsky\u2019s promise was unjustified in light of TenzeUs position as a director, equity does not require that Tenzer be allowed to enforce the promise. (See generally Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 139.) At the same time, this factual inquiry may establish that, because of his fiduciary relationship to the corporation, Tenzer was obligated to reveal his information without seeking compensation. If so, the corporation cannot be said to be unjustly enriched by retaining the benefits of Tenzer\u2019s information but refusing to pay for it. Thus, Tenzer will have to establish that his behavior was reasonably consistent with his fiduciary role in order to invoke the doctrine of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Resolution of this issue requires information which, at this point, does not appear in the record. For this reason, we conclude that summary adjudication was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Lucas, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-10\">In its motion for summary judgment, Superscope argued that, even if all the facts alleged in Tenzer\u2019s complaint and supporting papers were true, he was entitled to no relief as a matter of law. For this reason, Superscope submitted no factual declarations to counter the truth of Tenzer\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\">An outside director is a director who has no interest or other duties in the corporation other than as a director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Tenzer felt that it was Tushinsky\u2019s duty to disclose to the Board the amount of the finder\u2019s fee. He asserts that a fee of 10 percent was reasonable given the precarious financial condition of Superscope and the fact that the sale saved Superscope from bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Superscope\u2019s bylaws provide in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cArticle III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">\u201cDirectors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cSection 1: Powers. . . .

Directors . . . may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, ... as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the board of directors.

(See, e.g., Comment, <em>Equitable Estoppel and the Statute of Frauds in California </em>(1965) 53 Cal.L.Rev. 590, 602, 609; Note, <em>Oral Employment Contracts and Equitable Estoppel: The Real Estate Broker as Victim </em>(1975) 26 Hastings L.J. 1503; 1 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (1975) \u00a7 1:54, pp. 69-74, fn. 8.) Miller and Starr suggest that this issue may be due for reexamination in light of changed conditions in the real estate field. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In today\u2019s market, they assert, brokers often deal with sophisticated principals in superior bargaining positions. In such circumstances, the broker is powerless to compel the principal\u2019s cooperation in executing a written commission agreement and denial of the broker\u2019s claim for a commission based on failure to comply with the requirements of the statute of frauds is unjust. Whether or not there is merit in these arguments, we reserve for another day the question whether licensed brokers may invoke equitable remedies to avoid the sometimes harsh results of the statute of frauds. As noted above, the question is not presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Superscope also advanced a somewhat confused theory of \u201cwaiver\u201d; alleging that, by giving misleading answers on questionnaires Superscope distributed in 1980 and 1981, Tenzer had waived his claim against the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The use of the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in a contractual context is ambiguous and uninformative. (See generally 5 Williston on Contracts (3d ed. 1961) \u00a7 678, p. 238 et seq.) As Professor Williston notes, an agreement to discharge from liability previously incurred is more normally denominated a release. Civil Code section 1541 permits the extinction of an obligation, unsupported by consideration, provided that the release is in writing. The writing must, however, expressly show the creditor\u2019s intent to extinguish the obligation. <em>(Golden West Credit etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1932) 119 Cal.App. 627, 636 [7 P.2d 345].) In our view, Tenzer\u2019s answers on the 1980 and 1981 questionnaires express no such intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
