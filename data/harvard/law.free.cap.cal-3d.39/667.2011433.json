Code, \u00a7 187).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The People appeal the dismissal of murder charges against his codefendant, Leonard L. Rivas. The parties raise two separate and distinct claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Trevino raises the question whether the term \u201cSpanish surnamed\u201d is sufficiently descriptive of a cognizable group to satisfy the Wheeler<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> test for identifying prosecutorial abuse of the peremptory challenge in violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be tried by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. We conclude that the phrase does describe a cognizable' class, namely Hispanics, and that the prosecution failed to sustain its burden of proving that Hispanics were not impermissibly excluded from jury service on the basis of group bias. Trevino\u2019s conviction, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The People assert that the trial court\u2019s order granting Rivas a new trial was not tantamount to an acquittal, regardless of the language used in the order. This argument overlooks the threshold inquiry as to whether the trial court erred earlier in the trial in denying Rivas\u2019 motions for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. (\u00a7 1118.1.) Because the evidence was \u201cinsufficient as a matter of law,\u201d as the trial court belatedly acknowledged in ruling on Rivas\u2019 motion for a new trial, and Rivas was therefore entitled to acquittal, we conclude that the trial court responsible for conducting a new trial correctly discharged Rivas on the basis of his once in jeopardy plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The facts as to the two defendants are interwoven. On June 11, 1979, Rollo \u201cTed\u201d Hinton\u2019s body was found in the bedroom of his ransacked apartment. Cause of death was determined to be a strong blow to the back of the head. The possible murder weapon, a steam iron, was found next to the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">On January 26, 1982, an information was filed charging Jeremiah Trevino and Leonard L. Rivas, friends of the deceased, each with one count of murder (\u00a7 187) with a special circumstances allegation that the murder was committed during the commission or attempted commission of a robbery. (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 190.2, subd. (a)(17).) Both men pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">During the jury selection phase of the trial, the district attorney used peremptory challenges to exclude six Spanish surnamed individuals called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to sit on the panel of twelve: Gloria Longoria, Justina Gonzalez, Mary Silvas, Catalina Martinez, Alex Faci\u00f3 and Robert Guerrero.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No Spanish surnamed jurors remained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Following the prosecutor\u2019s exclusion of the sixth Spanish surnamed juror, the defense advised the court that it wished to make a <em>Wheeler </em>motion regarding the district attorney\u2019s seemingly automatic removal of this distinct group of jurors. The court apparently told the defense to wait until the three alternate jurors had been selected before pursuing the motion. During the selection of alternates, the district attorney peremptorily challenged one Spanish surnamed juror, Arnold Rocha, without questioning him on voir dire, but allowed another Spanish surnamed juror, Marcene Rocha, to remain as an alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The defense then made a <em>Wheeler </em>motion, chronicling the district attorney\u2019s behavior as a violation of the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. The trial court called upon the prosecutor to explain his exclusion of the Spanish surnamed jurors and accepted the proffered justifications. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The trial commenced on June 29, 1982. Wilma Nyberg, a neighbor of the deceased, testified for the prosecution that, at approximately 3 p.m. on the day in question, she saw a man she identified as Trevino exiting Hinton\u2019s apartment. At the same time, she heard a groan, and what sounded like Hinton saying \u201coh no,\u201d coming from inside the apartment. Immediately thereafter, a tall, slender, clean-shaven man emerged from the apartment. This man carried himself in the same manner as Rivas did in the courtroom. Both he and the first man appeared intoxicated. The two unsuccessfully attempted to start a light colored car<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> parked in front of Hinton\u2019s apartment. As Nyberg entered her apartment, she saw that the two men were rocking the car to try to start it. Later that afternoon she noticed that the car and the men were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Nyberg testified that she had attended a physical lineup in November 1981 where she had been able to identify Trevino as one of the men she saw, but she was unable to positively identify Rivas. Two days prior to the physical lineup she had been shown a photographic lineup, which included Rivas\u2019 picture. Nyberg identified a different person as the second man she had seen at the Hinton apartment. Nyberg testified that she had been shown other photographic displays and had identified Rivas, but the parties later stipulated to the fact that Nyberg was mistaken, as she had never been shown any other such lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Sergeant Wittman, the investigating officer who had shown Nyberg the photo display in 1981, testified that the picture of Rivas included in that display was taken the day after Hinton\u2019s death. Contrary to Nyberg\u2019s description of the second man she saw, the picture revealed that Rivas did not appear to be slender at the time and did have a moustache.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Nyberg admitted on the stand that \u201ceven today I can\u2019t positively identify Mr. Rivas other than he is the type of man that came through that corridor. \u201d The only other evidence linking Rivas to the scene of the crime was one fingerprint found on a dresser drawer. The expert who dusted Hinton\u2019s apartment for prints testified that he also found one of Trevino\u2019s prints on the dresser, and two of Hinton\u2019s prints and two of another individual\u2019s on a whiskey bottle in the living room. The expert was unable to estimate the age of the prints, admitting that they could have been made months earlier. Another prosecution witness confirmed that Trevino, Rivas and members of Trevino\u2019s family visited Hinton on occasion and referred to him affectionately as \u201cPrimo.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The prosecution also introduced evidence that Trevino and Rivas were seen together on the day of the crime. The two had visited Trevino\u2019s girlfriend in the hospital sometime after 6 a.m. when she gave birth to a child. The prosecution failed in its efforts to pinpoint the time with any greater accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defendants moved for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence. (\u00a7 1118.1.) The court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Defense witnesses testified that they had seen Hinton alive on the day in question at 2:30 p.m. and at 4 p.m. The defendants did not testify. At this point the defense renewed the motions for acquittal, which the court again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The jury found the defendants guilty of first degree murder with a finding that the special circumstances allegation was true. The court set aside the special circumstances finding as to both Trevino and Rivas. The defendants then moved for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence to support the murder convictions. (\u00a7 1181.) The court denied the motion as to Trevino, but granted as to Rivas. Trevino received a 25 years to life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Rivas later pled not guilty to the charges of murder and robbery contained in an amended information. The second trial court then allowed him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>change his plea to once in jeopardy (\u00a7 1016), and discharged him on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We deal first with the issue whether the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude the jurors in question violated Trevino\u2019s constitutional right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258.) Before reaching the merits of this claim, a review of the fundamental nature of the right in question, and the role of the prosecutor in safeguarding that right, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe purpose of [the] jury is to guard against the exercise of arbitrary power\u2014to make available the commonsense judgment of the community as a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor and in preference to the professional or perhaps overconditioned or biased response of a judge [citations].\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 522, 530 [42 L.Ed.2d 690, 698, 95 S.Ct. 692].)  The representative cross-section requirement is designed to serve several related functions, each of which complements this central role of the jury in our system of justice. First, and foremost in the eyes of the criminal defendant whose fate lies in the jurors\u2019 hands, the representative cross-section requirement protects, to the greatest extent possible, the right to be tried by an impartial jury. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 527-528 [42 L.Ed.2d at pp. 696-697]; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 266, 271-272; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 740, 754 [278 P.2d 9].) Of equal import to our overall concept of justice, the fair cross-section rule serves to \u201clegitim[ize] the judgments of the courts, promot[e] citizen participation in government, and <em>prevent[] further stigmatizing of minority </em>groups. \u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 267, fn. 6.) Certainly these interests are not advanced, but thwarted, by systematic exclusion from the jury of an identifiable group within the community. (See Note, <em>Limiting the Peremptory Challenge: Representation of Groups on Petit Juries </em>(1977) 86 Yale L.J. 1715, 1735-1738.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">These interests, we have noted, are essential to the integrity and continued vitality of our judicial system. For this reason, the representative cross-section rule is not limited in application to traditional minority groups alone. Thus, in <em>Theil </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 217 [90 L.Ed. 1181, 66 S.Ct. 984, 166 A.L.R. 1412], the high court held that exclusion of daily wage earners from jury service violated the cross-sectional requirement, threatening \u201cthe subtle undermining of the jury system.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 225 [90 L.Ed. at p. 1187].) The court cautioned that the rule does not mean \u201cthat every jury must contain representatives of all the economic, social, reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>gious, racial, political and geographic groups in the community; . . . [b]ut it does mean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials without systematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 220 [90 L.Ed. at p. 1185].) To hold otherwise, the high court stressed, \u201cwould breathe life into any latent tendencies to establish the jury as the instrument of the economically and socially privileged. That we refuse to do.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 224 [90 L.Ed. at p. 1186].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">These concerns, nonetheless, are amplified in the context of discriminatory exclusion of a racial or ethnic minority group, as alleged in the present case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   As this court emphatically stated nearly 50 years ago, \u201c \u2018one who is on trial for an alleged crime is entitled to a jury from which individuals of his own race who are otherwise qualified as jurors in the particular case, have not been <em>arbitrarily excluded </em>merely because of their nationality, race or color.\u2019\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 535, 539 [86 P.2d 92].) Such exclusion is suggestive of \u201cdecision-making by racial stereotype, a technique that should be anathema in our courts.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 296, 299 [148 Cal.Rptr. 915, 583 P.2d 774].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Over 40 years ago, Justice Black admonished the courts that \u201c[f]or racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 128, 130 [85 L.Ed. 84, 86, 61 S.Ct. 164].) In <em>Wheeler, </em>we added that \u201cin such a war the courts cannot be pacifists.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 267.) Vigilant enforcement of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community is the single most effective weapon available in our constitutional arsenal to combat such exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Responsibility for the preservation of a defendant\u2019s cross-sectional rights does not fall exclusively on the shoulders of the court overseeing the selection of the petit jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prosecutor also shares in that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s role is a unique one within the criminal justice system. Though the district attorney must diligently discharge the duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>prosecuting individuals accused of criminal conduct, the prosecutor may not seek victory at the expense of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Greer) </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 255, 266 [137 Cal.Rptr. 476, 561 P.2d 1164]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 403 , 424 [186 Cal.Rptr. 283].) Thus, the prosecution is obligated to respect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial in compliance with due process of law. <em>(Berger </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1935) 295 U.S. 78, 88 [79 L.Ed. 1314, 1321, 55 S.Ct. 629]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 311, 318, 319 [303 P.2d 329]; <em>Fuller, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 424, fn. 26.) Moreover, the prosecutor may not bring criminal charges against an individual unless supported by probable cause, and, once charges are instituted, must reveal to the court any information which negates the existence of probable cause. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 7-102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s dual role, as the defendant\u2019s adversary and as a guardian of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, extends to the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude individuals from the jury.  The prosecutor is free to use the statutorily provided peremptory challenges in any manner he or she chooses, so long as that use does not obstruct the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. (See <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854],)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we held in <em>Wheeler, </em>use of peremptory challenges against jurors on the ground of group bias alone violates the right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 276-277.)  The prosecutor must be ever watchful to insure that in his or her conscientious efforts to efficiently discharge official duties the statutory right to peremptorily challenge jurors is not exalted over the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. (See <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 281, fn. 28; <em>Fuller, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The prosecutor further shares responsibility for protecting the accused\u2019s cross-sectional rights because he or she acts on behalf of the state in conducting criminal prosecutions. (See <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pactman </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 409 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>[47 L.Ed.2d 128, 96 S.Ct. 984].)  As we noted in <em>Greer, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 255, \u201cthe role of the prosecutor ... [is not] simply a specialized version of the duty of any attorney not to overstep the bounds of permissible advocacy .... In all his activities, his duties are conditioned by the fact that he \u2018is the representative not of any ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all . . . (Id., at p. 266.) Thus, the prosecutor must execute the duties of this representative office diligently and fairly, avoiding even the appearance of impropriety that might reflect poorly on the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In the context of jury selection, the prosecutor must take care to exercise peremptory challenges for legitimate purposes only, ever mindful of the prosecutor\u2019s role as a representative of the state. The use of group stereotypes as the sole criterion for the exercise of these challenges not only violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, but attributes discriminatory intent to the state as well, detracting from the legitimacy of the state-imposed process. \u201c[P]art of the function of the jury is to ensure that the public will feel its conscience is reflected in the verdict .... To allow the prosecutor to exercise peremptory challenges based on group affiliation alone casts a shadow on the appearance of integrity which must of necessity underlie public identification with the verdict.\u201d (Note, <em>The Defendant\u2019s Right to Object to Prosecutorial Misuse of the Peremptory Challenge </em>(1979) 92 Harv. L. Rev. 1770, 1782.) The prosecutor, as an officer of the state, must take extra pains to insure that use of peremptory challenges does not result in a violation of an accused\u2019s right to be tried by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community.  The courts, in turn, must be vigilant in seeing to it that prosecutors do not overstep the constitutional bounds of the cross-section requirement in selecting members of the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We turn to the merits of the case at bench.  In <em>Wheeler </em>we formulated a three-part seriatim test by which a defendant can challenge the prosecutor\u2019s misuse of peremptory challenges to strike jurors on the basis of group bias alone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To make out a prima facie case of discriminatory exclusion, the defendant must establish: (1) \u201c[A]s complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the persons excluded are members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of a cognizable group . . and (3) \u201ca strong likelihood that such persons are being challenged because of their group association rather than because of any specific bias.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 280.) Once the defendant satisfies these requirements to the court\u2019s satisfaction, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to show that the jurors in question were legitimately excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the case at bench, the trial court did call upon the prosecutor to justify his use of peremptories to eliminate the Spanish surnamed jurors after the defendants, in a <em>Wheeler </em>motion, brought this systematic exclusion to the court\u2019s attention. In ruling on the motion, the court explicitly referred to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cburden of justification.\u201d  Nonetheless, the People assert that Trevino failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wheeler </em>test in that he did not establish that the excluded jurors were members of a cognizable class.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 36 [201 Cal.Rptr. 782, 679 P.2d 433], this court expressly recognized Hispanics as a cognizable class for purposes of determining whether a defendant has made out a prima facie case of constitutionally invalid selection of the jury pool.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Responding to the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cBlacks and Hispanics\u201d were discriminatorily excluded from jury service, we concluded: \u201cBoth Blacks and Hispanics share with other members of their groups a common perspective arising from their respective experiences as a group, and no other members of the community are capable of adequately representing their perspective. Thus, Blacks and Hispanics are cognizable groups for purposes of fair cross-section analysis. (See, e.g., <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Partida, supra, </em>430 U.S. 482, 495 []; <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 20, fn. 45 [].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Many ties bind Hispanics together as a cognizable group within the community. Hispanics often share an ethnic and cultural \u201ccommunity of interest,\u201d including language, history, music and religion. In addition, Hispanics have made notable achievements in the professions, the arts, industry and public life. On a more somber note, Hispanics, in relation to other Americans, share a host of harsh realities, such as relatively high unemployment, poverty, relative lack of educational opportunity and, of import to the present case, discrimination directed at them precisely because they are Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In the case at bar, the defense presented its <em>Wheeler </em>motion by referring to the district attorney\u2019s systematic elimination of \u201cSpanish surnamed\u201d ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>rors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue, therefore, is whether the term \u201cSpanish surnamed\u201d is sufficiently descriptive of Hispanics, a cognizable class within the community. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 475 [98 L.Ed. 866, 74 S.Ct. 667], the high court expressly rejected the argument that Spanish surnames do not identify a definable segment of the population. In holding that the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican descent from jury service violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the court stated: \u201cThe State challenges any reliance on names as showing the descent of persons in the County. However, just as persons of a different race are distinguished by color, these Spanish names provide ready identification of the members of this class.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 480, fn. 12 [98 L.Ed. at p. 871].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Twenty-three years after <em>Hernandez, </em>the high court reaffirmed the propriety of using Spanish surnames to define the relevant class of persons discriminatorily excluded from jury service in a given case. In <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Partida </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 482 [51 L.Ed.2d 498, 97 S.Ct. 1272], the court noted: \u201cFor our purposes, the terms \u2018Spanish-surnamed\u2019 and \u2018Mexican-American\u2019 are used as synonyms for the census designation \u2018Persons of Spanish Language or Spanish Surname.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 486, fn. 5 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 505].) The court then went on to determine that automatic elimination of persons from grand jury service on the basis of the \u201creadily identifiable\u201d characteristic of having a Spanish surname <em>(id., </em>at p. 497 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 512]) unconstitutionally discriminated against \u201cMexican-Americans\u201d13 in the county in question. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 496-499 [51 L.Ed.2d at pp. 511-513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>We judicially notice<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that governmental agencies have made extensive use of the category \u201cSpanish surnamed\u201d in compiling statistics on various aspects of American life; 2,222,185 Californians chose the category \u201cSpanish surname\u201d in responding to the 1970 census. (Californians of Spanish Surname (Fair Employment Practices Com., Div. of Fair Employment Practices (June 1976) p. 57).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the 1980 census did not include a \u201cSpanish surname\u201d response,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Bureau of the Census continues to maintain and update a census list of Spanish surnames.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also compiles and publishes employment statistics on the basis of Spanish surnames. The commission defines the designation as follows: \u201cThe term Spanish surnamed American has been adopted ... to describe all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Spanish origin. The term is meant to coincide with other terms employed by data collectors and analysists to denote the same group\u2014 for instance, Hispanic, persons of Spanish origin, Spanish Americans, persons of Spanish language.\u201d (The Employment Status of Spanish Surnamed Americans in the New York SMS A (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Com., Research Rep. No. 42 (June 1974) p. iv).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Governmental categorization by Spanish surname signifies more than simple utility in statistical compilation. It demonstrates a broader understanding that individuals bearing those names represent a discrete segment of the population based on ethnic commonality.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In common parlance, the Spanish surname designation refers to Hispanics. The term Hispanic is formally defined as \u201cAmerican[s] of Spanish or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Latin-American descent.\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (2d college ed. 1982) pp. 613-614.) The Hispanic Policy Development Project<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> defines \u201cHispanic\u201d in the following manner: \u201c[T]he term \u2018Hispanic\u2019 refers to all individuals who were classified as \u2018Persons of Spanish Origin or Descent\u2019 by the 1980 census. \u2018Persons of Spanish Origin or Descent,\u2019 and therefore \u2018Hispanics,\u2019 are those who classified themselves in one of the specific Spanish origin categories listed on the census questionnaire\u2014Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban\u2014as well as those who indicated that they were of other Spanish/ Hispanic origin.\u201d (Hispanic Policy Development Project, The Hispanic Almanac (1984) p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The bulk of the case law analyzing representative cross-section claims involves discrimination against a cognizable class defined by race or sex. (See, e.g., <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri </em>(1979) 439 U.S. 357 [58 L.Ed.2d 579, 99 S.Ct. 664] (women); <em>Taylor, supra, </em>419 U.S. 522 (women); <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258 (blacks); <em>Johnson, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 296 (blacks); <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 161 (blacks).) This type of discrimination, based on physical attributes, often is more easily isolated than ethnic discrimination, which may turn on some nonphysical characteristic such as a name, an accent or a style of dress. Nonetheless, these more subtle forms of ethnic discrimination are no less reprehensible than the most overt race or sex discrimination. In <em>Wheeler </em>we condemned group bias on the basis of \u201cracial, religious, <em>ethnic, </em>or similar grounds.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 276.) We must not close our eyes to such bias simply because it may be cloaked in the guise of neutrality.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the use of Spanish surnames to exclude jurors is sufficiently indicative of a systematic effort to excuse Hispanics to satisfy the requirements of the <em>Wheeler </em>test. Spanish surnames identify Hispanics, a cognizable class. Although the correlation between surname and group membership is not exact, such precision is unnecessary. Where, as here, no one knows at the time of challenge whether a particular individual who has a Spanish surname is Hispanic, a showing that jurors are being excluded on the basis of surname alone constitutes a prima facie case of exclusion of a cognizable class.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The argument that Trevino failed to establish a \u201ccognizable class\u201d for fair cross-section purposes because he did not prove up the national origin of each excluded Spanish surnamed juror, mischaracterizes Trevino\u2019s motion and the <em>Wheeler </em>test itself. National origin is a relevant inquiry only where the motion is premised on that basis. Where, as here, the motion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>based on ethnic identification, voir dire regarding national origin is unnecessarily intrusive upon the defendant\u2019s legitimate interests. In <em>Wheeler, </em>we imposed no requirement that the defendant establish that systematically excluded black jurors were of Afro-American, Caribbean, African or Latin American descent. To graft such a requirement on to the <em>Wheeler </em>test in the context of exclusion of an ethnic group easily identified on the basis of surname is to place an unwarranted and impractical burden on the defendant\u2019s ability to preserve his representative cross-section rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In <em>Wheeler </em>we stressed that \u201cveniremen are not required to announce their race, religion, or ethnic origin when they enter the box, and these matters are not ordinarily explored on voir dire. The reason, of course, is that the courts of California are\u2014or should be\u2014blind to all such distinctions among our citizens.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 263. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 776, 782, fn. 5 [102 Cal.Rptr. 277] (\u201cour officials are very properly colorblind\u201d).) In the present case, defense counsels\u2019 decision to make the <em>Wheeler </em>motion on the basis of easily identifiable surnames, rather than risk juror animosity in quizzing selected individuals as to whether or not they are Mexican-American, was proper. The prosecution cannot avoid the fact that the defendant identifies a cognizable class by suggesting an additional requirement of statistical perfection based on national origin. \u201cA party does not sustain his burden of justification by attempting to cast a different burden on his opponent.\u201d <em>(1Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 283, fn. 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Although the defense need not establish the nationality of excluded Spanish surnamed jurors, the composition of the relevant Hispanic community may be telling. This is particularly true in the instant case. For purposes of fair cross-section analysis, the relevant demographic community is the county in which the trial takes place. We judicially notice the 1980 census results, which indicate that 73,298 persons of Spanish origin live in Tulare County, approximately 30 percent of the total population of the county (total=245,738). This Spanish origin population is overwhelmingly of Mexican descent. A full 94 percent of the Spanish origin population, 68,985 individuals, chose the Mexican descent response in completing the census questionnaire. (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1980 Census of Population, vol. 1, Characteristics of Population, ch. B, General Population Characteristics, pt. 6, Cal. table 51 (July 1984).)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These statistics further indicated that the defense did identify a cognizable class in making the <em>Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In addition to identifying a cognizable group, Trevino satisfied the final prong of the <em>Wheeler </em>test, that of showing \u201ca strong likelihood\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>peremptories are being used to exclude the group in question. <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 280.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Trevino and Rivas are Hispanic. The victim of the crime was Caucasian, as were most of the members of the jury. The district attorney exercised peremptory challenges to remove six Hispanics from the jury after asking them few if any questions on voir dire. In making the <em>Wheeler </em>motion, the defense described these excluded jurors as \u201cmale and female, young, middle-aged and older, [of] differing backgrounds, from different areas of the county.\u201d (Fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>The prosecution left a solitary Spanish surnamed juror on the panel as an alternate, but only after the defense advised the court that it intended to make the <em>Wheeler </em>motion. These factors, taken together, create the requisite \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that the prosecution was abusing the peremptory challenge by eliminating Hispanics, as a group, from jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Once the defense made out a prima facie case, the burden shifted to the prosecution to rebut the inference of impermissible group bias. In determining whether the prosecution has satisfied this burden, the court must not consider the proffered justifications in terms of the district attorney\u2019s \u201c \u2018judgment\u2019 or \u2018sincerity,\u2019 \u201d but must determine whether the \u201cground of challenge was a specific bias on the part of the individual juror.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 284, fn. 32.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It appears that the trial court failed to adhere to this principle in ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">After calling upon the prosecutor to justify his use of peremptories against the six Spanish surnamed jurors and listening to the reasons offered, the trial court denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motion. In so ruling, the court stated: \u201cMr. Faller has sustained his burden of justification that the use of the peremptory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>challenges against these particular named jurors was for specific reasons which he explained on the record; [n]ot that they were necessarily members of a certain ethnic group, but because of their particular age or sex, he excused them for those reasons and other specific reasons such as with one juror he mentioned the fact that he had a relative convicted of [a] similar offense or a crime. And these explanations seem to fall within the reasonable use of the peremptory challenges for bias or implied bias that counsel might want to use. For that reason the motion would be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">It appears that the trial court was confusing \u201cspecific reason\u201d with \u201cspecific bias.\u201d In <em>Wheeler, </em>we defined \u201cspecific bias\u201d as \u201ca bias relating to the particular case on trial or the parties or witnesses thereto.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 276.)  A review of the record demonstrates that the prosecutor did not, in fact, satisfy his burden of showing that he excluded the Spanish surnamed jurors on the grounds of specific, not group, bias.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Our conclusion in <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 168, that disparate treatment of the members of the excluded group and the unchallenged jurors is indicative of group bias, guides our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The district attorney relied on age as the most compelling factor underlying his use of peremptories against this group. He voiced his concern that these particular jurors lacked maturity and that they might be close to the same age as the defendants. However, the district attorney made no effort to determine the jurors\u2019 ages on voir dire nor did he inquire into any age-based biases the jurors might harbor. Justina Gonzalez, to whom the prosecutor objected as \u201cquite young\u201d had two children, ages eight and six. Gloria Longoria who was \u201csomewhat younger than ... I would have ideally preferred\u201d had children ages 14, 10 and 7. Mary Silvas\u2019 oldest child was 18. It is doubtful that these jurors were the same age as Trevino who was 22 at the time of trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the prosecutor did not challenge Richard Mifko who was about the same age as the defendants. His asserted explanation for this disparity, that Mifko was a professional, is questionable. Mifko was an unemployed accountant. Taken as a whole, the district attorney\u2019s age justifications do not rise to the level of specific bias required by <em>Wheeler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The prosecution also found it troublesome that Silvas\u2019 eighteen-year-old child was close in age to at least one defendant. Although the district attorney feared that this might influence Silvas to identify with the defendants, he apparently had no similar concerns regarding juror Bernor who had a. 16-year-old son, juror Hobbs who had a 19-year-old son or juror Miller whose son was either 20 or 22 years old.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The district attorney\u2019s inconsistent approach is further exemplified by his admission that the fact that jurors Longoria and Silvas were female influenced his decision to excuse them. Not only is it difficult to imagine how these jurors\u2019 sex in any way translates into specific bias in the case, it is even harder to do so given the fact that five women sat on the final jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Likewise, the district attorney indicated he was bothered by the fact that several of the Spanish surnamed jurors had no strong opinion on the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>penalty, but he did not seem to mind that most of the members of the group ultimately empaneled were similarly noncommittal. During the <em>Witherspoon </em>examination, juror Burford expressed ambivalence about capital punishment and juror Foster was \u201cperplexed.\u201d Although juror Hicks had done some reading on the subject, he had yet to develop an opinion pro or con, and juror Bernor not only had not read anything on the death penalty, but also \u201creally hadn\u2019t given that much thought in it\u201d and had no opinion. In all, seven of the empaneled jurors had no particular opinion about the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Finally, the district attorney\u2019s reason for excluding Robert Guerrero based on his body language and mode of answering certain questions, is particularly untenable in light of <em>Wheeler\u2019\u2019 </em>s requirement of a showing of specific bias.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In a similar vein, the district attorney condemns Longoria for expressing herself \u201crather haltingly,\u201d then takes the opposite approach and criticizes Gonzalez\u2019 perceived verbosity. The internal inconsistencies in the district attorney\u2019s reasoning, coupled with the obvious lack of uniformity in application of this reasoning, lead to the conclusion that, with the exception of Alex Faci\u00f3, and possibly Catalina Martinez, the Spanish surnamed jurors were excluded for reasons other than those presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In <em>Wheeler, </em>this court noted that the prosecution might sustain its burden by a showing that it peremptorily challenged similarly situated members of the majority group on identical or comparable grounds. <em>(Id., </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 282.) Such a comparison must be presented to the trial court at the time the prosecution attempts to justify the challenges made to members of the cognizable class.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This the district attorney failed to do. Moreover, the reasons given for excluding the cognizable class are scarcely more believable than those we rejected in <em>Hall, </em>where we emphasized the trial court\u2019s substantial responsibility to seriously consider the prosecutor\u2019s justifications in light of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. <em>(Id., </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 167-169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">As the Court of Appeal correctly noted, \u201cThe reasons given for excluding Gloria Longoria, Justina Gonzalez, Mary Silvas, Catalina Martinez and Robert Guerrero are suspect to say the least. If such reasons suffice to show that the prosecutor did not predicate his peremptory challenges to the Mex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ican-American jurors on the basis of group bias, then the cross-representative rule could be evaded easily in every case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Our Constitution and system of justice cannot and should not tolerate such a result. \u201cIt demeans the Constitution to declare a fundamental personal right under that charter and at the same time make it virtually impossible for an aggrieved citizen to exercise that right.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Trevino stated a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of a cognizable group from the petit jury, and the prosecution failed to sustain its burden of showing that the jurors were not peremptorily excluded as a result of group bias. The conviction must, therefore, be set aside because of a denial of Trevino\u2019s right to an impartial jury under article I, section 16 of the California Constitution. As a result, we need not reach Trevino\u2019s remaining contentions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We now consider whether requiring Rivas to stand trial again would constitute double jeopardy after the trial court, in granting his motion for a new trial, stated that the evidence was \u201cinsufficient as a matter of law.\u201d We conclude that it would, but not because of error committed in granting that motion. Instead, the trial court erred earlier in not reaching the identical result when it considered Rivas\u2019 motions for judgment of acquittal (\u00a7 1118.1). As Rivas was entitled to a judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction, the double jeopardy clause bars his retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In granting Rivas\u2019 motion for a new trial pursuant to section 1181, subdivision 6<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the trial court prefaced its statement by defining what it considered to be the appropriate standard of review: \u201cA motion for a new trial made by a defendant on the basis that substantial evidence does not support his conviction requires a review of the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence such that a trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>This is the test applied by the reviewing courts, and by this trial court, </em>in considering this motion.\u201d (Italics added.) The court then reviewed the evidence and concluded: \u201c. . . [t]his court cannot view Ms. Nyberg\u2019s identification testimony as other than insubstantial and not sufficient to identify Rivas as being at the scene of the crime. [H] Other than the testimony of Ms. Nyberg the evidence linking Rivas to the slaying is negligible .... [|] Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, leaves this court with the conclusion that the evidence as to the defendant Rivas is insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> jn fact, trial courts <em>do not </em>employ the same standard as reviewing courts do in weighing the sufficiency of the evidence on a section 1181 motion for a new trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289].)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>\n                   This is not the case, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ever, with a motion for judgment of acquittal under section 1118.1.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In considering a section 1118.1 motion, the trial court is duty bound to apply the same test as does an appellate court in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment of conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 640, 666 [159 Cal.Rptr. 818, 602 P.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The standard of review applicable to a section 1118.1 motion is essentially the one the trial court erroneously used in ruling on Rivas\u2019 motion for a new trial. The court must determine \u201c \u2018whether from the evidence, including reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is any substantial evidence of the existence of each element of the offense charged.

It strains logic to rule during trial that the evidence is sufficient to preclude acquittal, and rule after trial that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the conviction, all the while applying the same standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">These conflicting rulings require us to make an initial determination as to the sufficiency of the evidence presented on the murder charge. If the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law, then the trial court erred in not granting the motion for acquittal and Rivas\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss. If, on the other hand, substantial evidence existed to support the conviction on appeal, then all of the trial court\u2019s rulings would be correct, and the reasons given for granting the new trial could be safely ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A review of the evidence suggests that it is insufficient as a matter of law. Because the trial court, in ruling on the motion for a new trial, accurately summarized the state of the evidence at the time the prosecution rested its case, we excerpt that discussion:<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he People rely heavily on the testimony of Mrs. Nyberg to show the presence of Rivas at the apartment at or about the time of Ted Hinton\u2019s death. However, Mrs. Nyberg was never able to positively identify Rivas as the second man at the apartment. She described the second man as tall and slender; that he walked very erect with his head up. She was not positive that it was Rivas but she saw a similarity in the way Rivas carries himself and that the second man had no moustache. In contrast to this identification testimony, Rivas was not, at that time, slender and he did have a moustache [elicited on cross-examination of Sergeant Wittman regarding a photograph of Rivas taken by the police on the day following the alleged murder]. Additionally, Mrs. Nyberg, despite her recollection of viewing several photo lineups of Rivas, [actually] only looked at one set of photos which included Rivas\u2019 picture, and she identified a Pat Juarez as the second person she saw at the apartment. Moreover, evidence was adduced indicating that Mrs. Nyberg attended a live lineup in which Rivas was present, but no further testimony was offered as to any identification she may have made at the live lineup. Further contradictions appear in Mrs. Nyberg\u2019s testimony as to the posture and manner of walking of the person alleged to be Rivas [Wittman testified that Nyberg told him that the man \u2018walked like he was intoxicated\u2019]. . . . [t] The fingerprint evidence cannot be considered substantially incriminating. The fact that Rivas\u2019 thumbprint was found on one of the unopened dresser drawers [the fourth drawer down of a five drawer chest-high dresser] in the victim\u2019s bedroom is susceptible of various interpretations .... The expert witness could not determine the age of the print, hence there is no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>to presume the print was made on the day of the murder as opposed to some previous occasion. [Rivas had been a guest in Hinton\u2019s home.] The evidence as to how or when the print came to be placed on the dresser is fraught with uncertainty, leaving the triers of fact to speculate as to how and when the print was made. This kind of guesswork as to the facts does not elevate speculation to the level of reasonable inference. [Citation.] [f] The testimony that Rivas was seen with Trevino before the crime [sometime after 6 a.m. Rivas, Trevino and Trevino\u2019s sister visited Trevino\u2019s girlfriend in the hospital] . . . does \u2018no more than generate suspicion, which will not support a conviction.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The only prosecution evidence that the trial court failed to chronicle in the above discussion is the testimony of the doctor who performed the autopsy estimating the time of death as a full day before both the defense and the prosecution agree the crime was committed. This, then, is the sum total of the evidence presented by the prosecution in its case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In denying Rivas\u2019 motion for acquittal at this point in the proceedings, the trial court opined: \u201cI think it\u2019s enough [evidence] . . . certainly to put Trevino there. As far as substantial evidence, it\u2019s more difficult to make that assessment as far as Rivas is concerned because the testimony regarding identification of him is based primarily on the feeling as far as concepts he has about the way he walks and holds himself. I suppose that\u2019s sufficient identification testimony to put before the jury, albeit, pretty weak. So far as putting the defendants at the scene, I think the direct evidence plus some circumstantial evidence gives rise to circumstantial evidence from which inferences can be derived that I could say could be reasonable\u2014not totally unreasonable or totally speculative or guesswork about the crime itself of Murder . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The evidence, or lack thereof, indicates that this ruling was in error with regard to Rivas. The highly speculative and equivocal identification testimony and the solitary fingerprint of some unknown vintage do not constitute evidence which is \u201creasonable, credible and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 578.) Because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law, Rivas was entitled to a judgment of acquittal when he made his initial section 1118.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s denial of the renewed motion for acquittal after the defense rested was in error. This motion generated a good deal of discussion between the bench and counsel, centered around the credibility of the witnesses with regard to the actual time of death. Countering defense counsel\u2019s repeated assertion that the final defense witness\u2019 testimony con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>clusively undermined Nyberg\u2019s testimony that the victim was killed at 3 p.m., the court simply emphasized and re-emphasized that the argument boiled down to a question of which witness the jury would believe. The court concluded that the credibility of the witnesses was a question for the trier of fact and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">What the court overlooked in ruling on this motion was that the dispute as to the time of death was of little consequence to Rivas\u2019 right to acquittal. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as the court must do on a motion for acquittal, there simply was no substantial evidence putting Rivas at the scene at the time Nyberg asserted the crime occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The court actually indicated as much when it observed, during this discussion that, \u201c[t]he evidence is . . . inconsistent. In my opinion it raises . . . reasonable doubt. There is some question in my mind whether the evidence is substantial. I think that term \u2018substantial\u2019 bothers me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">This concern over the question of substantiality evaporated when the court, in evaluating the motion for a new trial, emphasized: \u201cEven if the court assumes that the jury discounted entirely the testimony of [the defense witnesses] as to the time they last observed the victim alive, this court cannot view Mrs. Nyberg\u2019s identification testimony as other than insubstantial and not sufficient to identify Rivas as being at the scene of the crime. Other than the testimony of Mrs. Nyberg, the evidence linking Rivas to the slaying is negligible.\u201d The court was compelled to conclude that \u201cthe evidence as to the defendant Rivas is insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Considering the evidence, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the motions for acquittal and the reasoning it offered to justify the grant of a new trial, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the trial court may have been holding off on dismissing the charges against Rivas to allow the prosecution time to somehow bolster its case.  Indeed, the trial court\u2019s ruling on Rivas\u2019 motion to dismiss (\u00a7 1385),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> issued the same day as its ruling on the motion for a new trial, supports this conclusion.  The court denied the motion to dismiss the murder charge as to Rivas for three reasons: \u201cthe evidence indicative of guilt, the nature of the crime involved, and the likelihood of additional evidence being presented upon a retrial.\u201d As we have seen, the trial court clearly did not believe the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>reason, nor is it supported by the evidence. As the second reason is necessarily tied to the first, it too must fall. This leaves the third reason which, in this case, would represent a direct violation of the double jeopardy clause. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 209-210 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91].) As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1 [57 L.Ed.2d 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141], \u201cthe purposes of the Clause would be negated were we to afford the government the opportunity for the proverbial \u2018second bite at the apple.\u2019 \u201d (Id., at p. 17 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Rivas\u2019 situation, in this respect, is indistinguishable from that of the defendant in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 40 [67 L.Ed.2d 30, 101 S.Ct. 970], In <em>Hudson, </em>the high court held that Louisiana violated the double jeopardy clause by retrying a defendant for first degree murder after the trial court granted a new trial because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. The court also noted however, that Louisiana law does not allow trial courts to enter judgments of acquittal in jury trials, making the motion for a new trial a defendant\u2019s sole means of challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 41, fn. 1 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 32].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Although California law ordinarily provides both methods of challenge, it is virtually indistinguishable from the Louisiana system when the trial court precludes relief under the first of these methods by failing to seriously consider the evidence in light of the proper standard. This court cannot condone the evasion of a defendant\u2019s former jeopardy rights where, as here, the defendant is entitled to, but denied a judgment of acquittal. Given the facts of this case, the <em>Hudson </em>rule bars Rivas\u2019 retrial on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The conclusion of the second trial court that Rivas has been once in jeopardy on these charges (\u00a7 1016, subd. 5), and is therefore entitled to be discharged, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The judgment as to defendant Trevino is reversed and his cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.

She voiced no opinion as to the death penalty. She did finally say she would, as I recall, would possibly vote for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">\u201cShe was a fem\u00e1is [sic] juror and somewhat younger than that which I would have ideally preferred having.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">\u201cAnd I think the court will note, except with the exception of one of the jurors at issue, all of them were rather young approaching in age, the age of at least one of the defendants which caused me concern in regards to their identification with him in terms of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">\u201cWhile Mrs. Longoria was a housewife and her husband was self-employed, I believe in construction, she did in my opinion express herself rather haltingly during the, especially the Witherspoon examination of the jurors. And I had concern of her abilities to confer and to form an independent opinion as to the facts and her willingness to seriously consider and possibly vote for the death penalty in any penalty phase which we would find ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">\u201cIn regards to Justina Gonzalez, again, I found her to be quite young. She was very verbose and very interested in expressing her views on a great variety of subjects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">\u201cYet at the same time when approached even by defense counsel in regards to certain questions, she would say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to answer that,\u201d or \u201cI want to talk to you in private,\u201d and appeared to have a lack of confidence in her own ability to form opinions and to express herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-15\">\u201cAnd in regards, I did not feel she was the type of juror that would be able to cooly analyze the evidence. And in that regard be able to come to any type of rational decision based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-16\">\u201cConcerning Mary Silvas, again, she was also a female juror which was a factor in my decision to excuse her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-17\">\u201cWhile young in appearance, she did indicate that one of her children, I believe was eighteen years of age, which again would approach the age of at least one of the defendants. And I was concerned about identification with the defendants based upon the fact that she did have a child that would approximate the age of at least one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-18\">\u201cShe also, during the Witherspoon voiced no strong feelings against, regarding the death penalty. And indicated that she hadn\u2019t even thought about the question, even though she had been informed that it would be an issue in the case sometime before she appeared here for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>her Witherspoon interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cI found that to be somewhat serious and possibly a lack of commitment on her part to seriously consider the type of issues and make the tough decisions that were going to be required of jurors in this particular trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cAs far as Mr. Martinez was concerned, my just very feeling about him was that he really had no strong opinions about anything. He stated no particular opinion during the Wither-spoon interviews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201cAnd while he was tentative, he simply impressed me as someone that would simply go along with others on the jury and would not necessarily go to the trouble to form his own opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cThe Court: Which juror are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201cMr. Faller: Mr. Martinez, Catalina Martinez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cHe seemed to, at least in my opinion, have existed in something of a closed existence and, however, he did make an indication during general voir dire, that I believe his words were that he had friends that had been involved in stealing when they were growing up, and things of that nature. And that was also a factor in my decision to excuse him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">\u201cIn regards to Alex R. Faci\u00f3, your Honor, that particular juror is [szc] my recollection he indicated that he had, I believe it was, two brothers-in-law or a\u2014some level of such as that of relationship, who had been charged with murder; and in addition he also had, I believe he said, a cousin who had been a defendant of an armed robbery charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">\u201cAlso, during the Witherspoon interview I believe that this is one of those jurors which at one time expressed, under my questioning, a very definite opposition to the death penalty. But upon further questioning by either defense counsel or the court, I am not particularly sure which, indicated that there was a possibility that he might be able to vote for it. However, he had\u2014he had what I\u2019d interpreted and what I would call a basic opposition to the imposition of the death penalty, notwithstanding his ability to qualify under Witherspoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">\u201cIn regards to Mr. Guerrero, your Honor, I noted that during the voir dire examination, he sat with his arms folded, which indicated to me a little bit of a closed relationship with his fellow jurors. In addition, I notice an instance when defense counsel was inquiring of him [a]s to questions involving the presumption of innocence and the level of proof being beyond a reasonable doubt. He did not simply answer counsel\u2019s questions, but smiled and gave what I consider to be a reply that indicated some evasiveness on his part, either from counsel\u2019s questions, or some indication that there was something else in his mind regarding these subjects, which he was not expressing, which I interpreted to be something purposeful on his part to not fully open up and not fully answer questions and explain his thoughts behind the answers to the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">\u201cAlso I might indicate that, well, that is really all I have to say about Mr. Guerrero. It was really a question of manner in regards to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">\u201cI think it is particularly worth noting that I believe other than Mr. Faci\u00f3, Mr. Guerrero, Mr. Martinez, Miss Gonzalez, Mrs. Longoria, and at least Mrs. Silvas, in appearance, appeared to me to be very close in age, to at least one of the defendants. And that caused me concern in the fact that I did prefer to have more mature jurors to meet the kind of questions that were going to be presented in this case. And I felt there was a very strong possibility of age identification with the defendants that might not be present in more mature jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">\u201cSo we had more life experiences and in that regard I would have preferred their age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-17\">\u201cMr. Mifko, it might be noted is also perhaps close in age to either one or both of the defendants. However, he is an accountant. He had\u2014he is a professional person which I thought counterbalanced the possible maturity [sz'c] and lack of life experience on his part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-18\">\u201cAnd I think other than that, that all of the jurors who were finally chosen, finally sworn, were quite a bit more mature in basic overall age than those with the exception of Mr. Faci\u00f3, which were excused; at least in this group of which we were talking. And the age involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>in each of them, I would indicate to the court was a major consideration in my determination whether or not to excuse them.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Jurors Ogard and Ayers, members of the final panel, each had children between five and ten years old. Conceivably, therefore, these jurors were approximately the same age as Justina Gonzalez and Gloria Longoria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The dissent asserts that two of the district attorney\u2019s given reasons for excluding Silvas are legitimate: Silvas had a son approximately the same age as the defendant and Silvas had not considered the death penalty even though she was aware that it might be involved in this case. What the dissent ignores, is that juror Bernor who also had a son close in age to the defendants, had given no thought to the death penalty either. This is precisely the disparate treatment we identified in <em>Hall </em>as suggestive of group bias. (See <em>Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 168.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">To suggest, as does the dissent, that either body language <em>(post, </em>p. 703) or a conclusory notion that a juror might not form his own opinion <em>(post, </em>p. 703) rises to the level of specific bias in the <em>Wheeler </em>context, is to reduce the constitutional guarantee to meaningless superficialities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">It is the prosecution\u2019s responsibility to bring these circumstances to the trial court\u2019s attention. It is neither the function nor the duty of the trial courts, or the appellate courts on review, to speculate as to prosecutorial motivation for other peremptory challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On the first day of jury deliberations, the trial judge (Judge Allen) told the jury, off the record and out of the presence of the defendants and their lawyers, that each juror could have one alcoholic beverage with lunch if they so chose. Trevino contends that subsequent juror drinking prejudiced his right to a fair trial and that the judge\u2019s statement approving such indulgence constituted reversible error. It appears that neither contention is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The wealth of the case law dealing with the question of juror consumption of alcohol prior to hearing evidence or participating in deliberations reflects the general rule that no misconduct is established where it appears that the drinking did not affect the jurors\u2019 ability to perform their duties. (See <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 388, 412 [185 Cal.Rptr. 654, 650 P.2d 1171] and cases cited therein.) Affidavits submitted by the courtroom bailiffs and most of the jurors, as well as the judge\u2019s personal observation of the jurors, reveal no such impairment in the instant case. The trial court\u2019s denial of Trevino\u2019s motion for a new trial based on consumption of alcohol by jurors appears to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Likewise, the court\u2019s ex parte communication to the jurors regarding taking a drink with lunch did not prejudice Trevino. Because the facts suggest that the actual imbibing did not adversely affect jury deliberations, it follows that the court did not commit prejudicial error in condoning the activity. The communication was not prejudicial per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">This situation is unlike that discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 815, 848-850 [183 Cal.Rptr. 817, 647 P.2d 93], where the trial judge, without notice to counsel, sent exhibits into the jury room at the jury\u2019s request, after the panel had commenced deliberations. In <em>Hogan </em>we concluded that the failure to notify counsel constituted prejudicial error requiring reversal because the requested exhibits contained inadmissible and highly damaging material which counsel might well have prevented from getting to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Though Judge Allen\u2019s communication to the jurors was not prejudicial error, we strongly question its wisdom. The Court of Appeal explicitly refrained from approving this practice and assumed it was but an isolated incident in Tulare County. Unfortunately, however, the plethora of case law on the issue of juror drinking suggests that we cannot indulge this presumption as to the frequency and extent to which the problem arises in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">Juror consumption of alcoholic beverages should be strongly discouraged by the courts. The deliberative process, made all the more demanding by the tense atmosphere of the juryroom, requires jurors to perform their duties diligently and to the best of their ability. Any activity, like drinking, which may tend to impede juror performance and perception, should be shunned. Trial courts must exercise care to avoid even tacit approval of such activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Section 1181 states in relevant part: \u201cWhen a verdict has been rendered or a finding made against the defendant, the court may, upon his application, grant a new trial, in the following cases only: ... [1] 6. When the verdict or finding is contrary to law or evidence</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\u201cIn ruling upon a motion for a new trial, the trial court is required to independently weigh the evidence, but an appellate court will not modify or set aside the verdict if there is any substantial evidence to support it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 761.) The trial court\u2019s role is essentially that of the \u201c13th juror\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Robarge </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 628, 633-634 [262 P.2d 14]), except insofar as it concludes that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. As we observed in <em>Serrato: </em>\u201cThe function of a jury, when it finds the evidence insufficient, is to acquit. By contrast, the function of the court, ruling on a motion for new trial is to grant a new trial if it finds the evidence insufficient.

Instead, I believe we should adhere to the approach set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 282 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] and reiterated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 168 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854]\u2014\u201cwe rely on the good judgment of the trial courts to distinguish bona fide reasons for such peremptories from sham excuses belatedly contrived to avoid admitting acts of group discrimination.\u201d It is in this light that I review in some detail the specific reasons which the prosecutor gave for the peremptory challenges at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">First, however, some general observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">(1) This particular trial judge did precisely what the trial court in <em>Hall </em>failed to do: he made a \u201csincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s explanation in light of the circumstances as then known, his knowledge of trial techniques, and his observations of the manner in which the prosecutor has examined members of the venire and has exercised challenges for cause or peremptorily . . . .\u201d <em>(Hall, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 167-168.) In <em>Hall </em>the trial court made it known that it was abdicating its function and \u201capparently considered itself bound to accept all of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations at face value . . . .\u201d <em>{Id.., </em>at p. 169.) Nothing of the sort can be said here. Yet the majority gives no weight to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s veracity and instead assumes the crucial fact-finding role itself. So much for reliance on the \u201cgood judgment\u201d of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">(2) The majority focuses on the six Hispanics who were peremptorily excused by the prosecution and pretty well ignores the characteristics of the fifteen non-Hispanics who were similarly challenged and of the jurors and alternates who were eventually seated. This inevitably distorts the picture. For example, the majority discounts Faller\u2019s reason that he dismissed certain Hispanics because they had no strong views on the death penalty, pointing out that seven of the jurors eventually seated professed similar attitudes. Not discussed, however, are other characteristics of the seated jurors which might properly have neutralized this \u201cminus\u201d from the prosecution\u2019s point of view. Nor does the majority point out that Faller challenged four non-Hispanics\u2014Opal Jennings, Bonnie Goodwin, Patricia Olds, Laquita Brown\u2014who had no views on the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">(3) In this connection I note that the majority apparently objects to this dissent\u2019s comparing of the prosecution\u2019s claimed specific bias of challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Hispanics with similar characteristics of non-Hispanics who were also challenged by the People\u2014such as the non-views on the death penalty of prospective jurors Jennings, Goodwin, Olds and Brown. The majority says that \u201csuch a comparison must be presented to the trial court at the time the prosecution attempts to justify the challenges made to members of the cognizable class.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 692.) One cannot quarrel with that statement, but unless we are to assume that the trial judge had left the bench at the relevant times, he was of course aware of the voir dire examination which preceded the challenges to Jennings, Goodwin, Olds and Brown. Thus the majority\u2019s mandate that the comparison be before the trial court was amply fulfilled. While it was the prosecution\u2019s burden to show that its challenges were triggered by specific bias, I know of no rule which prohibits it from letting the record speak for itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">(4) The majority opinion states that \u201c [t]he district attorney exercised peremptory challenges to remove six Hispanics from the jury after asking them few if any questions on voir dire.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 687.) In so stating, the majority overlooks the fact that the <em>Witherspoon </em>examination is an integral part of voir dire. During the <em>Witherspoon </em>examination, Faller questioned Alex Faci\u00f3, Robert Guerrero, Justina Gonzalez, and Gloria Longoria. The only Spanish sumamed prospective juror that he did not question was Mary Silvas. The majority\u2019s observation is, therefore, incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Further, the majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that the prosecutor did not engage many of the Hispanic jurors in extended questioning is misleading in another respect. Faller was, of course, not the only one to question the jurors on voir dire. In this case, each juror was first questioned by the court and each of the two defense counsel, before the voir dire questioning passed to Faller. There is obviously nothing improper in an attorney exercising a peremptory challenge on the basis of impressions gained from a potential juror\u2019s responses to questions posed by the court or by other counsel. The record here discloses that Faller declined to pose additional questions to many of the potential jurors\u2014both non-Hispanic and Hispanic\u2014and that he exercised peremptory challenges with respect to a number of the non-Hispanic jurors whom he did not personally question. Thus, the trial court could reasonably have found that no inference of group bias arose from the fact that Faller excused some jurors without lengthy questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">With these preliminaries out of the way, I review the reasons Faller gave for peremptorily challenging the six Spanish surnamed jurors. I do not propose to rely on any bases for challenging the six prospective jurors other than those adduced by Faller.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\n<em>Alex Faci\u00f3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The majority concedes that this prospective juror was challenged for specific bias. It is, however, important to note that the reasons for challenging Faci\u00f3 were consistent with those given with respect to other prospective jurors. In brief, Faci\u00f3 had relatives charged with serious crimes and he was \u201csoft\u201d on the death penalty. Several non-Hispanics who were challenged shared similar attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\n<em>Catalina Martinez</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Fuller said he excused Martinez because he felt he did not have any strong opinions on anything and gave the impression that he would simply go along with the other jurors rather than form his own opinion and because Martinez went drinking with friends who steal. The majority apparently agrees with the Court of Appeal that the reasons given for his exclusion are \u201csuspect\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 692), but does not explain why.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The reasons are legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Martinez admitted that he had friends who steal. He said he went drinking with them. The special circumstance charged in defendants\u2019 murder trial was felony murder: it was alleged the murder was committed during the commission or attempted commission of a robbery. Martinez did not know whether his friendship with thieves would interfere with his ability to decide the case fairly. He conceded that it was \u201ctough to project what you are going to do.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so doing, he was admitting a specific bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Even though Martinez eventually responded to defense attorney questioning in such a way as to give the appearance that he could control his bias, the trial court could have determined that Fuller was justified in doubting Martinez\u2019 neutrality. The fact that Martinez admitted he might be biased provides a valid ground for challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Faller\u2019s second reason for dismissing Martinez\u2014that Martinez would simply go along with the other jurors rather than form his own opinion\u2014is also a valid ground for challenge, and the trial court could legitimately have accepted this justification as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>Robert Guerrero</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Faller indicated that he excused Guerrero because he sat with his arms folded during the voir dire\u2014which Faller felt indicated a closed relationship\u2014and because Faller did not believe Guerrero was sincere in his answers. The majority holds that \u201cexcluding Robert Guerrero based on his body language and mode of answering certain questions, is particularly untenable in light of Wheeler\u2019s requirement of a showing of specific bias.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 692.) In so holding, the majority has\u2014apparently inadvertently\u2014substantially changed the law surrounding peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We recognized in <em>Wheeler </em>that \u201ca prosecutor may fear bias on the part of one juror because he has a record of prior arrests or has complained of police harassment, and on the part of another <em>simply because his clothes or hair suggest an unconventional lifestyle. . . . Indeed, even less tangible evidence of potential bias may bring forth a peremptory challenge: either party may feel a mistrust of a juror\u2019s objectivity on no more than the \u2018sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another\u2019 </em>(4 Blackstone, Commentaries *353) <em>. . . .\u201d (Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 275, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">We recently reaffirmed this proposition in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854], where we held that \u201cA prosecutor may act freely on the basis of \u2018hunches,\u2019 unless and until these acts create a prima facie case of group bias, and even then he may rebut the inference.\u201d Clearly, therefore, an attorney may excuse a prospective juror because of a gut feeling. When an attorney does so, his concern is that the juror may be biased against his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The majority\u2019s rejection of body language as a basis for specific bias points up another reason why its evaluation of the trial court\u2019s ruling is quite unfair: the prosecutor was, of course, never asked to explain why he challenged 15 prospective jurors who were <em>not </em>Spanish sur named. We have no way of knowing how many of those 15 exhibited unacceptable body language just as we have very few clues as to the other reasons why they were excused. The majority therefore expresses doubts about the sincerity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations without knowing whether his reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>challenging non-Hispanics were perhaps entirely consistent with those he gave for challenging the Spanish surnamed jurors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Faller also felt that Guerrero\u2019s answers were evasive and indicated that he had \u201csomething else on his mind regarding these subjects which he was not expressing, ...\u201d The trial court, which found this explanation to be credible, had had an opportunity to observe the prospective juror during voir dire\u2014an advantage not shared by the majority which nevertheless feels that it is in a better position to judge Faller\u2019s credibility. The trial court could properly find that Faller had sustained his burden of justification for dismissing Guerrero.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\n<em>Justina Gonzalez</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Faller stated that he had excused Gonzalez because she was young, because she was defensive and lacked confidence, and because he did not think she could \u201ccooly analyze the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In explaining his challenge to several jurors, Faller expressed his desire to have a jury \u201ca bit more mature in basic overall age\u201d because he did not want to risk juror sympathy based on age identification with the defendants. The majority does not suggest that a juror\u2019s potential age identification with a particular defendant cannot give rise to specific bias, but simply rejects the prosecutor\u2019s professed reliance on this factor as insincere, in large part, apparently, because the prosecutor did not explicitly question the jurors as to their age. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 691.) It is hardly unusual, however, to make a rough judgment about age on the basis of appearance, and the trial court\u2014 who viewed the jurors in question\u2014evidently did not find the prosecutor\u2019s explanation suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In addition, the majority disbelieves Faller\u2019s explanation that he excused Gonzalez because she was defensive. The majority states that \u201cthe district attorney condemn[ed] Longoria for expressing herself \u2018rather haltingly,\u2019 then [took] the opposite approach and criticizefd] Gonzalez\u2019 perceived verbosity.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 692.) This is not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Faller never criticized Gonzalez\u2019 verbosity. On the contrary, he stated, apparently with approval, \u201c[Gonzalez] was very verbose and very interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>in expressing her views on a great variety of subjects, [f] <em>Yet at the same time </em>when approached even by defense counsel in regards to certain questions, she would say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to answer that,\u2019 or T want to talk to you in private,\u2019 and appeared to have a lack of confidence in her own ability to form opinions and to express herself.\u201d (Italics added.) Characterizing this as a criticism of her verbosity is simply incorrect. From the record it appears that Faller could have concluded in good faith that Gonzalez, while outwardly verbose, was actually defensive and lacked confidence. The trial court, of course, could find that he sustained his burden of justification in dismissing her on this ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\n<em>Mary Silvas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Faller explained that he had excused Silvas because she was female, had a child about the age of one of the defendants, and had not even thought about the death penalty\u2014which Faller felt indicated a lack of commitment to consider seriously what she would do during sentencing. Although the majority simply rejects each of these reasons as disingenuous, the trial court could reasonably have found that at least the last two reasons demonstrated that Faller had not excluded her because she was Hispanic. As discussed above, Faller excluded other jurors who he thought might feel undue sympathy for the defendants because of age identification and he excused at least one non-Hispanic juror, Jill Moffitt, who\u2014like Silvas\u2014had children of about the defendants\u2019 age. In addition, throughout the voir dire Faller utilized peremptory challenges frequently with respect to jurors who indicated either that they would not or might not vote for the death penalty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court could have found that Faller did not want to take a chance that Silvas\u2014 who stated that she had not even thought about the death penalty\u2014might decide that she could not impose such a penalty when called on to consider the issue during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\n<em>Gloria Longoria</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Faller informed the court that he had excused Longoria because he felt she was an equivocal juror during the <em>Witherspoon </em>examination and because she expressed herself rather haltingly. Faller explained that he was concerned that Longoria would be unable to reach a verdict independently or to consider seriously and vote for the death penalty. He also stated that he had excused her because she was female and younger than he would have preferred. In criticizing these explanations, the majority attacks only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>last two\u2014dismissal because of age or sex. The opinion omits any consideration of the merits of the other reasons Faller gave for dismissing Longoria. Certainly Faller could legitimately excuse a juror he felt was equivocal during the <em>Witherspoon </em>examination. Similarly, Faller\u2019s concern that Longoria would have been unable to form an opinion independently and reach a verdict was a valid ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">So that there will be no misunderstanding, I should make it clear that this dissent is not intended as a \u201cjury argument\u201d in favor of the prosecutor\u2019s professed reasons for challenging the six Hispanics. If the trial court had concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s explanations were not genuine and had found that the peremptory challenges to the six Hispanic jurors had been exercised because of supposed group bias, I would have no reason to quarrel with that determination. The trial court came to the opposite conclusion, however, and given its ability to view the prosecutor and the potential jurors in person and to evaluate the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations from that perspective, I submit that it is inappropriate\u2014and contrary to the teaching of <em>Wheeler </em>and Hall\u2014for us to brush aside the trial court\u2019s finding and substitute our own view of the matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Trevino raises other issues besides the <em>Wheeler </em>claim. I express no opinion with respect to any of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">To be fair, the majority also concedes that \u201cpossibly\u201d Catalina Martinez was excluded for the reasons stated by Fallen</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The following colloquy took place during the general voir dire: \u201cMr. Martinez: I have a lot of friends that, you know, they were Mexican friends and they used to go out and steal and all that, and I would just know them, you know.

Can you do that? [K] A Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\">I have my own hunch that what is really behind the majority\u2019s rejection of hunches, gut-feelings and body language is a fear that prosecutors will insincerely attempt to justify group bias with such reasons and that trial judges, some of whom are perceived as being unsympathetic toward the <em>Wheeler </em>rule, will rubber-stamp their explanations. I submit that if we cannot trust trial courts to do their job fairly, we might as well close up shop and that we, ourselves, were insincere when, in <em>Wheeler, </em>we professed our faith in the \u201cgood judgment\u201d of the trial bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Faller peremptorily challenged every juror who would not vote for the death penalty or who might be unable to shoulder the responsibility of imposing the death penalty. He also challenged Dorothy Lawrence and Mary Krider, both of whom stated they would be inclined to impose life without possibility of parole over the death penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b724-6\">LUCAS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">I concur in the judgment dismissing the charges against defendant Rivas, based on the insubstantiality of the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">I dissent, however, to the reversal of the judgment as to defendant Trevino. For the reasons aptly stated by Justice Kaus in his concurring and dissenting opinion, the trial court properly ruled that any inference of group bias was rebutted by the prosecutor. In addition, and unlike Justice Kaus, I believe that <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748], was incorrectly decided and should be reexamined.
