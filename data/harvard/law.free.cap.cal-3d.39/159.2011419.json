The petitioners (plaintiffs), Raul and Gloria Ochoa, are the surviving parents of Rudy Ochoa. The real parties in interest (defendants) are the County of Santa Clara and four alleged agents and employees of the county.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   The complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states that on February 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>1981, Rudy was admitted to the custody of Santa Clara County juvenile hall. On March 23, 1981, he became ill with an apparent cold. On March 23 and 24, he went to the infirmary for care and treatment. Rudy\u2019s parents visited him on March 24. They saw that he was \u201cextremely ill\u201d and was holding his left side in an attempt to relieve severe pain. Rudy told his parents that he felt very sick and that he had been told that he had a \u201cbug.\u201d Gloria Ochoa thereafter spoke with juvenile hall authorities and expressed concern that her son was not receiving the necessary treatment. The juvenile hall authorities attempted to reassure her about her son\u2019s condition. Both parents experienced extreme mental and emotional distress upon seeing their son\u2019s illness and pain and continued to be distressed thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On March 25, 1981, Rudy was admitted to the juvenile hall infirmary. He was eventually diagnosed as having bilateral pneumonia and had a temperature of 105 degrees. When Mrs. Ochoa visited her son in the infirmary, he was very pale, and looked dehydrated. His skin was clammy and sweaty. He appeared to be going into convulsions and was hallucinating during most of his mother\u2019s visit. When he was lucid he complained of feeling very sick and of feeling pain. Mrs. Ochoa was \u201cvery distressed and concerned\u201d and requested that she be allowed to take her sick child to her own physician. She told the authorities that she would cooperate in any way necessary so long as Rudy could be seen by the family physician. Mrs. Ochoa was then seen by one of the defendants, Stanley Lourdeaux, M.D., and was told that her son only had the flu and that he should be left in the infirmary. Rudy repeatedly asked his mother to take him to a private doctor. After repeating her requests that her son be seen by the family doctor, Mrs. Ochoa was told that she would have to wait until the following morning to discuss the problem with the probation officer. Dr. Lourdeaux then advised Mrs. Ochoa that her son would be given a penicillin shot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Mrs. Ochoa then returned to her son\u2019s bedside to find him complaining of excruciating pain under his left, rib cage. When she attempted to comfort him, his side was tender to touch. She spoke with the nurses on duty and requested that her son be released to her private doctor \u201ceven if handcuffed.\u201d The nurses denied her request. Mrs. Ochoa gave the nurses her telephone number and asked that she be called immediately if Rudy got worse and told them that she wished to be kept informed of his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">After her conversation with the nurses, Mrs. Ochoa returned and began to apply cold compresses in order to bring his fever down. At one point she was told by infirmary personnel to leave. She did not comply with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>request, however, and continued to attend to her child by applying cold water compresses and by attempting to reassure him. Rudy continuously asked her not to leave him. While she was with him, she tried to roll him over on his side. Rudy yelled and screamed, complaining of excruciating pain in his chest area, and asked her to summon the doctor and tell him about the pain. The doctor was called but did not examine Rudy while Mrs. Ochoa was present. Throughout this entire period the child was vomiting and unable to retain any fluids. He was also observed by infirmary personnel coughing up blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The authorities again insisted that Mrs. Ochoa leave her son. \u201c[S]he bent down to kiss him and [he] clasped her tightly and pleaded that she [stay] because he was so sick.\u201d She attempted to reassure Rudy, telling him that the doctor had assured her he would tend to him. Mrs. Ochoa was then required to leave her son\u2019s room. She returned to Dr. Lourdeaux and again pleaded that her son be allowed to be treated by the family physician and removed from the facility for that purpose. During all of this Mrs. Ochoa \u201cexperienced extreme mental and emotional distress.\u201d She was distressed because of her son\u2019s condition and because it appeared that her child\u2019s medical needs were being ignored. Mrs. Ochoa never again saw her son alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The complaint also alleges that Rudy Ochoa was seen by the attending physician, Dr. Lourdeaux, only once on Tuesday, March 24, 1981, and on only one occasion at approximately 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25, 1981. After this, no physician examined him until he died at approximately 1:05 a.m. on Thursday, March 26, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Finally, the complaint alleges that Rudy was never transferred to the intensive care unit of any hospital facility, that no X-rays were taken despite the repeated communications of pain and distress below the rib cage, particularly on the left side, and that no blood or urine tests were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint set forth nine causes of action. Defendants demurred and the trial court sustained the demurrers to counts five through nine without leave to amend. Plaintiffs then sought a writ of mandate to compel the court to set aside the order sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrers to the fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth causes of action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"> Plaintiffs first contend that they have stated a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress under our decision in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   An examination of Dillon and subsequent cases compels the conclusion that plaintiffs have stated a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>In <em>Dillon </em>we became the first American jurisdiction to hold that a parent who witnesses the negligent infliction of death or injury on her child may recover for the resulting emotional trauma and physical injury in cases where the parent does not fear imminent physical harm. In so doing we rejected the \u201chopeless artificiality\u201d of the rule requiring that the plaintiff be fearful for his or her own personal safety in order to recover. The touchstone of our analysis in <em>Dillon </em>was foreseeability. \u201cSince the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or an obligation to plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk, that factor will be of prime concern in every case. Because it is inherently intertwined with foreseeability such duty or obligation must necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><em>Dillon </em>also provided guidelines to aid in ascertaining whether a cause of action was stated in a particular case. \u201cIn determining . . . whether defendant should reasonably foresee the injury to plaintiff, or, in other terminology, whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care, the courts will take into account such factors as the following: (1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2) Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u201cThe evaluation of these factors will indicate the <em>degree </em>of the defendant\u2019s foreseeability: obviously defendant is more likely to foresee that a mother who observes an accident affecting her child will suffer harm than to foretell that a stranger witness will do so. Similarly, the degree of foreseeability of the third person\u2019s injury is far greater in the case of his contemporaneous observance of the accident than that in which he subsequently learns of it. The defendant is more likely to foresee that shock to the nearby, witnessing mother will cause physical harm than to anticipate that someone distant from the accident will suffer more than a temporary emotional reaction. All these elements, of course, shade into each other; the fixing of obligation, intimately tied into the facts, depends upon each case.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 740-741, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">There is no question that Mrs. Ochoa has alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the first and last <em>Dillon </em>requirements. Plaintiff, the parent of the deceased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was present while her child suffered apparent injury at the hands of defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The primary issue before us is whether, in order to state a cause of action under <em>Dillon, </em>the child\u2019s injury must have been the result of a brief and sudden occurrence viewed contemporaneously by the plaintiff. The issue did not arise in <em>Dillon </em>because the injury to the child was caused by an automobile accident. Many of the subsequent cases requiring an application of the <em>Dillon </em>factors have also involved situations similar to the <em>Dillon </em>case where there was a brief, sudden occurrence. (See, e.g., <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 728 [169 Cal.Rptr. 435] [electrocution]; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 506 [146 Cal.Rptr. 495, 5 A.L.R.4th 826] [car accident]; <em>Nazaroff </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 553 [145 Cal.Rptr. 657] [drowning]; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Sissoev </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 865 [114 Cal.Rptr. 868] [car accident]; <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 253 [79 Cal.Rptr. 723] [explosion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">One case, <em>Jansen </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 22 [106 Cal.Rptr. 883] has required that the child\u2019s injury or death be the result of a sudden occurrence. In <em>Jansen </em>a mother sought damages for emotional trauma and physical injury caused by witnessing the pain-ridden deterioration and death of her daughter in the hospital. She later learned that her child\u2019s death was due to the failure to diagnose a penetrating duodenal ulcer. The <em>Jansen </em>court denied recovery, concluding that <em>Dillon </em>\u201ccontemplates a sudden and brief event causing the child\u2019s injury. . . . [T]he event causing injury to the child must itself be one which can be the subject of sensory perception.\u201d <em>(Jansen, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at p. 24.) Since the failure to diagnose could not be discerned by a lay person contemporaneously with such failure, the court concluded that extending the <em>Dillon </em>rules to cover this situation would yield the potentially limitless liability which <em>Dillon </em>sought to avoid. <em>Jansen </em>was followed in <em>Hair </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 538 [119 Cal.Rptr. 639]. In <em>Mobaldi </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 573 [127 Cal.Rptr. 720], the court interpreted <em>Jansen </em>as requiring that \u201cthe plaintiff observe an act contemporaneously causing injury. . . . The <em>Jansen </em>restriction is related to the reason for the <em>Dillon </em>limitation. It recognizes that to avoid \u2018potentially infinite liability\u2019 [citation] <em>Dillon </em>draws its limitation in terms of a very close connection in time and geography between the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>gent act and resulting injury.\u201d (Id., at pp. 584-585; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 506, 512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We implicitly approved of <em>Jansen\u2019s </em>\u201csudden occurrence\u201d requirement in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122]. <em>Justus </em>involved wrongful death and <em>Dillon </em>causes' of action by fathers who had been present in the delivery room, and who had experienced distress when the fetuses were delivered still-born. We believed that <em>Justus </em>presented a closer case than <em>Jansen </em>because \u201ceach accident ... [in <em>Justus] </em>was a relatively sudden occurrence.\u201d <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 564, 584.) We nevertheless held that the fathers had failed to state a cause of action under <em>Dillon </em>because they had not sustained shock as a result of \u201c\u2018sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 584, quoting <em>Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 740.) While <em>Justus </em>implicitly approved the sudden occurrence requirement, the case essentially involved a situation where the fathers were unaware of a connection between the defendants\u2019 conduct and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Our review of other cases allowing a cause of action for emotional distress under <em>Dillon </em>leads us to the conclusion that the \u201csudden occurrence\u201d requirement is an unwarranted restriction on the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines. Such a restriction arbitrarily limits liability when there is a high degree of foreseeability of shock to the plaintiff and the shock flows from an abnormal event, and, as such, unduly frustrates the goal of compensation\u2014the very purpose which the cause of action was meant to further.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The cases allowing recovery have done so by applying the <em>Dillon </em>criteria with some degree of flexibility and for that reason are instructive. In <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022], for example, the plaintiff husband was sitting in his parked car while his wife removed groceries from the trunk. The defendant\u2019s car approached plaintiff\u2019s car at high speed, killed plaintiff\u2019s wife and then struck plaintiff\u2019s car. We held that the husband had stated a cause of action under <em>Dillon </em>despite the fact that he did not see his wife being struck by defendant\u2019s car and did not immediately observe the effect of the collision on her. <em>(Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 74-75.) We said that <em>\u201cDillon . . . </em>does not require a <em>visual </em>perception of the impact causing the death or injury. In the matter before us, although Benjamin did not see Elizabeth struck by defendant\u2019s automobile, he fully perceived the fact that she had been so struck, for he knew her position an instant before the impact, observed defendant\u2019s vehicle approach her at a high speed on a collision course, and realized that defendant\u2019s car must have struck her. Clearly, under such circumstances Benjamin must be deemed a percipient witness to the impact causing Elizabeth\u2019s catastrophic injuries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 76, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Similarly in <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman, supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 253 (which we approved in Krouse) the Court of Appeal held that a mother had stated a cause of action under <em>Dillon </em>even though she did not actually observe the tortious event. In <em>Archibald </em>the mother came upon her child moments after he had been injured in an explosion. The court observed that \u201cthe shock of seeing a child severely injured immediately after the tortious event may be just as profound as that experienced in witnessing the accident itself,\u201d and that therefore the plaintiff had met the contemporaneous observance requirement of <em>Dillon. (Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman, supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Using an approach similar to that in <em>Archibald, </em>the court in <em>Nazaroff v. Superior Court, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d 553 held that a mother had stated a cause of action where she arrived on the scene in time to see her missing child being pulled out of a neighbor\u2019s pool and to aid in efforts to resuscitate him. He died three days later. After reviewing a number of cases which applied the <em>Dillon </em>factors the court concluded: \u201cOn balance, and in the light of all of the criteria reviewed above, we must conclude that the record before the court demonstrates that there are triable issues of fact to carry to the jury as to whether the alleged physical harm to the mother resulted from an emotional shock proximately caused by the direct emotional impact from the <em>contemporaneous observation of the immediate consequences of the defendants\u2019 negligent act, </em>which was the proximate cause of the injury and death of her son. [Citation omitted.] The shout from the pool area may have permitted her to reconstruct the scene, as well as did Mrs. Archibald and Mr. Krouse. Her knowledge of what had occurred was derived from her own senses, and not from another\u2019s recital of an uncontemporaneous event.\u201d <em>(Nazaroff v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 566-567, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In <em>Mobaldi v. Regents of University of California, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 573, plaintiff brought her foster son to the hospital for tests relating to a congenital kidney defect. Plaintiff held the boy in her arms while doctors injected a glucose and dye solution into his arm intravenously. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, one of the physicians mistakenly used a \u201cdrastically unsafe\u201d dosage of the solution. The doctors then left the room to examine X-rays. While in his foster mother\u2019s arms, the child began to breath peculiarly, became spastic, convulsant and finally comatose. <em>Mobaldi </em>held that plaintiff satisfied the <em>Dillon </em>requirements where she \u201cperceive[d] by sight and hearing the physical injury to another in her presence caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, ...\u201d (55 Cal.App.3d at p. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Mrs. Ochoa\u2019s position in this case is similar to that of the plaintiffs in the above-discussed cases and factually distinguishable from that of the mother in <em>Jansen. </em>Here Mrs. Ochoa was aware of and observed conduct by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>defendants which produced injury in her child. She was aware of the fact that her child was in need of immediate medical attention. To her knowledge the defendants had failed to provide the necessary care. As her complaint alleges, she \u201cexperienced extreme mental and emotional distress and concern for her son and for <em>[sic] </em>the apparent outrageous neglect of medical care while she was present.\u201d Like the parents in both <em>Nazaroff </em>and <em>Archibald, </em>she was able to perceive, and suffered shock, from the connection between defendants\u2019 conduct and her child\u2019s injury. By contrast, in <em>Jansen, </em>the mother\u2019s distress stemmed only from the sight of her child\u2019s suffering. Any distress she may have suffered as a result of perceiving the impact of defendant\u2019s conduct upon her child was the result of \u201clearning of the accident from others after its occurrence.\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 741.) In this regard, the mother\u2019s situation in <em>Jansen </em>was no different from that of any parent who witnesses the pain and suffering of his or her child due to illness or injury and is unaware that the defendant\u2019s conduct is a contributing factor to the continued pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Although <em>Jansen </em>may be distinguished from the case before us on the ground that in <em>Jansen </em>the plaintiff did not perceive defendant\u2019s tortious conduct, we by no means suggest\u2014as did the court in <em>Hair </em>v. <em>County of Monterey, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.3d 538, 543-544\u2014that plaintiff must be aware of the tortious nature of defendant\u2019s actions. As the court in <em>Mobaldi </em>observed, such a requirement would lead to the anomalous result that a mother who viewed her child being struck by a car could not recover because she did not realize that the driver was intoxicated. <em>(Mobaldi, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.3d at p. 583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We are satisfied that when there is observation of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the child\u2019s injury and contemporaneous awareness the defendant\u2019s conduct or lack thereof is causing harm to the child, recovery is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">It is important to remember that the factors set forth in <em>Dillon </em>were merely guidelines to be used in assessing whether the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant\u2019s negligence. As we stated in <em>Dillon: </em>\u201cWe are not now called upon to decide whether\u00a1 in the absence or reduced weight of some of the above factors, we would conclude that the accident and injury were not reasonably foreseeable and that therefore defendant owed no duty of due care to plaintiff. In future cases the courts will draw lines of demarcation upon facts more subtle than the compelling ones alleged in the complaint before us.\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 741.) It is clear that in the present case defendants had every reason to foresee that Mrs. Ochoa would be distressed by their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">It has been suggested that plaintiffs should not get the benefit of the <em>Dillon </em>rule, because they were voluntarily present at a location where distressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>incidents were likely to occur. In <em>Justus </em>we implied in dictum that another factor mitigating against the application of the <em>Dillon </em>rule to the plight of the fathers present in the delivery room was that they were voluntarily present in a place where it was extremely likely that they would witness distressing events. (19 Cal.3d 564.) Some courts have read this statement to imply that recovery by a plaintiff voluntarily at the scene of a traumatic event may be precluded. (See, e.g., <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Macias </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 640, 650 [167 Cal.Rptr. 905]; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 354, 361 [152 Cal.Rptr. 420], Jefferson, J., dis.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a requirement however undercuts the very foundation upon which the <em>Dillon </em>case rested. We said in <em>Dillon </em>that a tortfeasor could be held liable for damages to a bystander parent because of the foreseeability that the parent of an endangered child would be \u201c \u2018somewhere in the vicinity. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 730, quoting Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) at p. 353.) A distinction between the involuntary and voluntary presence of the close relative of the injured or dead person thus appears to relieve the defendant of liability for the very risk which should have been foreseen. While in a proper case it may be said that a bystander assumed the risk of traumatic shock, we cannot say that in the ordinary course of events the voluntary or involuntary presence of the plaintiff should be a decisive factor in determining whether plaintiff has stated a <em>Dillon </em>cause of action. To the extent that <em>Justus </em>makes a contrary suggestion, it is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The fear that a less than strict application of the <em>Dillon </em>factors will result in \u201cinfinite liability\u201d should not prevent courts from allowing plaintiffs to go forward when their shock and trauma stems from their sensory perception of defendant\u2019s conduct and their loved one\u2019s injury, particularly where, as here, defendants could clearly foresee Mrs. Ochoa\u2019s traumatized reaction. In <em>Dillon </em>defendant argued that an otherwise meritorious claim should be barred out of a fear that there would be an increase in suits as well as fraudulent claims. We repeat here our response to such a contention: \u201c\u2018[We] should be sorry to adopt a rule which would bar all such claims on grounds of policy alone, and in order to prevent the possible success of unrighteous or groundless actions. Such a course involves the denial of redress in meritorious cases, and it necessarily implies a certain degree of distrust, which [we] do not share, in the capacity of legal tribunals to get at the truth in this class of claim.\u2019\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 744, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>quoting <em>Hambrook </em>v. <em>Stokes Bros. </em>(1925) 1 K.B. 141, quoting <em>Dulieu </em>v. <em>White and Sons </em>(1901) 2 K.B. 669, 681, opn. by Kennedy, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We therefore conclude that under the facts as alleged, Mrs. Ochoa has stated a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and that the fifth cause of action should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Plaintiffs also contend that they have stated a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress because they were \u201cdirect victims\u201d of defendant\u2019s negligence within the meaning of our decision in <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813, 16 A.L.R.4th 518]. In <em>Molien </em>this court held that a husband could state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress where his wife had been negligently misdiagnosed as having syphilis. We rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that although he was not present when the diagnosis was communicated to his wife, he was a \u201cbystander\u201d victim under <em>Dillon </em>saying that \u201c. . . the significance of <em>Dillon </em>for the present action lies not in its delineation of guidelines fashioned for resolution of the precise issue then before us; rather, we apply its general principle of foreseeability to the facts at hand, much as we have done in other cases presenting complex questions of tort liability. [Citations omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cIn the case at bar the risk of harm to plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable to defendants. It is easily predictable that an erroneous diagnosis of syphilis and its probable source would produce marital discord and resultant emotional distress to a married patient\u2019s spouse; Dr. Kilbridge\u2019s advice to Mrs. Molien to have her husband examined for the disease confirms that plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the negligent diagnosis. Because the disease is normally transmitted only by sexual relations, it is rational to anticipate that both husband and wife would experience anxiety, suspicion, and hostility when confronted with what they had every reason to believe was reliable medical evidence of a particularly noxious infidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u201cWe thus agree with plaintiff that the alleged tortious conduct of defendant <em>was directed to him as well as to his wife. </em>\u201d <em>(Molien, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 923, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Plaintiffs here have not stated a cause of action as direct victims of defendants\u2019 negligence. In <em>Molien </em>defendant\u2019s misdiagnosis was, by its very nature directed at both the wife and the husband. The wife was asked to tell her husband of the diagnosis and the husband was required to submit to tests. By contrast, here the defendants\u2019 negligence in the instant case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>directed primarily at the decedent, with Mrs. Ochoa looking on as a helpless bystander as the tragedy of her son\u2019s demise unfolded before her. While she was a foreseeable plaintiff to whom the defendants owed a duty of care pursuant to our holding in <em>Dillon, </em>the duty owed was owed to her as a percipient witness, not as a direct victim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In the sixth cause of action plaintiff Gloria Ochoa incorporates by reference the facts previously set forth and alleges that the \u201ccallous and deliberate indifference\u201d of defendants \u201cto the serious medical and physical needs of decedent\u201d violated federal and state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   She further alleges that the facts state a cause of action cognizable under 42 United States Code section 1983.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We note initially that the civil rights cause of action has been brought by Gloria Ochoa in her capacity as special administratrix of her deceased son\u2019s estate. Although 42 United States Code section 1983 itself is silent on the question whether an action pursuant to its provisions survives the death of the victim of the alleged violations, 42 United States Code section 1988 provides that \u201cin all cases where [the laws of the United States] . . . are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the state wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause. ...\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.)  This provision has been interpreted to mean that since section 1983 is silent on the question of survival of actions, state law must be referred to in order to make that determination. (See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Wegmann </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 584, 588-590 [56 L.Ed.2d 554, 559-561, 98 S.Ct. 1991].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Probate Code section 573 is the principal provision governing survival of actions in this state. Section 573 as amended in 1961 provides in relevant part that \u201c. . . [n]o cause of action shall be lost by reason of the death of any person but may be maintained by or against his executor or administrator.\u201d These provisions were meant to apply to \u201call causes of action heretofore or hereafter arising . . . .\u201d (Deering\u2019s Ann. Prob. Code, \u00a7 573 (1974 ed.) note at p. 327.) The 1961 amendment was meant to make clear that all claims, including those for injury to the person, survived the death of the victim or wrongdoer. (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, pp. 2314-2315; <em>Estate of Hoertkom </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 461, 465 [151 Cal.Rptr. 806].) In the present case, the decedent\u2019s claim is in the nature of a tort, and under section 573, such a claim survives his death and may be brought by the administrator of his estate. (4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Turning to the allegations supporting the section 1983 action, we note that the complaint is ambiguous or silent as to the precise custodial status of Rudy Ochoa prior to his death. It is unclear whether he was a \u201cpretrial detainee\u201d or whether he had in fact received the juvenile equivalent of a trial.  In general, the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment do not attach unless the victim has been tried and sentenced for a crime. (See <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 651, 671-672, fn. 40 [51 L.Ed.2d 711, 730, 97 S.Ct. 1401].) A distinction has usually been drawn between a pretrial detainee, whom the state lacks the power to punish, and a sentenced offender, whom the state may not punish in a cruel and unusual manner. (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 520, 535-536 [60 L.Ed.2d 447, 465-466, 99 S.Ct. 1861]; <em>Loe </em>v. <em>Armistead </em>(4th Cir. 1978) 582 F.2d 1291, 1294.) A detainee awaiting trial is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than by the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The ambiguity is not fatal in the instant case, however, because \u201cthe due process rights of a [detainee] are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.\u201d <em>(Revere </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 239, 244 [77 L.Ed.2d 605, 611, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 2983].) Because we conclude that the facts, as alleged, show that defendants\u2019 conduct violated the standards set forth for determining whether the rights of convicted prisoners have been violated, we need not determine in the present action the exact scope of the rights afforded pretrial detainees with respect to medical care.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff should, however, be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>leave to amend, if she so requests, to properly allege the status of her son at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 97 [50 L.Ed.2d 251, 97 S.Ct. 285] set forth the standards applicable to a claim that the medical needs of a prisoner have been ignored. In that case the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 . . . [citation omitted] proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, supra, </em>429 U.S. at p. 104 [50 L.Ed.2d at p. 260].) The court went on to state, however, that not every claim of inadequate medical care rises to the level of cruel and unusual punishment. Specifically, \u201ca complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 106 [50 L.Ed.2d at p. 261].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The court concluded that under the facts there present the prisoner had failed to state a claim for relief. In <em>Gamble </em>the prisoner had been injured, had been checked for a hernia and returned to his cell. He experienced pain for which he was given medication and was examined by a doctor. The following day he was again examined by another doctor, was diagnosed as having back strain and received medication for his condition. On other oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>casions he received treatment and was seen by doctors when he complained of pain. The court concluded that it was quite apparent that the plaintiff had \u201creceived extensive medical care and that the doctors were not indifferent to his needs.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 108, fn. 16 [50 L.Ed.2d at p. 262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Defendants do not dispute that Rudy Ochoa was suffering from a \u201cserious medical need.\u201d Rather, they contend that defendants\u2019 conduct did not rise to the level of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d contemplated by the court in <em>Gamble. </em>Pointing to the fact that Rudy was seen by doctors on at least two occasions and that he received a diagnosis, was placed in the infirmary and that penicillin was prescribed for him, defendants assert that plaintiffs are merely alleging negligence. Defendants rely on a group of cases which have denied relief to prisoners where allegations or evidence suggests that under the circumstances the treatment received was adequate, or if not adequate merely negligent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">It has been recognized, however that inadequate medical treatment may, in some instances, constitute a violation of 42 United States Code section 1983. <em>(Westlake </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(6th Cir. 1976) 537 F.2d 857, 860-861, fn. 5.) In <em>Sturtz </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia </em>(E.D.Pa. 1982) 529 F.Supp. 434, for example, the plaintiff alleged that defendants acted \u201ccarelessly, recklessly and negligently\u201d when they failed to remove sutures from his eye, neck and face. The court concluded that although plaintiff was alleging inadequate medical treatment, he had stated a cause of action under section 1983; \u201c. . . where a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment, federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments. <em>Pinon </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>368 F.Supp. 608, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>610 (E.D.Wis. 1973). See also <em>Fitzke </em>v. <em>Shappell, </em>468 F.2d 1072, 1076 (6th Cir. 1972). In some cases, however, the medical attention rendered may be so woefully inadequate as to amount to no treatment at all, thereby rising to the level of a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Westlake, </em>537 F.2d at p. 860, n. 5; <em>Tolbert </em>v. <em>Eyman, </em>434 F.2d 625, 626 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Rhay, </em>407 F.2d 496 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Stilner </em>v. <em>Rhay, </em>371 F.2d 420, 421 n. 3 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 997, 87 S.Ct. 1318, 18 L.Ed.2d 346 (1967). In this case, . . . plaintiff has adequately pleaded a set of facts which may evidence a deliberate indifference to serious medical needs which may entitle him to \u00a7 1983 relief.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Other cases have similarly recognized that \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d medical care may result in the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. (See, e.g., <em>Scitarelli </em>v. <em>Manson </em>(D.Conn. 1978) 447 F.Supp. 279; <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Vinzant </em>(1st Cir. 1981) 657 F.2d 468, 474; <em>Laaman </em>v. <em>Helgemoe </em>(D.N.H. 1977) 437 F.Supp. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Accepting as we must, the truth of the allegations in the complaint, there is no question that the treatment received by Rudy Ochoa under the circumstances was \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d Mrs. Ochoa brought her son\u2019s symptoms to the attention of the defendants when she visited with him on March 24. When she visited him a second time Rudy was exhibiting alarming symptoms, including a soaring temperature, dehydration, vomiting, hallucinations, the beginnings of convulsions and severe pain on his left side. He was also observed vomiting blood. These conditions indicated, even to a layperson, that emergency measures were needed. Significantly, it was left to Mrs. Ochoa to make use of the facilities in order to care for her son. Although penicillin was prescribed, it is unclear that any was ever administered. Mrs. Ochoa\u2019s requests for treatment for her son were met only with the observation that he had a \u201cbug.\u201d It is also alleged that no radiological, blood or urine tests were undertaken in order to diagnose Rudy\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Given the severity of the symptoms exhibited by the decedent as well as the lack of response by the defendants to his medical needs we conclude that Mrs. Ochoa has pleaded facts sufficient to state a cause of action under 42 United States Code section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding the Superior Court of Santa Clara County to vacate its order in this action and to enter a new order consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Reynoso, J., and Girard, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-12\">Contrary to the county\u2019s assumption that it was no longer a defendant in this action, plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate directing the trial court to reverse its order sustaining the demurrers of the county as well as the individual defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\">In testing the sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer we are guided by the well-settled rule that \u201ca general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint [citation]; that the question of plaintiff\u2019s ability to prove these allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court [citations]; and that plaintiff need only plead facts showing that he may be entitled to some relief [citation].\u201d <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 496 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">It is unclear whether the shot was ever given.

Plaintiffs appear to assume that a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress may be established on the same theory as that for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The two torts are entirely different. (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) \u00a7 233 et seq. and \u00a7 548 et seq.) The negligence count is discussed in the text. An examination of the requirements for intentional infliction of emotional distress leads to the conclusion that plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action for that tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">A cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress must allege facts showing outrageous conduct which is intentional or reckless and which is outside the bounds of decency. It has been said in summarizing the cases discussing intentional infliction of emotional distress that \u201cthe rule which seems to have emerged is that there is liability for conduct exceeding all bounds usually tolerated by decent society, of a nature which is <em>especially calculated to cause, </em>and does cause, mental distress of a very serious kind.\u201d (Prosser &amp; Keaton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) p. 60, fn. omitted, italics added.) (See, e.g., <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Western National Life Insurance Company </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 376 [89 Cal.Rptr. 78, 47 A.L.R.3d 286] [defendant maliciously employed tactics such as making false charges in order to compel the plaintiff to surrender policy or to disadvantageous^ settle policy]; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Can\u00f3nica </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 898 [5 Cal.Rptr. 28] [making threats and accusations for the purpose of publicly humiliating the plaintiff].) Here, although defendants conduct did cause the plaintiffs untold distress, it is evident that the defendants acted negligently rather than with the purpose of causing the plaintiffs emotional distress. Further, although the law appears to be moving toward allowing recovery where mental distress is caused when plaintiff witnesses conduct directed toward a third person, \u201cthus far recovery is clearly limited to the most extreme cases of violent attack, where there is some especial likelihood of fright or shock.\u201d (Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>at p. 66, fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs have abandoned their eighth cause of action\u2014interference with parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">The complaint reveals that Mr. Ochoa only visited his son once and that he was extremely distressed by what he saw. As we shall explain, such distress is actionable under <em>Dillon. </em>Presumably, any further distress suffered by him was not the result of what he saw, but rather the result of what was related to him by his wife after her subsequent visit with their son. Under <em>Dillon </em>such distress is not actionable. The discussion in the text focuses on the experiences of Mrs. Ochoa. The analysis, however, is applicable to Mr. Ochoa\u2019s cause of action. It has been said that a distinction between distress caused by personal observation of the injury and by hearing of the tragedy from another is justified because compensation should be limited to abnormal life experiences which cause emotional distress. While receiving news that a loved one has been injured or has died may cause emotional distress, it is the type of experience for which in a general way one is prepared, an experience which is common. By contrast few persons are forced to witness the death or injury of a loved one or to suddenly come upon the scene without warning in situations where tortious conduct is involved. In the present case, for example, while it is common to visit a loved one in a hospital and to be distressed by the loved one\u2019s pain and suffering, it is highly uncommon to witness the apparent neglect of the patient\u2019s immediate medical needs by medical personnel. (See generally, Note, <em>Limiting Liability for the Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: The \u201cBystander Recovery\" Cases </em>(1981) 54 So.Cal.L.Rev. 847.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Defendants appear to suggest that <em>Dillon </em>only applies when plaintiffs witness the death of their relative. <em>Dillon, </em>however, speaks in terms of death or injury. Further, plaintiffs do not contend that they are entitled to recover because of the shock and trauma experienced upon learning of Rudy\u2019s death. Rather, liability is posited on the shock and trauma which they experienced upon seeing their son\u2019s medical needs being ignored by the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Commentators have also noted and criticized the voluntary/involuntary bystander distinction.

A court must decide whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose. See <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor </em>[(1960) 363 U.S. 603] at 613-617 [4 L.Ed.2d 1435, 80 S.Ct. 1367]. Absent a showing of an expressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility officials, that determination generally will turn on \u2018whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].\u2019 <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 168-169, [9 L.Ed.2d 644, 83 S.Ct. 554]; see <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor, supra, </em>at 617, [4 L.Ed.2d 1435, 80 S.Ct. 1367], Thus, if a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to \u2018punishment.\u2019\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish [supra, </em>441 U.S. at pp. 538-539 (60 L.Ed.2d at p. 468)], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 307 [73 L.Ed.2d 28, 102 S.Ct. 2452], which involved the due process rights of an involuntarily committed mentally retarded person, the court first noted that the standard articulated in <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble </em>[(1976) 426 U.S. 97 (50 L.Ed.2d 251, 97 S.Ct. 285)] for denial of medical care of convicted persons had been erroneously applied by the lower court. <em>(Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, supra, </em>457 U.S. 307, 312, fn. 11 [73 L.Ed.2d 28, 35].) The court concluded that the involuntarily committed person had a right to adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care and also to safe conditions, freedom from bodily restraint and minimally adequate care or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint. Liability would be imposed \u201cwhen the decision by the professional [regarding care of the committed person] is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\u201d <em>(Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, supra, </em>at p. 323 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 42], fn. omitted.)

In <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(3d Cir. 1980) 624 F.2d 1204 for example, the defendant doctor was unaware that the consultation he had ordered for plaintiff\u2019s condition had never been arranged by prison officials. Upon learning of the delay the doctor immediately arranged for the consultation. Other cases have involved prisoners who did not cooperate in the prescribed course of treatment. (See, e.g., <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Hongisto </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1980) 488 F.Supp. 304; <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Vinzant </em>(1st Cir. 1981) 657 F.2d 468.) In other cases the court examined the course of treatment given by medical personnel and found that it did not in any way deviate from standard treatment or was adequate given the nature of plaintiff\u2019s condition. (See, <em>Bass </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 550 F.2d 229; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(E.D.Pa. 1979) 463 F.Supp. 1232; <em>May </em>v. <em>Enomoto </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 633 F.2d 164; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Lockhart </em>(8th Cir. 1977) 561 F.2d 728; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Beck </em>(S.D.Ga. 1980) 481 F.Supp. 723.) In other cases there was a lack of evidence suggesting a serious or urgent medical need. (See, e.g., <em>Sowell </em>v. <em>Israel </em>(E.D.Wis. 1980) 500 F.Supp. 209; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>McGowan </em>(D.Colo. 1978) 445 F.Supp. 468; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Unknown United States Marshall </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 587 F.2d 377.) In one case even though the doctor had made an incorrect diagnosis he did so after a period of time and the court was not convinced that the doctor\u2019s examination was merely cursory (see <em>Wester </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(4th Cir. 1977) 554 F.2d 1285). Finally, <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Sacred Heart Hospital </em>(E.D.Pa. 1980) 496 F.Supp. 692 involved the failure to diagnose a very rare disease where the defendants had made more than a cursory attempt to do so and where the plaintiff had exhibited no alarming symptoms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>GRODIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7A\">I agree with the majority that the facts which plaintiffs have alleged are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress under the theory of <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316]. That being so, the \u201calternative\u201d theory which plaintiffs have advanced\u2014that they were \u201cdirect victims\u201d of defendant\u2019s negligence within the meaning of <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813, 16 A.L.R.4th 518]\u2014appears in this case to be redundant. The majority opinion is therefore entirely adequate to the decision of this cause and I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">I agree also with the Chief Justice that there remain after today\u2019s opinion numerous questions concerning the application of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines which have proved troublesome to the lower courts and which this court must, sooner or later, confront and resolve. As a means of focusing needed attention upon those policy considerations which ought to guide the development of the law in this area I take the opportunity to add a few thoughts of my own.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">As regards physical injury, apart from problems pertaining to the determination of duty in certain classes of cases (see, e.g., <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 112-113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561]), recovery is normally allowed under a showing of negligence, foreseeability, and proximate cause; and each of these elements is said to be a question for the jury. <em>(Weirum </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36]; see also Prosser &amp; Keaton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 37, pp. 235-238.) If precisely the same rules were applied to emotional distress, then in principle any person who claims to have suffered such injury as a result of another\u2019s negligent act would be entitled to present his case to a jury whenever the record reflects triable issues of fact with respect to the requisite elements of the tort. Moreover, as a matter of logical analysis this would be true whether or not the evidence comported with the criteria enunciated in <em>Dillon, </em>since at most those criteria would serve as guidelines for the jury\u2019s determination of foreseeability as a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Perhaps such a rule would be desirable. It must be recognized, however, that it is not the rule which <em>Dillon </em>established. After observing that the principle of foreseeability serves \u201cto limit the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every negligent act\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 739), Justice Tobriner\u2019s opinion proceeds to suggest factors which \u201cthe courts will take into account\u201d in determining \u201cwhether defendant should reasonably foresee the injury to plaintiff, or, in other terminology, whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 740, see also p. 741 [\u201c[i]n light of these factors the court will determine whether the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>and harm was <em>reasonably </em>foreseeable\u201d]; p. 742 [\u201c[t]he courts have in the past, in analogous situations, drawn the limits of liability, applying general guidelines such as those above set forth to the specific facts of the cases\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Thus, however, flexible the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines were intended to be, it is clear that they were to be applied in the first instance by the <em>courts </em>as a means of guarding against unwarranted extensions of liability. The principle of <em>foreseeability, </em>normally a question for the jury, became fused in this analysis with the concept of <em>duty, </em>which serves normally as a vehicle for limiting liability on the basis of policy considerations which are thought to outweigh the policy of compensating victims of negligent conduct. (Diamond, <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg Revisited: Toward a Unified Theory of Compensating Bystanders and Relatives for Intangible Injuries </em>(1984) 35 Hastings L.J. 477 [hereafter <em>Dillon v. Legg </em>Revisited].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">This fusion has given rise to a degree of confusion, and a perception of \u201carbitrariness,\u201d in the application of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines. Professor Diamond, for example, argues that of the three <em>Dillon </em>criteria, only one (a close relationship between the victim and the bystander plaintiff) is clearly relevant to a foreseeability analysis <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg Revisited, supra, </em>35 Hastings L.J. at p. 488), and that the \u201cmechanical application\u201d of the guidelines \u201chas led to the erection of arbitrary limitations on recovery bearing little relation to the principles of foreseeability espoused so forcefully in <em>Dillon. </em>\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 478.) The Chief Justice\u2019s separate opinion in this case provides numerous illustrations of this thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">One solution to this dilemma, obviously, is to abandon any limitations upon recovery for emotional injury that are not also imposed upon physical injury. This appears to be the approach of the House of Lords in <em>McLoughlin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian </em>(1982) 2 All Eng.Rep. 298.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parallel is not precise since in Britain personal injury cases are normally tried without a jury (see <em>Ward </em>v. <em>James </em>(1966) 1 Q.B. 273, 280) so that it is the court which determines whether the elements of recovery are present. In application, therefore, the English rule is similar to that which would exist if we were to recognize negligent infliction of emotional distress as a generic tort with the element of foreseeability determined by the court rather than by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">A second approach, that advocated by the Chief Justice, calls for extending the principle of <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 916, so as to allow recovery for the negligent infliction of mental distress whether the plaintiff is a \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d victim, but to insist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that the injury meet some threshold of \u201cseriousness.\u201d The function of this requirement, presumably, would be to protect against \u201cfraud, trivial claims, and unlimited liability.\u201d (Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: Coherence Emerging from Chaos </em>(1982) 33 Hastings L.J. 583, 620.) One commentator, observing that even \u201cserious\u201d emotional injury is a normal and inevitable part of existence, suggests \u201climiting recovery to cases of emotional distress that most people <em>do not face with sufficient frequency or sufficient certainty </em>to anticipate, to prepare for, and thus to absorb without suffering severe or permanent emotional damage.\u201d (Note, <em>Limiting Liability for the Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: The \u201cBystander Recovery\u201d Cases </em>(1981) 54 So.Cal.L.Rev. 847, 868.) This is similar to the formulation in <em>Molien: </em>whether \u201ca reasonable man, normally constituted, would be unable to adequately cope with the mental stress engendered by the circumstances of the case.\u201d (27 Cal.3d at p. 938, citing <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>State </em>(1970) 52 Hawaii 156, 173 [472 P.2d 509, 520],)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Two academic commentators have suggested what might be termed a more radical solution. Professor Richard Miller argues that it is possible for the judicial process to produce an approach to recovery for mental-distress-without-impact that will satisfy the competing concerns of justice and policy \u201conly if the courts are willing to couple the application of ordinary negligence principles for determining the issue of liability with a significant reduction in the damages available if liability is imposed.\u201d (Miller, <em>The Scope of Liability for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: Making \u201cThe Punishment Fit The </em>Crime\u201d (1979) 1 Hawaii L.Rev. 1, 3.) Eschewing a case-by-case approach, Professor Miller advocates application of general tort principles with a limitation of recovery in mental-distress cases to tangible economic loss in the form of medical care and disability. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 39-40.) Professor Diamond, pointing to this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Sortini </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 220 [182 Cal.Rptr. 337, 643 P.2d 954] to illustrate the appropriateness of such judicially imposed limitations upon recovery, advocates extending Professor Miller\u2019s thesis to include loss of consortium and parent-and-child society claims as well. <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg Revisited, supra, </em>35 Hastings L.J. at pp. 479-480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Finally, it has been suggested that while any court-imposed limitation upon the category of plaintiffs who may recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress can be attacked as \u201carbitrary,\u201d the result is more acceptable in terms of public policy than not to have any limitations at all. (Pearson, <em>Liability to Bystanders for Negligently Inflicted Emotional </em>Harm\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>A Comment on the Nature of Arbitrary Rules </em>(1982) 34 U.Fla. L.Rev. 477.) Though Professor Pearson relies upon his analysis to urge a return to the \u201czone of danger\u201d test which <em>Dillon </em>rejected, a similar argument might be made in support of continued reliance upon <em>Dillon </em>guidelines, with or without modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">This case does not require us to choose among these alternatives, and I do not do so now. What seems to me important to recognize is that the choice inevitably involves difficult questions of public policy, including a determination as to whether the nature of emotional injury requires any limitations upon recovery that are not imposed also upon physical injury and, if so, precisely what those limitations ought to be. Absent legislative guidance, courts cannot avoid making such policy decisions, and in the process of making them we are likely to benefit from all the assistance, in the form of analysis and empirical evidence, that the parties can provide.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The high court of Australia has arrived at a similar result in <em>Jaensch </em>v. <em>Coffey </em>(1984) 54 Austl. Argus L.R. 417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Professors Nolan and Ursin take issue with the <em>Molien </em>formulation insofar as it suggests that the \u201cthin skull plaintiff\u201d rule, applicable to physical injury, should be abandoned when it comes to emotional injury. (Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: Coherence Emerging from Chaos, supra, </em>33 Hastings L.J. at p. 616, fn. 188.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b199-6\">BIRD, C. J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Seventeen years ago in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316], California became the first American jurisdiction to hold that a mother could recover for the emotional distress she experienced when she witnessed the negligent infliction of death or injury to her child even though she was not within the physical zone of danger. (See Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: Coherence Emerging from Chaos </em>(1982) 33 Hastings L.J. 583.) The <em>Dillon </em>court rejected the \u201chopeless artificiality\u201d of the zone-of-danger rule (68 Cal.2d at p. 733) and emphasized the primary importance of foreseeability in establishing liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 739-740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">However, the court cautioned that since duty is inherently intertwined with foreseeability, this issue \u201cmust necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis. We cannot now predetermine defendant\u2019s obligation in every situation by a fixed category; <em>no immutable rule </em>can establish the extent of that obligation for every circumstance of the future.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 740, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\"><em>Dillon </em>set forth certain guidelines for determining the foreseeability question: \u201c(1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2) Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship. \u201d (68 Cal.2d at pp. 740-741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">What has followed in Dillon's wake is confusion rather than clarity. The <em>Dillon </em>guidelines have been strictly and mechanically applied. This has led to arbitrary, inconsistent and inequitable results antithetical to principles enunciated in <em>Dillon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>A </em>review of the cases is illustrative. First, consider the Court of Appeal decisions which have strictly construed the second <em>Dillon </em>guideline. In <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 728 [169 Cal.Rptr. 435], a six-year-old boy was electrocuted by touching an evaporative cooler while playing outside. His mother and father, who were inside the house, came out after their son\u2019s playmate told them something was wrong with their child. They rushed outside to see him lying in a puddle of water by the cooler in a \u201cdying state,\u201d gagging and spitting up. Efforts to revive him failed. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 730-731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Court of Appeal held that the parents did not state a cause of action under <em>Dillon </em>because they did not satisfy the second \u201crequirement.\u201d (112 Cal.App.3d at p. 734.) The parents \u201cdid not sensorily perceive the injury-causing event, that is, the actual contact between the electrically charged water cooler and [their child], but saw only the results of the contact (the injuries) after the accident was over.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 736.) The court was confident that its strict application of the second <em>Dillon </em>\u201crequirement\u201d followed a \u201csteady flow of Court of Appeal cases.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 506 [146 Cal.Rptr. 495, 5 A.L.R.4th 826] is one example in that \u201cflow.\u201d There, the plaintiffs, who had been following a car in which their two daughters were passengers, came upon the wreckage of the car. They realized instantly that their daughters were either dead or dying. The father left his car and reached the wreckage \u201cbefore the dust had settled.\u201d (Id., at pp. 508-509.) Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that since the parents did not see, hear or otherwise sensorily perceive the injury-producing event, the second <em>Dillon </em>\u201crequirement\u201d had not been met. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 512.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>These cases are hard to reconcile with other Court of Appeal decisions which have taken a more flexible view. For example, in <em>Nazaroff v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 553 [145 Cal.Rptr. 657], the mother of a three-year-old boy sought recovery after witnessing her son being pulled from a swimming pool. The mother had been looking for her son when she heard a neighbor scream, \u201cIt\u2019s Danny.\u201d She ran to the pool and saw a neighbor pull Danny out and give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Three days later, the boy died. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 557, 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Even though the mother arrived on the scene after the accident, the Court of Appeal permitted recovery. Observing that <em>Dillon </em>\u201ccreat[ed] [not] parameters but merely guidelines\u201d (80 Cal.App.3d at p. 562), <em>Nazar off </em>characterized the issue as whether emotional distress had resulted from the \u201ccontemporaneous observation of the immediate consequences of the defendants\u2019 negligent act,\u201d and concluded that there were triable issues of fact for the jury. (Id., at p. 566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Similarly, in <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 253 [79 Cal.Rptr. 723], the plaintiff\u2019s 13-year-old son sustained severe injuries as the result of a gunpowder explosion. Within moments of the actual explosion, the mother appeared at the scene in an effort to render aid. When she saw his injuries, she suffered severe fright, shock and mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Court of Appeal reversed a summary judgment for the defendants, concluding that all three <em>Dillon </em>factors had been satisfied. (275 Cal.App.2d at p. 256.) As to the second factor, the court noted that \u201c[a] plaintiff claiming damages for emotional trauma as a result of injury to a third party must either be present at the time of the accident [citation] or the shock sustained by the plaintiff must be <em>fairly contemporaneous with the accident rather than follow when the plaintiff is informed of the whole matter at a later date. </em>[Citation.] Manifestly, the shock of seeing a child severely injured immediately after the tortious event may be just as profound as that experienced in witnessing the accident itself. Consequently, the shock sustained by the mother herein was \u2018contemporaneous\u2019 with the explosion . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>There is no principled way to reconcile these cases. Why should the parents in <em>Hathaway </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>who arrived on the scene moments after the crucial event, have been denied recovery, when the parents in <em>Nazaroff </em>and <em>Archibald, </em>who also arrived moments after the accident, have been permitted recovery? Was the emotional distress suffered by the parents in the former cases any less reasonably foreseeable than the emotional distress suffered by the parents in the latter cases? The arbitrary distinctions drawn in cases such as <em>Hathaway </em>and <em>Parsons </em>lead to inequitable and unjust results.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Other inconsistent results are caused by this rigid, narrow construction of the second <em>Dillon </em>guideline. For example, compare <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122] with <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 354 [152 Cal.Rptr. 420]. Both cases involved plaintiff-fathers who were present in the delivery room when their children died during birth due to the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence. In <em>Justus, </em>the court denied recovery since the father\u2019s shock occurred <em>after </em>the doctor informed him that the baby had just died. (19 Cal.3d at p. 585.) However, in <em>Austin, </em>the court permitted recovery since the father \u201clearned of the death by his own observation . . . .\u201d (89 Cal.App.3d at p. 358.) Surely, these results are irreconcilable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Cases addressing the third <em>Dillon </em>factor\u2014\u201c[w]hether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 741)\u2014further illustrate the morass that has developed. <em>Dillon </em>spoke only in terms of a close relationship, yet lower courts have read in a close <em>blood or marriage </em>relationship as a threshold requirement for recovery. Again, arbitrary distinctions, inequities and inconsistencies are the result of these mechanical applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Drew </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 555 [168 Cal.Rptr. 65] is another illustration. There, the plaintiff sustained emotional distress when she witnessed an automobile collision involving her \u201cde facto spouse\u201d with whom she had lived continuously for three years. Construing the third <em>Dillon </em>guideline to require a \u201cfamily relationship\u201d between the plaintiff and the decedent, the Court of Appeal observed, \u201c[t]o allow persons standing in a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 (to use a contemporary colloquialism) to recover for emotional distress resulting in physical injury would abandon the <em>Dillon </em>requirement that \u2018[t]he courts . . . mark out the areas of liability, excluding the remote and unexpected. \u2019 ...\u201d (Id., at pp. 557-558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In a sharply worded dissent, Justice Poch\u00e9 chastised the majority for drawing a \u201cbright line distinction\u201d between those persons formally married and those not and for rewriting the third <em>Dillon </em>guideline \u201cto require a formal marriage relationship.\u201d (110 Cal.App.3d at p. 558.) \u201cWe are told that unchurched . . . relationships cannot be close and that the tortfeasor could not foresee that his victim would have a close relationship with a person to whom she was not formally married. ... [t] I do not believe that this no marriage-no recovery rule is what the California Supreme Court meant when it ordered the courts of this state to carefully analyze on a case-by-case basis what the ordinary person should have foreseen.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 558-559.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>Trapp </em>v. <em>Schuyler Construction </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1140 [197 Cal.Rptr. 411] further illustrates how the courts have narrowly construed this guideline. The plaintiffs were two children who witnessed the drowning of their first cousin and constant playmate in a swimming pool negligently maintained by the defendant. Despite the presence of a relationship analogous to that between siblings, the Court of Appeal held that a close relationship \u201cdoes not include friends, housemates, or those standing in a \u2018meaningful relationship.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Court of Appeal for the Fifth District recently concluded that the third <em>Dillon </em>guideline requires a strict construction. <em>(Kately </em>v. <em>Wilkinson </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 576 [195 Cal.Rptr. 902].) There, a mother, Kately, her 14-year-old daughter, Rebecca, and the daughter\u2019s best friend, Rhonda, described as a \u201cfilial member\u201d of the family, were involved in a water skiing accident. Kately was the owner and operator of the boat. While Rhon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>da was water skiing, the boat\u2019s steering wheel locked because of an alleged defect. While Rebecca looked on, the boat collided with Rhonda, causing severe injuries. Rhonda, who was still alive, was pulled back into the boat. However, \u201cbecause of the locked steering column, Kately was unable to operate the boat. Kately and Rebecca were compelled to sit with Rhonda in her badly mutilated condition as the boat circled in the water. Rhonda died as a result of her injuries.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 580.) Witnessing these fatal injuries, Kately and Rebecca suffered emotional stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The Court of Appeal concluded that Kately\u2019s and Rebecca\u2019s relationship with Rhonda was \u201cnot a family relationship but one akin to a family relationship because of friendship and past associations . . . .\u201d <em>(Kately, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 579.) Although aware of several out-of-state cases which suggested a more liberal construction of the third <em>Dillon </em>guideline, the court observed that the California courts \u201cwhich have been called upon to construe the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines as they relate to foreseeability, when the satisfaction of one or more of them was less than absolute, have construed them strictly.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 584.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">As these cases so aptly illustrate, confusion and inconsistency are the result of a strict construction of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines. The courts have woven a web of arbitrary rules having little or no relation to the reasonable foreseeability of a plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">However, this deplorable state of the law does not stop with <em>Dillon </em>and its progeny. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813, 16 A.L.R.4th 518] added another layer of confusion upon an already \u201canalytically complex regime of arbitrary rules restricting recovery for foreseeable emotional distress\u201d (Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>supra, </em>33 Hastings L.J. at p. 587).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Molien, </em>this court permitted a husband to recover for emotional distress resulting from the misdiagnosis of his wife for syphilis. Faced with a factual situation which did not fit neatly into the <em>Dillon </em>mold, <em>Molien </em>recognized that <em>Dillon's </em>general foreseeability principles controlled and reaffirmed that foreseeability was the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in determining a defendant\u2019s liability. (27 Cal.3d at pp. 922-923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Since the plaintiff-husband was not a bystander, the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines were not applicable. However, <em>Molien </em>permitted recovery since the risk of harm to the husband was \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d The court characterized the husband as a \u201cdirect victim.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>As several commentators and courts have observed, this \u201cdirect victim\u201d test is nothing more than reasonable foreseeability in disguise. (See, e.g., <em>Andalon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 600, 609 [208 Cal.Rptr. 899]; <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Royale Convalescent Hospital </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 914, 922-923 [206 Cal.Rptr. 2] (dis. opn. of Sonenshine, J.); <em>Accounts Adjustment Bureau </em>v. <em>Cooperman </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 844, 848-849 [204 Cal.Rptr. 881]; Nolan <em>&amp; </em>Ursin, <em>supra, </em>33 Hastings L.J. at p. 603; Note, <em>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: New Horizons After Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1981) 13 Pacific L.J. 179, 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Yet that test, too, has spawned confusion. For example, in <em>Andalon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 600, the Court of Appeal permitted the parents of a child born with Down\u2019s Syndrome to recover for emotional distress resulting from the alleged negligent prenatal care to the mother. The court concluded that both parents were \u201cdirect victims,\u201d since the mother was a party to the contract with the defendant-doctor and the father was a \u201cdirect beneficiary of [the] tort-duty imposed by virtue of the doctor-patient relationship.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In <em>Accounts Adjustment Bureau </em>v. <em>Cooperman, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d 844, the Court of Appeal permitted the parents of a two-year-old child to maintain an action against a psychologist for emotional distress allegedly caused by the defendant\u2019s misdiagnosis of their child. Relying on <em>Molien, </em>the court held that \u201c[i]t would be pure fiction to believe that a negligent diagnosis of a two-year-old could not foreseeably cause parents serious emotional distress. A two-year-old has no one but parents to be distressed. Parents having sole responsibility for their child can be direct victims of their child\u2019s misdiagnosis.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 848-849.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">A similar expansive reading of Molien\u2019s direct victim analysis occurred in <em>Sesma </em>v. <em>Cueto </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 108 [181 Cal.Rptr. 12]. There, a mother and father suffered emotional distress as a result of alleged medical negligence resulting in the stillbirth of their child. The court permitted the mother to go to trial as a direct victim since the mother\u2019s \u201cemotional distress could have been personally and directly sustained in her own right, as contrasted to injury sustained in her \u2018bystander\u2019 capacity as a prospective mother distressed at injury inflicted upon her unborn fetus.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 115, fn. omitted.) The court further held that <em>Molien </em>\u201csupports the conclusion that . . . the father [] may be able to show that he is a \u2018direct victim\u2019\u2014if not percipient witness\u2014of negligent acts giving rise to infliction of serious emotional distress.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">However, in <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Macias </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 640 [167 Cal.Rptr. 905], the Court of Appeal strictly construed Molien\u2019s direct victim require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ment. There, a mother sued for negligent infliction of emotional distress caused by the negligent diagnosis and treatment of her infant son. The court recognized that \u201c[t]he language in <em>Molien </em>is sufficiently broad ... to permit similar reasoning to be applied to the facts of the case before us.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 649.) Nevertheless, the court applied the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines and denied recovery because the mother\u2019s shock did not result from a contemporaneous observance of the negligent conduct but from the news of her child\u2019s death moments later. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 650.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Royale Convalescent Hospital, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d 914 also illustrates a strict construction of Molien's direct victim limitation. There, the court denied recovery to a wife who sued a hospital for emotional distress arising from the negligent care of her husband who was seriously hurt when he fell from his hospital bed because of the defendant\u2019s failure to raise the bed\u2019s safety rails. The court was not persuaded that the case fell within the ambit of <em>Molien, </em>concluding that the wife was not a direct victim since her emotional distress derived solely from her husband\u2019s injuries. (I<em>d., </em>at pp. 917-918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In a persuasive dissent, Justice Sonenshine concluded that the wife was a direct victim under <em>Molien. </em>(158 Cal.App.3d at p. 923.) \u201cIt is easily predictable that negligent care of one\u2019s elderly and infirm spouse would produce emotional distress. This is particularly true in the context of this case. Wife herself is elderly and was unable to personally fulfill her spousal obligations of comfort and care. She thus entrusted her husband\u2019s care to defendants. Any negligent abuse of that responsibility would have a <em>direct </em>effect on her.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In <em>Kately </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d 576, the Court of Appeal applied a flexible direct victim analysis. Although <em>Dillon </em>would not permit recovery (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 185), the court held that under <em>Molien, </em>mother and daughter were direct victims. (148 Cal.App.3d at pp. 587-589.) The manufacturer and seller of the boat \u201cshould reasonably have foreseen that Kately, as the purchaser and an operator of the defective boat, would suffer emotional distress when the boat malfunctioned and killed or injured another human being.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 587-588.) \u201cThe user of a defective product is not a mere bystander but a primary and direct victim of the product defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Id., at p. 588.) Moreover, in view of a statute which required that the skier be under constant surveillance, the court held that \u201cit was foreseeable that [the daughter] would suffer emotional distress from witnessing injury to the skier for whom she was the responsible observer ....\u2019\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 588-589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Kately </em>is particularly representative of the confusion that has followed <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien. </em>Faced with a compelling factual situation in which emotional distress was manifestly foreseeable, the court reached a just result. But that result was obscured by a strict reading of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines and a flexible direct victim analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Taken together, <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien </em>reduce to the following: if a plaintiff is a \u201cdirect victim,\u201d then a \u201cpure\u201d foreseeability test applies to determine liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress. However, if the plaintiff is a \u201cbystander,\u201d the three <em>Dillon </em>criteria are invoked. (See Diamond, <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg Revisited: Toward a Unified Theory of Compensating Bystanders and Relatives for Intangible Injuries </em>(1984) 35 Hastings L.J. 477, 494-495; Note, <em>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: Reconciling the Bystander and Direct Victim Causes of Action </em>(1983) 18 U.S.F. L.Rev. 145, 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">It may be asked whether the distinction between a direct victim and a bystander is sufficiently clear to justify application of different tests. (See <em>Andalon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at pp. 608-609.) Why, for example, should plaintiffs such as Mr. Molien be permitted recovery while plaintiffs who fall within the ambit of the <em>Dillon </em>bystander scenario be denied recovery simply because they fail to satisfy all of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">One commentator has aptly summarized the state of negligent infliction of emotional distress law after <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien: </em>\u201c[C]ourts have applied the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines mechanically, viewing them as strict preconditions to recovery. This mechanical application has led to the erection of arbitrary limitations on recovery bearing little relation to the principles of foreseeability espoused so forcefully in <em>Dillon. </em>While in some instances mental distress is compensated, other equally foreseeable mental injuries are not. The result is feast or famine for the plaintiff depending on the fortuities of time, location, or characterization of the plaintiff as \u2018direct\u2019 or \u2018indirect.\u2019 \u201d (Diamond, <em>supra, </em>35 Hastings L.J. at p. 478, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Instead of providing the clear guidance that is sorely needed in this area of the law, the majority mechanically apply the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>their reaffirmation that the guidelines should be treated as such (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 170), even the majority convert the guidelines into strict \u201crequirements.\u201d (See <em>id.., </em>at p. 165 &amp; fn. 6.) They also narrowly construe <em>Molier\u00eds </em>direct victim analysis, virtually limiting <em>Molien </em>to its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The majority properly reject the \u201csudden occurrence\u201d requirement which had been read into the second <em>Dillon </em>guideline. Their rejection is premised on the arbitrariness of that requirement. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 168.) However, the rule they propose\u2014that recovery is permitted \u201cwhen there is observation of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the child\u2019s injury and contemporaneous awareness the defendant\u2019s conduct or lack thereof is causing harm\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 170)\u2014is equally arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">While this rule obtains the correct result here, such will not always be the case. Liability should not hinge on the observation of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing. Certainly, the foreseeability of emotional shock from seeing a loved one die or suffer injury does not always depend on whether the plaintiff observes the defendant\u2019s conduct or is \u201ccontemporaneously aware\u201d that such conduct is causing the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Under the majority\u2019s rule, any parent who arrives on the scene after an accident will not be permitted recovery. For example, a parent who is present with a child when a doctor administers an incorrect dosage which results in the child\u2019s death will be permitted recovery, while a parent who is asked to wait in an adjoining room while the doctor administers the same fatal dosage will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This court should not replace one arbitrary limitation with another, thereby perpetuating artificial distinctions which result in inequitable and unfair rulings. Instead, this court should embrace the foreseeability principles espoused in both <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien. </em>Both of those decisions emphasized that foreseeability of the risk was the critical element in determining liability. <em>(Molien, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 922; <em>Dillon, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 740.) Both recognized that \u201c [i]n order to limit the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every negligent act, the law of torts holds defendant amenable only for injuries to others which to defendant at the time were <em>reasonably foreseeable.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 739, italics added; <em>Molien, supra, </em>at p. 922.) Both instructed that liability had to be determined on a case-by-case basis and that \u201cno immutable rule\u201d could establish the extent of that liability for every circumstance in the future. <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>at p. 740; <em>Molien, supra, </em>at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Just as <em>Dillon </em>condemned the \u201chopeless artificiality\u201d of the zone of danger rule (68 Cal.2d at p. 733), denounced \u201cartificial abstractions which bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>recovery contrary to the general [principles of tort law]\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 747) and rejected \u201c \u2018mechanical rules of thumb\u2019 \u201d which are at variance with those general principles <em>(id., </em>at p. 746), this court should reject the \u201cmechanical rules of thumb\u201d created by a rigid application of the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines and condemn the \u201chopeless artificiality\u201d of the direct victim/bystander distinction. Just as <em>Molien </em>held that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to exercise care in that case \u201c[b]ecause the risk of harm . . . was reasonably foreseeable\u201d (27 Cal.3d at p. 923), this court should reaffirm that simple holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien </em>compel the conclusion that reasonable foreseeability <em>is </em>the appropriate test for determining whether a defendant is liable for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. Any other reading of those cases creates artificial distinctions and arbitrary limitations which in the end produce unjust results and mass confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">By embracing reasonable foreseeability to determine a defendant\u2019s liability, this court would conform the emotional distress area to all other areas of negligence law, thereby honoring its admonition in <em>Dillon </em>that there is \u201cno good reason why the general rules of tort law, including the concepts of negligence, proximate cause, and foreseeability, long applied to all other types of injury, should not govern the case now before us.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 746.) The test of reasonable foreseeability \u201cfacilitates rational risk spreading and correlates liability with the risks that the defendant should expect.\u201d (Diamond, <em>supra, </em>35 Hastings L.J. at p. 500.) Most importantly, it provides a principled basis for determining liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Other courts, notably in England and Hawaii, have held that reasonable foreseeability is the appropriate test for determining a defendant\u2019s liability in these cases. In <em>McLoughlin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian </em>(1982) 2 All Eng.Rep. 298, plaintiff\u2019s husband and three minor children were involved in an automobile accident caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence. One of the plaintiff\u2019s children was killed instantaneously and her husband and two other children were severely injured. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was two miles away at home. She was informed of the accident about an hour later and was driven to the hospital. There, she saw the injured, bedraggled members of her family and heard that her two-year-old daughter had been killed. As a result, plaintiff suffered severe shock, organic depression and a change of personality. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 300-301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The House of Lords reversed both lower courts which had denied plaintiff\u2019s claim and held that she had stated a cause of action for emotional distress. Relying in part on <em>Dillon, McLoughlin </em>concluded that \u201ccommon law principle requires the judges to follow the logic of the \u2018reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>foreseeable test\u2019 so as, in circumstances where it is appropriate, to apply it untrammelled by spatial, physical or temporal limits. Space, time, distance, the nature of the injuries sustained and the relationship of the plaintiff to the immediate victim of the accident are factors to be weighed, but not legal limitations, when the test of reasonable foreseeability is to be applied.\u201d <em>(McLoughlin, supra, </em>2 All Eng.Rep. at p. 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Since Lord Bridge\u2019s opinion in <em>McLoughlin </em>is particularly instructive, I would like to quote from it at length. He concluded that there were no policy considerations sufficient to justify limiting the liability of negligent tortfeasors, who have caused emotional distress, by some narrower criterion than that of reasonable foreseeability. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 319-320.) \u201cA policy which is to be relied on to narrow the scope of the negligent tortfeasor\u2019s duty must be justified by cogent and readily intelligible considerations, and must be capable of defining the appropriate limits of liability by reference to factors which are not purely arbitrary.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 319.) \u201c[T]o draw a line by reference to any of [the <em>Dillon\\ </em>criteria must impose a largely arbitrary limit of liability. . . . [Ijnjustice would be wrought by any such hard and fast lines of policy as have been suggested.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Lord Bridge concluded that \u201cthis is an area of the law of negligence where we should resist the temptation to try yet once more to freeze the law in a rigid posture which would deny justice to some who, in the application of the classic principles of negligence . . ., ought to succeed, in the interests of certainty, where the very subject matter is uncertain and continuously developing, or in the interests of saving defendants and their insurers from the burden of having sometimes to resist doubtful claims. I find myself in complete agreement with [Justice] Tobriner . . . that the defendant\u2019s duty must depend on <em>reasonable foreseeability </em>and\u2014\u2018must necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis. We cannot now predetermine defendant\u2019s obligation in every situation by a fixed category; no immutable rule can establish the extent of that obligation for every circumstance of the future.\u2019 \u201d (2 All Eng.Rep., at p. 320, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The courts of Hawaii have taken similar stands. In recognizing the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the court in <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>State </em>(1970) 52 Hawaii 156, 52 Hawaii 283 [472 P.2d 509], held that liability in such cases would be determined \u201cmost justly by the application of general tort principles.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 520.) Liability may be found where it was reasonably foreseeable that serious mental distress to the plaintiff could result from the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 520-521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\"><em>Rodrigues </em>was reaffirmed four years later in <em>Leong </em>v. <em>Takasaki </em>(1974) 55 Hawaii 398 [520 P.2d 758, 94 A.L.R.3d 471]. There, the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201cwhen it is reasonably foreseeable that a reasonable plaintiff-witness to an accident would not be able to cope with the mental stress engendered by such circumstances, the trial court should conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct is the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury and impose liability on the defendant for any damages arising from the consequences of his negligent act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 765.) The court noted that the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines \u201cshould not be employed by a trial court to bar recovery but should at most be indicative of the degree of mental stress suffered.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 766.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Most recently, in a unanimous decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court reaffirmed the principles espoused in <em>Rodrigues </em>and <em>Leong. </em>In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Animal Quarantine Station, Etc. </em>(1981) 63 Hawaii 557 [632 P.2d 1066], the court upheld an award of damages for emotional distress suffered when the plaintiffs\u2019 dog died as a result of the defendants\u2019 negligence in transporting the dog to a private veterinarian hospital. None of the plaintiffs saw the dog die nor did any of them see its deceased body. They were informed of the dog\u2019s death by telephone the following day. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1067.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The court found that <em>Rodrigues </em>and <em>Leong </em>were dispositive. (632 P.2d at p. 1068.) Reaffirming the view that the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines \u201cshould be utilized to determine the genuineness and degree of mental distress, rather than to bar recovery,\u201d the court indicated that there is no requirement that the tortious event be witnessed by the plaintiffs. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1069.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The posture taken by the courts of England and Hawaii supports the conclusion that reasonable foreseeability should play the primary role in determining a defendant\u2019s liability in such cases. As both jurisdictions recognized, the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines should be used as mere factors for the jury\u2019s consideration rather than as hard and fast requirements for recovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Opponents of such an approach will undoubtedly proclaim that it will open the floodgates and result in unlimited liability. But as the majority observe, quoting from <em>Dillon, </em>\u201c \u2018 \u201c[We] should be sorry to adopt a rule which would bar all such claims on grounds of policy alone, and in order to prevent the possible success of unrighteous or groundless actions. Such a course involves the denial of redress in meritorious cases, and it necessarily implies a certain degree of distrust, which [we] do not share, in the capacity of legal tribunals to get at the truth in this class of claim.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 171, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Addressing a related argument in <em>Rodrigues, </em>the Hawaii Supreme Court recognized that its decision \u201cdoes shift a part of the burden of administering claims of mental distress inordinately assumed by the courts to juries.\u201d (472 P.2d at p. 521, fn. 8.) However, \u201c[a]s in other mental tort cases, the jury, representing a cross section of the community is in a better position to consider under what particular circumstances society should or should not recognize recovery for mental distress. . . . Moreover, the jury is no less \u2018without restraint\u2019 under the \u2018reasonable man\u2019 standard we have established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>than in innumerable other negligence cases where a \u2018reasonable man\u2019 standard and general tort principles are applied and where the preliminary issue of whether the case presents questions on which reasonable men would disagree is for the court.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Dillon </em>itself indicated that the concept of reasonable foreseeability \u201climit[s] the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every negligent act ... .\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 739.) <em>Dillon </em>also observed that \u201cwe cannot let the difficulties of adjudication frustrate the principle that there be a remedy for every substantial wrong.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>In the face of the present confusion that exists in this area of the law, these statements should not be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Moreover, the <em>Molien </em>court, like the Hawaii court in <em>Rodrigues, </em>limited recovery to claims of <em>serious </em>mental distress. <em>(Molien, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 930; <em>Rodrigues, supra, </em>472 P.2d at p. 520.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That limitation, employed with the reasonable foreseeability principle, adequately limits the class of potential claims. (Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>supra, </em>33 Hastings L.J. at pp. 609-615; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kokua Sales and Supply, Ltd., supra, </em>532 P.2d at pp. 677-678 (dis. opn. of Richardson, C. J.).) \u201c[T]he seriousness criterion adequately protects against fraud, trivial claims, and unlimited liability by requiring severe and debilitating harm.\u201d (Nolan &amp; Ursin, <em>supra, </em>33 Hastings L.J. at p. 620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">It is also instructive to take note of Hawaii\u2019s experience. In its most recent decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c[sjince our holding in <em>Rodrigues, </em>there has been no \u2018plethora of similar cases\u2019; the fears of unlimited liability have not proved true.\u201d <em>(Campbell, supra, </em>632 P.2d at p. 1071.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The <em>Dillon </em>guidelines originally envisioned as aids in determining reasonable foreseeability have been transformed into rigid, threshold requirements for recovery. Arbitrary, inconsistent and inequitable results are the rule. The <em>Molien </em>\u201cdirect victim\u201d scheme, at least as construed by the majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>only adds another layer of confusion. The majority\u2019s reasoning simply perpetuates the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The answer lies in a careful reading of the grounds on which <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Molien </em>rest. An individual who suffers emotional distress, regardless of whether he or she is a \u201cdirect victim\u201d or a \u201cbystander,\u201d should be able to recover damages if (1) the emotional distress was reasonably foreseeable and (2) the distress suffered was serious. The concepts of reasonable foreseeability and serious injury, employed together, adequately protect against unlimited liability and provide a principled basis for determining it. <em>Dillon </em>should remain a guidepost to assist the trier of fact in determining liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">As Justice Tobriner stated so eloquently, \u201cLegal history shows that artificial islands of exceptions, created from the fear that the legal process will not work, usually do not withstand the waves of reality and, in time, descend into oblivion. . . .

In recognizing a cause of action, the court concluded that \u201c[i]t is nonetheless patently clear that a mother forms a sufficiently close relationship with her fetus during pregnancy so that its stillbirth will foreseeably cause her severe emotional distress. . . . The solution to the problem lies not in contorting <em>Dillon </em>to cover a situation which it was not designated to fit, but in recognizing that the emotional distress arising from the sensory impact of the death of the child is compensable as part of the mother\u2019s cause of action for malpractice to herself.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>A more liberal reading <em>o\u00ed Dillon </em>and a focus on the reasonable foreseeability of the serious emotional distress would have prevented such a strained analysis. <em>(See post, </em>at pp. 190-191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Negligent misdiagnosis and treatment cases are in their own state of disarray.

There, the court denied recovery where a grandfather living in California suffered a fatal heart attack when informed by telephone that his daughter and granddaughter had been killed and another granddaughter seriously injured as a result of an automobile accident in Hawaii. To limit a defendant\u2019s liability, the <em>Kelley </em>court required that plaintiffs be located within a reasonable distance from the scene of the accident. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 676.) The court held that the defendants could not reasonably foresee the consequences to the grandfather since his location from the scene of the accident was \u201ctoo remote.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In a strongly worded dissent, Chief Justice Richardson, the author of <em>Rodrigues </em>and <em>Leong, </em>chastised the majority for drawing a line that \u201carbitrarily forecloses plaintiff\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of mental stress.\u201d (532 P.2d at p. 678.)

It is thus a deliberate policy decision that as between an innocent plaintiff and a negligent wrongdoer, that the latter must bear the loss. ...[!] Confining liability to a specific sphere of contemporaneity, as proposed, is all too inflexible. In effect the majority reinstates a scheme of arbitrary distinctions as to where liability ends that we expressly rejected in <em>Rodrigues. </em>The artificiality of the majority\u2019s position is too readily apparent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">An increasing number of other out-of-state decisions are permitting recovery for emotional distress in situations where the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines are not explicitly satisfied.

(See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 165, fn. 5.) The majority apparently rely on the view that the defendant must act with \u201cthe purpose of causing the plaintiffs emotional distress.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>To support that view, the majority cite cases involving threats and insults.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In my view, this situation more closely resembles cases involving unauthorized autopsies, where liability has been found even in the absence of a claim that the defendant acted with the purpose of causing emotional distress. (See, e.g., <em>Huntly </em>v. <em>Zurich General A. &amp; L. Ins. Co. </em>(1929) 100 Cal.App. 201 [280 P. 163].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">A cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress may rest upon outrageous conduct by the defendant which is in \u201creckless disregard\u201d of the probability of causing emotional distress. There does not have to be an intent to cause such distress. (See <em>Newby </em>v. <em>Alto Riviera Apartments </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 288, 296 [131 Cal.Rptr. 547], disapproved on another point in <em>Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 740-741, fn. 9 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161].) \u201cA defendant\u2019s conduct is in reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress if he has knowledge of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will result and acts with deliberate disregard of that probability or with a wanton disregard of the possible results.\u201d (BAJI No. 12.77 (6th ed. 1977); see also Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 46, com. i.) Given the lack of response by the defendants in the face of the severity of the symptoms exhibited by the decedent and the repeated pleas of Mrs. Ochoa, plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">It is also interesting to note that the majority conclude that plaintiffs stated facts sufficient to state a cause of action under 42 United States Code section 1983 which requires plaintiffs to state facts which show that defendants\u2019 medical care was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and thus resulted in the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 176-177.) If defendants\u2019 conduct may have amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, does it not satisfy the \u201creckless disregard\u201d test for an intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action? Methinks there is an inconsistency here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
