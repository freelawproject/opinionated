We conclude that when Labor Code section 5405, subdivision (a) (all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise cited) applies, the limitations period specified therein runs from the date of injury. If the employer breaches its statutory duty to notify an employee unaware of his workers\u2019 compensation rights of those rights, the limitations period is tolled for the period of time that the employee remains unaware of his rights. No tolling occurs if the employee has actual knowledge of his rights before the employer\u2019s breach. The employer has the burden of proving when the injured employee gained actual knowledge of his workers\u2019 compensation rights. The employee must know that he may be entitled to relevant benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation system. We reach this conclusion after examining the language of the statutes involved, the case law, and the policies underlying the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On February 25, 1981, while working for the City of Daly City (City), Marvin Martin slipped and fell, injuring his left leg. The injury worsened and on March 6, 1981, Martin was admitted to Kaiser Foundation Hospital (Kaiser) in Redwood City where he was furnished medical services. Because of his injury, Martin did not return to work until May 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">On April 23, 1981, Kaiser, as required by section 6409, sent a first report of work injury to Scott, Wetzel Services, Inc., insurance adjusters for City. There is no evidence that either Kaiser or City knew before Kaiser sent this letter that Martin\u2019s injury was possibly work related. On July 2, 1981, the adjusters, as required by section 5402 and administrative regulations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Martin a letter rejecting any employer liability for the injury, and advising Martin that if he was not satisfied he could contact the state Division of Industrial Accidents or consult an attorney. A copy of the letter was sent to Kaiser. Both parties concede that this letter adequately notified Martin of his workers\u2019 compensation rights. Martin acknowledged receiving the letter on August 13, 1981. There is no evidence that he had any knowledge of his workers\u2019 compensation rights prior to receiving this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Kaiser forwarded the case to its attorney in January 1982. In March 1982, Kaiser\u2019s attorney wrote to Martin\u2019s attorney asking if Martin planned to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim. After it received a negative response, Kaiser, on April 15, 1982, filed an application for adjudication of claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) as a medical lien claimant. (The right to file such a claim is discussed <em>infra.) </em>Kaiser\u2019s application was filed more than one year after Martin sustained his injury, but less than one year after City\u2019s adjusters sent the notice denying liability and advising Martin of his workers\u2019 compensation rights; i.e., more than one year from the date of injury, but less than one year after the employer notified the employee of his workers\u2019 compensation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The WCAB held that Kaiser\u2019s action was barred by section 5405, subdivision (a), which states that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings must be commenced within one year from the date of injury. As will appear, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">1. <em>Section 5405: Language and Underlying Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Section 5405 specifies in relevant part that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings must be commenced within one year from the later of \u201c(a) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>date of injury; or . . . [f] (c) The date of last furnishing of any benefits provided for in [\u00a7\u00a7 4600-4605] . . . .\u201d Sections 4600-4605 specify that an employer must provide all competent medical care reasonably required to treat a work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The purpose of any limitations statute is to require \u201cdiligent prosecution of known claims thereby providing necessary finality and predictability in legal affairs, and ensuring that claims will be resolved while the evidence bearing on the issues is reasonably available and fresh.\u201d <em>(Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Webb) </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 329, 336 [137 Cal.Rptr. 878, 562 P.2d 1037]; see also 3 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1983) \u00a7 78.10 [\u201cThe purpose ... of any limitations statute [is] to protect the employer against claims too old to be successfully investigated and defended\u201d]; 2 Hanna, Cal.

Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 726 [117 Cal.Rptr. 79, 527 P.2d 631], the employee had a heart attack at work on February 20, 1968, and his supervisor called an ambulance. Because of the heart attack, the employee did not work for one year; he paid all his own medical expenses. In December 1970, a relative suggested to the employee that he might have a workers\u2019 compensation claim, a possibility that he had not considered previously. He consulted an attorney and filed a claim on January 22, 1971, almost three years after the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In <em>Reynolds, </em>we held the claim was not barred by section 5405\u2019s one-year limitations period because the employer never notified the employee of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation rights,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the employee was unaware of those rights at the time of his injury. We observed that, under section 138.4, \u201cThe administrative director [of the Division of Industrial Accidents, Department of Industrial Relations] shall, with respect to injuries involving loss of time: [1] (a) Prescribe reasonable rules and regulations for the serving on the employee of reports dealing with the payment or nonpayment of benefits . . . .\u201d (P. 729.) Pursuant to section 138.4, the administrative director had promulgated rules effective at the time of the employee\u2019s injury in <em>Reynolds, </em>requiring an employer to notify employees of their workers\u2019 compensation rights when an employee\u2019s injuries resulted in hospitalization or loss of more than seven days of work. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 9816, 9817, 9859.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Reynolds, </em>\u201cThe clear purpose of these rules is to protect and preserve the rights of an injured employee who may be ignorant of the procedures or, indeed, the very existence of the workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u2019\u2019 (12 Cal.3d at p. 729.) <em>Reynolds </em>stands for the proposition that when an employer fails to perform its statutory duty to notify an injured employee of his workers\u2019 compensation rights, <em>and </em>the injured employee is unaware of those rights from the date of injury through the date of the employer\u2019s breach, then the statute of limitations will be tolled until the employee receives actual knowledge that he may be entitled to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Following the <em>Reynolds </em>decision, the Legislature in 1975 added new section 138.3, and amended section 5402. Section 138.3 states: \u201cThe administrative director shall, with respect to all injuries, prescribe . . . reasonable rules and regulations requiring the employer to serve notice on the injured employee that he may be entitled to benefits under this division.\u201d The 1975 amendment to section 5402 added the following relevant language: \u201cUpon receiving . . . knowledge [of an injury], the employer shall notify the injured employee . . . that he may be entitled to benefits under this division. Such notice by the employer shall be within the time period and in the manner prescribed by the administrative director for such purpose . . . .\u201d Thus, sections 138.3 and 5402 codify Administrative Code, title 8, sections 9816, 9817, and 9859, and by implication confer legislative approval on the result reached in <em>Reynolds. </em>(See <em>Review of Selected 1975 Cal. Legislation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(1976) 7 Pacific L.J. 237, 568-569; Mastoris, <em>The Statutes of Limitation in Workers\u2019 Compensation Proceedings </em>(1979) 15 Cal. Western L.Rev. 32, 55 &amp; fn. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In 1977, pursuant to the 1975 legislation, the administrative director added a rule requiring employers, within five days of receiving notice of any employee\u2019s work-related injury, to notify the employee in writing of his workers\u2019 compensation rights. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 9880.) Apart from lending support to the <em>Reynolds </em>decision, the net result of the 1975 legislation and subsequent addition to the Administrative Code was to expand the employer\u2019s duty to inform the injured employee.  Under section 5402, the duty now arises when the employer has actual or constructive knowledge of any work-related injury, including those requiring no hospitalization or time off work.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">3. <em>Effect of the 1975 Amendments on the Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We think it significant that the reinforcement of the employer\u2019s duty to notify following <em>Reynolds </em>was accomplished not by modifying section 5405 (the limitations period), but by expressly codifying that duty in a separate section entitled, \u201cNotice of Injury.\u201d (\u00a7 5402.) Because this was the approach taken, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to postpone automatically the commencement of the limitations period until an employer with knowledge of an industrial injury notified the employee of his workers\u2019 compensation rights. If the Legislature had intended an automatic postponement, it could easily have been accomplished by an amendment to section 5405.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We also note that, although the Legislature codified the employer\u2019s duty to notify, it failed to specify a consequence for the breach of that duty. Yet the 1975 amendments were not surplusage. We must therefore determine the legislative intent in the light of both the <em>Reynolds </em>decision, which generated the changes, and the policy of protecting those unaware of their rights, inherent in any notification statute. We conclude that the remedy for breach of an employer\u2019s duty to notify is a tolling of the statute of limitations if the employee, without that tolling, is prejudiced by that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">An employee would be prejudiced without the tolling if he has no knowledge that his injury might be covered by workers\u2019 compensation before he receives notice from the employer. Requiring prejudice to toll the limitations period promotes the policy behind the notification statutes; to protect those unaware of their rights. If between the date of injury and the date the employer breaches, an employee gains the requisite actual knowledge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation rights, he will not be prejudiced by failure of his employer to notify him of those rights, and there is no reason to toll the statute of limitations even if his employer never advises him of his workers\u2019 compensation rights. If the employee remains ignorant of his rights past the time the employer breaches its duty to notify, the employee will be prejudiced from the date of breach until the employee gains actual knowledge that he may be entitled to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation system. By promoting the purpose of the notice statute in this manner, we accord weight to the Legislature\u2019s choice following <em>Reynolds </em>to modify the Labor Code\u2019s notice requirements rather than to alter the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In selecting this approach, we have rejected an ironclad rule that would start the statute of limitations running only upon receipt of the statutorily required notice from the employer; such an inflexible rule would be inconsistent with the policies underlying statutes of limitations. Such statutes are intended to afford \u201cfinality and predictability in legal affairs, and [to ensure] that claims will be resolved while the evidence bearing on the issues is reasonably available and fresh.\u201d <em>(Kaiser (Webb), supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 336.) The related notice statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 138.3, 138.4, 5402) demonstrate a legislative decision that the policies underlying the statute of limitations are outweighed when an employer with knowledge of an injury breaches its duty to advise, and the employee is unaware of workers\u2019 compensation. Once a breaching employer notifies an injured employee of his workers\u2019 compensation rights, the policies behind the statute of limitations take precedence, and the tolling of the limitations period ends no later than the date notice is received. The tolling period ends earlier only if the employer proves that the employee gained the requisite knowledge of his workers\u2019 compensation rights before he receives the employer\u2019s notice. Similarly, if an employee is already aware of his rights when the injury is discovered, the limitations period is not tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Furthermore, in order to find that the limitations period starts only upon an employee\u2019s receipt of the statutory notice, without regard to the employee\u2019s knowledge at the time of injury, we would be required to ignore the language of section 5405 expressly providing that the period runs from the \u201cdate of injury.\u201d The present case involves a \u201cspecific\u201d or discrete injury rather than a cumulative injury or occupational disease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For a specific in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>jury, the code defines \u201cdate of injury\u201d as \u201cthat date during the employment on which occurred the alleged incident or exposure, for the consequences of which compensation is claimed.\u201d (\u00a7 5411.) To require automatic tolling of the limitations period until the statutory notice is received would be to read \u201cdate of injury\u201d out of the statute of limitations (\u00a7 5405) in almost all cases. As noted previously, the Legislature did not amend section 5405, nor did it amend section 5411 to redefine \u201cdate of injury\u201d in specific injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The rule we adopt requiring tolling only where an employer\u2019s breach of the notice requirements prejudices an employee is consistent with the other notification requirements of the workers\u2019 compensation system. Section 5400 requires an injured employee to notify his employer in writing of the injury within 30 days of its occurrence. An employee\u2019s failure to give written notice has no consequence if an employer gains constructive knowledge of the injury. (\u00a7 5402.) But if the employer does not gain such knowledge then it may successfully move to dismiss the claim for compensation if it can prove it was prejudiced by lack of written notice. (\u00a7 5403.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In conclusion, the rule we adopt is consistent with both the <em>Reynolds </em>decision and the applicable workers\u2019 compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">4. <em>Kaiser\u2019s Claim Is Timely</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Applying the foregoing analysis to the present case, we conclude that the statute of limitations began running on the date of Martin\u2019s injury, but was tolled from the date City was in breach, until the date it notified Martin of his workers\u2019 compensation rights, and Kaiser\u2019s claim is thus timely. Martin\u2019s injury occurred on February 25, 1981. Kaiser sent its first report of work injury on April 23, 1981, but City did not send the required notice until July 2, 1981, and Martin did not acknowledge receiving the notice until August 13, 1981. The administrative regulations require an employer upon receiving knowledge of a work-related injury to advise an employee of his workers\u2019 compensation rights within five working days. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 9880.) Hence, City was in breach of its duty to notify for at least two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Next, because there is no evidence in the record that Martin knew of his workers\u2019 compensation rights, we find that City\u2019s breach would have prejudiced him.  The burden was on City to prove Martin knew of his rights before City sent notice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we presume Martin was ignorant of those rights until he received City\u2019s notice in July or August 1981.  Since City breached its duty and Martin was ignorant of his workers\u2019 compensation rights until he received notice, the statute of limitations was tolled during the two-month period that City was in breach. Kaiser\u2019s application was therefore timely because it was filed within one year and two months from the date of Martin\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">5. <em>Kaiser\u2019s Status as a Lien Claimant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">A hospital such as Kaiser that provides medical services to an injured employee may initiate compensation proceedings by filing an application. (\u00a7 5501; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 10360, 10364.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A medical lien claimant\u2019s filing initiates the workers\u2019 compensation process as if the employee himself had filed a claim. The injured employee must be named as a party and served notice, but he need not take part in the proceedings. Although the Labor Code permits a hospital to initiate proceedings, \u201cno separate, independent right against the employer or insurance carrier [has] been conferred ... by the [code] on doctors or hospitals furnishing medical services to injured employees [;] ... the only direct liability [is] a liability to the injured employee, and an award in favor of the injured employee must be made before a lien thereon [can] be imposed in favor of the doctor or hospital.\u201d <em>(Independence Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 397, 402 [41 P.2d 320].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The question arises whether, to protect its interests, Kaiser was required to file a claim on behalf of Martin within one year from the date of injury. Since Kaiser\u2019s lien claim is derivative, Kaiser has no greater or fewer rights than Martin to bring the action. Furthermore, neither the Labor Code nor any California case creates a different statute of limitations for medical lien claimants as opposed to injured employees in workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pensation claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that there is but one limitations period for any particular workers\u2019 compensation claim, and that is the period applicable to the injured employee. The limitations period in the present case was tolled from the date City breached its duty until the date Martin received notice of his compensation rights from City. Regardless of its own prior knowledge of the workers\u2019 compensation laws, Kaiser, like any other lien claimant, had one year from the date of Martin\u2019s injury plus the period of City\u2019s breach to file a timely claim if Martin did not previously file one.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The WCAB and City cite <em>Hurwitz </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 854 [158 Cal.Rptr. 914], for the proposition that the statute of limitations bars the present claim. <em>Hurwitz, </em>however, is distinguishable. In <em>Hurwitz, </em>employee, a legal secretary, was injured while descending the steps of her office building on May 2, 1975. Employee hired an attorney to sue the owner of the office building in tort rather than seek workers\u2019 compensation from her employer. At or near the date of injury, employee knew she had a workers\u2019 compensation claim and even knew of the one-year limitations period. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 862.) Yet, she filed no claim for workers\u2019 compensation until April 11, 1977, almost two years after the date of injury. Employee contended that her claim was not barred by the statute of limitations, because her employer failed to send her the statutorily required notice of her workers\u2019 compensation rights. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 868-869.) Since employee not only knew of her workers\u2019 compensation remedy on the date of her injury but also deliberately delayed pursuing that relief, the <em>Hurwitz </em>court was correct in holding her claim barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The Board\u2019s decision denying Kaiser\u2019s lien claim is annulled and the matter is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Bird, C.

Section 5412 provides that the date of injury in a cumulative injury case is the date the employee knew or should have known his injury was work related. In <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>the Court of Appeal held that the cumulative injury limitations period was the same for both Kaiser and the injured employee because both were apprised of the same facts, and the court would not require of Kaiser a greater insight into whether the cumulative injury was work related. In dicta, the court said, \u201cIf a [health care] provider can be shown to have greater knowledge in that respect than ... the employee, the provider\u2019s claim may be precluded as a lien.\u201d (Id., at p. 573.) We presume the Court of Appeal meant that a lien claimant could be barred by laches if it unreasonably delayed.

(\u00a7\u00a7 5410, 5803, 5804.) Nevertheless, a lien claim may be barred by laches if there is unjustifiable delay. <em>(Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd.
