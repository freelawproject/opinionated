Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (a)) in the shooting death of his wife of 13 years. Upon review, we conclude that disbarment is the more appropriate discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In the disciplinary proceedings below, petitioner and respondent State Bar entered into a \u201cStipulation as to Facts and Discipline.\u201d (See Rules Proc. of State Bar, rules 401-408.) The stipulation contains the following recital of the relevant facts leading up to and including the killing: \u201c[Petitioner] and his wife, Marcie Nevill, began having marital difficulties in approximately August 1981. Some of these difficulties involved Mrs. Nevill\u2019s relationship with a male co-worker in her office. On November 20, 1981, [petitioner] picked up the couple\u2019s sixteen-month-old daughter from her nursery school and took her to Mrs. Nevill\u2019s office. He advised Mrs. Nevill that he and the child were leaving, then took the child home. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Nevill left her office and also went home, [f] When Mrs. Nevill arrived home, an argument ensued and [petitioner] shot his wife approximately ten times with a rifle in the bedroom of their house. Death was immediate. [Petitioner] telephoned the police, his mother, and his wife\u2019s office shortly after the shooting and advised them all that he had just killed his wife, [f] Police officers arriving on the scene found Mrs. Nevill\u2019s body in the couple\u2019s bedroom. [Petitioner] was outside of the house holding his daughter. He appeared very upset and made numerous unsolicited and emotional statements such as T killed her,\u2019 T did it,\u2019 T was supposed to kill myself.\u2019 [Petitioner] was taken into custody immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">This rather abbreviated factual summary may be supplemented by reference to the trial transcript.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The transcript reveals the following facts: The Nevills\u2019 marital discord was compounded by each spouse\u2019s admitted infi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>delity, Mrs. Nevill\u2019s accelerated professional advancement, petitioner\u2019s lack of success as a lawyer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his recent loss of a local election. Petitioner wanted his wife to quit work and stay home with their child. The couple argued, reconciled and argued again. After at least one such episode, petitioner became physically violent, throwing his wife down on a couch and striking her repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">On the morning of the killing, Mrs. Nevill declined petitioner\u2019s invitation to meet for lunch, telling him that her coworkers were taking her out to celebrate the start of her planned 30-day leave of absence. After she left for work, petitioner visited a friend who \u201cknew a lot of people\u201d to discuss locating someone to beat up Mrs. Nevill\u2019s lover and teach him to stay away from her. Petitioner and his friend smoked marijuana and used cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Petitioner next called his \u201cparamour\u201d to break a lunch date for that afternoon, falsely stating that he was waiting for a phone call \u201con a verdict.\u201d He then called Mrs. Nevill and renewed his invitation to meet for lunch. She declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Suspicious, petitioner drove to his wife\u2019s office, hid behind a bush and, using binoculars, observed her leaving with a man. Petitioner tried to follow the car but eventually lost track of it. He then had three drinks, returned to Mrs. Nevill\u2019s office and used more cocaine. After waiting some time, he drove to his daughter\u2019s nursery school, ostensibly to make sure that his wife had not taken her. Finding the child at the school he then took her with him and returned to Mrs. Nevill\u2019s office where he confronted her about her lunch date. Mrs. Nevill admitted that she had lied.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Petitioner then announced that he was leaving Mrs. Nevill and taking the child with him. Mrs. Nevill expressed concern that the child was becoming a pawn in their dispute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but agreed to move with him for a trial period.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Petitioner put the child in the car and sped home, hoping that Mrs. Nevill would follow. While waiting for her to arrive, he placed a rifle on top of the bed concealing it with a sheet. He began packing and used more cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">When Mrs. Nevill arrived, alone, the couple argued. Petitioner accused her of being seen going into a hotel with the other man. She allegedly responded that she had not slept with the man \u201cthis week.\u201d Petitioner then told her to call the other man, which she attempted to do without success. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Finally, petitioner grabbed the rifle and fired three shots into the bedroom floor. Mrs. Nevill, seated on the bed, called out, \u201cyou really are crazy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Petitioner immediately turned the gun on her, shooting her 10 or 11 times. He then called the police and Mrs. Nevill\u2019s parents, and was subsequently taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Petitioner was charged with murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187). At trial, Dr. Randolph Reed, a forensic psychiatrist who had examined petitioner and conducted a sodium amytal interview with him, testified for the defense that petitioner had a \u201cmixed personality disorder,\u201d which meant he was a \u201cpsychologically weak, immature, and fragile individual\u201d who dealt with problems in a childlike fashion. Reed opined that this disorder did not cause the shooting, but it contributed to petitioner\u2019s inability to handle significant stress. Reed concluded that petitioner was coming apart psychologically before the killing and, therefore, did not have the capacity to intend to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">After the jury returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court sentenced petitioner to the upper term of six years plus an additional two years for using a firearm. Upon notice of conviction, this court referred the matter to the State Bar for a report and recommendation as to whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime involved moral turpitude or other misconduct warranting discipline. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6102, subds. (a) and (c); <em>In re Rothrock </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 449, 455 [106 P.2d 907, 131 A.L.R. 226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Petitioner and the principal referee for the State Bar entered into the \u201cStipulation as to Facts and Discipline\u201d referenced above. In addition to the factual statement, the stipulation contains a \u201cStatement of Mitigating Circumstances,\u201d which recites what petitioner would have testified to had he been called as a witness in the disciplinary proceedings. In summary, petitioner would have testified that: a confluence of factors contributed to the marital disharmony; Mrs. Nevill had asked for a separation and then changed her mind, promising to stay home and forget the other man; petitioner feared losing his child and had made efforts to obtain marriage counseling; petitioner only took his daughter from the nursery school because she cried to go with him; he secreted the rifle under the sheet to scare Mrs. Nevill\u2019s boyfriend in case the couple tried to take the child from him; immediately after killing Mrs. Nevill he was \u201can emotional basket case\u201d and planned to kill himself; and, Dr. Reed diagnosed petitioner as having a \u201cmixed personality disorder\u201d which prevented him from being \u201cable to deal with relationships or stress in a realistic fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The stipulation does not include an explicit finding regarding moral turpitude; rather, it contains a simple statement that the killing \u201cdoes involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>misconduct warranting discipline.\u201d The stipulation includes the following recommended discipline: five-year suspension stayed; probation for five years including thirty months actual suspension following petitioner\u2019s release from prison; quarterly reports to the State Bar as to his familiarity and compliance with the provisions of the State Bar Act and the Rules of Professional Conduct; abstinence from the \u201cexcessive use of intoxicants and mind- or mood-altering drugs\u201d unless medically prescribed; and psychiatric counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Upon the hearing panel\u2019s recommendation, the review department voted to approve the stipulation. Three of the review department referees voted against the stipulation on the ground that the recommended discipline appeared insufficient in view of the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In reviewing cases of attorney misconduct, this court attributes substantial weight to the State Bar\u2019s recommendations as to discipline. <em>(Olguin </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 195, 199 [167 Cal.Rptr. 876, 616 P.2d 858]; <em>Inniss, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 558.) The court is duty bound, however, to exercise its independent judgment in determining the appropriate discipline in any given case. <em>(Garlow </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 912, 916 [180 Cal.Rptr. 831, 640 P.2d 1106]; <em>Weir </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 564, 576 [152 Cal.Rptr. 921, 591 P.2d 19]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 509, 513-514 [153 Cal.Rptr. 24, 591 P.2d 47].) Because petitioner stipulated that his behavior constituted misconduct warranting discipline, our task is limited to adjudging what degree of discipline is warranted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The discipline ultimately imposed must be consistent with its purpose, that of protecting the public, the courts, and the legal profession from unfit practitioners. <em>(In re Possino </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 163, 168 [207 Cal.Rptr. 543, 689 P.2d 115].) In determining the extent of discipline to be imposed we must consider each case on its own facts <em>(Toll </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 824, 831 [117 Cal.Rptr. 427, 528 P.2d 35]), taking into account not only the offense itself, but also any aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>(Tarver </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 122, 133 [207 Cal.Rptr. 302, 688 P.2d 911].) \u201cThere are no fixed standards as to the appropriate penalty\u201d in disciplinary actions. <em>(Alberton </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 1, 14 [206 Cal.Rptr. 373, 686 P.2d 1177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In the instant case, the need to protect the public and the profession is great. The facts indicate that petitioner used his 16-month-old daughter as a pawn to lure his wife into what would be their final confrontation, secreted the rifle under a sheet to insure that he would maintain the upper hand in the anticipated hostilities over the child, and finally killed his wife in an extremely violent and frightening manner. By his actions, petitioner displayed a dangerous volitility which might well prejudice his ability to effectively represent his clients\u2019 interests given the pressures associated with the practice of law. Petitioner\u2019s professionally diagnosed childlike responses to the stresses of life heighten our concern. While \u2018\u201cwe are not insensitive to the personal and professional problems that frequently besiege the practitioner\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tarver, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 134), it is our duty to protect the public from those attorneys who, for whatever reason, are unable to cope with pressure and adversity. The safety of the public, and the integrity of the profession require no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">For these reasons, we find the State Bar\u2019s proposed discipline inadequate. The degree of discipline ultimately imposed must, of necessity, correspond to some reasonable degree with the gravity of the misconduct at issue. Petitioner has committed the ultimate offense; the taking of a life. Two and one-half years actual suspension simply fails to attest to that fact. The circumstances surrounding petitioner\u2019s misconduct compel the conclusion that disbarment is the more appropriate discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The factors offered in mitigation do not dissuade us from concluding that petitioner should be disbarred. Where an attorney\u2019s criminal act involves actual physical harm to a particular individual, the necessary showing of mitigating circumstances increases accordingly. (Cf. <em>In re Higbie </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 562, 574 [99 Cal.Rptr. 865, 493 P.2d 97]; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 112, 119-120 [287 P.2d 778].) Any greater physical harm than that perpetrated in the instant case is inconceivable. In turn, the proffered mitigating circumstances are simply inadequate in the face of this harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">In formulating the discipline recommendation, the principal referee appears to have considered as mitigating<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the fact that petitioner; (1) was having marital problems caused in part by his wife\u2019s involvement with someone else; (2) used alcohol and cocaine on the day of the killing; (3) argued vehemently with his wife shortly before killing her; (4) admitted his guilt immediately after the crime; (5) was diagnosed as having a personality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>disorder; and (6) is serving an eight-year sentence for the crime. Additionally, the State Bar asks us to consider as mitigating the fact that petitioner has never before been disciplined for unethical conduct, that he has been cooperative in this matter and that the killing is unrelated to the practice of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Bearing in mind that present fitness to practice law is our primary concern <em>(Possino, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 172; <em>In re Petty </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 356, 362 [173 Cal.Rptr. 461, 627 P.2d 191]), we cannot indulge the suggestion that these factors constitute adequate mitigation to preclude disbarment. Petitioner\u2019s marital problems and the events of the day in question do not mitigate petitioner\u2019s behavior; rather they serve to underscore petitioner\u2019s difficulties coping with stress. Likewise, petitioner\u2019s mental condition is not mitigating. In <em>Possino, </em>we expressly rejected the assertion that disbarment was inappropriate given the errant attorney\u2019s psychological condition, stating \u201c \u2018[w]e realize that in many cases psychoneurotic problems may underlie professional misconduct and moral turpitude. In this area our duty lies in the assurance that the public will be protected . . . rather than in an analysis of the reasons for his delinquency.\u2019\u201d <em>(Possino, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 171. See also <em>In re Duggan </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 416, 423 [130 Cal.Rptr. 715, 551 P.2d 19]; <em>In re Fahey </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 842, 850, fn. 4 [106 Cal.Rptr. 313, 505 P.2d 1369, 63 A.L.R.3d 465]; <em>Grove </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 680, 685 [58 Cal.Rptr. 564, 427 P.2d 164].) Though petitioner\u2019s behavior may have been caused by his \u201cpersonality disorder,\u201d that disorder will not preclude his disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Our responsibility to protect the public and the profession also prevents us, in the instant case, from looking to the lack of prior discipline and the fact that the offense is unrelated to legal practice as mitigating circumstances. While a \u201cclean record\u201d may be taken into account where an attorney\u2019s indiscretion is not great, where restitution has been made or where the attorney has been rehabilitated, \u201cdisbarment is not reserved for those possessing prior records.\u201d <em>(In re Weber </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 578, 582 [128 Cal.Rptr. 434, 546 P.2d 1378].) Where, as here, an attorney\u2019s misconduct is egregious and is not substantially mitigated by other circumstances, once is one time too many. (See <em>Benson </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 382, 388 [96 Cal.Rptr. 30, 486 P.2d 1230].) Likewise, that the crime is not directly related to the practice of law does not insulate petitioner from the appropriate discipline. (See <em>In re Rohan </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 195 [145 Cal.Rptr. 855, 578 P.2d 102].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>While petitioner\u2019s admission of guilt and his candor and cooperation with the police, the courts and the State Bar may be viewed as factors in mitigation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they pale in comparison with the egregious behavior from which they stem. The same is true of the fact that petitioner is serving an eight-year sentence for his crime. While criminal punishment is relevant to the determination of appropriate discipline, criminal punishment and attorney discipline serve two different purposes. <em>(In re Hanley </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 448, 455 [119 Cal.Rptr. 5, 530 P.2d 1381].) For our purpose, petitioner\u2019s criminal sentence is of limited import. Therefore, when put in perspective and balanced against the need to protect the public and the profession, we cannot afford these proffered mitigating factors sufficient weight to preclude disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Beyond the absence of adequate mitigation, disbarment is also appropriate as a cautionary measure. Given petitioner\u2019s uncontested volatility, his lengthy incarceration and his extended absence from practice, we can best achieve the goal of protecting the public by imposing discipline which incorporates some mechanism for future reevaluation of petitioner\u2019s fitness to practice law and attendant ability to cope with the stresses of everyday life. Disbarment provides such an opportunity for thorough reappraisal; the recommended discipline does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The State Bar\u2019s recommendation of five years\u2019 probation and two and a half years\u2019 actual suspension upon release from incarceration fails to accommodate the need for complete investigation and review prior to reinstatement. Once the five-year period had run its course, petitioner automatically would be reinstated as a member of the bar in good standing without a renewed inquiry into his then present fitness to practice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The terms of the proposed probation\u2014quarterly reports, abstinence from mind-altering drugs and psychiatric counseling\u2014provide only insufficient assurance to the public and the profession that petitioner\u2019s inability to cope with stress or to control his emotions will have been remedied when the disciplinary period comes to a close. Even though the State Bar can, after formal hearing, revoke probation for good cause shown (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rules 611, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>612),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this safeguard offers no guarantee that even the most conscientious compliance with the conditions will produce the hoped-for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Disbarment will better protect the public, the profession and the courts. Disbarment guards against the unfit practitioner until such time as he or she affirmatively demonstrates that the disability has been overcome. Requiring petitioner to make such a showing prior to readmission will assure that the discipline imposed has served its recognized purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Although a disbarred attorney may seek reinstatement after five years, such reinstatement is not automatic. Once an attorney files a petition for readmission, the State Bar\u2019s Division of Trial Counsel conducts an exhaustive investigation into the applicant\u2019s fitness, at that time, to practice law. (See Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 664.) A formal hearing is held at which interested parties may testify for or against readmission. (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 665.) The burden is on the attorney seeking readmission to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a majority of the hearing panel, \u201c(1) rehabilitation and present moral qualifications for readmission, and (2) present ability and learning in the general law.\u201d (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 667.) Having been disbarred once, the burden of proving good moral character is higher than when first admitted. <em>(Kepler </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 52, 55 [13 P.2d 509].) In addition, the attorney must pass the Professional Responsibility Examination and also may be required to retake the general bar examination. (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In the instant case, this structured readmission process essentially combines the probation conditions proposed by the State Bar with the necessary opportunity for reassessment of petitioner\u2019s fitness to practice law should he wish to reenter the practice. Once disbarred, petitioner would be precluded from seeking reinstatement for five years from the effective date of our order. (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 662.) To demonstrate his rehabilitation and then present fitness to practice, petitioner would necessarily have to show that he had received and benefitted from psychiatric care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>no longer suffered a lack of emotional control or an overwhelming inability to cope with stress. Use of nonprescribed mind-altering drugs during the interim would reflect poorly on these efforts. Moreover, because the investigation and hearing would take place after petitioner was released from prison and had had the opportunity to readjust to life outside of an institutional setting, the hearing panel would be able to evaluate petitioner\u2019s ability to make that transition and cope in his new environment. Finally, after petitioner\u2019s extended absence from the law, his legal knowledge would be assessed. Each of these factors would weigh heavily in the determination of petitioner\u2019s then present fitness to practice law. If petitioner successfully carried his burden of proving his fitness at that time, then the public would be assured, to the greatest extent possible, of that fitness, and he would be readmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The probation-temporary suspension scheme proposed by the State Bar requires compliance with its conditions, but stops short of requiring rehabilitation. Although this type of disciplinary program will be appropriate in many proceedings, it is inappropriate under the particular circumstances of this case. Given petitioner\u2019s volatility and the gravity of his offense, the added enforcement power available with disbarment is necessary for the protection of the public, the courts and the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Petitioner is hereby disbarred on the effective date of this order. Petitioner is further ordered to comply with rule 955 of the California Rules of Court and to comply with subdivisions (a) and (c) of that rule within 30 and 40 days respectively after the effective date of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> After the State Bar Review Department adopted the investigating referee\u2019s order approving a stipulation as to the facts and discipline, this court sent a letter advising Nevill that it was considering the imposition of more substantial discipline. Nevill then filed his petition for writ of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Despite the existence of the stipulation, petitioner asks that we take judicial notice of the trial transcript and the opinion of the Court of Appeal affirming his manslaughter conviction. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 450, 452, subd. (d)(1), 459.) As a general rule, an attorney is bound by the factual recitals in a stipulation once the review department has approved it. <em>(Inniss </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 552, 555 [143 Cal.Rptr. 408, 573 P.2d 852]; Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 401. See also <em>Giovanazzi </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 465, 470-471 [169 Cal.Rptr. 581, 619 P.2d 1005].) This rule, however, applies only to preclude the attorney from attempting to contradict the stipulated facts. By his request for judicial notice, petitioner wishes to supplement, not contradict the stipulated facts. (See <em>Wells </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 199, 207-208 [203 Cal.Rptr. 134, 680 P.2d 1093] [supplemental statement detailing events referred to in stipulation was properly before this court].) Judicial notice is therefore appropriate. (See also Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6102, subd.

The referee must periodically assess \u201cthe extent and degree of the probationer\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation, and [determine] whether such compliance furthers the objectives of protection of the public and rehabilitation of the probationer.\u201d (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 611(d).) However, the referee may issue a \u201cNotice to Show Cause why probation should not be revoked\u201d <em>only </em>upon determining that the probationer has violated the conditions of probation <em>and </em>that revocation would further the purpose of the probation order. (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 611(e). See also rule 612.) The rules do not provide for revocation of probation when the rehabilitation objective of probation is not being met despite compliance with the probation conditions. This gap in oversight capacity is particularly worrisome where, as here, the attorney\u2019s misconduct is egregious and the result of a combination of nonquantitative factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
