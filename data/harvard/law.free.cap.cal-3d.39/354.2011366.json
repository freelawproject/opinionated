We address the claims of two who assert they are the father of a daughter. One was the mother\u2019s husband; he raised, loved and nurtured the child until temporarily prevented from doing so after a divorce. The second claimant contends he is the natural father, has since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>married the mother and now lives with her and the child. By this triangular litigation each claimant seeks to be declared the legal father; the child, too, seeks a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Evidence Code section 621 declares the presumption that \u201c. . . the issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband ... is presumed to be a child of the marriage. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In conformity with the statute, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant below, Ronald W. Plaintiffs Donald R. and Michelle W., a minor, appeal challenging the constitutionality of the statute as applied to them. As will appear below, we hold that as applied to plaintiffs the statutory presumption violates neither the due process nor equal protection clauses of the California or United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Defendants Ronald and Judith W. were married on May 7, 1965, and lived together as husband and wife until their separation approximately 12 years later. Judith gave birth to two daughters, Tamara and Michelle, who were raised as the children of that marriage. During the marriage to Judith, Ronald W. provided the necessary support for the children. As the father of Tamara and Michelle, he tended, nurtured and loved them and received affection from them. Through their daily interchanges with Ronald and Judith, Tamara and Michelle were provided with the security, as well as the restraints, they needed for their growth and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Donald R., the second claimant to the paternity of Michelle, met Judith in 1973. Donald R. and Judith began having sexual relations in that year, although Judith and Ronald W. were married and living together. On October 24, 1974, Judith gave birth to Michelle. Donald R. did not claim paternity at the time of birth nor thereafter for four years while Judith and Ronald W. remained married and continued to live together. Donald R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>asserted no claim nor accepted any responsibility. Throughout that time, without objection from Donald R., the obligation of parenting was fulfilled by Ronald W.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">When Ronald and Judith W. separated they executed a marriage settlement agreement; Ronald was granted custody of Tamara, Michelle\u2019s sister, and Judith custody of Michelle, by then nearly five years of age. The issue of paternity was not raised. Ronald\u2019s obligation to provide child support for Michelle was also not at issue; it was agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Following the dissolution of their marriage, Ronald W. regularly and continually exercised his visitation rights with Michelle. In November 1980, when Donald R. married Judith, Ronald W. was refused further visitation. That right was restored when he threatened court action to enforce the settlement agreement. Since Judith\u2019s marriage to Donald R., Michelle has lived in Donald R.\u2019s home and he has held her out to be his natural child.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In March 1981, this action to establish paternity was brought by Donald R. and Michelle, age six, through her guardian ad litem. Upon the uncontradicted facts that Ronald W. and Judith were living together as a married couple for nine years before Michelle\u2019s birth and that Ronald W. was neither impotent nor sterile, the trial court applied the presumption of section 621 and established that Ronald W. is the father of Michelle. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The presumption of paternity established by section 621 is limited. The following prerequisites must be satisfied: first, the child\u2019s mother must be married; second, the mother must be cohabiting with her husband; third, the husband must be neither impotent nor sterile; fourth, two years must have passed since the birth of the child and during those two years the husband\u2014or the mother in conjunction with the putative father\u2014must have failed to rebut the presumption in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Plaintiffs assert alternative grounds for holding section 621 unconstitutional. First, section 621 prevents them from establishing the biological parent-child relationship in a court of law, thus depriving them of a liberty interest protected by the due process clause. Second, the gender-based classification of the statute which accords the natural father fewer procedural protections than the married natural mother violates the equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>guarantee of the California and United States Constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, they argue that the classifications in the statute deny them a fundamental right and thus the law should be strictly scrutinized.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">A. <em>Due Process Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We review two interests, that of the child and that of the alleged natural father. As to plaintiff Donald R., we hold that the statute is constitutional as applied. No due process violation can be found in applying the presumption to the facts of this case. Our conclusion is based upon a weighing of the competing private and public interests. We find that the public interest in protecting the family unit and promoting familial stability outweighs Donald R.\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\n<em>1. The Putative Father\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Does the application of the presumption of section 621 violate Donald R.\u2019s due process rights?  We have held that the issue of whether section 621 adequately protects a putative father\u2019s interests \u201cmust be resolved by weighing the competing private and state interests. \u201d <em>(In re Lisa R. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 636, 648 [119 Cal.Rptr. 475, 532 P.2d 123, 90 A.L.R.3d 1017], cert. den. (1975) 421 U.S. 1014 [44 L.Ed.2d 682, 95 S.Ct. 2421], rehg. den. (1975) 423 U.S. 885 [46 L.Ed.2d 116, 96 S.Ct. 159].) <em>In Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 564, 570 [33 L.Ed.2d 548, 570, 92 S.Ct. 2701], the high court explained that \u201ca weighing process has long been a part of any determination of the <em>form </em>of hearing required in particular situations. ...\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The United States Supreme Court has scrutinized, under the due process clause, state laws limiting a natural father\u2019s relationship with his illegitimate offspring in three seminal cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1971) 405 U.S. 645 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 92 S.Ct. 1208], <em>Quilloin </em>v. <em>Walcott </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 246 [54 L.Ed.2d 511, 98 S.Ct. 549], rehg. den. (1978) 435 U.S. 918 [55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>L.Ed.2d 511, 98 S.Ct. 1477], and most recently in <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 103 S.Ct. 2985].</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>Stanley, </em>an unwed father lost custody of his three children upon the death of the children\u2019s unwed mother. The father, Stanley, had lived with the children and their mother since their birth and they were summarily taken and placed with court-appointed guardians without any prior hearing. This deprivation was found to violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Powell, writing for the court, concluded that Illinois, \u201cinsists on presuming rather than proving Stanley\u2019s unfitness solely because it is more convenient to presume than to prove. Under the Due Process Clause that advantage is insufficient to justify refusing a father a hearing when the issue at stake is the dismemberment of his family.\u201d (405 U.S., at p. 658 [31 L.Ed.2d at p. 562].) Thus, Illinois could not automatically destroy the Stanley family and uproot the children without first providing the father with the opportunity to be heard on the issue of parental fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The limits on a putative father\u2019s due process rights were addressed in <em>Quilloin </em>v. <em>Walcott, supra, </em>434 U.S. 246, where the Supreme Court held that a Georgia statute which denied an unwed father the right to veto an adoption of his illegitimate child did not violate the due process clause. The father in that case only sought to claim paternity after the mother and her new husband had initiated adoption proceedings. The court held that the denial of the father\u2019s legitimation petition\u2014found by the trial court to be in the child\u2019s best interest\u2014did not violate the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Finally, the court most recently addressed this issue in <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>463 U.S. 248. Lehr, the putative father, sought to invalidate an adoption order granted in favor of the biological mother and her husband. The child was already two years old at the time and the father \u201cnever had any significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with [the child], and he did not seek to establish a legal tie until she was two years old.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 262 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 627], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">This court has examined the conclusive presumption of paternity in <em>Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 636, where a putative father sought to continue the parent-child relationship he had established with his daughter. In <em>Lisa R., </em>although the minor child was presumed to be legitimate, both of her parents were deceased and the child was being adjudicated a dependent of the juvenile court. With adoption proceedings by foster parents pending, Lisa\u2019s putative father sought to prove his paternity and obtain visitation rights. Following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>supra, </em>405 U.S. 645, we held that the Evidence Code\u2019s preclusion of proof of paternity offended the constitutional guarantee of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The difference between the state-threatened dissolution and termination of a developed parent-child relationship in <em>Stanley </em>and <em>Lisa R. </em>and the denial of a legal determination of paternity in the case at bench is clear and significant. As we recently noted, \u201cIn both <em>Stanley </em>and <em>Lisa R., </em>the putative fathers were seeking to establish their legal relationship with children who otherwise had no parents and were wards of the state.\u201d <em>(Estate of Cornelious </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 461, 466 [198 Cal.Rptr. 543, 674 P.2d 245], app. dism. (1984) 466 U.S. 967 [80 L.Ed.2d 812, 104 S.Ct. 2337].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This is not a case where the state has attempted to intervene or to prevent the establishment of a relationship between putative father and child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, Donald R. seeks a determination that he is Michelle\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d father, notwithstanding the established and continuing emotional and financial father-daughter relationship between Michelle and Ronald.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that Donald\u2019s abstract interest in establishing paternity is not as weighty as the interests of the fathers in <em>Stanley </em>and <em>Lisa R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We turn to the interests of the state. Numerous policy considerations have been cited in favor of a conclusive presumption of paternity, including certain social policies upholding the integrity of the family <em>(Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603, 619 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657]), and protecting the child\u2019s welfare <em>(In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at pp. 649-650).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Thus, section 621 does not purport to factually determine the biological paternity of a child. <em>(Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 619.) We note that, as stated by the United States Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he actions of judges neither create nor sever genetic bonds.\u201d <em>(Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>U.S. at p. 261 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].) The interests noted above apply to the facts of the case at bench. Here, Donald R.\u2019s private interest in establishing a biological relationship in a court of law is overridden by the substantial state interests in familial stability and the welfare of the child. Accordingly, the application of section 621 to the instant case comported with the requirement of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. <em>The Child\u2019s Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The second interest to consider in this case, the interest of Michelle in a legal determination of who her biological father is, has been treated by the other litigants as an appendage to the rights of the putative father. The guardian ad litem for Michelle is a family friend of Donald and Judith R. Michelle is represented by the same attorney as Donald R. and their interests have been continually asserted as being consistent with each other. Our concern is that Michelle is not the real actor behind this \u201cchild\u201d paternity suit and that she may be asserting a right which may or may not be in her best interests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not convinced under the circumstances of this case, that Michelle\u2019s rights are greater than those afforded to Donald R.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In <em>Estate of Cornelious, supra, </em>35 Cal. 3d 461, we held that the guarantee of due process of law was not offended when a child was precluded from proving paternity by the operation of section 621. In <em>Estate of Cornelious, </em>as in the case at bench, we apply a balancing test to resolve an as-applied challenge to the statute in question. (35 Cal.3d at p. 467.) Because Michelle\u2019s rights have not been argued to be separate from Donald R.\u2019s we cannot conclude that her interest in establishing paternity outweighs the state\u2019s interest in preserving and protecting the developed parent-child and sibling relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability. Given the facts that Michelle has a legal father and that he opposes this attempt to have Donald R. declared the biological father, we are unpersuaded that a judicial juggling of Michelle\u2019s family relationships is warranted by her abstract interest in establishing paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that section 621 as applied to Michelle is constitutionally defective pursuant to the authority of <em>Vlandis </em>v. <em>Klein </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 441 [37 L.Ed.2d 63, 93 S.Ct. 2230]. In <em>Vlandis </em>the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>States Supreme Court invalidated a permanent and irrebuttable presumption that students who were nonresidents when they applied to attend state universities remained nonresidents for purposes of assessing fees and tuition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While <em>Vlandis </em>involved a purported factual determination of residency, section 621 does not purport to determine biological paternity. Rather, it is \u201cin actuality a substantive rule of law\u201d designed to further public policies. <em>(Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 603, at p. 619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Furthermore, because we apply the balancing test utilized in <em>Estate of Cornelious, </em>we cannot conclude that the presumption of section 621 is necessarily irrebuttable. Simply because Donald R. and Michelle are unable to rebut the presumption does not mean that we interpret section 621 to be a \u201cconclusive and unchangeable presumption. \u201d <em>(Vlandis </em>v. <em>Klein, supra, </em>412 U.S. at p. 443 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 66].) Rather, we merely conclude that the denial of Michelle\u2019s motion for blood tests was justified because the state interests outweighed her abstract interest in vindicating true parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Michelle is not being threatened with termination of her association with Donald R. She is not even being prevented from obtaining information as to who her biological father is. As stated by the United States Supreme Court, the extent to which due process must be afforded an individual \u201cis influenced by the extent to which he may be \u2018condemned to suffer grievous loss.\u2019\u201d <em>(Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 254, 262-263 [25 L.Ed.2d 287, 296, 90 S.Ct. 1011].) We cannot say that denying Michelle the opportunity to present blood test evidence in a court of law violates the guarantee of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">B. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The guarantee of equal protection ensures that \u201cno person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or classes in like circumstances . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Romo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 189, 196 [121 Cal.Rptr. 111, 534 P.2d 1015].) Specifically, a sovereign may not subject men and women to disparate treatment where there is no substantial relationship between the classification and an important governmental purpose. <em>(Reed </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 71, 76 [30 L.Ed.2d 225, 229, 92 S.Ct. 251]; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 190, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>197 [50 L.Ed.2d 397, 407, 97 S.Ct. 451], rehg. den. (1977) 429 U.S. 1124 [51 L.Ed.2d 574, 97 S.Ct. 1161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Section 621 allows the natural mother of the child to bring a suit to rebut the presumption that her husband is the child\u2019s father. Plaintiffs claim that this constitutes an impermissible gender-based distinction because the putative father is not allowed to rebut the presumption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Subdivision (d) of section 621 states: \u201cThe notice of motion for blood tests under subdivision (b) may be raised by the mother of the child not later than two years from the date of birth if the child\u2019s biological father has filed an affidavit with the court acknowledging paternity of the child.\u201d We note that the plain word of the statute indicates that the rights of the natural married mother and the natural unwed father are conditioned upon each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Caban </em>v. <em>Mohammed, supra, </em>441 U.S. 380. In that case the Supreme Court invalidated a statutory scheme under which only unwed mothers\u2014and not unwed fathers\u2014received hearings prior to a termination of child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In <em>Caban, </em>one parent had an absolute unconditional right and the other parent had absolutely none. In our due process analysis, we have declined to interpret section 621 as an absolute bar to all suits to establish paternity by either the putative father or the presumed legitimate child. Rather, we have applied the balancing test analysis of <em>Lisa R. </em>and <em>Estate of Cornelious. </em>In contrast to <em>Caban, </em>although Donald R. and Michelle are not able to rebut the presumption under the facts of this case, this does not mean that all putative fathers and all presumed legitimate children are barred in all cases. Thus, we fail to find that the statutory scheme, as interpreted by the courts and as applied to plaintiffs\u2019 case, violates the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">All further statutory references are to the Evidence Code. Section 621, subdivision (a) states in full that: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband, who is not impotent or sterile, is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Subdivision (b) allows rebuttal of the presumption of subdivision (a) by blood test evidence. Subdivisions (c) and (d) provide that such evidence must be presented within two years of the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Plaintiffs do not challenge and we do not now address any question regarding the adequacy of the two-year statute of limitations, although we note that the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Habluetzel </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 91 [71 L.Ed.2d 770, 102 S.Ct. 1549] suggests that this raises due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">We note that the version of section 621 which was in effect in 1981, the date plaintiffs filed their action, differs somewhat from that now in effect. Because plaintiffs challenge\u2014 and the appellate court analyzed\u2014the present version of section 621, our decision, too, is based on the present statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d A similar provision is contained in the California Constitution, article I, section 7, subdivision (a) which states that \u201c[a] person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Although we deny plaintiffs\u2019 claims under both Constitutions, we do not hold that the provisions are identical in scope and purpose in all cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The issue was also raised in <em>Caban </em>v. <em>Mohammed </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 380 [60 L.Ed.2d 297, 99 S.Ct. 1760]. Because that case was decided on equal protection grounds, the court expressed no view on the due process challenge. (Id., at p. 394, fn. 16 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 308].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">We leave open the question of the validity of section 621 as applied to such situations or to termination situations for a case in which the issue is squarely presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Ronald W. argues, without citation to authority, that in enacting section 621 the Legislature sought to prevent children from being stigmatized as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d Even assuming that this argument is correct, this state\u2019s subsequent adoption of the \u201cUniform Parentage Act\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 7000 et seq., added by Stats. 1975, ch. 1244, \u00a7 11, pp. 3196-3204) has rendered such a consideration to be without any legal effect. The act, approved in 1973 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (see Uniform Parentage Act, Comrs. Prefatory Note, 9A U.L.A. (Master ed. 1979) pp. 579-582), \u201cmakes a revolutionary change in the law by abolishing the incidents of illegitimacy and establishing legal equality of children without regard to the marital status of their parents\u201d (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed., 1984 supp.) Parent and Child, \u00a7 242A, p. 326). As now provided by Civil Code section 7002, \u201c[t]he parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent, regardless of the marital status of the parents.\u201d Accordingly, we reject Ronald\u2019s argument that the \u201cstigma\u201d of illegitimacy should be considered in determining the constitutionality of section 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The possibility exists for a conflict between a child\u2019s interest and that of the putative father. For example, it has been noted that \u201c[u]nlike adults, children have no psychological conception of relationship by blood-tie until quite late in their development. For the biological parents, the facts of having engendered, borne, or given birth to a child produce an understandable sense of preparedness for proprietorship and possessiveness. These considerations carry no weight with children who are emotionally unaware of events leading to their births.\u201d (Goldstein et al., Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) at p. 12.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that <em>Vlandis </em>requires invalidation of a conclusive presumption whenever there is a \u201creasonable alternative means\u201d of proving the presumed fact. In <em>Vlandis </em>the existence of other methods of proving residency was one factor in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis. In invalidating the statutory presumption, the court discussed the state\u2019s purposes for the presumption and determined that those were not served by applying the presumption to the case before it.

Code, \u00a7 621) to deny plaintiff, Donald R., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>opportunity to prove that he is Michelle\u2019s biological father denies him due process of law. (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In upholding the presumption here, the majority purport to weigh the competing private and public interests as required by <em>In re Lisa R. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 636, 648-651 [119 Cal.Rptr. 475, 532 P.2d 123, 90 A.L.R.3d 1017] and <em>Estate of Cornelious </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 461, 467 [198 Cal.Rptr. 543, 674 P.2d 245]. However, the majority\u2019s weighing of interests proceeds according to a most curious logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">At the outset, the majority tip the scales in favor of Ronald W. when they label him \u201cthe father\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 358) and the \u201clegal father\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 363) of Michelle. Those labels beg the question to be decided, since plaintiffs seek a declaration that Donald R. is the legal father. Similarly, the majority suggest that Ronald W.\u2019s relationship with Michelle will be jeopardized unless the presumption is upheld. Yet, they fail to explain how that relationship is threatened by plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On the other end of the scale is plaintiffs\u2019 interest in establishing that Donald R. is the father. The majority focus narrowly on the apparent security of Donald R.\u2019s current relationship with Michelle and disregard the legal vulnerability of that bond. (See Bartlett, <em>Rethinking Parenthood as an Exclusive Status: The Need for Legal Alternatives when the Premise of the Nuclear Family has Failed </em>(1984) 70 Va. L.Rev. 879, 912-919 [hereafter <em>Rethinking Parenthood].) </em>Having thus limited the scope of inquiry, they conclude without difficulty that plaintiffs have only an \u201cabstract interest in establishing paternity.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 362.) According to the majority, this \u201cabstract\u201d interest is outweighed by the public interest in protecting the stability of a family unit which ceased to exist years ago. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 360.) This is a strange sort of weighing indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The state\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the family unit <em>(In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 650; <em>Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603, 619 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657]) is not even implicated here. The family unit formerly composed of Ronald W., Judith W., Michelle, and her sister no longer exists. It was destroyed when Ronald W. and Judith W. divorced. The majority\u2019s assertion that this nonexistent family unit is threatened by plaintiffs\u2019 action to establish paternity is baffling.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Equally baffling is their assumption that Ronald W.\u2019s relationship with Michelle is threatened. Ronald W. currently enjoys rights to regular visitation with Michelle. These rights, which arose from the years in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>accepted daily parental responsibility for her, would continue to protect his interest in visitation even if Donald R. were declared the legal father. (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 367-371.) Accordingly, it is not necessary to uphold the conclusive presumption in order to protect Ronald W.\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Prior to the institution of the proceedings leading to this appeal, Ronald W. was obligated to provide for Michelle\u2019s support by statute (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 196, 196a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by a provision in his marriage settlement agreement with Judith W. Similarly, he was entitled to reasonable visitation with Michelle both by statute (\u00a7 4601)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by the terms of the agreement. The majority are unable to explain how these obligations and rights would be altered, much less destroyed, by a decision permitting Donald R. to offer scientific proof that he is Michelle\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Let\u2019s assume for the moment that a judgment declaring Donald R. to be Michelle\u2019s biological father would terminate Ronald W.\u2019s status as a \u201cfather\u201d under sections 196 and 196a. Nothing in this record or in the authorities cited by the parties suggests that Ronald W.\u2019s support obligation and visitation rights under the marriage settlement agreement would disappear. (Compare \u00a7 229 <em>[adoption </em>decree automatically terminates the parents\u2019 duties towards, and rights over, a child who is adopted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The argument may be taken a step further. Assume that all of Ronald W.\u2019s rights and obligations, both as a \u201cfather\u201d under sections 196 and 196a and as a party to the marriage settlement agreement, would be extinguished upon a judicial declaration that Donald R. is Michelle\u2019s biological father. Ronald W. would then be left with the legal status of a former stepparent. However, even under these circumstances, his relationship with Michelle would not be jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The rights of stepparents were persuasively asserted by the Utah Supreme Court in <em>Gribble </em>v. <em>Gribble </em>(Utah 1978) 583 P.2d 64 [1 A.L.R.4th 1263], In that case, a wife filed a divorce action. The husband counterclaimed for visitation rights with the wife\u2019s son by a previous marriage. The husband had not adopted the son. However, he claimed that he had lived with the boy for four years, that he had treated him as his own son, and that he was concerned about the boy\u2019s future. The trial court held as a matter of law that a stepparent was not entitled to a hearing on the issue of visitation. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The Utah Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding the stepfather entitled under the due process clause of the state constitution to a hearing to determine whether he stood <em>in loco parentis to </em>the boy. The court held that a stepparent who has assumed the status and obligations of a parent without formal adoption is entitled to the same visitation rights as a natural parent. <em>(Gribble, supra, </em>583 P.2d at pp. 67, 68.) It also noted that divorce does not terminate the stepparent\u2019s <em>in loco parentis </em>status. Only the stepchild or the stepparent may terminate that relationship. (Id., at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Gribble\u2019s application of the <em>in loco parentis </em>doctrine to stepparent visitation rights is cited with approval in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 480, 486 [166 Cal.Rptr. 583] (conc. opn. of Hopper, J.). In this marital dissolution action, the superior court entered an order granting a husband visitation privileges with the wife\u2019s minor child by a former marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Court of Appeal granted the wife\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition, holding that in a divorce proceeding a superior court lacks jurisdiction to award visitation privileges to a spouse who is not the natural or adoptive parent of the other spouse\u2019s child. <em>(Perry, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at pp. 484-485.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dissatisfied with the result it was compelled to reach, the court invited the Legislature to address the \u201cthorny problem of visitation by stepparents.\u201d (108 Cal.App.3d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Hopper noted that the husband had not alleged that he stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the child. \u201c[I]f [the] husband had raised the issue and had been found by the superior court to be <em>in loco parentis </em>with regard to Lonnie, one could conclude that Lonnie was a \u2018child of the marriage\u2019 within Civil Code section 4351 [citations].\u201d <em>(Perry, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 486 (conc. opn. of Hopper, J.); see also <em>In re Marriage of Halpern </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 297, 307 [184 Cal.Rptr. 740].)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The 1982 Legislature, in an apparent response to the <em>Perry </em>court\u2019s invitation, added section 4351.5 to the Civil Code. Subdivision (a) of section 4351.5 gives the superior court in a marriage annulment or dissolution proceeding jurisdiction to award reasonable visitation rights to a stepparent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The statute provides for mandatory mediation (subd. (c)) and a court hearing if mediation fails to produce a settlement (subd. (h)). Both the stepparent seeking visitation rights and any natural or adoptive parent must be given notice of the mediation (subd. (i)), notice of any subsequent hearing, and an opportunity to appear and be heard at such hearing (subd. (h)). Visitation rights may be awarded to the stepparent if the court determines that such visitation is in the best interests of the child. (Subd. (a); see generally Wit-kin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed., 1984 supp. to vol. 6) Parent and Child, \u00a7 83A, pp. 217-218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The enactment of section 4351.5 did not supplant the alternative method by which a superior court may award stepparent visitation under the <em>in loco parentis </em>doctrine. <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 486 (conc. opn. of Hopper, J.).) The courts of this state have repeatedly held that one standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child has the same rights and duties as a natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201c \u2018It is the well-settled law that one standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to those held out as members of his family is entitled to all the rights of a parent. He also incurs the same liability with respect to them that he is under to his own children. The relation being established, the reciprocal rights, duties, and obligations pertaining to it arise between them the same as if he [were] their natural father.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Trudell </em>v. <em>Leatherby </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 678, 682 [300 P. 7], overruled on another point in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 914, 923 [92 Cal.Rptr. 288, 479 P.2d 648]; see <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 820, 823 [39 Cal.Rptr. 820]; cf. <em>Adoption of McDonald </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 447, 458-460 [274 P.2d 860] [agency to which child is relinquished for adoption does not acquire the right of a natural parent to withhold consent to adoption; like that of a guardian, an adoption agency\u2019s relationship to a child lacks the \u201cnatural affection between parent and child\u201d which is the basis of a natural parent\u2019s rights].)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">More recently, this court stated that \u201c[t]he fact of biological parenthood may incline an adult to feel a strong concern for the welfare of his child, but it is not an essential condition; a person who assumes the role of parent, raising the child in his own home, may in time acquire an interest in the \u2018companionship, care, custody and management\u2019 of that child. The interest of the \u2018de facto parent\u2019 is a substantial one, recognized by the decision of this court in <em>Guardianship of Shannon </em>(1933) 218 Cal. 490 [23 P.2d 1020] and by courts of other jurisdictions and deserving of legal protection.\u201d <em>(In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 692-693 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>fns. omitted; see Goldstein et al., Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) pp. 17-20.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In summary, the interests of both Ronald W. and Donald R. vis-a-vis Michelle are subject to certain procedural and substantive protections no matter which of them is legally recognized as Michelle\u2019s father. Those protections are based on common law, constitutional, and statutory principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Both men have developed a parent-child relationship with Michelle. At different times, each man has willingly assumed full parental responsibilities for her. Each man appears to be entitled to the application of the procedural protections and substantive standards available to a \u201cde facto parent\u201d <em>(In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 692-693) or one standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child <em>(Trudell </em>v. <em>Leatherby, supra, </em>212 Cal. at p. 682; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 486 (cone. opn. of Hopper, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The protections afforded by the common law are consistent with constitutional due process concerns which arise whenever an established parent-child bond is threatened. Such concerns are implicated whether the \u201cparent\u201d is a stepfather (see <em>Gribble </em>v. <em>Gribble, supra, </em>583 P.2d at pp. 67, 68), a man who claims to be the biological father <em>(In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 649; see <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 92 S.Ct. 1208]), or a foster parent <em>(In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 693).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In addition to these constitutional and common law rights, each man would have certain statutory rights in future proceedings affecting his relationship with Michelle. Donald R. would be entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of his right to reasonable visitation with Michelle in any proceeding to dissolve his marriage to Michelle\u2019s mother. (\u00a7 4351.5; see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 368-369.) Ronald W., even if the presumption that he is Michelle\u2019s father had been successfully rebutted, could be granted reasonable visitation rights. (\u00a7 4601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The majority assume that Donald R.\u2019s interest in establishing his biological paternity of Michelle is outweighed by Ronald W.\u2019s competing interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>in protecting his developed parent-child relationship with her. The foregoing discussion exposes the fallacy of that assumption. In fact, Ronald W.\u2019s relationship with Michelle is <em>not </em>in jeopardy. Their relationship has been reduced to one of regular visitation as the result of a marital dissolution. A judicial declaration that Donald R. is the legal and biological father of Michelle would not restrict or destroy that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On the other side of the scale, the majority obscure the nature of Donald R.\u2019s interest by vaguely labeling his relationship with Michelle as an \u201cassociation.\u201d (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 365, fn. 8.) However the bond between Donald R. and Michelle is labeled, it is clear that they currently enjoy a day-to-day parent-child relationship with all of the practical attributes of legal custody. Maintaining the continuity of that relationship is important to the child\u2019s psychological well-being. (See <em>Rethinking Parenthood, supra, </em>70 Va. L.Rev. at pp. 902-911.) By denying plaintiffs the opportunity to establish that Donald R. is Michelle\u2019s legal father, the majority assure that their relationship stands on a shaky legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">For example, if Donald R. and Judith W. were to divorce, Judith W. would be entitled to sole custody of Michelle. (See \u00a7 4600, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If Judith W. died, Ronald W., not Donald R., would be entitled to sole custody as the legally recognized surviving \u201cparent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Donald R. would be entitled to custody only (1) if both Judith W. and Ronald W. had given their consent or died, or (2) if a court found that an award of custody to either of them would be detrimental to Michelle. (See \u00a7 4600, subds. (b)(2), (c); see generally, <em>Rethinking Parenthood, supra, </em>70 Va. L.Rev. at pp. 912-919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Thus, Donald R.\u2019s interest in establishing his paternity is far from abstract. If any of the asserted interests in this case is abstract, it is the state\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity of a nonexistent family.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Whenever the conclusive presumption of paternity is challenged on due process grounds, competing interests must be carefully balanced. In this case, the result of that balancing process compels but one conclusion\u2014that Donald R. must be permitted an opportunity to rebut the presumption. The recognized state interests in upholding the presumption are either nonexistent or entitled to no deference under the circumstances of this case. The family unit for which the majority reserve such solicitude ceased to exist long ago. Similarly, plaintiffs\u2019 action poses no danger to the private interests of the \u201cpresumed\u201d father, Ronald W.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">On the other side of the scale is the emotional and familial bond which has developed between Donald R. and Michelle in their current living situation. Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial interest in establishing the legal foundation necessary to protect that bond. The majority have advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>no reason that will justify barring plaintiffs from making the attempt. Accordingly, I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Civil Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Section 4601 provides: \u201cReasonable visitation rights shall be awarded to a parent unless it is shown that such visitation would be detrimental to the best interests of the child.

The relationship of the term to the <em>in loco parentis </em>doctrine was not discussed. At least one court has used the two concepts interchangeably.

(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at fn. 5.) I would go further and expressly disapprove the cases which have cited avoidance of the stigma of illegitimacy as a policy consideration supporting a conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>presumption. <em>(Estate of Cornelious, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 465; <em>In re Madalina </em>(1917) 174 Cal. 693, 697 [164 P. 348, 1 A.L.R. 1629]; <em>Vincent B. </em>v. <em>Joan R. </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 619, 623 [179 Cal.Rptr. 9]; <em>In re Marriage of B. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 524, 529-530 [177 Cal.Rptr. 429]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 193, 198 [152 Cal.Rptr. 478]; <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 297, 303 [145 Cal.Rptr. 483]; cf. <em>In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 650; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sorensen </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 280, 288-289 [66 Cal.Rptr. 7, 437 P.2d 495, 25 A.L.R.3d 1093]; <em>Estate of Lund </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 472, 480-482 [159 P.2d 643, 162 A.L.R. 606]; <em>Estate of McNamara </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 82, 95 [183 P. 552, 7 A.L.R. 313]; <em>Estate of Walker </em>(1917) 176 Cal. 402, 410 [168 P. 689]; <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 873, 885 [153 Cal.Rptr. 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Disapproval of these decisions to the extent that they rely on avoidance of the stigma of illegitimacy is supported by constitutional considerations. In this regard, the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 429 [80 L.Ed.2d 421, 104 S.Ct. 1879] is instructive. In that case, the court unanimously reversed the order of a Florida trial court which had awarded custody of a child to the father on the ground that the mother was cohabiting with a black man. The mother and the child were white. The trial court\u2019s decision had turned solely on \u201cwhat it regarded as the damaging impact on the child from remaining in a racially-mixed household.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 432 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 425, 104 S.Ct. at p. 1881].) The trial court had stated that \u201cdespite the strides that have been made in bettering relations between the races in this country,\u201d, the child would inevitably \u201csuffer from the social stigmatization that is sure to come.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In reversing, the high court held that the possibility of stigmatization due to racial biases and stereotypes was not a legitimate basis for the custody determination. \u201cThe Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\u201d <em>(Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 433 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 426, 104 S.Ct. at p. 1882].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The court left no doubt that the constitutional imperative governed the actions of judicial officers. <em>(Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 432, fn. 1 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 425, 104 S.Ct. at p. 1881]; <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer </em>(1948) 334 U.S. 1 [92 L.Ed. 1161, 68 S.Ct. 836, 3 A.L.R.2d 441]; <em>Ex Parte Virginia </em>(1880) 100 U.S. 339, 346-347 [25 L.Ed. 676, 679].) \u201c \u2018Public officials sworn to uphold the Constitution may not avoid a constitutional duty by bowing to the hypothetical effects of private racial prejudice that they assume to be both widely and deeply held.\u2019\u201d <em>(Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 433 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 426, 104 S.Ct. at p. 1882], quoting <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 217, 260-261 [29 L.Ed.2d 438, 464-465, 91 S.Ct. 1940] (dis. opn. of White, J.).) Private prejudice based on illegitimacy should be accorded no greater judicial deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
