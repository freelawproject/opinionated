The judgment, which included the power to commit Man-ton involuntarily to a state mental institution, followed a jury finding that Mant\u00f3n was gravely disabled. (Lanterman-Petris-Short Act; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">While being cared for at San Diego County Mental Health Services, Man-ton was referred for conservatorship by the counselor of mental health. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(\u00a7 5352.) Pursuant to that referral, Robert Deney, a mental health counsel- or, conducted an investigation and prepared a conservatorship report. (\u00a7\u00a7 5008, subd. (g), 5354.) The report contained information from Man-ton\u2019s hospital and medical records, including statements of doctors and hospital attendants, interviews with Mant\u00f3n, and conversations with Mant\u00f3n\u2019s father including statements by him regarding statements by Mant\u00f3n\u2019s mother. Deney concluded that appellant was gravely disabled and recommended that a conservatorship be established over his person because he was unable to accept treatment voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">A petition for appointment of a conservator for appellant and the report by Deney were filed with the superior court on June 20, 1983. The court appointed a temporary conservator (\u00a7 5353) pending a hearing on the petition for appointment of a conservator (\u00a7\u00a7 5350, 5365). At the hearing, the court found that appellant was gravely disabled but vacated this finding when appellant requested a jury trial. (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">At the jury trial, which commenced August 4, 1983, appellant objected to Deney\u2019s testimony and to his conservatorship investigation report on the basis that they contained inadmissible hearsay. The court agreed with this characterization but after considering the opinion in <em>Conservatorship of Davis </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 313 [177 Cal.Rptr. 369], found both admissible pursuant to section 5354. The jury concluded that defendant was gravely disabled and a conservator was thereafter appointed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Appellant now challenges the introduction of Deney\u2019s report and testimony on both statutory and constitutional grounds. In addition, he raises several claims concerning the testimony of a psychiatrist and hospital attendant who testified regarding his condition. We conclude that there is no statutory authorization for the introduction of the report during trial and that the court erred in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Once a recommendation of conservatorship is made by an appropriate person (\u00a7 5352), the \u201cofficer providing conservatorship investigation\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the relevant county begins an inquiry to determine suitable treatment for the proposed conservatee. Section 5354 describes the investigation process. All suitable alternatives to conservatorship must be considered and only if no alternative exists may conservatorship be recommended. The investigating officer \u201cshall render to the court a written report of investigation prior to the hearing. The report to the court shall be comprehensive and shall contain all relevant aspects of the person\u2019s medical, psychological, financial, family, vocational and social condition, and information obtained from the person\u2019s family members, close friends, social worker or principal therapist.\u201d In addition, the report contains the recommendations of the investigator as to suitable alternatives and the propriety of conservatorship. The investigator must also designate a suitable conservator and provide recommendations regarding the scope of the conservator\u2019s power and the proper placement for the proposed conservatee. (\u00a7\u00a7 5354.5-5356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Once it has been prepared, a copy of the report is sent to the person originally recommending conservatorship, to the proposed conservator, and to the recommended conservatee. Section 5354 concludes by providing that \u201cThe court may receive the report in evidence and may read and consider the contents thereof in rendering its judgment.\u201d  At issue here is whether that language permits use of the report at the contested court or jury trial where at issue is whether the proposed conservatee is \u201cgravely disabled.\u201d (See \u00a7\u00a7 5008, subd. (h), 5350, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">When a petition has been filed, a \u201chearing\u201d must be held within 30 days. Such a hearing may be waived if the proposed conservatee demands a trial before the hearing date. (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d).) A demand for court or jury trial also may be made within 5 days following the hearing and such trial must commence within 10 days of the demand date unless the proposed conservatee\u2019s counsel requests an extension of up to 15 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Here, appellant made a timely request for jury trial. At the ensuing trial his objection to the introduction of the report by the conservatorship investigator resulted in a lively discussion, during which the court commented: \u201cI seriously doubt the propriety of gross hearsay that nobody says he used for diagnostic purposes and I suspect that when it comes in, and its probably in that report, it will be error, and if the jury receives it, it will be prejudicial. [t] But it isn\u2019t error under the present law that I am bound by, and so I\u2019m bound to make the error.\u201d The \u201cgross hearsay\u201d to which the court referred included statements in the report describing comments by appellant\u2019s father referring to appellant\u2019s history, the father\u2019s attitude toward appellant, and the father\u2019s description of appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s feelings about appellant. The report was based on information \u201cfrom hospital records, records of prior conservatorships\u201d and conservations with appellant\u2019s fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ther. Clearly, but for some exception to the hearsay rule, the report would be inadmissible as containing hearsay and even hearsay on hearsay. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">County contends that introduction of the conservatorship investigative report nonetheless was consistent with due process requirements, and points to other code sections permitting introduction of various reports prepared as part of an investigation. For example, Civil Code section 233 provides that when a petition for termination of parental custody and control is filed (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 232), the court shall order an investigation into the circumstances and the \u201cjuvenile probation officer or the county department shall render to the court a written report of the investigation with a recommendation to the court of the proper disposition to be made . . . .\u201d The report is to be received into evidence by the court which \u201cshall read and consider the contents thereof in rendering its judgment.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">County argues that the receipt into evidence of reports rendered pursuant to Civil Code section 233 (see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 263; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 281) is analogous to and supports the treatment of the reports urged here. It also points specifically to <em>Conservatorship of Davis, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d 313, 328, where the court concluded that investigative reports and the testimony of those preparing such reports \u201cby specific language in section 5354, may be admitted and considered by the trier of fact. ... [1] . . . [Ojnce such testimony was received in evidence, it . . . could and should have been considered by the jury as trier of fact in reaching its verdict as to \u2018grave disability.\u2019\u201d County asserts that <em>Davis, </em>and language in <em>Conservatorship of Early </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 244 [197 Cal.Rptr. 539, 673 P.2d 209], citing <em>Davis </em>with approval, indicate that authority for the introduction of such reports at contested trials lies in section 5354. However, contrary to county\u2019s contention, we did not specifically address this question in <em>Early, </em>nor did our citation in that case to the reasoning in <em>Davis </em>necessarily indicate approval of the Court of Appeal\u2019s treatment of the use of conservatorship investigation reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The <em>Davis </em>court stressed that \u201cSections 5001 et seq., necessarily require the trier of fact (the jury in the case at bench) to determine the question of grave disability, not in a vacuum, but in the context of suitable alternatives, upon a consideration of the willingness and capability of the proposed conservatee to voluntarily accept treatment and upon consideration of whether the nondangerous individual is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members, friends or other third parties. [Citation.]\u201d (124 Cal.App.3d at p. 325.) Similarly, in <em>Early, supra, </em>we concluded that in deciding whether a person was gravely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>disabled because he or she was \u201cunable to provide for . . . personal needs for physical health, food, clothing or shelter ...\u201d (\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)), courts should consider \u201cthe willingness and ability of third persons to assist the proposed ward or conservatee . . .\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 252).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Neither the <em>Davis </em>nor the <em>Early </em>opinion relied on admissibility of the investigative report as a precondition to their still valid conclusions regarding the appropriate scope of inquiry in conservatorship trials. In particular, county\u2019s reliance on <em>Davis </em>as a definitive interpretation of the application of section 5354, is misplaced. The discussion of section 5354 occurred in a very diiferent context: the proposed conservatee, who had relied upon the report\u2019s contents during the trial, had been found <em>not </em>gravely disabled. The county was contending on appeal that the jury\u2019s inquiry went too far when it reached beyond the question of the person\u2019s ability to succeed without assistance from any outside source. The <em>Davis </em>court\u2019s reference to section 5354 was made as part of its explanation that, as a matter of statutory construction, the phrase \u201cwhether [the person] is gravely disabled\u201d must be broadly construed (124 Cal.App.3d at p. 323), and thus the information in the report was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Nor is county assisted by directing our attention to language in <em>Early </em>stating that a comprehensive investigative report \u201calso may form the basis for a more extended conservatorship . ...\u201d (35 Cal.3d at pp. 247-248.) That comment is followed by an explanation that if a conservatorship is recommended, the proposed conservatee may demand a jury trial on the issue of grave disablement, and casts no light on the question presently before us. The issue of grave disability and suitable placement obviously can be determined based on <em>admissible </em>evidence; hearsay often may make things easier to \u201cprove\u201d but that does not mandate that its use be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Looking at the statutory scheme and the language of section 5354 itself, we conclude that they do not purport to provide any exception to the general rules of evidence in regard to the use of conservatorship investigation reports at contested trials on the issue of grave disability. The hearing procedures are taken from those set forth in Probate Code section 1820 et seq. (\u00a7 5350; Cal. Conservatorships (Cont.Ed.Bar 1983) \u00a7 8.38 at p. 530 (hereafter CEB).) In deciding whether a conservator should be appointed, the court must determine whether the proposed conservatee is gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or alcoholism. (\u00a7\u00a7 5008, subd. (h), 5350.) At the hearing, the court may rely upon the \u201cverified petition, the proofs of service, the court investigator\u2019s report, and the testimony of the proposed conservator\u201d and of the proposed conservatee if available. (CEB, \u00a7 4.50 at p. 192.) Section 5365.1 also specifically permits waiver of the presence of the physician or other professional recommending conservatorship and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>introduction by stipulation of the recommendations and records of such persons \u201cat any hearing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">If the proposed conservatee chooses to go forward with the hearing he may agree to be bound by the court\u2019s decision at such hearing by not contesting the petition or thereafter demanding a trial. (See, e.g., <em>Conservatorship of Chambers </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 277, 281 [139 Cal.Rptr. 357]; CEB, \u00a7 8.41 at p. 531.) But while section 5354 requires submission of the conservatorship report \u201cprior to the hearing,\u201d (italics added) it makes absolutely no mention of the use of the report at any subsequent contested trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the conservatee may demand a <em>trial </em>in lieu of or after a <em>hearing </em>strongly indicates that the procedures at the two types of proceedings were expected to differ. If the report were admissible at both the initial hearing and a subsequent court trial, the two proceedings would be essentially identical in terms of the acceptable range of evidence to be considered. We believe that the better interpretation is one avoiding such redundancy in the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Yet another indication that the reports were intended for use only at the hearing is provided by section 5358, subdivision (c). That provision states that \u201cAt the time that the court considers the report of the officer providing conservatorship investigation . . ., the court shall consider available placement alternatives.\u201d At a <em>trial, </em>as opposed to a hearing, the issue is whether the proposed conservatee is gravely disabled; the question of placement is not decided until after a judgment is rendered on that issue. (\u00a7 5350, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>(d).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language of section 5358, subdivision (c), regarding use of the report for purposes of assessing placement alternatives thus further demonstrates that the report is to be considered solely during the hearing stage. Unlike Civil Code section 233 and similar statutes urged as analogous by county, section 5354 does not provide an express exception to the hearsay rule permitting use of the investigation report at a <em>contested trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Because we conclude that the Legislature intended that the investigation report be admitted only at the hearing to the extent that it does not otherwise qualify for admission under any exception to the hearsay rule, we need not ftirther consider the question whether the report\u2019s admission complies with the requirements of due process. Such an inquiry need only be undertaken if statutory authority is provided which permits unqualified introduction of the reports at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As a result of our conclusion, reversal is mandated. The introduction of the report and testimony regarding it, which the jury considered as substantive evidence of appellant\u2019s condition, was potentially highly prejudicial. The report was replete with hearsay and conclusions adverse to appellant\u2019s claims that he did not need a conservator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In his appeal, appellant also raises several issues concerning various jury instructions and certain testimony. These are issues which will not necessarily recur and we therefore do not further address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">We therefore reverse the conservatorship judgment rendered in this proceeding<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the ground that the court erred in admitting the conserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>torship investigation report to the extent it contained inadmissible hearsay. Nothing in the present statutory scheme provides an exception to the general rules of hearsay for this report when its use is sought during a contested trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The conservatorship in effect was not stayed and therefore continued pending this appeal. (\u00a7 5352.4.) Conservatorships automatically terminate one year after appointment of the conservator (\u00a7 5361), although they may be reviewed and extended upon application by the conservator, subject to the right to request a trial (\u00a7 5362). Because of the brevity of the basic period, the issue here might evade review on the ground of mootness. However, because the matter is one of general interest and likely to reappear in the future, resolution is appropriate. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Layton </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 922, 925 [123 Cal.Rptr. 97, 538 P.2d 225]; <em>Knoll </em>v. <em>Davidson </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 335, 344 [116 Cal.Rptr. 97, 525 P.2d 1273].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">County has supplied an analysis of the 1978 amendments to section 5354 prepared by the staff of the Subcommittee on Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities. The amendments included deletion of the following language: \u201cIn contested cases, if the proposed conservatee or his counsel objects to the receipt of the report in evidence, such report shall not be read or considered by the court until the issue of grave disability has been adjudicated.\u201d The comment to this deletion observed that \u201cThe grave disability must be evidenced during the trial itself. This has led to frustration on the part of families, mental health professionals, and the courts and has led to the high percentage of recidivism of chronic mentally disordered persons. AB 3111 would permit the investigation report to be admitted into evidence.\u201d County urges that this comment demonstrates legislative intent to permit unqualified introduction of the report at any jury or court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The comment prepared by the staff is ambiguous and does not address the issue raised here. There is no showing that specific hearsay problems raised by use of the report were considered. Nor does the comment indicate how introduction of the conservatorship report would alleviate the asserted frustration involved in requiring that \u201cgrave disability ... be evidenced during the trial itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Because of our conclusion that the remaining effective language of the section does not establish that such reports are to be received in evidence over the conservatee\u2019s objection at the time of trial as opposed to during the initial hearing, and because the analysis by the subcommittee\u2019s staff is ambiguous and incomplete, we do not afford it great weight. (Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 587 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371] [\u201call pertinent factors\u201d are considered in determining legislative intent].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">County points to section 5358.3 as demonstrating the Legislature\u2019s ability to distinguish between a \u201chearing\u201d and a \u201ctrial\u201d and argues that its failure to do so in section 5354 meant that section\u2019s provisions were applicable to both proceedings. In fact, the absence of any reference to a trial in section 5354, and the Legislature\u2019s demonstrated ability to make such distinctions, bolsters our conclusion that the admissibility of the report is limited to the initial hearing proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\">For example, appellant\u2019s father is described as stating appellant \u201cwas an incorrigible child from an early age\u201d who \u201chas been arrested numerous times for offenses such as stealing food and trespassing.\u201d His father also is cited as saying appellant \u201chad no place to live and no means of support that he knew of.\u201d In addition, throughout the report appear statements regarding appellant\u2019s behavior which are not attributed to a particular source. Since the jury was required to determine whether appellant had a mental disorder and, if so, was nonetheless able voluntarily to care for himself, these statements went to the heart of the decisionmaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\">This determination does not mandate that any existing conservatorship be vacated. Appellant\u2019s present status as a conservatee, if applicable, would, of course, be pursuant to proceedings subsequent to those at issue here.
