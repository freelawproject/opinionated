For the reasons set forth below, we answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Plaintiffs are homeowners who live adjacent to defendant Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. The airport became a public entity in 1978 when it was purchased by the three cities pursuant to Government Code section 6500 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1982, plaintiffs filed suit for inverse condemnation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>nuisance caused by noise, smoke, and vibrations from flights over their homes. The trial court sustained demurrers to both causes of action, dismissing the inverse condemnation action because defendant is prohibited by statute from exercising the power of eminent domain, and dismissing the nuisance action as barred by the statute of limitations covering permanent nuisances. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">1. <em>Inverse Condemnation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Defendant contends that because \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d is a \u201cshorthand description of the manner in which a landowner recovers just compensation for a taking of his property when condemnation proceedings have not been instituted\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Clarke </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 253, 257) [63 L.Ed.2d 373, 377, 100 S.Ct. 1127], it should follow that if an entity lacks the power to condemn by eminent domain, it cannot be liable in inverse condemnation. Indeed, there is some authority for this mechanical view. (3 Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d ed. 1981) \u00a7 8.1 [4], p. 8-39; <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agcy. </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 566 F.2d 1353, 1358, revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom., Lake Country Estates </em>v. <em>Tahoe Planning Agcy. </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 391 [59 L.Ed.2d 401, 99 S.Ct. 1171]; <em>Western Internat\u2019l Hotels </em>v. <em>Tahoe Reg. Plan. Agcy. </em>(D. Nev. 1975) 387 F.Supp. 429, 439; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1972) 346 F.Supp. 140, 143; <em>Ex Parte Carter </em>(Ala. 1980) 395 So.2d 65, 67; <em>Collopy </em>v. <em>Wildlife Com\u2019n, etc. </em>(Colo. 1981) 625 P.2d 994, 1005; cf. <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Penna. Public Utility Com\u2019n. </em>(1980) 48 Cmwlth. Ct. 384 [409 A.2d 962, 964].) As defendant is prohibited from exercising eminent domain power,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it therefore contends that it cannot be subject to suit for inverse condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">These authorities are not controlling. They fail to recognize that the term, \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d describes an action grounded not on statutory condemnation power, but on the constitutional proscription against the taking (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) or the taking or damaging (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19) of property for public use without just compensation. A landowner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>whose property has been invaded by a public entity that lacks eminent domain power suffers no less a taking merely because the defendant was not authorized to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We have previously recognized the constitutional basis of an inverse condemnation action. In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713 [123 P.2d 505], we held that mere failure of the Legislature to enact a statute authorizing an inverse condemnation suit did not entitle the state to disregard the constitutional imperative; we therefore allowed the action even though the state had not consented to be sued. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 719-723.) Similarly, the court in <em>Sutfin </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 50 [67 Cal.Rptr. 665], held that liability in inverse condemnation did \u201c \u2018not depend upon a showing that there is statutory authority in the defendant entity to exercise affirmative eminent domain powers to accomplish the same result. All that is necessary to show is that the damage resulted from an exercise of governmental power while seeking to promote \u201cthe general interest in its relation to any legitimate object of government.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Id., at p. 55.) We later explicitly recognized what was implicit in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Sutfin: </em>\u201c[t]he authority for prosecution of an inverse condemnation proceeding derives from article I, section 19, of the California Constitution . . . .\u201d <em>(Holtz </em>v. <em>San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 648, 652 [131 Cal.Rptr. 646, 552 P.2d 430],)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We therefore conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation action may be maintained although defendant lacks eminent domain power. <em>(Fountain </em>v. <em>Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority </em>(11th Cir. 1982) 678 F.2d 1038, 1043-1045.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the inverse condemnation claim was filed within the five-year statute of limitations <em>(Frustruck </em>v. <em>City of Fairfax </em>(1963) 212 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Cal.App.2d 345, 374 [28 Cal.Rptr. 357]), the trial court erred in dismissing this cause of action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">2. <em>Nuisance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action alleges that defendant\u2019s activities became a nuisance as of January 29, 1978\u2014the date defendant became a public entity. Because plaintiffs did n\u00f3t file their complaint until 1982, a question arises as to whether their nuisance claim was timely filed. The answer depends on whether the nuisance is characterized as continuing or permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The trial court ruled that because this particular nuisance is not subject to judicial abatement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is a permanent nuisance upon which the statute of limitations (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 338, subd. 2 and 340) had run at the time plaintiffs filed their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">It does not follow, however, that simply because commercial flights operated in compliance with federal law may not be enjoined, the nuisance at issue is a permanent one. Whether a nuisance will be classified as continuing or permanent depends not on the offending party\u2019s interest in continuing the nuisance, but on the type of harm suffered. (See <em>Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 937 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\"> Two distinct classifications have emerged in nuisance law which determine the remedies available to injured parties and the applicable statute of limitations. On the one hand, permanent nuisances are of a type where \u201c \u2018by one act a permanent injury is done, [and] damages are assessed once for all.\u2019\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1907) 150 Cal. 624, 626 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>[89 P. 599], quoting <em>Beronio </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1890) 86 Cal. 415, 421 [24 P. 1093].) The cases finding the nuisance complained of to be unquestionably permanent in nature have involved solid structures, such as a building encroaching upon the plaintiff\u2019s land <em>(Rankin </em>v. <em>DeBare </em>(1928) 205 Cal. 639 [271 P. 1050]),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a steam railroad operating over plaintiff\u2019s land <em>(Williams, supra, </em>150 Cal. 624),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or regrade of a street for a rail system <em>(Eachus </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Ry. Co. </em>(1894) 103 Cal. 614 [37 P. 750]). In such cases, plaintiffs ordinarily are required to bring one action for all past, present and future damage within three years after the permanent nuisance is erected. <em>(Rankin, supra, </em>205 Cal. at p. 641; <em>Williams, supra, </em>150 Cal. at p. 626; <em>Robinson, supra, </em>129 Cal. at p. 11.) The statutory period is shorter for claims against public entities. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.) Damages are not dependent upon any subsequent use of the property but are complete when the nuisance comes into existence. <em>(Eachus, supra, </em>103 Cal. at p. 622.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">On the other hand, if a nuisance is a use which may be discontinued at any time, it is considered continuing in character and persons harmed by it may bring successive actions for damages until the nuisance is abated. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 104, 107-108 [162 P.2d 625].) Recovery is limited, however, to actual injury suffered prior to commencement of each action. Prospective damages are unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The classic example of a continuing nuisance is an ongoing or repeated disturbance, such as the one before us today, caused by noise, vibration or foul odor. (E.g., <em>Vowinckel </em>v. <em>N. Clark &amp; Sons </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 156, 158 [13 P.2d 733] [vibration, noise and noxious soot, smoke and gases emanating from pottery factory].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, even more substantial physical invasions of land have been held to be continuing in character. (E.g., <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Ferrera </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 827, 828 [301 P.2d 905] [deflection of rain water and emission of noxious odors and fumes from neighbor\u2019s pipes and furnace].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As emphasized in <em>Tracy, </em>the distinction to be drawn is between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>encroachments of a permanent nature erected upon one\u2019s lands, and a complaint made, not of the location of the offending structures, but of the continuing use of such structures. <em>(Id., supra, </em>144 Cal.App.2d at p. 828.) The former are permanent, the latter is not.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In case of doubt as to the permanency of the injury the plaintiff may elect whether to treat a particular nuisance as permanent or continuing. <em>(Spaulding </em>v. <em>Cameron </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 265, 268 [239 P.2d 625].) The importance of the plaintiff\u2019s election has long been recognized. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Dickinson </em>(1946) 331 U.S. 745, 749 [91 L.Ed. 1789, 1794, 67 S.Ct. 1382]; <em>Kornoff v. Kingsburg Cotton Oil Co. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 265, 269-271 [288 P.2d 507]; <em>Kafka, supra, </em>191 Cal. at p. 752; <em>Williams, supra, </em>150 Cal. at p. 628; <em>Martinez-Ferrer </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 316, 326 [164 Cal.Rptr. 591]; <em>Tracy, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.2d at p. 829; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed 1985) Actions, \u00a7 425, pp. 458-459; Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 930.) As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Dickinson, </em>a case in which a landowner sued to recover damages after the government flooded his land, \u201c[i]f suit must be brought, lest he jeopardize his rights, as soon as his land is invaded, other contingencies would be running against him\u2014for instance, the uncertainty of the damage and the risk of res judicata against recovering later for damage as yet uncertain. The source of the entire claim ... is not a single event; it is continuous.\u201d <em>(Dickinson, supra, </em>331 U.S. at p. 749 [91 L.Ed. at p. 1794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Another contingency running against the plaintiff is the statute of limitations. In <em>Spaulding </em>we expressed concern that \u201cif the initial injury is slight and plaintiff delays suit until he has suffered substantial damage and the court then determines that the nuisance was permanent, the defendant may be able to raise the defense that the statute of limitations ran from the time of the initial injury. [Citation.] On the other hand, if the defendant is willing and able to abate the nuisance, it is unfair to award damages on the theory. that it will continue. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Spaulding, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d at p. 268.) We then emphasized that \u201c[b]ecause of these difficulties, it has been recognized that in doubtful cases the plaintiff should have an election to treat the nuisance as either permanent or not. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Defendant contends, however, that this is not a case to which election applies because <em>Spaulding </em>separately categorized privileged activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>nuisances as permanent. Defendants read too much into the <em>Spaulding </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Although <em>Spaulding </em>contains language suggesting that election is unavailable when the nuisance arises as a result of privileged activity,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this isolated aspect of the opinion must be viewed in context. First, the purported exclusion is dictum only. <em>Spaulding </em>did not involve a question of privilege. In <em>Spaulding, </em>the defendant, a private landowner, negligently maintained piles of dirt on his property which caused mudslides on the plaintiff\u2019s land when it rained. The trial court ordered the nuisance abated but also awarded prospective damages for permanent diminution in the value of plaintiff\u2019s property. Thus, the issue was the necessity of election, not whether privilege precluded such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Second, <em>Spaulding\u2019s </em>election discussion is based, in part, on <em>Phillips, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 104, a case involving \u201cprivileged\u201d governmental activity. In <em>Phillips </em>we held that even assuming the city could not be required to remove a road block obstructing access to Phillips\u2019 property, it could not be said as a matter of law that the gate was a permanent nuisance since it apparently \u201ccould have been removed at any time.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 108.) It is difficult to reconcile this case, affirmatively relied upon in <em>Spaulding, </em>with an interpretation of the latter as absolutely barring election when privileged activity is at issue. The two opinions are more realistically viewed as focusing the election inquiry on the ability to abate rather than on the possibility of a court order requiring abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Third, public policy militates against defining a nuisance as permanent or continuing on the basis of privilege alone. As noted, the purpose of nuisance law is to provide a means of recovery for harm suffered. The doctrine of election is designed to facilitate just and equitable recovery. Though the traditional remedy of injunctive relief may be unavailable in a given case, the damage suffered is no different than in a case involving identical but nonprivileged activity. Both victims are harmed in the same way, and both may seek damages for such harm. Where the nuisance is a continuing one, both victims, therefore, should be able to bring successive actions as dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ages accrue. To hold that the statute of limitations applies to one continuing nuisance but not the other is to put the burden on the victim to choose his or her tortfeasor wisely. Nuisance law neither requires nor supports such a harsh result.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Moreover, we should be particularly cautious not to enlarge the category of permanent nuisances beyond those structures or conditions that truly are permanent. Where some means of abatement exists, there is little or no incentive to make remedial efforts once the nuisance is classified as permanent. Such a result is at odds with tort law\u2019s philosophy of encouraging innovation and repair to decrease future harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Finally, the privilege alluded to in <em>Spaulding </em>is quite different from the privilege claimed in the present case. In a word, the <em>Spaulding </em>privilege is absolute. <em>Spaulding </em>referred to an \u201coffending structure or condition [] maintained as a necessary part of the operations of a public utility\u201d as a clear permanent nuisance, <em>\u201c\\s\\ince the utility by making compensation is entitled to continue them.'\u2019'\u2019 (Id., </em>38 Cal.2d at p. 267.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">We do not deal with such an extensive privilege. Federal preemption of local regulation of airport noise is not absolute. In <em>Greater Westchester, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 86, we concluded that federal preemption does not operate to wholly eliminate local responsibility for airport noise control. We based this conclusion, in part, on the distinction drawn by the United States Supreme Court in <em>City of Burbank </em>v. <em>Lockheed Air Terminal </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 624 [36 L.Ed.2d 547, 93 S.Ct. 1854], between a municipality\u2019s exercise of the police power and its proprietary efforts to reduce airport noise. Federal law preempts only the former. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 635-636, fn. 14 [36 L.Ed.2d at pp. 554-555]; <em>Greater Westchester, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 96. See also <em>San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>v. <em>Gianturco </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 651 F.2d 1306, 1314, cert. den., 455 U.S. 1000 [71 L.Ed.2d 866, 102 S.Ct. 1631].) The message of <em>City of Burbank </em>and <em>Greater Westchester </em>is clear: state law damage remedies remain available against an airport proprietor despite the fact that federal law precludes interference with commercial flight patterns and schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Moreover, recovery is not limited to damages for permanent nuisance only. In <em>Greater Westchester </em>we affirmed damage awards totalling $86,000 for personal injuries sustained during the period 1967-1975 by persons living near Los Angeles International Airport. <em>(Id., </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 92.) Although we did not otherwise identify the nuisance as permanent or continuing, the time frame given strongly suggests the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>The airport operator\u2019s separate duty to reduce noise, and hence, separate nuisance liability, is particularly compelling in the present case. Defendant is a public entity charged with responsibility for the \u201cacquisition, operation, repair, maintenance, improvement and administration\u201d of the airport as a public airport. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6546.1.) Not only does defendant play a proprietary role in the airport\u2019s operations, but it is expressly required by statute to make all reasonable efforts to curb noise pollution at the airport. \u201cIn operating the airport, the separate public entity . . . shall not permit or authorize any activity in conjunction with the airport which results in an increase in the size of the noise impact area . . . and shall further comply with the future community noise equivalent levels prescribed by [the California Administrative Code]. . . . [1f] In addition, the entity shall diligently pursue all reasonable avenues available to insure that the adverse effects of noise are being mitigated to the greatest extent reasonably possible.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, despite the fact that the flights to and from the airport are privileged, defendant shoulders an affirmative responsibility to minimize noise levels through the use of buffers, barriers or other noise reducing devices. The privilege is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Airport operations are the quintessential continuing nuisance. Although federal law precluding interference in any way with flight patterns and schedules adds an element of permanency to an otherwise continuing problem, it does not mandate that the overall nuisance is a permanent one. Thus plaintiffs may elect whether to treat airport noise and vibrations as a continuing or as a permanent nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Because plaintiffs elected to treat the airport as a continuing nuisance, we conclude that the statute of limitations does not bar their nuisance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed as to both causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Bird, C. J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">The cities\u2019 joint powers agreement was specifically authorized by Government Code section 6546.1, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the County of Los Angeles, any agency, commission, or board provided for by joint powers agreement entered into by cities pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of this chapter for the purpose of the acquisition, operation, repair, maintenance, improvement and administration of the Hollywood-Burbank Airport as a public airport, pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, may carry out such purpose and may authorize the issuance of revenue bonds, pursuant to this article, to pay for acquiring, repairing, improving, financing and refinancing such project, including all facilities and improvements and all expenses incidental thereto or connected therewith. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Government Code section 6546.1 provides in part that defendant \u201cshall not authorize or permit ... the purchase of fee title to condemned real property zoned for residential use . . . .\" Moreover, we cannot agree with plaintiffs that Public Utilities Code section 21652 authorizes defendant to take by condemnation the air space easements at issue here. Although that section recognizes air space easements may be acquired by condemnation when \u201cnecessary to permit imposition ... of excessive noise, [or] vibration . . . due to the operation of aircraft to and from the airport\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd.

[Citations.] The remedy for a continuing nuisance was either a suit for injunctive relief or successive actions for damages as new injuries occurred. <em>Situations arose, however, where injunctive relief was not appropriate or where successive actions were undesirable either to the plaintiff or the defendant or both. Accordingly, it was recognized that some types of nuisances should be considered permanent, and in such cases recovery of past and anticipated future damages were allowed in one action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cThe clearest case of a permanent nuisance or trespass is the one where the offending structure or condition is maintained as a necessary part of the operations of a public utility. Since such conditions are ordinarily of indefinite duration and since the utility by making compensation is entitled to continue them, it is appropriate that only one action should be allowed to recover for all the damages inflicted. It would be unfair to the utility to subject it to successive suits and unfair to the injured party if he were not allowed to recover all of his probable damages at once.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 267, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Thus, if a use of property alleged to be a nuisance is likely to continue indefinitely because its owner cannot be compelled to abate, the nuisance is deemed permanent and the plaintiff is given a single cause of action for his damages past, present, and future. This test for classifying nuisances as either continuing or permanent turns on whether the nuisance is reasonably abatable. It is the rule followed not only in this state (see, e.g., <em>Kornoff </em>v. <em>Kingsburg Cotton Oil Co. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 265, 269-271 [288 P.2d 507]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Cameron, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d at p. 267), but in other jurisdictions as well (see, e.g., <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Heftler Realty Company </em>(Fla.App. 1975) 316 So.2d 594, 595; <em>City of Columbus </em>v. <em>Myszka </em>(1980) 246 Ga. 571, 572 [272 S.E.2d 302]; <em>Patz </em>v. <em>Farmegg Products, Inc. </em>(Iowa 1972) 196 N.W.2d 557, 562; <em>Kentland-Elkhorn Coal Company </em>v. <em>Charles </em>(Ky.App. 1974) 514 S.W.2d 659, 664; <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. </em>(1979) 285 Md. 673, 688-690 [404 A.2d 1064]; <em>Drybread </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis </em>(Mo.App. 1982) 634 S.W.2d 519, 520-521; <em>Rebel </em>v. <em>Big Tarkio Drainage Dist. </em>(Mo.App. 1980) 602 S.W.2d 787, 792-793; <em>Sundell v. Town of New London </em>(1979) 119 N.H. 839 [409 A.2d 1315, 1320-1321]; <em>Aguayo </em>v. <em>Village of Chama </em>(1969) 79 N.M. 729, 731 [449 P.2d 331]; <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1983) 112 Wis.2d 88, 102-103 [332 N.W.2d 733]). It is also approved by commentators: \u201cBut if the nuisance can not be abated, or is such that the court will not enjoin its continuance, all damages must be obtained in one action. \u201d (1 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts (1956) \u00a7 1.30, p. 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Under these principles, the nuisance alleged here must be deemed permanent. First, injunctive relief is not simply inappropriate, it is unavailable. As this court observed in <em>Greater Westchester Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 86 [160 Cal.Rptr. 733, 603 P.2d 1329], certiorari denied, 449 U.S. 820 [66 L.Ed.2d 22, 101 S.Ct. 77], \u201ccommercial flights which are conducted in strict compliance with federal regulations may not be enjoined as nuisances, both because of the continuing public interest in air transportation, and because of the likelihood of direct conflict with federal law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 94; see also <em>Loma Portal Civic Club </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 582, 591 [39 Cal.Rptr. 708, 394 P.2d 548].) Second, successive actions are plainly undesirable. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin recently held in <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>an airport noise case, \u201cThe injured party must . . . present his . . . entire claim for past and future damages in one action. This limitation on such a damage action is necessary in order to protect airport proprietors from repeated and vexatious litigation based on the same nuisance.\u201d (112 Wis.2d at p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In some cases classification may be doubtful; in such cases, the <em>Spaulding </em>court observed, a plaintiff should be allowed to elect whether to treat the alleged nuisance as continuing or permanent. (38 Cal.2d at p. 268.) Recognizing that their claim here would be barred by limitations if the asserted nuisance is characterized as permanent, plaintiffs insist this case is within the class defined in <em>Spaulding </em>as \u201cdoubtful,\u201d and hence that they may avoid the limitations bar by treating the alleged nuisance as continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\"><em>Spaulding </em>allows such an election only if, inter alia, \u201cthe defendant is not privileged to continue the nuisance . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As <em>Greater West-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number><em>Chester </em>establishes, defendant\u2019s use of its property may not be enjoined as a nuisance: there are no allegations that defendant either is not subject to or has failed to comply with federal regulations. (26 Cal.3d at p. 94.) Thus, defendant is privileged to continue the nuisance alleged here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Nor is defendant\u2019s privilege to continue the alleged nuisance diminished by its <em>ability </em>to adopt means within its power to mitigate the allegedly offensive noise. Although the federal government has apparently not preempted all facets of noise control <em>(Greater Westchester, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at pp. 93-100, and authorities cited; Bennett, <em>Airport Noise Litigation: Case Law Review </em>(1982) 47 J. Air L. &amp; Com. 449, 464-469; Werlich &amp; Krinsky, <em>The Aviation Noise Abatement Controversy: Magnificent Laws, Noisy Machines, and the Legal Liability Shuffle </em>(1981) 15 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 69, 83-91; Comment, <em>The 1980 Airport Noise Act: Noise Abatement or Just More Noise? </em>(1981) 14 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 1049, <em>passim), </em>it is clear that permissible local regulation may be imposed only by airport <em>proprietors, </em>and not by third parties. (See Bennett, <em>supra, </em>47 J. Air L. &amp; Com. at pp. 469-473, and cases cited.) Thus in <em>City of Burbank </em>v. <em>Lockheed Air Terminal </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 624 [36 L.Ed.2d 547, 93 S.Ct. 1854], the United States Supreme Court invalidated a municipal ordinance that purported to regulate noise by imposing a take-off curfew on a privately owned airport. <em>City of Burbank </em>plainly establishes that the delicate federal/local-proprietor noise control scheme currently in effect will not tolerate private suits seeking mandatory imposition of local noise controls. (Cf. <em>San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>v. <em>Gianturco </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 651 F.2d 1306, 1316-1319, cert. den. (1982) 455 U.S. 1000 [71 L.Ed.2d 866, 102 S.Ct. 1631] [state may not direct an airport proprietor to exercise its noise abatement power].)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Thus, plaintiffs may not elect to treat the alleged nuisance as continuing: defendant is privileged to continue the nuisance and it must therefore be classified as permanent. (See <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>112 Wis.2d at pp. 102-103 [injunctive relief against airport noise unavailable; plaintiff may claim damages for permanent nuisance only].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Claims against public entities alleging injuries to persons or personal property must be brought by the 100th day after the accrual of the cause of action; all other claims\u2014including those for real property damage\u2014must be brought within 1 year after accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.) As plaintiffs implicitly admit, their nuisance cause of action accrued when the public entity undertook operations on January 29, 1978; from that date, plaintiffs claim, defendant\u2019s operations have \u201csubstantially interfered\u201d with the use and enjoyment of their properties. Because the limitations period began to run at that time, it is clear that plaintiffs\u2019 1982 complaint is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">I would accordingly affirm the order dismissing the nuisance cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Lucas, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Since \u201cprivileged\u201d in this context merely means not reasonably abatable (see <em>Spaulding, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d at pp. 267-268), the majority\u2019s claim to the contrary <em>(ante, </em>at pp. 870-872) is manifestly specious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"><em>Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480], does not support a contrary conclusion. In <em>Nestle </em>we held, inter alia, that a nuisance action based on airport noise was improperly dismissed on the basis of government immunity, and suggested that the plaintiffs on remand might be able to demonstrate a continuing nuisance. This dictum, of course, preceded the United States Supreme Court\u2019s noise control preemption decision in <em>City of Burbank </em>(1973) <em>supra, </em>411 U.S. 624; moreover, the court was not asked to consider <em>Spaulding\u2019s </em>first requirement for election: a nuisance may not be treated as continuing if the defendant is privileged to continue it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
