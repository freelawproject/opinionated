J., Thayee, Robaback, Wheelee and Reed, Js.</judges>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-8\">General Statutes, \u00a72407, providing that all taxes, properly assessed, shall become a debt due from the person against whom assessed, merely prescribes a remedy for their collection by ordinary action, and does not change the nature of a tax.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-9\">The word \u201cdebt\u201d as used in this section means a just demand, rather than an obligation arising out of a contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-10\">A tax is neither a debt nor an implied contract within General Statutes, \u00a7 1110, limiting actions for debt due \u201cby book or to balance book accounts.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-11\">The legislative intent must be clear in order to bring a tax within the terms of such a statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-12\">A tax is a public burden imposed by law upon the individual for a public purpose.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-13\">Indebitatus assumpsit, unless authorized by statute, cannot be maintained for a tax.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b388-14\">Argued March 5th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE5\">decided April 9th, 1912.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-15\">Action to recover the amount of a town tax, brought by appeal from a judgment of a justice of the peace to the Superior Court in Middlesex County where a demurrer to a plea of the statute of limitations was sustained <em>(Williams, J.), </em>from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A-1\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-16\"><em>Bertrand E.

The plaintiff demurs on the ground that the statute is not available as a defense to an action of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>In a broad sense everything of absolute obligation is a debt. In its ordinary sense debt is substantially synonymous with contract. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>8 Vt. 135, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">A tax is not a debt in the ordinary sense of that term. It does not rest upon contract, either express or implied. It does not carry interest, and is not subject to set-off unless expressly so made by statute. Neither its existence, nor its continuance, depends upon individual will. In short, it bears none of the characteristics of a debt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., 70 </em>Conn. 590, 603, 40 Atl. 465; <em>Sargent &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>67 Conn. 162, 166, 34 Atl. 1028; <em>Lane County </em>v. <em>Oregon, 7 </em>Wall. (U. S.) 71, 81; <em>Camden </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>26 N. J. L. 398; <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>54 Fed. Rep. 426, 4 C. C. A. 408; <em>Philadelphia M. &amp; T. Co. </em>v. <em>Omaha, </em>63 Neb. 280, 283, 88 N. W. 523; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Peckett, </em>26 Vt. 482, 486; Cooley on Taxation (3d Ed.) pp. 17, 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A tax is a public burden imposed by law upon the individual for a public purpose. <em>New London </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>60 Conn. 112, 22 Atl. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The collection of taxes in general depends upon the statutory remedies, and indebitatus assumpsit cannot be maintained for their collection unless expressly authorized by statute. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>156 Fed. Rep. 881, 84 C. C. A. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The primary object of General Statutes, \u00a7 2407\u2014 \u201cAll taxes, properly assessed, shall become a debt due from the person, persons, or corporation, against whom they are respectively assessed,\u201d etc. \u2014 was to provide a simple remedy for the collection of taxes by ordinary action. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Schmitz, </em>58 Conn. 522, 526, 20 Atl. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The statute did not change, nor purport to change, the character of the obligation of a tax; it merely provided another remedy for its collection. \u201cDebt\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>used in this statute in its higher sense of a just demand, rather than in its ordinary sense of an obligation arising out of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The entire argument of the defendant is that the limitation placed upon the \u201caction for an account, or for a debt due by book or to balance book accounts, or upon any simple or implied contract \u201d (General Statutes, \u00a7 1110), must bar this action because it either seeks the collection of a debt or of an obligation resting upon an implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In pointing out the nature of a tax, its dissimilarity to either a debt or an implied contract has been shown. Were this otherwise, and the tax held to be a debt, the statute would have no application. The debt referred to in \u00a7 1110 is \u201ca debt due by book or to balance book accounts.\u201d A debt of this kind has long been known to our law, and to it a tax bears no resemblance. A tax is not a debt due by book or to balance book accounts. By no construction can this statute be properly held to include the obligation of a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">It was within the legislative power to have brought a tax within the statute. The intention so to do should have been clearly manifested in the terms of the statute; for a statute of this nature would have been in derogation not merely of existing law, but of a public policy served by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
