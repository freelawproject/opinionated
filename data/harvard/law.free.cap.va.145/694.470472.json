Properly, the bill of exception or the order granting it should show it, but the practice in this respect has not been uniform. The statute is silent on the subject, but it is plain that what was to \u201cappear in writing\u201d was to appear to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>trial court or judge who was to act on it. The manner of showing this is a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">If the notice was not in fact given, the act of signing the bills of exception was a nullity, and they cannot be considered. It must in some way be made to appear affirmatively that the notice was given, \u201d or was waived, but the manner of showing this fact is not pointed out by the statute. In the case of appeal to this court, where the matter involved is merely pecuniary, it must affirmatively appear that the amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the court, but it has been held that where this does not otherwise appear from the record, it may be shown by affidavits filed in this court. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>112 Va. 134, 70 S. E. 507. By analogy the same rule should be applied to the notice required by the statute. In the instant case it appears from the affidavit of the trial judge, which is in no way questioned, that the notice was given, opposing counsel was present, and the propriety of signing the bills of exception was decided on its merits; and yet we are asked to ignore these facts because not stated in the bills of exception, or the notice and the return thereon were not formally made parts of the record. This would be a sacrifice of substance to form, which is forbidden by section 6331 of the Code. The statute does not require the notice to be made a part of the record, but simply that it shall be made to \u201cappear in writing\u201d to the trial court or judge that the notice was given. If the notice was in fact given, that fact may be established in some satisfactory manner, as by certificate of the trial judge, or by affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">There is a strong array of authority to show that the giving of a notice of this kind is jurisdictional, and that the judge of the trial court is without power to sign the bill, unless it <em>appears from the record </em>that the notice has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>been given. <em>Rareburg </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>18 Kan. 592; <em>Atkinson, &amp;c., R. Co. </em>v. <em>Ditmats </em>(Kan. App.), 42 Pac. 933; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hirschey, </em>5 Wash. 326, 31 Pac. 871; <em>Van Why </em>v. <em>So. Pac. R. Co., 5 </em>Utah 15, 86 Pac. 485; <em>State v. Gowith, </em>19 Mont. 48, 47 Pac. 207; <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>15 Wash. 425, 46 Pac. 650; <em>Farner </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>18 N. M. 237, 135 Pac. 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Onr statute, however, is a section of the Code of 1919, which was a general revision of the entire statute law of the State, and must be construed along with other sections of the Code so as to make them harmonize, if possible. The provision as to giving the notice is substantial and material and cannot be minimized or ignored, but the manner of evidencing this fact, or of making up the record for appeal, is purely formal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The revisors tell us that one of the principal objects of the revision was to secure to every litigant a fair trial on the merits of his case, and as far as possible to subordinate form to substance. In this spirit they inserted in section 6331 the provision that no judgment should be arrested or reversed for any \u201cdefect, imperfection or omission in the record, or for any error committed on the trial where it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d In the revisors\u2019 note to this section it is said: \u201cIt is intended to render it practically impossible for a case to be reversed on any mere technicality, and to allow all judgments to stand when fairly rendered on the merits, if substantial justice has been reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">It would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of this statute to reverse the judgment in the instant case for the formal defect complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">This was an action on an accident insurance policy, issued in 1919, and kept in force by subsequent renewals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>A copy of the policy is filed with the notice of motion for a judgment. The plaintiff also filed a bill of particulars, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">\u201cPlaintiff will claim that the said accident insurance policy, a copy of which is filed with the notice of motion for judgment, was continued in force for twelve months from the 10th day of July, 1923, by virtue of a certain renewal agreement, a copy of which is hereto attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201cCOPY OF RENEWAL AGREEMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cPersonal Accident and Health Renewal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cStandard Accident Insurance Company <em>of Detroit, Michigan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201cId t onsideration of a premium of one hundred fifty and 00-100 dollars, Policy No. 1004 4565 is continued in force for twelve months from noon, standard time, of the 6th day of May, 1923, to noon, standard time, of the 6th day of May, 1924.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cIssued to Henry Scholz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201cThis renewal is issued subject to all of the agreements, conditions and provisions of the said policy, as well as those of any supplementary agreement attached to said policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201c(Not valid unless countersigned by the agent.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201cNo. 876253 C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">\u201cLem W.

The insured died June 25, 1924. The plaintiff claimed, that the renewal premium was not paid until July 10,. 1923, and that such payment continued the policy in force from July 10, 1923, to July 10, 1924. The insurance company defended on the grounds, (1) that the-policy had expired at the time of the death of the assured, and (2) that the death of the assured did not-result from bodily injuries effected directly, exclusively and independently of all other causes, through accidental means, which was the injury insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The policy contained the following <em>\u201cStandard Provisions:\u201d</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cA. (1) This policy includes endorsements and attached paper, if any, and contains the entire contract of insurance except as it may be modified by the company\u2019s classification of risks and premium rates in the event that the insured is injured after having changed his occupation so classified, except ordinary duties about his residence or while engaged in recreation, in which event the company will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in the policy as the premium would have purchased at the rate but within the limits so fixed by the company for such more hazardous occupation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201cIf the law of the State in which the insured resides, at the time this policy is issued requires that prior to its issue a statement of the premium rates and classification of risks pertaining to it shall be filed with the State official having supervision of insurance in such State, then the premium rates and classification of risk mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in this policy shall mean only such as have been last filed by the company in accordance with such law, but if such filing is not required by such law, then they shall mean the company\u2019s premium rates and classification of risks last made effective by it in such State prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the company is liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201cB. (2) No statement made by the applicant for insurance not included herein shall avoid the policy or be used in any legal proceeding hereunder. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions. No change in this policy shall be valid unless approved by an executive officer of the company and such approval be endorsed h\u00e9reon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\u201cC. (3) If default be made in the payment of the agreed premium for this policy, the subsequent acceptance of a premium by the company or by any of its duly authorized agents shall reinstate the policy, but only to \u25a0cover accidental injury thereafter sustained and such sickness as may begin more than ten days after the date of such acceptance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\u201cQ. (20) The insurance under this policy shall not cover any person under the age of eighteen years nor over the age of sixty-five years. Any premium paid to the Company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The policy also provided that \u201cthis policy may be <em>renewed </em>with the consent of the company, and by the payment of the premium, subject, however, to its conditions and limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">About two weeks prior to May 1, 1923, the company sent to its agents at Roanoke, Wellford &amp; Smith, the renewal receipt hereinbefore copied preparatory to the renewal of the policy on the date of its expiration, to-wit, May 6, 1923, but it was not so renewed. About a week or ten days after May 6, 1923, Wellford, of the firm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Wellford &amp; Smith, applied to the insured to renew his policy, and he agreed to renew it in about thirty days, and Wellford agreed that his firm would carry the policy for that period. The premium on the policy had been increased ten dollars since the last renewal and the insured wished some explanation of this fact. Wellford undertook to make the explanation, and on June 22, 1923, sent the renewal receipt to the company, together with a similar receipt for another party, and, after referring to the increase in the premium, said: Please look into this and see if any error has not been made in figuring the premiums on these policies. If so, kindly correct the premiums, if not, please return the renewals, explaining the advance in premiums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On June 26, 1923, the company returned the renewal receipts to Wellford &amp; Smith, explaining the increase of the premiums, and saying: \u201cWe trust that you will have no difficulty in placing the renewals in the hands of the assured.\u201d On July 10,1923, the insured paid the premium of $150.00 to Wellford &amp; Smith, and Wellford says he thinks he then delivered to him the renewal receipt aforesaid. . No question is raised about the payment thereafter of the amount of the premium to the company by Wellford &amp; Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The action being on contract, the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery is dependent upon the proper interpretation of the contract evidenced by the policy and the renewal receipt aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Where.a policy of insurance contains provisions in conflict with statutory provisions of the place of contract, it is well settled that the statute will prevail. <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Daggs, </em>172 U. S. 557, 19 S. Ct. 281, 43 L. Ed. 552; <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>205 U. S. 489, 27 S. Ct. 578, 51 L. Ed. 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">An effort was made in the argument to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the policy in the instant case does not comply with the provisions of section 4315 of the Code, quoted from in the margin, <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but we are of opinion that paragraph A of the \u201cStandard Provisions\u201d hereinbefore quoted is a full compliance with section 4315, and that the policy is to be construed according to its terms, and that \u201cthe premium rates and classifications of risks mentioned in this policy shall mean only such as have been last filed by the company in accordance with such law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">It is not questioned that the rates charged in the renewal receipt accord with the list \u201clast filed by the company with the State Corporation Commission,\u201d but it is insisted that there was no insurance in force from May 6, 1923, till July 10, 1923, when the premium was paid, and that the payment on that date was for insurance for one year from July 10, 1923. It is conceded, however, that if the policy was in force from May 6, 1923, to July 10, 1923, the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The record shows that the defendant made an honest effort to comply with the insurance laws of the State. The renewal receipt was sent to the agents two weeks before May 1, 1923, with a view to a prompt renewal for one year of the policy on date of its expiration, and receipted for the premium for insurance for one year. But the company knew that those renewals were not always made on the dates of expiration, and that when made at later dates it would receive a greater sum for the premium than it was entitled to, hence it provided in its policy that \u201cany premium paid to the company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The parties to the contract were competent to enter into it, and could make any contract not forbidden by law or contrary to public policy. The contract fixed the date of its termination at \u201cnoon, standard time, on the 6th day of May, 1924.\u201d If an excess premium was charged that did not render the policy void, but subjected the company to a penalty under section 4320 of the Code. Neither did the amount of the premium paid fix the duration of the risk. The renewal receipt fixed the duration of the risk. The policy fixed the rate to be charged therefor, and this accorded with the statute. Conceding that the premium exceded the amount which might be lawfully charged, the effect was not to extend the duration of th\u00e9 risk, but to require the company to refund the excess under the terms of the policy which stipulated that \u201cany premium paid to the company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request.\u201d We know of no statute in this State which is inconsistent with and prevails over the terms of this contract. Neither the policy nor any statute provided that the policy should continue in force for a year from the payment of the premium, but the contract evidenced by the renewal receipt fixed the date of expiration, and the policy provided that any excess of premium should be refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">This was not a reinstated policy under clause C of the \u201cStandard Provisions,\u201d but an extension or renewal of the original policy, and reading the policy and renewal receipt together, as component parts of the contract, we find that the company contracted that, in consideration of $150, the policy \u201cwas continued in force for twelve months from noon, standard time, of the 6th day of May, 1923, to noon, standard time of the 6th day of May, 1924,\u201d and that the parties agreed that any premium paid for any period not covered by the policy should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>be refunded by the company, upon request. We can see no reason why the parties might not validly so agree. Their contract was not for any extension of the risk beyond May 6, 1924, but for a refund of the excess premium, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In the case of <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Missouri Casualty Co. </em>(St. Louis Ct. of App.), 179 S. W. 993, and <em>Fallis </em>v. <em>Massachusetts B. &amp; Ins. Co., </em>210 Mo. App. 579, 243 S. W. 217, so much relied on by the plaintiff in error, it does not appear, from the reports of those cases, that the policies contained the provision for refunding excess premiums contained in the policy in the instant ease. They stress the meaning of \u201cmonthly premiums\u201d for a month\u2019s insurance, and other language not found in the policy in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">As we have hereinbefore stated, under the terms of the policy, if a premuim was paid for any period not covered by the policy, the effect was not to extend the period of the risk, but to render the company liable for a refund of the excess. In the instant ease, the period of the risk fixed by the renewal receipt was from May 6, 1923, till May 6, 1924, and if the policy was not in force between May 6, 1923, and July 10, 1923, that time was \u201ca period not covered by this policy\u201d and if an excess premium was charged for the period stipulated for, the effect was to render the company liable to refund the excess, and not to extend the period of the risk. Such was the contract of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">If, however, we are wrong in our construction of the contract, was there any excess premium charged? This depends upon whether the policy of the insured was in effect from May 6, 1923, till July 10, 1923. If it was, then the rate charged and received was not excessive. The only evidence on this subject is the testimony of Warren Wellford and the correspondence between his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>firm and the defendant company, and unless there is contradiction in this evidence, there is no conflict in the evidence on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Wellford was a mere agent for the defendant company, had no interest in the controversy, and, although the assured is dead, Wellford was a competent witness at common law and does not require corroboration under section 6209 of the Code. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Atlantic, &amp;c., Realty Co., </em>129 Va. 494, 106 S. E. 521; <em>Epes </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>135 Va. 80, 115 S. E. 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Wellford testified that his firm of Wellford &amp; Smith received the renewal receipt of the insured prior to May 1, 1923; that about a week or ten days after May 6, 1923, he saw Scholz, the insured, and explained to him why the premium was $150, instead of $140, as theretofore, and Scholz said that he would accept the renewal and pay for it \u201cin about thirty days or about the first of the month\u201d of Tuly, and Wellford agreed to carry the risk for him for that time. Wellford agreed \u201cto reinstate that policy and to give him credit that he asked for. He wanted to retain this particular policy and I told him I would carry it and give him credit.\u201d A new policy and such as was then being issued would have cost him $160. Wellford testified that the company charged his firm with the amount of the receipt; that Scholz became liable to the firm for the amount, and the firm to the company; that he did not at the time surrender the renewal to Scholz because he did not ask for it; that they had a \u201cnumber of customers that rarely ever did get the receipts;\u201d that if Scholz had died before July 10, \u201cI would have had to explain to the company that I was carrying him and I would have settled with the company for his premiums at settling time.\u201d On cross-examination by the plaintiff he testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cQ. If you return the receipt to the company; you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>wouldn\u2019t do that if you had extended a man credit, you would look to him for payment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">\u201cA. No, sir; we would have paid that for him to the company if we were carrying him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cQ. That is your invariable custom, that when the premium is not paid, in order to get credit with your company you send that renewal receipt back and they credit you up with the renewal receipt which they have charged you with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; for those we are not carrying ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cQ. If you were carrying it yourself, it would never go back to the company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201cA. No, sir; we would carry it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The witness then testified that the renewal receipt had never been out of his custody from the time it was received until payment was made on July 10, 1923. The renewal receipt was then presented to the witness bearing the endorsement of the home office of the company, \u201cReceived per Aec. &amp; H. Department June 25, 1923.\u201d This was not satisfactorily explained at tbe time, but the next morning, when the examination of the witness was resumed, he stated that he had looked up his correspondence on the subject, and found that the receipt had been sent to the home office for an <em>explanation </em>of why the premium had been raised. The correspondence consisted of a letter from Wellford &amp; Smith to the home office of the company, dated June 22, 1923, and of the reply thereto. The letter of Wellford &amp; Smith enclosed the Scholz renewal and one other renewal. After describing the renewal receipts, it is said: \u201cPlease look into this and see if any error has not been committed in figuring the premiums on these notices. If so, kindly correct the premiums; if not, please return the renewals, explaining the advance in premiums.\u201d No credit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>asked. The reply from Detroit, Mich,, dated June 26, 1923, gave the explanation asked apd returned the receipts. In concluding the reply it is said: \u201cWe trust that you will have no difficulty in placing the renewals in the hands of the assured.\u201d The letter of Wellford <em>&amp; </em>Smith did not mention the fact that they were carrying the assured, nor did it contain anything to which the words quoted from the company\u2019s letter was a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Wellford further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cQ. State whether or not from the time you had the arrangement with Mr. Scholz to give him credit for this renewal premium, if at any time he had demanded of you the certificate, whether or not, under your agreement with him, you would have delivered the certificate or procured it and delivered it to him, whether premium had then been paid by Mr. Scholz or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; I would have delivered it to Mr. Scholz at the time I called on him if he had demanded it, or any other time, because I had extended him credit and I was responsible for the premium.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">If Scholz had been accidently killed prior to July 10, 1923, would a jury, upon the foregoing evidence, have been justified in finding the defendant liable on the policy sued on? We think it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\"> Insurance policies are prepared by the insurers, and in cases of doubt or uncertainty are construed most strongly against them. Wellford &amp; Smith were agents of the insurer; were provided with policies which they could issue without referring them back to the company, and were also provided with renewal receipts duly executed by the company, and were authorized to collect the amounts Called for by the receipts and to countersign the same. The countersigning was necessary to insure their authenticity, but if the money was actually and duly paid to the agents of the company we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>do not doubt tbe liability of tbe insurer in like manner as if tbe receipt had been duly countersigned. The delivery to tbe agents of the renewal receipts, duly executed, was sufficient evidence of the consent of the company to the renewal of the policy, and if the premium was paid by or for the assured that was a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the policy that \u201cthis policy may be <em>renewed </em>with the consent of the company, and by the payment of the premium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The policy was issued in consideration of a fixed premium and it could make no difference to the company, if the premium were in fact paid, whether it was paid by the assured or by the agent. The policy did not provide that it should not be effective until the premium was actually paid to the company, as some policies do, and the agent was in no default in making payment to the company. The extension of credit, in the manner indicated, did not violate any express provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">A number of eases hold that the cancellation of a debt of the agent to the assured is not a payment within the meaning of the law, where the amount is not paid by the agent to the company' at the time the premium should have been paid. <em>Ferebee </em>v. <em>North Car., </em>&amp;c., <em>Ins. Co., </em>68 N. C. 11; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Germania L. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mont. 532, 39 Pac. 742, Note L. R. A. 1915A, 686. But this is not such a ease. Here there was a continuing personal obligation on the part of the assured to pay the premium to the agent, which was discharged by the assured on July 10, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In <em>Wooddy </em>v. <em>Old Dom. Ins. Co., </em>31 Gratt. (72 Va.) 362, 31 Am. Rep. 732, a policy of fire insurance on a building should have been issued, according to the agreement between the agent of the company and the owner of the building, on April 16, and the building was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>destroyed by fire in tbe early morning of the next day, April 17. \u201cNo policy was ever issued to the appellant by Rowzie or by the company, nor was tbe premium ever paid by the appellant unless the tender aforesaid, coupled with the agreement between the appellant and the company\u2019s agent (Rowzie) amounted to a payment. Rowzie, it seems, has never had any settlement of accounts with the company. It was bis duty, according to the proofs, to make daily and monthly reports of his transactions as agent to his principal.\u201d The circumstances relating to the tender of the premium hereinbefore referred to were that the assured \u201cpulled out his pocket book and took out the money\u201d to pay the premium of $12.50 when the^agent declined toreeeive it, saying he owed the owner more than that for rent and would credit him by that amount. This was held to be a payment of the premium and the company liable. In the course of the opinion it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u201cThe appellant took the money from his pocket and offered it to Rowzie who declined t\u00f3 take it, saying in terms, <em>\u2018I have in my hands </em>money belonging to you for the rent, and will credit you by that amount.\u2019 It seems to me that it would be extremely technical to hold that this was not a payment, when, if instead of retaining the money, which he says he had in his hands belonging to the appellant, he had paid it over to him with one hand and taken it back from him with the other, the law deemed that there would have been payment. In the latter case, the money paid would have become at once the money of the company in the hands of its agent, and so, I think, the money retained by the agent under the arrangement made beeame in like manner the money of the company, the greater part of it, in fact ($9.00), was already in the hands of the company; for, according to Rowzie\u2019s statement (and it is not contradicted) the company owed him that amount, balance on account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Bouton </em>v. <em>Am. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>25 Conn. R. 542, it was decided that an agreement made in good faith between an insurance agent having authority to receive an insurance premium, and the insured, that the agent shall become personally responsible to his principals for the amount of such premium,.and the insured his personal debtor therefor, constitutes a payment of the premium as between the insured and the insurance company. The same principle was affirmed in <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Conn. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>25 Conn. R. 207 [65 Am. Dec. 565].\u201d To the same effect see <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Commercial Ins. Co., </em>2 Dutcher (N. J.) 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In <em>Wytheville Ins. &amp; R. Co. </em>v. <em>Teiger, </em>90 Va. 277, 280, 18 S. E. 195, 196, it is said in an opinion by Lewis, P.: \u201cMoreover, it is fair to infer from the fact of giving credit in the present case, and the custom of these agents, to remit to the company only once or twice a month, and sometimes not oftener than once in two months; that they were in the habit of delivering policies on credit, and this was known and assented to by the company. <em>Labarno Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hoover, </em>113 Pa. St. 591, 8A. 163, 57 Am. Rep. 511; <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>96 U. S. 234, 24 L. Ed. 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\u201cIt would seem, also, from what was brought out in the cross-examination of the vice-president of the company as a witness in the case, although he does not say so in so many words, that the practice of the company was to charge its agents personally with the premiums on policies sent to them. He says they still owe for a number of policies, some of which have expired. And if they were, in fact, charged with the premiums on the plaintiff\u2019s policy when the policy was signed, then, as between the plaintiff and the company, the premium was paid when the policy was delivered; for <em>the rule is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>well settled that where the agent gives credit and the amount is charged to him by the insurer, the transaction is equivalent to a payment. Miller </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>12 Wall. 285, 20 L. Ed. 398; <em>White </em>v. <em>Conn. Ins. Co., </em>120 Mass. 330; <em>Train </em>v. <em>Holland Ins. Co., </em>62 N. Y. 598; <em>Bang </em>v. <em>Farmville Ins. Co., </em>1 Hughes 290 [Fed. Cas. No. 838]. (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In <em>Homestead Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ison, </em>110 Va. 18, 65 S. E. 463, the court thus states the facts and its conclusions thereon as to the payment of the premium: \u201cIt is contended by the insurance company that the policy never became effective, because the premium was never paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\u201cThis position is not sound. The record shows that the Appalachia Insurance Agency, composed of Brooks &amp; Sparks, were general agents of the defendant company, with blank policies signed by the president and secretary of the company in their hands to be delivered by them to applicants for insurance. They had full authority to deliver policies, collect premiums and make rates. The policy in this case receipts the payment of the premium, forty-eight dollars, and recites that it was issued in consideration of that premium; and further shows on its face that as between the company and the Appalachia Agency the premium in question was considered as fully paid. The plaintiff testified that when the agent delivered the policy to him he offered to pay him the whole amount in money, and was told that if he would pay two dollars and some potatoes, and settle an account he had against the agent on his books it would be sufficient, and that he (the agent) would trade out the balance with him, or call on him later if he needed more money. The agent says that he asked the plaintiff for five dollars; that the latter gave him two- and-a-half dollars, and said he was going to Kentucky to see about some money and would settle in full when he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>turned; and lie told him that would be all right and delivered the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\u201cThe defendant was bound, in either view of the transaction. The company having given its agent full power to collect the premium, and having treated the premium as paid, cannot now call in question the transaction of its agent in extending credit to the insured for a part of the premium. The policy in this ease contains no condition that it shall not be effective unless the premium be paid, and nothing to show that the payment of the premium in money is a prerequisite to the taking effect of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\u201cAn agent who has power to countersign and deliver policies and who is responsible to the company for the premiums and their collection on all policies issued by him, binds the company by an agreement to extend credit to the insured. A valid payment may be made in other ways than in cash, if there has been an assent thereto by the insurer or its agent. 39 Cye. 605, 606.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The court then quotes from and approves the opinions in <em>Wooddy </em>v. <em>Old Dom. Ins. Co., supra, </em>and <em>Wytheville Ins. &amp; B. Co. </em>v. <em>Teiger, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In <em>Squiers </em>v. <em>Hanover Fire Ins. Co., </em>162 N. Y. 552, 57 N. E. 93, 76 Am. St. Rep. 349, it was held that where insurance agents authorized \u2018to countersign, issue and renew policies of insurance\u2019 agree orally to continue an existing contract of insurance and issue a renewal of policy therefor, the insurer is bound, although credit was given for renewed premium. In the course of the opinion it was said: \u201cThe oral contract is the ordinary and usual agreement which an insurance agent makes on the eve of the policy expiring that he will renew it. The question in this case is not whether the agent can enter into a parol contract of insurance that will bind the principal, but rather having agreed orally to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>an existing contract of insurance and issue a renewal or policy therefor the company is bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\u201cThis court considered the question in <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Albany City Fire Ins. Co., </em>50 N. Y. 402, 10 Am. Rep. 495, and held the parol contract valid. In a later case <em>(Angell </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>59 N. Y. 171, 17 Am. Rep. 322) the authority cited was followed, and it was further held that the payment of the premium at the time of the oral agreement is not necessary to make the contract binding on the company; if a credit be given by the agent it is equally obligatory. <em>Trustees, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., </em>19 N. Y. 305; <em>Audubon </em>v. <em>Excelsior Ins. Co., </em>27 N. Y. 216.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In the instant case Wellford &amp; Smith had the power to countersign, renew and issue the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Notwithstanding what is said in some of the cases quoted, it is not necessary to decide, and we go no further than to hold that, where not forbidden by the policy, an agent may make a valid contract with an assured to carry the risk for him for a designated time.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Assignments of error three and four relate to the following questions propounded to the witness, Wellford, and his answers thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cQ. I will ask it in this way. If during the time that you agreed to give him credit, Mr. Scholz had died, would he not, under your agreement with him, have been protected, or would he, or not, have been protected?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Wellford, state whether or not in a great many instances you carry insurance for your customers for two or three or more months during all of which time under your agreement and under authority from the company they are protected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Undoubtedly, the first question was an improper question to be asked on an examination in chief, and if it had been asked in chief would have necessitated a reversal of the case on the authority of <em>Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hairston, </em>108 Va. 846, 62 S. E. 1057, 128 Am. St. Rep. 989. But it was not asked in chief, but on re-examination after a most protracted cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff in which he went into all the circumstances relating to the renewal receipt, and asked the opinion of the witness on different phases of the ease, amongst others: \u201cSuppose he had died between those dates,\u201d and \u201cIf he had died in the meantime, he could not have a legal demand on the company without your aid, could he?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">None of these matters had been brought out on the examination in chief of the witness by counsel for defendant, and at an early stage of the cross-examination when the witness was asked: \u201cUntil he had the renewal receipt countersigned by you, it was not under its own terms, operative, was it?\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected to the question and any answer thereto, but his objection was over-ruled, and the witness answered: \u201cThe policy, in my opinion, from the sixth day of May, from the time I called on Mr. Scholz in person, then I reinstated the policy back for him and I became then liable for the premium, I mean my firm did.\u201d On further cross-examination the witness testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cQ. Now, then, if you became liable to the company, or your firm became liable to the company, for the premium, Mr. Scholz in turn was liable to you, and, of course, you gave him then his renewal certificate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\u201cA. I would have given it to him if he had asked for it. I don\u2019t know that I did give it to him. I don\u2019t think I did. but I would have done so if he had asked me for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201cQ. Why didn\u2019t you mail it to him, if you extended him credit and wanted to make his policy operative, which could not be done until he had that renewal certificate countersigned by you. Why didn\u2019t you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t ask for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cQ. Suppose <em>he had died between those </em>dates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cA. It would have been paid for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cQ. By his own death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u201cA. No, sir; it would have been paid for by the company\u2019s money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">\u201cQ. What evidence did he have to that effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201cA. He had the same evidence I had from him. I told him I would extend him credit. He had my word for it, and I had his word that he was going to pay it on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">Hi \u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">\u201cQ. And not until that date, the 10th of July, did you give him this renewal certificate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-14\">\u201cQ. If he had died in the meantime, he could not have had a legal demand on the company without your aid, could he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\">\u201cA. No, sir; I would have had to explain to the company that I was carrying him and I would have settled with the company for his premium at the settling date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-16\">Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi H?

Not always. We have a number of customers that rarely ever get the receipts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\u201cQ. Suppose it is not paid to you, what do you do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201cA. Return it to the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cQ. Then you get credit when you return it to the company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cQ. If you return the receipt to the company\u2014-you wouldn\u2019t do that if you had extended a man credit, you would look to him for payment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cA. No, sir; we would have that for him to the company, if we were carrying him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201cQ. That is your invariable custom; that when the premium is not paid, in order to get credit with your company you send that renewal receipt back and they credit you up with the renewal receipt which they have charged you with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; for those that we are not carrying ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">\u201cQ. If you were carrying it yourselves it would never go back to the company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">\u201cA. No, sir; we would carry it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">The first question objected to, therefore, and the answer thereto was a mere reiteration of what had been elicited on the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">The second question above objected to was also asked on re-examination after the cross-examination above recited, and after the witness had' further testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201cQ. If it (renewal receipt) was out of your possession of course Mr. Scholz would never have had any protection, would he ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-16\">\u201cA.

E. 551, it was held: \u201cWhere a party objecting to evidence admitted had previously elicited the same evidence from the witness on cross-examination, the error, if any, is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>137 Va. 726, 120 S. E. 146, it is said: \u201cIt is well settled and obviously a sound general rule that an objection to evidence cannot be availed of by a party who has, at some other time during the trial, voluntarily elicited the same evidence, or has permitted it to be brought out by his adversary without objection. The rule finds its most frequent application in cases where the party making the objection afterwards introduces the same evidence, but it is properly and logically applicable in any case, regardless of the order of introduction, if the party who has brought out the evidence in question, or who has permitted it to be brought out, can be fairly held responsible for its presence in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">See also <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Ristine, </em>138 Va. 273, 122 S.
