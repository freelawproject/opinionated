The complaint demands judgment for said sum of $1,854.25, with interest from the said 9th day of December, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The answer among other things alleges that neither the contract set forth in the complaint, nor any note or memorandum thereof expressing the consideration, was in writing, subscribed by the testatrix or by her lawfully authorized agent. It appeared at the trial that the plaintiff stored most of her furniture and removed ths balance thereof to the residence of the decedent, and that she and the members of her household took up their residence in the home of the deceased, and resided there for a period of 12 weeks; the plaintiff in the meantime taking care of the testatrix and conducting her household affairs. The trial justice held that the alleged contract by the testatrix to give the plaintiff the house and furniture had not been established by satisfactory evidence, but he awarded the plaintiff $180, being $15 a week for the 12 weeks, as the reasonable value of her services, besides interest thereon from December 9, 1905, amounting in all to $288.15. The plaintiff appeals from this judgment in her favor, and claims that she is entitled to recover the sum of $1,854.25, the value of the house and furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Without reference to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the plaintiff\u2019s alleged oral contract, it is clear that she cannot prevail on this appeal. The action is at law, and not in equity. The contract to make compensation in real estate, not being in writing, is void under the statute of frauds, and, whatever relief might be granted the plaintiff in an action in equity, the court is powerless to grant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>lief in this action beyond what the trial justice has already granted. Real Property Law (Consol. Laws, c. 50) \u00a7\u00a7 259, 270; Banta v. Banta, 108 App. Div. 172, 93 N. Y. Supp. 393; Ludwig v. Bungart, 48 App. Div. 613, 63 N. Y. Supp. 91; Matthews v. Matthews, 133 N. Y. 679, 31 N. E. 519; S. C., 80 Hun, 605, 30 N. Y. Supp. 449; Stanton v. Miller, 14 Hun, 383, affirmed 79 N. Y. 620. The trial justice therefore awarded the plaintiff the most favorable judgment to which, under the pleadings and evidence, she was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Nothing decided by this court on the appeal from the order\"striking out certain portions of the complaint as irrelevant (157 App. Div. 100,141 N. Y. Supp. 574) sustains the plaintiff\u2019s position on this appeal. The answer had not then been served. The question of the statute of frauds had not been raised, and was not and could not be before the court in any form whatever. Where the invalidity of a contract void under the statute of frauds does not appear on the face of the complaint the question of such invalidity can onfy be raised by answer. Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y. 379, 34 N. E. 911; Matthews v. Matthews, 154 N. Y. 288, 48 N. E. 531. The court on that appeal was not at liberty to anticipate the nature of the answer, and therefore naturally and properly disposed of the appeal solely with reference to the complaint, and without any reference whatever to a question which might or might not be raised by an answer not yet served.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur, except HOWARD, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
