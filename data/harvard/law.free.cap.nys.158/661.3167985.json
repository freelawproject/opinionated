It has been repeatedly held that a defendant, applying to a court for an order opening his default, must \u00a7how as a condition precedent to granting of the relief facts establishing a meritorious defense, and an affidavit of merits alone is not sufficient. Heischober v. Polishook, 152 App. Div. 193, 195, 136 N. Y. Supp. 567; Clews v. Peper, 112 App. Div. 430, 98 N. Y. Supp. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">The_ favor of the court should be extended upon proper terms when the litigant, who has a meritorious cause of action or defense, has through inadvertence or neglect lost his right to have his day in court. The favor should be withheld when it is not shown that there is a meritorious controversy, for the courts should not be burdened with unfounded claims to relief, nor should a just cause be delayed by the interposition of an unwarranted defense. Insistence on the observance of the rule makes for the orderly administration of justice, and is not the enforcement of a mere technical rule of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, the motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to a renewal of the motion upon proper papers and on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
