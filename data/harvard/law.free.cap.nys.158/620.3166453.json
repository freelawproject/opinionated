On or about November 10, 1915, defendant submitted a proposed order for entry on the motion, and served a copy of such proposed order on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and the latter submitted a form of order resettling the case, which was signed by the court and entered November 15th. A copy of this order, with notice of entry, was served, by plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the defendant\u2019s attorney December 3, 1915. Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal from the order of November 15th was not served until January 18, 1916, several days after the time limited by statute, and on the day following the service the notice was returned to the defendant\u2019s attorney. Plaintiff, however, failed to pay the costs of the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court, and as, for that reason, all proceedings on his part were stayed (Code, \u00a7 779), defendant contends that the service by plaintiff\u2019s attorney of the order resettling the case was a nullity, and that therefore the notice of appeal was served in due time.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">It is undisputed that because of the nonpayment of the costs awarded by the Appellate Term all plaintiff\u2019s proceedings were stayed. The stay, however, did not render any subsequent proceedings taken by the plaintiff void, but merely made them irregular (Wessels v. Boettcher, 142 N. Y. 212, 36 N. E. 883), and within the express terms of the Code provision the defendant at its election could waive the irregularity. The motion to resettle the case was a proceeding brought on by the defendant, not by the plaintiff. No objection to the service by plaintiff of the order entered on defendant\u2019s motion resettling the case was made by defendant\u2019s attorney; on the contrary, the order was not only received and retained on December 3, 1915, but on December 21st defendant moved to resettle that order, and on the denial of this last motion, and the entry of the order thereupon January 11, 1916, defendant\u2019s attorney on January 18, 1916, appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>order of January 11th, and also served the notice of appeal from the order of November 15th.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">It is apparent, therefore, even assuming that the service by plaintiff of the order entered on defendant\u2019s motion was a progressive step taken by plaintiff in the action (see Allen v. Becket [Sup.] 84 N. Y. Supp. 1011), that the irregularity constituted by such service was waived by the subsequent proceedings of the defendant based upon the entry and service of that order upon its attorney (Allen v. Becket [Sup.] 85 N. Y. Supp. 192; Reeder v. Lockwood, 30 Misc. Rep. 531, 62 N. Y. Supp. 713). It follows that the motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of the City Court dated November 15, 1915, resettling the case on appeal herein, must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> With regard to that portion of plaintiff\u2019s motion which asks for the dismissal of defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of the City Court entered January 11, 1916, denying defendant\u2019s motion to resettle the order of November 15th, that part of the motion must be denied, for the reason that such order is appealable, and it appears that the notice of appeal therefrom was served in due time.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Motion to dismiss appeal from order of November 15, 1915, resettling case, granted, and appeal dismissed with $10 costs; motion to dismiss appeal from order denying motion to resettle order of November 15, 1915, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
