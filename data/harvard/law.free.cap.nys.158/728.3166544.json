R, until the pupil is competent to comply with the rules of the International Aeronautical Federation for an aviator's certificate.\u201d The plaintiff paid the $300 and began taking lessons under an instructor furnished by defendant. The lessons were discontinued for the winter in December, 1914, and resumed in June, 1915. The plaintiff took about 25 lessons in all; the last one, as he testifies, being on July 29, 1915. Plaintiff claims that about this time the machine upon which he had been receiving instruction was wrecked, and that thereafter he received no more lessons.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\"><bracketnum>[1 j</bracketnum> The contract contained no time limit, and defendant was obligated thereby to give plaintiff a sufficient number of lessons until plaintiff became competent, etc. Neither was the plaintiff limited in time in which to receive the lessons, so that the question is whether or not the defendant refused to perform on its part within a reasonable time after demand therefor made by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The court below found that \u201cthe defendant has delayed an unreasonable time in the performance of its contract,\u201d and gave judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount paid by him to defendant for instruction, and in addition thereto plaintiff\u2019s expenses from Seattle, Wash., his place of residence, to Garden City. Clearly there is no foundation for the allowance of this last item. There is no claim that plaintiff was induced to seek the defendant\u2019s school by any false representations, and payment of plaintiff\u2019s traveling expenses from his residence to defendant\u2019s school is not a proper element of damages for a breach of its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I am also of the opinion that the plaintiff failed to prove any breach of contract on the part of defendant. It appears that the plaintiff in December voluntarily ceased taking lessons and worked in defendant\u2019s factory at wages, until he again resumed lessons in June, 1915. He admits that after he took his last lesson on July 29, 1915, although the particular machine upon which he had been taking lessons, called by him the \u201cschool machine,\u201d was broken, the defendant had another machine running \u201cin fine shape,\u201d but that he never asked for a lesson to be given him on that machine, and was never told that he could receive lessons thereon; his reason being that \u201cI did not want lessons on that machine.\u201d He also testified that, although he was- frequently at the field where lessons were given, he did not make himself known to any person there, or ask for lqssons. On November 22, 1915, plaintiff was notified by letter from defendant that he (plaintiff) had received 27 lessons and that he was entitled to 33 more, and that the defendant was ready to give those \u201cat any time, weather conditions permitting.\u201d Plaintiff says he visited defendant\u2019s school several times after the receipt of this letter, and says that they had no machine there. This evidently refers to what he termed the \u201cschool machine,\u201d as it is not disputed that the defendant had a high power machine there, and, as before stated, plaintiff did not ask for nor was instruction refused him upon that machine. For all that now appears in the record the defendant was and has been ready ever since July 29, 1915, to give-plaintiff lessons at any time he might within reason apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
