He was not merely there to take orders from the charterer, but for the purpose of care of the property and to relieve the charterer from responsibility. The master\u2019s agency was set forth with unusual particularity in the owner\u2019s agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-14\">\u201cWe will furnish a captain for each scow at our own expense, who will be under your control and orders, but you are not to be responsible for the acts of any captain in the care, movement, or navigation of said scows, and we will save you harmless, and defend you from any claims, actions, or suits arising therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> Replevin, however, not only requires possession, but an exclusive right to possess and control the property. Rogers v. Arnold, 12 Wend. 30. Paragraph 4 of the answer (which plaintiff moved to have struck out as sham, frivolous, and irrelevant) has the material averment that defendant had so \u201cfurnished and placed in charge of said boat a captain who remained1 on said vessel.\u201d While this is accompanied with argumentative matter as to the legal effect of the captain\u2019s presence, the paragraph is not for that reason to be stricken out. Town of Essex v. N. Y. &amp; Canada R. R. Co., 8 Hun, 361. Obviously, too, on such pleadings, plaintiff should not have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
