It was there that plaintiff\u2019s assignors resided and rendered the services sued for. We have to consider the county where the cause of action arose (Jacina v. Lemmi, 155 App. Div. 397, 139 N. Y. Supp. 1034), rather than the convenience of a plaintiff suing upon an assigned claim (Belden v. Schapiro, 138 App. Div. 669, 123 N. Y. Supp. 53). Plaintiff\u2019s opposing affidavits array 10 witnesses, mostly cumulative, for the purpose of showing that defendant was trustee under the agreement of April 24, 1914, and acted as such. But this agreement does not appear to be disputed, and plaintiff\u2019s acts under it may apparently be proved by witnesses in New-burgh, without cumulative testimony from New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant, to abide the event, and defendant\u2019s motion granted to change the place of trial to Orange county.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
