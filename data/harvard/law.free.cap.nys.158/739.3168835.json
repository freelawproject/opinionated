This pile of lumber constituted a nuisance. Lawton v. Olmstead, 40 App. Div. 544, 58 N. Y. Supp. 36; Place v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 157 App. Div. 24, 141 N. Y. Supp. 970. It is true that defendant was a contractor for a work of public improvement, and that he probably intended to use the lumber in his work; but he had received no permit to place the lumber where he did place it, nor does it appear that any necessity of the work required that it should be so placed and kept for several days. The plaintiff was lawfully using the sidewalk, and the evidence made out a prima facie case of liability against the defendant. Whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the child or its mother was for the jury under proper instructions. We certainly cannot say that such negligence appeared from the evidence as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
