While employed as an operator of <em>a </em>staying machine in the factory of the appellant her \u201cfinger slipped and was caught under head of stayer\u201d; the result being that the end of the second finger of her right hand was \u201csqueezed off.\u201d This happened October 26, 1914. On November 9th following, just 14 days afterward, she returned to work. Before the accident she received $1.25 a day; after the accident she was paid $5 a week, and this wage was to continue until she recovered sufficiently to do her \u201cregular work.\u201d She did not go to a hospital, but was treated at home. In the conclusions of fact the Commission has found that \u201cher fingers slipped and were caught between the anvil and the head of the staying machine, requiring the amputation of the tip of the bone of the second finger of the right hand.\u201d But the Commission, by the expression \u201crequiring the amputation of the tip of the bone,\u201d must have referred to the amputation by the machine, rather than any amputation executed by a surgeon\u2019s knife, for there is no evidence in the record of any surgical amputation. In fact, the opposite is in the record, for the attending physician, in reply to the question, \u201cDescribe the treatment,\u201d answered \u201cNone.\u201d In describing the nature and extent, of the injury the physician says: \u201cLoss of tip of second finger of right hand.\u201d That this description does not minimize the injury is fully confirmed by the X-ray photograph, for it is only by careful examination of the picture that any injury at all can be discovered; and, even after the injury is located, it is perfectly apparent that only the merest shaving of bone is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The Commission has determined that the case came within subdivision 3 of section 15 of the Compensation Law, which provides that the loss of the first phalange of the finger is considered to be equal to the loss of one-half of the finger, and has awarded compensation for 15 weeks; that is, the Commission had held that the loss of this slight particle of bone is equivalent to the loss of the first phalange, and therefore to the loss of one-half of the finger. The Matter of Petrie, 165 App. Div. 561, 151 N. Y. Supp. 307, affirmed in 215 N. Y. 335, 109 N. E. 549, is relied upon to sustain this determination. We do not think that the opinion of this court in the Petrie Case, nor that of the Court of Appeals, warrants the position assumed or the award made by the Commission in this case. In the Petrie Case the Commission found as a fact that the claimant\u2019s injury resulted in \u201cthe amputation of the third finger on the right hand near the first joint\u201d; also that \u201cin the amputation of the third finger about one-third of the bone of the distal phalange was cut off.\u201d In this case the finding is that there was an \u201camputation of the tip of the bone.\u201d The findings of the Commission in the Petrie Case, together with the evidence, convinced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the Court of Appeals, and convinced this court, that \u201csubstantially all of the phalange was cut off.\u201d Assuming, then, as both courts did, that substantially all of the first bone of the finger was destroyed, it was held that the injury amounted to the same as a complete loss of the bone. But both courts held that a loss of some portion of the end of the finger might be so insignificant as not to amount to the loss of the entire phalange. On this subject the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-3\">\u201cIt very likely may be that the loss might be of such a minor portion of the phalange that an award could not be sustained under the clauses which have been quoted as for a loss of the entire phalange.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">And to the same effect this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cOf course, a mere pinching of the finger, which does not result in a permanent injury, is not to be construed as the loss of half a finger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The Court of Appeals, as well as this court, in disposing of the questions arising under the \"Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, has announced a policy of liberal interpretation. But a liberal interpretation should not go to the extent of becoming an absurd interpretation. It could not have been the purpose of the Legislature to enact that a loss of a fraction of the first phalange, so slight as to be scarcely perceptible to the naked eye, should be equivalent to the loss of half the finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The last clause of subdivision 3 of section 15, and subdivision 4 of that section, provide that in all cases, either of permanent partial disability or of temporary partial disability, not otherwise specifically provided for in section 15, the compensation shall he 66% per centum of the difference between the average weekly wages of the injured employ\u00e9 and his wage-earning capacity after the accident; this compensation to continue during the disability, subject to certain conditions and limitations. It is under either one or the other of these provisions, according as the Commission may determine the facts, that we think the claim should be disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Therefore we conclude that the award should be set aside and the claim remitted to the Commission for further consideration. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
