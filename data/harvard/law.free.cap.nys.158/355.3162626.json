If it be a contract to guarantee the payment by the debtor for goods thereafter to be bought, then, tire guarantor haying invited the seller to act and part with his property on the credit of the guaranty, the words of the guaranty must be given the meaning which the creditor would naturally attach to them. Rindge v. Judson, 24 N. Y. 64. The contract of guaranty, omitting the addresses of the parties and its formal beginning, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201cI guarantee Mr. E. Herman\u2019s account to the amount of $25, and am liable for it if he does not pay for any merchandise taken on credit from Leyenson &amp; Arison. M. Lindenbaum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The meaning of a paper like this may depend on circumstances within the knowledge of the parties when it was given and accepted. All we learn from the meager statement of facts is that after November <em>7, </em>1910, which was the date the guaranty was given, Mr. E. Herman and Leyenson &amp; Arison started in and continued to do business for about four years, and that during such time Leyenson &amp; Arison sold to Herman goods aggregating hundreds of dollars worth; that more than $25 was paid thereon by Herman, and that the sum claimed\u2014\u25a0 i. e., $22.88\u2014is the last balance that is due. We learn from this statement that the business relations between Herman and Leyenson &amp; Arison began after the guaranty was given. This we get from the words of the stipulation of facts, that they \u201cstarted in\u201d after November 7th. The Herman account was not therefore in existence at the date of the guaranty, and the guaranty was, therefore, of an \u201caccount\u201d for any merchandise taken on credit. And this must mean taken thereafter on credit. In view of the fact, ascertained by reading the words of the guaranty in the light of the circumstances stated in the stipulation, that the guaranty was for the future, I think the natural meaning is that it is a continuing guaranty. The word \u201caccount\u201d imports that. That would be a word used for the result of a continuous course of dealings. So one would say an account at the grocer\u2019s, the butcher\u2019s, or the baker\u2019s, and the word would convey the meaning of a continuous course of dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">The fact that $25 is the limit of the guarantor\u2019s liability, and not of Herman\u2019s credit, is also shown by the words of the instrument. The guaranty reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">\u201cI guarantee Mr. E. Herman\u2019s account to the amount of $25, and am liable for it [i. e., for $25] if he does not pay for any merchandise taken on credit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The guaranty being for future dealing, being continuous, and the $25 being the limit of the guarantor\u2019s liability, and not of the credit to be given to Herman, it follows that the judgment should have been for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Judgment reversed, with $30 costs, and judgment directed for plaintiffs for $22.88, with interest from October 22, 1914, with appropriate costs below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
