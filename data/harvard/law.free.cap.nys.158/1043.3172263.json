From an order sustaining plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to a separate defense, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AfmX\">Reversed, and demurrer overruled.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1065-15\">Defendant employed plaintiff as a machinist in its Brooklyn plant. The complaint stated that about November 16, 1915, while plaintiff was engaged about a friction saw used for cutting metal beams, one of the boxes upon the shaft suddenly broke, letting the revolving saw fall down and strike its bed, by which it broke into fragments, so that the guard on the machine flew off and struck plaintiff on the head, causing him great pain and anguish; \u201cthat said blow upon plaintiff\u2019s head injured his left ear so that he has been rendered totally deaf in that ear, and has thus been permanently injured,\u2019\u2019 to his damage 85,000. Plaintiff made various charges of fault against defendant, denying any contributory negligence, and averred service of a notice under the Employers\u2019 Liability Act (Consol. Laws, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204). After various denials, the answer pleaded as a separate defense that defendant conducted the business of the manufacture and assembly of structural iron and steel, and at all said times plaintiff was an employe of defendant engaged in that business; that defendant had complied with all the provisions of chapter 67 of tile Consolidated Laws of the state of New' York for securing payment of compensation to any and all its injured employ\u00e9s. The plaintiff demurred to this separate defense on the ground that the same was insufficient in law on its face. The Special Term sustained this demurrer, from which order defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1065-16\">Argued before ]ENKS, P.

Such liability for compensation is declared to be \u201cexclusive,\u201d unless the employer fails to secure the statutory compensation as provided under section 50, when the injured employ\u00e9 \u201cmay, at his option, elect to claim compensation under this chapter, or to maintain an action in the courts for damages on account of such injury\u201d (section 11). The ordinary tort rule of \u201cno liability without fault\u201d sufficed for the earlier and simpler relations of employment. But the increasing loss of life and limb in modern industrialism enabled us slowly to grasp the humane idea of liability merely from the nature of the work. As the perils of a seaman\u2019s life give him the right to \u25a0cure and maintenance at the expense of the ship (The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, 23 Sup. Ct. 483, 47 L. Ed. 760), so the employer in the specified trades, as an incident of his enterprise, must compensate his workmen for their injuries in the employment. The prior right to \u25a0sue gives place to this substitute, to be administered without the expense, uncertainties, and delay of litigation, involving the risk of defeat if unable to make out actionable negligence. This new remedy is constitutional. Matter of Jensen v. Southern Pacific Co., 215 N. Y. 514, 109 N. E. 600, L. R. A. 1916A, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The point of the demurrer, therefore, is whether this statute affords compensation for an accidental personal injury sustained by the employ\u00e9 in the course of his employment which results in permanent total deafness in one ear. Section 15 establishes a schedule of \u25a0compensation in terms of the average weekly wages for different classes of injuries, viz.: (1) Cases of total permanent disability; (2) temporary total disability; (3) permanent partial disability; and (4) temporary partial disability. Under the class of permanent partial disability are enumerated losses of different bodily members, with a scale of compensation measured by wages, varying according to the degree of injury and deprivation. Then follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-6\"><em>\u201cOther Oases. </em>In all other cases in this class of disability [i. e., permanent partial disability], the compensation shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the difference between his average weekly wages and his wage-earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or otherwise, payable during the continuance of such partial disability, but subject to reconsideration of the degree of such impairment by the commission on its own motion or upon application of any party in interest.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">The employer, or his insurer, is to provide compensation for all personal injuries that involve permanent or temporary disability, whether total or partial. The particular injuries set out in the schedule .are merely examples to aid in administering the statute. The enumeration does not profess toi be exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The jurisdiction to construe tire Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law ordinarily is exercised through appeals from the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (section 23). Nevertheless it arises .here incidentally. On these pleadings, we cannot hold that tire injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>sued for is excluded from the terms of that statute. Hence, on demurrer, this defense is not on its face insufficient. Shinnick v. Clover Farms Co., 169 App. Div. 236, 154 N. Y. Supp. 423, relied on below, was where a horse had bitten an employe\u2019s ear, causing a part to be amputated. Although this left a disfigurement, it did not impair the injured person\u2019s efficiency, and therefore his injury did not come in the class of scheduled disabilities. However, total deafness, the gravamen of this complaint, obviously impairs plaintiff\u2019s industrial efficiency. The amount and extent of this disability, as gouged by the wage-earning capacity, could be ascertained in like manner as other disabilities which now are being compensated by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer overruled, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
