It could not be held as matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in boarding a crowded car. Cattano v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., 173 N. Y. 566, 66 N. E. 563. The question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was therefore one for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There was also sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the question of defendant\u2019s negligence, viz., whether the pushing against plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tiff by other passengers was caused by the effort of the conductor to collect fares, in doing which he \u201cpushed with his hands.\u201d Leher v. Steinway Co., 118 N. Y. 556, 23 N. E. 889; Cattano v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., supra. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to both of these issues was corroborated by the testimony of a disinterested witness. The learned court, therefore, erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event.
