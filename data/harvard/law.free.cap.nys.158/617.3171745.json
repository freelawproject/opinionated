The defendants appealed to the Appellate Division from this order, and the order of the Special Term was affirmed. The plaintiff contends that costs should be taxed in his favor as though he had pursued the old complicated process of bringing the demurrer on for argument, instead of the simplest and latest process, as provided in section 976. On a motion for a retaxation of costs the Special Term has held against him on this contention, and he appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">The Special Term was unquestionably right. The whole trend of modern thought and legislation is to simplify the practice of the law.. The original method provided in the Code for bringing on a demurrer for trial was cumbersome, expensive, and dilatory. It has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>antiquated, and will very soon be abandoned altoge'ther. As Judge Miller, sitting in the First Department, said, in comparing the old method of bringing on a demurrer with the practice under section 547 of the Code, in National Park Bank v. Billings, 144 App. Div. 536, 129 N. Y. Supp. 846:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201cNaturally most practitioners chose the simpler, quicker, and less expensive method.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">And naturally now they choose, as the plaintiff did here, the simplest and least expensive method. It was to avoid red tape, roundabout routes, and useless expense that the Legislature provided (first in 1908 and then in 1909) these two simple, expeditious, and inexpensive methods of bringing a demurrer before the court for trial and determination. We would be blocking the wheels of progress and traveling backwards were we to cumber this direct road to justice by requiring litigants to pay the same tolls as are exacted from those who travel the ancient road. We are not disposed to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">This demurrer was brought on as a contested motion; that is, became a contested motion. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney stood up at the Special Term among other attorneys who were arguing contested motions and presented his matter in the same way that they did then-matters. The motion was disposed of by an order. An appeal to the Appellate Division was taken from this order, and was affirmed by this court. It follows that the plaintiff was entitled to $10 costs of motion at the Special Term, and $10 on an affirmance of the order in the Appellate Division, but to no other costs. He is, of course, entitled to his disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Therefore the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
