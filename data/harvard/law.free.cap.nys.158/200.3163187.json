At the time he was engaged in delivering a load of coal, and, having raised the front part of the wagon body by means of the crank handle, had lowered it slightly, whereupon a \u201cdog\u201d attached to the wheel which plaintiff had been turning, and which had apparently engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>in the \"cogs\u201d of the adjacent wheel (thus insuring the immobility of the body of the wagon), suddenly jumped out of the cogs, thereby causing the crank handle to slip from plaintiff\u2019s hand and to reverse and rotate, striking him on the head and causing the injuries for which he has recovered damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that the mechanism of the wagon was defective, in that the \u201cdog\u201d had been worn and shortened by use and become unsafe, as it slipped and failed to keep its place in the cogs, thus leaving the loaded wagon liable to suddenly fall unless the driver continually kept his hold upon the crank handle; that he notified the defendant\u2019s yard foreman of its condition on the day preceding the accident and was told to take it to the blacksmith employed by defendant who had a shop in its yard; that plaintiff did so, informed the blacksmith of its condition, left the wagon with him, and was told to return for it after dinner, at which time he saw the \u201cdog\u201d had been fixed, by repairing and lengthening it; that he asked why a new one had not been put in, but was told by the blacksmith \u201cit was all right, it had been fixed\u201d; that it looked safe to him, so he took the wagon out and made two deliveries that afternoon, but the accident happened on the first trip the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The only question in the case which requires consideration necessitates the reversal of the judgment herein. Dr. Stafford B. Smith had been called as a witness for the defense on the question of the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. After he had been cross-examined for some time, he was asked, \u201cQ. You are the physician for the insuring company in this case?\u201d and answered, \u201cI am for Mr. Menkel\u201d (defendant\u2019s attorney). The latter then moved to withdraw a juror, which was denied by the court, whereupon he duly excepted. This motion should have been granted, and its refusal constituted error calling for a reversal The courts have repeatedly censured the putting of questions which suggest-to the minds of the jurors that defendant was insured in a casualty company, and have reversed judgments and granted new trials on that ground alone.

Supp. 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It is quite true that some of these cases were decided before the amendment to section 1180, Code of Civil Procedure, was enacted, which took effect September 1, 1911, and provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cThe fact that a juror, * * * in actions for damages for injuries to person or property, * * * is a shareholder, stockholder, director, officer oi employe, or in any manner interested, in any insurance company issuing policies for protection against liability for damages for injury to person or prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>erty, shall constitute a good ground for a challenge to the favor as to such juror.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">But this is a general proposition, the only effect of which is to ascertain if talesmen are interested in any casualty company, and to make their interest a ground for challenge, presumably because such interest might bias them against any recovery in an accident case, whether defendant was insured or not. It does not give the right to otherwise suggest or to state directly that the defendant in a particular case is insured against loss by reason of accidents caused by him. The first case cited, Rodzborski v. American Sugar Refining Co., 210 N. Y. 262, 104 N. E. 616, was decided after the amendment in question took effect. In it the rule laid down in Simpson v. Foundation Company, 201 N. Y. 479, 95 N. E. 10, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 321, was cited with approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cThere Judge Vann, writing for the court, said: \u2018The circumstances indicate, however, that one object of the questions was to suggest to the jury that the defendant was insured in an accident company in order to induce them to give a larger verdict.\u2019 He further said: \u2018Evidence that the defendant in an action for negligence was insured in a casualty company, or that the defense was conducted by an insurance company, is incompetent and so dangerous as to require a reversal, even when the court strikes it from the record and directs the jury to disregard it, unless it clearly appears that it could not have influenced the verdict.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In the Rodzborslci Case, as in this, the plaintiff\u2019s case depended upon his own version as to the happening of the accident. The corroboration in this case is only as to what happened on the preceding day. In both cases there was a direct contradiction of material evidence by defendant\u2019s witnesses. Here the plaintiff\u2019s counsel by his question conveyed to the jury the direct information that defendant 'was insured. In the case cited the question of plaintiff\u2019s counsel conveyed no hint of any insurance company indemnifying defendant, and the statement that an employers\u2019 liability company was insuring the 'defendant came from the witness in the course of a lengthy answer \u2022in response to a question as to what directions he was given by defendant. Still the Court of Appeals felt called upon to reverse the judgment upon that ground (as well as another), as it did not clearly appear that the error was harmless. The same rule is applicable to the case at bar and requires a like disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The judgment and order appealed from a-re reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
