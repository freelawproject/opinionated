Y. Supp. 508), and arc unable to find any substantial difference between them, or any difference at all, except slight changes in the matter of verbiage. Upon the authority of our former decision, therefore, the cause of action demurred to is insufficient in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">It follows that, in so far as appealed from, each order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the demurrer to the first cause of action sustained, and the motion for judgment upon said cause of action granted, with $10 costs. Inasmuch as this is plaintiff\u2019s third attempt to frame a sufficient complaint, no leave to further amend will be granted. Orders filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
