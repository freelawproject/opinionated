The court at Special Term denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for alimony and counsel ices pendente lite on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the action. The application was decided on the pleadings and the affidavits submitted by both parties. These papers raised an issue as to the residence of the parties, upon which depended jurisdiction under section 1763, subd. 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure. This important and vital question should not be determined upon affidavits, but rather at the trial. It has been held by this court that disputed questions of jurisdiction in cases of this kind should not be determined merely upon affidavits, but should be reserved for the trial. Barber v. Barber, 137 App. Div. 665, 122 N. Y. Supp. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion is granted, with $10 costs, and remitted to the Special Term to fix the amount of alimony and counsel fee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
