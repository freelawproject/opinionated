The inventor of the device was Thomas A. Morris. The apparatus to be made by the plaintiff was simply a model. It was not for actual use, and plaintiff was building it under the instructions and in accordance with experiments tif Thomas A. Morris, who was in the employ of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> The record shows that plaintiff proved its case, and the evidence of the defendant does not disprove it. Defendant\u2019s only witness practically admits the model was completed in accordance with instructions. There was a question as to the place of delivery. Plaintiff\u2019s witness swore positively that it was to be delivered in its place. Defendant\u2019s witness was not sure as to the place of delivery. In the absence of proof of an agreement to the contrary, the place of delivery would have been plaintiff\u2019s place of business where the model was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">. <bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> Defendant claimed that the machine was to be completed within three weeks, and that time was the essence of the contract. I can find nothing in the evidence that specifically required the machine to be completed within three weeks. The plaintiff in its letter (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 2) proposing to build the machine simply stated\" that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-15\">\u201cHe expected to start the model at once and finish within three weeks\u2019 time from receipt of order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Defendant in its letter of acceptance of the proposition makes no mention of time within which the machine was to be finished. As mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ter of fact, the machine was used for the experimental purposes contemplated by the parties, and was actually tested by the defendant after it was completed, and the inventor, Morris, found it would not work; and the evidence of the plaintiff was that it was finished about the first part of May. It appears to me from the whole case that plaintiff duly performed its part of the contract, and that defendant did not establish a good defense, and did not sustain its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, with $30 costs, defendant\u2019s counterclaim dismissed, and judgment ordered for the plaintiff for the amount demanded in its complaint, with costs in the Municipal Court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
