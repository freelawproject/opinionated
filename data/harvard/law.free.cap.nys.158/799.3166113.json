Vernon that denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a retaxation of costs. This action was brought in the City Court of Mt. Vernon to recover the sum of $57.20. The answer set up a counterclaim for the sum of $80, in addition to denials of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. On the trial \u25a0of the issues tire jury awarded a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $41.70. Thereupon the defendant taxed a full bill of costs against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The City Court of Mt. Vernon is a local inferior court created by \u25a0chapter 182 of the Laws of 1892. Section 55 of that statute describes it as \u201ca court of record.\u201d While it is questionable whether the Legislature had power to make this court \u201ca court of record\u201d under section 18 of article 6 of the Constitution, yet this point is not involved necessarily in this appeal. The act of 1892, in section 108 thereof, makes provision for the allowance of costs to prevailing parties in actions where neither pleading asks judgment for the sum of $50 or more, and provides that in all other actions the same costs and allowances \u201cas are now provided by law in actions and proceedings in the Supreme Court, except term fees, shall be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Under section 3228 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which applies to the Supreme Court, as the plaintiff did not recover the sum of $50, she was not entitled to costs as of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">The defendant rests his claim for costs on section 3229 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the defendant is entitled to costs, of course, on the rendering of a final judgment in an action specified in section 3228 unless the plaintiff is entitled to costs as therein prescribed. If this section (3229) is applicable to actions in the City Court of Mt. Vernon, the order now before us on appeal must be affirmed. While section 108 of the statute of 1892 assimilates to actions in the City Court of Mt. Vernon the provisions of section 3228 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it does necessarily include section 3229. Under that section of the Code, a defendant who has not prevailed in an action may have costs against a prevailing plaintiff under the defined circumstances. But section 108 of the statute of 1892 contemplates and provides for costs for prevailing parties. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">\u201cThe following costs and allowances shall be recovered by the prevailing party, in all actions, proceedings and appeals under this act,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">And again in subdivision 2, where it assimilates the costs taxable in actions in the Supreme Court to actions in the City Court of Mt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Vernon, it uses the important words \u201cshall be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d It would seem that it was the clear intent of the act of 1892 that costs in actions in the City Court of Mt. Vernon should be recoverable only by the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Section 109 of that statute, which provides for the taxation of costs by the clerk of the court, again expresses the same idea. It declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-3\">\u201cThe clerk of said court shall, on two days\u2019 notice, adjust and tax the costs and disbursements of the prevailing party, and the same shall be included in the judgment,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">That is, the judgment in favor of the prevailing party, who in this case was the plaintiff. These views lead to a reversal of the order of the County Court of Westchester county, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The matter is remitted to the City Court of Mt. Vernon, with direction to that court to vacate and set aside the taxation of costs and disbursements in favor of the defendant in the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
