These are substantially the allegations of fact, and the demand for judgment is that the \u201csaid instrument dated August 18, 1899, executed by said plaintiff Merritt Hull, and filed in said Surrogate\u2019s Court on April 13, 1914, be declared fraudulent and void, and that the same be set aside and canceled, and that plaintiff have judgment against John Hull, Jr., in the sum of $1,478.25, with interest from April 13, 1914, and that in the event of execution being returned unsatisfied that the plaintiff have judgment against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The answer of the defendant John Hull, Jr., denies all of the material allegations of the complaint except the relationship of the parties and the fact that he has paid over the sums mentioned to the other defendants, and sets up several defenses, and the plaintiff demurs to the separate defense and counterclaims, consisting of new matter, respectively set forth in the paragraphs third, seventh, and eighth. As to the third paragraph it is urged that it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof, while as to the seventh it is claimed that as a defense it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof, and that as a counterclaim it appears on the face thereof that it is not of the character specified in sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tian 501 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and as to the eighth paragraph it is insisted that it is insufficient in law on the face thereof; that as a counterclaim it appears on the face thereof that it is not of the character specified in section 501 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The learned court found as conclusions of law that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, overruled the plaintiff\u2019s demurrers, and that \u201cthe plaintiff not asking for or desiring leave to plead over, and the allegations in the separate defenses and counterclaims demurred to being thereby admitted,\u201d it was ordered that a final judgment be entered in favor of the defendants Prank Hull and John Hull, Jr., individually and as executor of the estate of John Hull, Sr., deceased, dismissing the complaint upon the merits; that the demurrers be overruled, with costs, and that the defendant Prank Hull have judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of $97.59, with interest thereon; and that the defendant John Hull, Jr., have judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of $585.37, with interest and costs. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> It seems entirely clear that the complaint, which is opened to examination by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer (Lewis v. Cook, 150 N. Y. 163, 44 N. E. 778), fails to state facts necessary to constitute a cause of action. The instrument which is sought to be set aside on the ground of fraud is alleged to have been \u201csigned and delivered to said John Hull, Jr.,\u201d and this instrument, under seal, recites that it is \u201cfor a valuable consideration.\u201d While it is true that under the provisions of section 840 of the Code of Civil Procedure an executory instrument under seal is only presumptive evidence of consideration, which may be rebutted, an assignment is not an executory instrument. It is completed by delivery of the assignment, and the statute has not changed the rule of the common law in respect to such instruments. Baird v. Baird, 81 Hun, 300, 302, 30 N. Y. Supp. 785, affirmed 145 N. Y. 659, 40 N. E. 222, 28 L. R. A. 375; Williams v. Whittell, 69 App. Div. 340, 346, 74 N. Y. Supp. 820. The allegations of the complaint that the instrument was without consideration can therefore have no bearing upon the question. The declaration that the instrument was signed and delivered, and the instrument itself being set forth and being under seal, it is conclusive upon the plaintiff in so far as the question of consideration is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> The allegation of the complaint that the \u201cdefendant, John Hull, Jr., fraudulently represented to plaintiff that it would be for the plaintiff\u2019s interest to execute and deliver said assignment, and promised and agreed that such assignment would be held by the defendant John Hull, Jr., in escrow, and not delivered to James Hull and Frank Hull, or either of them, and not used for any purpose whatever, and would never be used or delivered unless and until such use or delivery was authorized by said plaintiff,\u201d is not an allegation of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of action for fraud. The mere characterization of the representations alleged to have been made by John Hull, Jr., as \u201cfraudulent,\u201d without telling us what these repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>sentalions were, is not that plain and concise statement of facts which the Code requires. John Hull, Jr., had no interest in the assignment; the instrument ran to James and Frank Hull, and there is nothing to show that the alleged representations of John Hull, ]r., that it would be to the interest of the plaintiff to make and deliver the said instrument were not true, or that they in any manner tended to deceive or mislead the plaintiff to his disadvantage. If the plaintiff executed and delivered the assignment on the theory that it was for his interest to do so, then the allegation that this delivery was made in escrow, to become effective only upon the plaintiff\u2019s further action, is inconsistent with the alleged fraudulent representations, and the affirmative defenses pleaded by the defendants, demurred to by the plaintiff, tend strongly to show that the assignment was, in fact, in the interests of the plaintiff. We think the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> But if there could be any reasonable doubt as to the propriety of \"dismissing the complaint upon the ground suggested, the allegations of the third paragraph of the defendants\u2019 answer, demurred to by the plaintiff, seem entirely sufficient to bring about the same result. It is there alleged that the defendant John Hull, Jr., as executor, took the necessary steps to procure a decree discharging him from further liability as such executor, and that the plaintiff was made a party to the proceeding and was personally cited, and that the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the execution and delivery of said assignment, and knew that the defendant, John Hull, Jr., individually and as executor, and the defendants James Hull and Frank Hull, were relying and acting upon said assignment as a valid and legal assignment, absolute in its terms and effect, and that the said John Hull, Jr., as such executor, had paid to Frank Hull and James Hull, pursuant to said assignment, the legacy given to said Merritt Hull by the will of said John Hull, Sr., and that the proceeding resulted in a decree finally settling the account, and that no appeal has been taken from that adjudication. The demurrer admitting these facts, the plaintiff is clearly estopped by the decree, and the complaint should be dismissed on that ground, assuming it to have stated a good cause of action in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\"><bracketnum>[7-9]</bracketnum> There can be no doubt that there was an irregularity in granting an affirmative judgment upon the counterclaims, but it appears that the form of judgment was agreed to on the part of the plaintiff, through his attorney, and having once waived his rights in this regard he ought not to be heard to contend to the contrary for the purpose of overturning a judgment which seems to have done substantial justice to the parties. The rule is well established that a party may waive a rule of law, or a statute, or even a constitutional provision, enacted for his benefit or protection, where it is exclusively a matter of private right, and no considerations of public morals are involved; and, having once done so, he cannot subsequently invoke its protection (Mayor of New York v. M. R Co., 143 N. Y. 1, 26, 37 N. E. 494), and no good reason <em>suggests </em>itself why the rule should not apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur; KELLOGG, P. J., and COCHRANE, J\u201e in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
