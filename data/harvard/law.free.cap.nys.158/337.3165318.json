An assessment for taxes and a sale under it, taking effect as an execution of a statute power, must be construed strictly, so as to identify the land and fix its size and location. Here the west bound was upon a so-called highway within the land, and not properly bounding it. The southern bound on the highway, as stated, is hopelessly wrong, so that that side line cannot be fixed, even after the tax purchase and attempted occupation. At the trial the defendant grantee admitted that he had not ascertained where his southern bounds ran. This is inadequate. Erschler v. Lennox, 11 App. Div. 515, 42 N. Y. Supp. 805; Oakley v. Healey, 38 Hun, 244; Blackwell, Tax Titles, \u00a7 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Such an insufficient description is not helped out by recording, under Tax Law, \u00a7\u00a7 131, 132.
