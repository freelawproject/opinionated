Subsequent to the entry of judgment dismissing_ the complaint in the former action, plaintiff obtained an ex parte order granting him leave to sue as a pauper. The fact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>dismissal of the complaint in the former action and the nonpayment of costs awarded to defendant was not brought to the attention of the court in connection with plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to sue as a pauper; but no motion has since been made by defendant to vacate the order on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">While section 125 of tire Municipal Court Code provides for a stay, without further direction of the court, until the payment of costs which have been awarded, that section must be read in conjunction with section 461 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which, not being inconsistent with the provisions of the Municipal Court Code, must be deemed a part of the Municipal Court Code. Section 15, M. C. C. Section 461 specifically provides that a person to whom leave to sue as a pauper is granted \u201cshall not be prevented from prosecuting the same by reason of his being liable for the costs of a former action, brought by him against the same defendant.\u201d This provision of the Code is conclusive on this point. Roberti v. Carlton, 18 How. Prac. 466; Harris v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. (Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 473; Young v. Nassau Elec. R. R. Co., 34 App. Div. 126, 54 N. Y. Supp. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The order must therefore be reversed, and the motion denied, without costs of appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
