(Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ' 1919, \u00a7 6336%a et seq.j. Judgment was rendered for defendant. The sole question presented for review is whether plaintiff was exempt from the tax by virtue of section 231 (4) of the act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6336% o), which exempts \u201cdomestic building and loan associations and co-operative banks without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit.\u201d District Judge Peck, in a considered opinion (280 Fed. 143), held plaintiff not exempt. We approve, not only this conclusion, but the reasoning upon which it is based. The judgment of the District Court is accordingly affirmed, upon the opinion of the District Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
