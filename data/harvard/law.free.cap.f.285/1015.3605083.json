Anglo-American Incand. Light Co. v. General Elec. Co., 43 App. D. C. 385. To be sure, there are certain differences in the two products, but the points of similarity are more important in a case of this kind. The product of each party is soap, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>and we are convinced that the contemporaneous use of the two marks would \u201cbe likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.\u201d The marks look and sound alike, and there was no apparent reason for such a simulation by the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
