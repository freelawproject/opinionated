Prior to the adoption of this mark by the'applicant, the opposer, appellee here, adopted and has since used substantially the same mark in connection with the sale of numerous tool and hardware specialties, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>glass cutters, cold chisels, pliers, saw vices, chain drills, hack saws, nail and rivet sets, wire grips, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">It is the contention of the applicant that its pneumatic rivet cutters are not of the same descriptive properties, within the meaning of the Trade-Mark Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9485 et seq.), as the smaller tools of the opposer. The Patent Office thought otherwise. The business end of applicant\u2019s rivet cutter is a cold chisel, and, although the power actuating it is derived from pneumatic pressure, it functions in exactly the same way as though manually operated. In other words, it is a rivet cutter, whether automatically or manually operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">It may be conceded that there is considerable difference between a large automatic rivet cutter, and a smaller hand tool, such as opposer manufactures and sells; but that difference is less noticeable m the smaller tool manufactured by applicant and called the \u201cBaby Devil.\u201d In either case, however, the purpose of the tools, of the two parties is the same, and it must be held that they are goods of \u201cthe same general qualities or characteristics as those of the goods to which\u201d opposer\u2019s trade-mark already had been applied. Anglo-American Incand. L. Co. v. General E. Co., 43 App. D. C. 385; Imperial Cotto Sales Co. v. N. K. Fairbanks Co., 50 App. D. C. 250, 270 Fed. 686. Certainly there is sufficient similarity in the characteristics of the products of the parties as to be likely to create confusion in the mind of the public and to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The decision therefore is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
