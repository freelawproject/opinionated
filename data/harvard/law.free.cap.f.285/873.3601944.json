Upon oral argument it was conceded that the question whether ten or only nine cars were actually shipped and received could not be withdrawn from the jury, and whether plaintiffs unreasonably delayed shipment of the one car in question \u2014 if that question is in . case \u2014 appears on the record obviously not resolvable as a matter of law, against the plaintiffs ; hence there remain two contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">First \u2014 Acceptance of the contracts by plantiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Counsel for defendant makes no claim that areeptarce in writing to comply with the statute of frauds is essential, but urges that, as Keiser-Hogle Company was merely a broker without auihoriiy to accept for and bind plaintiffs to the contracts, some proof, verbs' or written, of acceptance by the latter, is essential. Assuming that it suffices to show acceptance without formal words, response to defendant\u2019s demands is found in the record: (1) In plaintiffs\u2019 receipt and reiertion of the broker\u2019s notes. (2) In their acceptance of shipping orders. (3) In shipping eight cars and receiving payment therefor irem the defendant, all expx\u2019essly upon the contracts. (4) In arranging ior and carrying out adjustment of claim for loss of one car for the benefit of the defendant. (5) In dealing with defendant directly, or indirectly through the broker (on defendant\u2019s initiative), for delay or indulgence in making shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">This,, conduct, and the oral and documentary proofs evidencing it, establish conclusively, in our judgment, acceptance of the contracts. Clearly, upon these facts, plaintiffs could not contend nonacceptance, or that the obligations of the contracts had been accepted with a reservation, optionally to perform in part only by segregating shipments as separate contracts, and the defendant, after receiving partial performance, cannot be heard to urge no acceptance to relieve against its own default.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Secondly \u2014 Sufficiency of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">It set out in detail the facts, viz.: The execution of the contracts, their partial performance, the defendant\u2019s repudiation and refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>accept 171 barrels, and loss, measured by the decline in the market. It is urged that.-' because this count further avers that <em>\u201cby means </em>whereof\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>defendant\u2019s failure, etc.) \u201cthe said defendant became and was and still is <em>indebted </em>to the plaintiff,\u201d the declaration is not sufficient to sustain a recovery as upon breach of an executory contract, for unliquidated damages. Whether this shall be interpreted as a \u201ccommon\u201d or a \u201cspecial)\u2019 count impresses us as wholly without substance. The facts, as noted, and their averment in' the declaration, sufficed to disclose, plainly, a/ cause of action for damages upon breach of an executory contract, <em>o\u00ed </em>sale; the proofs had been offered and received on the trial without objection to their pertinency to establish that sort of a cause of -action. Hence, even tenable criticism of the declaration, in that it charged \u201cdamage\u201d to be \u201cindebtedness,\u201d could and should have been met, with or without request, before or after verdict, by amendment conforming pleading to proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
