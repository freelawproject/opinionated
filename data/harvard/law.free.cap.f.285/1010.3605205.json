Appellee also has used \u201cOld Liberty\u201d and a picture of the Liberty Bell. Obviously these two marks have the same signification. It goes without saying, as found by the Patent Office, that the concurrent use of appellant\u2019s mark upon the same class of goods would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public and deceive purchasers, within the meaning of the Trade-Mark Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9485 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-19\">Appellant, however, contends that, because appellee\u2019s testimony shows that it sold packages of candy marked \u201cBelle Package,\u201d appellee is not in a position to object to the registration by appellant of its mark, and cites Alaska Packers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Admiralty Trading Co., 43 App. D. C. 198. There would be force in this contention, had appellee used the word \u201cBelle\u201d alone, but the evidence shows conclusively that this use always was in connection with the word \u201cTou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>raine,\u201d written in a distinctive manner and clearly indicating the origin of the goods. In other words, this use was in the nature of a grade mark, and did not, in our opinion, conflict with the use of the trade-mark \u201cOld Liberty,\u201d or \u201cLiberty Bell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
