C. N. and F. W. Jonas acted as agents or distributors for appellee on the Pacific Coast from 1914 to 1918, and in the Middle West territory from 1916 to 1918, when, at the instance of appellee, the relationship was severed. Thereafter the Jonas brothers became identified with the appellant company, which commenced to manufacture and sell wrenches in competition with appellee. It was then that the trade-mark \u201cBlade-hawk\u201d was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">We agree with the Patent Office that the marks are so sufficiently similar as to be likely to create confusion, and, as we have intimated in prior decisions, the circumstances indicate strongly a purpose and intent on the part of appellant to reap some benefit from the established trade of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-16\">The dedsion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
