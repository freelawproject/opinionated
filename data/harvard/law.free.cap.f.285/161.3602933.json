It was asserted that battery efficiency had been maintained during these long periods because of the excellence of appellant\u2019s method of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">This was an absolute falsehood, fully proven, if not in effect admitted, and out of this false representation and reliance thereon all the matters complained of by Hubert and his associates directly grew. Nothing in this bulky record enables Apostoloff to escape from the equitable and legal consequences of this fundamental fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Decrees affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
