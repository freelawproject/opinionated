UNITED STATES.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b773-4\">(Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3b\">January 15, 1923.)</decisiondate>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A8A\">No. 2870.</docketnumber>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b773-10\">Samuel W.

Thereupon the alleged cause of forfeiture was tried by a jury, and a verdict having been found for the government, and judgment entered thereo.n, claimant brought this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">The decisive question is the alleged error of the court in refusing claimant\u2019s request for binding instructions. After examination of the issue and proofs, we are of opinion the point was properly refused. The proceeding was'under the Pure Food and Drug Act (Comp. St. \u00a7\u2022 8724) which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\">\u201cAn article shall be deemed misbranded * * * in the case of food * * * if the package containing it, or its label, shall bear any statement, design or device regarding the ingredients, or the substance contained therein, which statement, design or device shall be false or misleading in any particular.\u201d O</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">The proofs show a well-known brand of champagne, called \u201cWhite Seal,\u201d was sold in a distinctive bottle, the mouth of which was sealed with a white cap or covering. Such champagne could be sold by a druggist on prescription under legal permit. The claimant put carbonated apple juice, with capsicum added, into bottles, which in form and dress bore semblance to the White Seal champagne and labeled them \"Sparkling White Seal.\u201d Referring to some, but not all, of the testimony, one witness, experienced in the champagne trade, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\">\u201cThe appearance of the bottle is misleading. At a distance I would think it was a pint of champagne.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The testimony of another experienced witness was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201cQ. In \u2018design\u2019 and \u2018device,\u2019 can you say whether or not that bottle is misleading?, A. It appears to me from here a bottle of champagne, as I would understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cQ. Gan you say whether or not in its general make-up ,it is misleading? A. <em>In its general malce-up it is, to my mind.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cQ. In the trade. Would it be generally misleading to the trade, to the consuming trade? A. It all depends. It would depend on where the goods were sold. If they were sold in a grocery store, I do not think so. If in a ' drug store, <em>they might.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cQ. But I mean in its make-up without respect to where it was sold? A. In the style of the package you mean, in other words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201cQ. Xes. A. The style of the package is misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201cQ. The style of the package is misleading? A. Xes sir. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">\u201cQ. And if you could have read the words \u2018Duffy-Mott\u2019 from your seat upon the witness stand, you would not have answered, would you, that it looked like champagne? A. On the table there it looks like a champagne package, and 1 might say it looks like a bottle of champagne, unless I looked at the bottle closely and saw the label; then I would know it was not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">The court below rightly summed up the substantial question involved in the case in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">\u201cIf the jury believe that the use of the words \u2018Sparkling White Seal,\u2019 taken in connection with the way the bottle Is put up, is a misleading statement, and taken in connection with everything else that is contained on the label the jury belieye that the public generally would be deceived into thinking that they were buying champagne when in fact they were getting carbonated apple juice, with some capsicum in it, then the government has made out its case. * * * The jury must find, not that they might think it was some other kind of apple juice, or they might think it was some other kind of beverage, but they might think it was champagne. If the public is not deceived into thinking it is champagne, then the government has failed to make out a case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">Under such proofs, manifestly the court would have been in error, had it withdrawn the case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Finding the mode of submission and charge given to the jury were fair and without error, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
