As we remarked in Bartlett v. Arbuckle Bros., \u2014- App. D. C.-, 285 Fed. 1001, just decided, the scope of our inquiry in this proceeding is restricted to the questions whether the marks are applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, and! whether they are so deceptively similar as to be likely to cause confusion in trade or deceive purchasers. It would require altogether too great a stretch of the imagination to rule that the fabrics of the applicant\u00aband the oils, greases, etc., of the \u00f3pposer are goods of the same descriptive properties. Clearly they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">It follows that the decision must be and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
