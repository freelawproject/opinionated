Thereafter, Lynch failing to avail himself of the opportunity to take testimony motion was made for judgment on the record. Lynch then filed another motion for dissolution, on the ground specified in the first motion, and the further grounds that the count, if broadly construed, is not patentable to Headley and Thompson, and that their application does not contain a sufficient disclosure to support the matter in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\"> It is a familiar rule in interference proceedings that claims will be given the broadest interpretation which they reasonably will support, irrespective of the exigencies of a particular case. Kirby v. Clements, 44 App. D. C. 12; Scott v. Longtin,-App. D. C.-, 281 Led. 606. The Patent Office was guided by this rule in finding that the Headley and Thompson application contained a sufficient disclosure. The Assistant Commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-9\">\u201cThe device <em>75 </em>of the Headley and Thompson application is the regulator called for by \"the issue. The applicants do not in the present case show the details of this regulator. The specification, however, does indicate its intended method of operation, and reference is made to patent No. 1,017,870, granted February 20, 1912, to Headley and Bard, in which are shown the details of this regulator. It seems unnecessary to insist that the applicants here should have shown all the details which was already disclosed in that patent. It was sufficient for them to incorporate it by reference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">We agree with the Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">As to the contention that the claim, if .broadly interpreted, is not .patentable to Headley and Thompson, it is sufficient to say that this is a question not proper to be raised in an interference proceeding, as we many times have ruled.
