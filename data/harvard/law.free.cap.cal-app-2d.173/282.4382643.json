But that is not what he desires. He wants a new trial, a jury trial, and seeks a reversal of the judgment in order to get it.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">He invokes the landmark case of <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Barba, </em>38 Cal.2d 350 [240 P.2d 604]. In that ease the trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial on condition that the defendant consent to an increase of award in an amount fixed by the court (p. 355 of 38 Cal.2d). The trial court expressly decided that the damages were inadequate and ordered a new trial limited to the issue of damages alone unless defendant filed his consent to the indicated increase. Upon the filing of such consent, the increased judgment was entered. It recited all of the pertinent facts and specifically stated that prior to making the conditional order the court had \u201c \u2018found that the evidence was insufficient to support each of the verdicts hereinabove set forth in that the damages awarded each of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>respective plaintiffs was inadequate. \u2019 \u201d (<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> [Cal.App.] 226 P.2d 677, at 682.) The record showed that the jury awards barely covered the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 special damages, leaving nothing for general damages. The finding that the jury award lacked support in the evidence was, therefore, correct and a new trial should have been granted. The attempt to thwart plaintiffs' right to a new trial before a jury (by increasing the judgment without plaintiffs\u2019 consent) was prejudicially erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment had to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">How are we in the instant case going to spell any such set of facts out of the record before us as a basis for reversing the judgment in this case? Plaintiff-appellant has furnished a clerk\u2019s transcript only. He has provided us neither with a reporter\u2019s transcript nor with an agreed or settled statement. All that the clerk\u2019s transcript shows, pertinent to this inquiry, is the text of the orders above quoted and plaintiff\u2019s notice of motion for new trial; nothing by which to test the accuracy of his asserted right to a new trial. In the absence of such a showing, plaintiff has failed to meet the burden, as appellant, of demonstrating that the judgment rests upon prejudicially erroneous action of the trial court. An affirmance is clearly indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We note in passing that plaintiff is also faced with the problem of reading into the orders under review a finding that the verdict was inadequate and lacked support in the evidence. The code says that when a new trial is granted upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict or decision \u201cthe order shall so specify this in writing and shall be filed with the clerk within ten days after the motion is granted; otherwise, on appeal from such order it will be conclusively presumed that the order was not based upon that ground.\u201d How can plaintiff spell any such finding out of the orders under review? If his notice of motion for new trial had specified that ground only, he might invoke the principles enunciated and applied in such cases as <em>Ice-Kist Packing Co. </em>v. <em>J. F. Sloan Co., </em>157 Cal.App.2d 695, 696 [321 P.2d 840]; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Tyrone Power Enterprises, </em>49 Cal.App.2d 383, 389-390 [121 P.2d 829]; <em>Piru Citrus Assn. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 911, 914-916 [214 P.2d 426]; <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Mutual Benefit H. &amp; </em>A. <em>of Omaha, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 887, 890-892 [289 P.2d 550, 290 P.2d 87]; <em>Van Ostrum </em>v. <em>State, </em>148 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>1, 3-5 [306 P.2d 44].  But in our case the notice of motion specified all of the grounds (except \u201cexcessive damages\u201d) mentioned in section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That makes it like <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>167 Cal.App.2d 680 [335 P.2d 137], in which the notice of motion for new trial cited five different grounds, including insufficiency of the evidence. That made it impossible for the reviewing court to say that \u201cthe trial court in its purely generalized order did not base its order on misconduct of the jury or errors in law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the party making the application. Nor can we tell whether or not the trial court felt that one of these matters had misled the jury and that for that reason the damages were too much, or too little. The decision may not be made in this court by mere surmise, and we cannot rewrite the portion of section 657, Code of Civil Procedure, that is above quoted.\u201d (P. 762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We conclude that the judgment must be affirmed. This does not mean that we approve of additur. It means merely that plaintiff-appellant has not, by the appeal record furnished, shown a basis for reversal. He has shown that the trial court increased the amount of the judgment. He has not furnished a record from which we may determine that he was injured or aggrieved by such increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Bray, P. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">On October 15, 1957, plaintiff filed a \u201cNotice of Denial for New Trial\u201d stating \u201cthat plaintiff, Gail D.
