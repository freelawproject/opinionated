The respondent moves to dismiss the appeal upon the grounds that the motion to vacate the judgment was made upon the same grounds as the motion for new trial, to wit: the disqualification of the trial judge under section 170 subdivision 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the question of the disqualification of the trial judge is subject to review on an appeal from the judgment which is now pending in division three of this court and that therefore the order here appealed from is not an appealable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">The record fully supports the respondent\u2019s contention and upon the authority of <em>Litvinuk </em>v. <em>Litvinuk, </em>27 Cal.2d 38 [162 P.2d 8], the motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Fourt, Acting P.
