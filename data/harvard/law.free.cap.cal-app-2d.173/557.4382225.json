The trial court found that plaintiff was not mentally incompetent or of unsound mind during the time in question and that the defendant did not conceal any facts from the court in the divorce action. It further found that plaintiff was not mentally incompetent at the time of signing the property agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Plaintiff appeals from the judgment and assigns as the sole ground of error the insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings. We have carefully studied the record and while there was some conflict in the evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s mental competency there was substantial evidence that she was at all times competent and this being so this court will not disturb the judgment of the trial court as it is the province of the trial court and not this court to pass on the credibility of the witnesses and to determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. (Appeal and Error, 4 Cal.Jur. 2d, \u00a7 606, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We may say here that in our opinion the preponderance of the evidence sustains the findings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Fourt, Acting P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment was denied and, considering the motion as a petition for a rehearing, the petition for a rehearing was denied October 7, 1959.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-18\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
