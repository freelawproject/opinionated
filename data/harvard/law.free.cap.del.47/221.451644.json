Any Judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Court of General Sessions, the Court of Common Pleas, the Municipal Court of the City of Wilmington, or the Clerk of any of the foregoing courts, or any Justice of the Peace, or any Magistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases may, within the limits of their respective territorial jurisdictions, issue a warrant to search any house or place for each or any of the following: * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> \u201cProbable cause\u201d as employed under Article 1, Section 6 of our Constitution means a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious person to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged. Absolute certainty is not implied, nor does the term mean positive or actual cause. The determination is concerned only with whether or not the affiant has reasonable grounds for a belief, and not with the question as to whether the offense charged has been committed, or whether the accused is guilty or innocent. If the apparent facts set out in the affidavit for a search warrant are such that a reasonably discreet and prudent person would be led to believe that there was a commission of the offense charged, there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d justifying the issuance of a search warrant. 47 <em>Am. Jur. (S. </em>&amp; S.) <em>Par. </em>22; <em>Lane v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>672, 76 <em>A. </em>1016; <em>Tucker v. Cannon, </em>28 <em>Neb. </em>196, 44 <em>N. W. </em>440; <em>Mitchell v. Wall, </em>111 <em>Mass. </em>492; <em>U. S. v. Lotempio, D. C., </em>58 <em>F. </em>2d 358; <em>Firer v. Lowery, </em>59 <em>Mo. App. </em>92; <em>Driggs v. Burton, </em>44 <em>Vt. </em>124; 34 <em>Words </em>&amp; <em>Phrases, </em>p. 27. Thus, it seems that a determination of \u201cprobable cause\u201d, as embodied under Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution, becomes a mixed question of law and fact, and, as the question of law is dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>upon the existence of facts, \u201cprobable cause\u201d may not be inferred without a determination that sufficient facts are stated from which it may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Having suggested the meaning to be applied to the term \u201cprobable cause\u201d as embraced within the provisions of Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution, I reach the' question as to whether or not the power and authority to determine the same may be delegated by the Legislature to a ministerial officer such as the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas for New Castle County in the light of the provisions of Article 4, Section 1 of the Constitution, <em>supra. </em>In other words, is the task in determining \u201cprobable cause\u201d a judicial or a ministerial function?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The determination as to whether there exists \u201cprobable cause\u201d, predicated upon the averments in the affidavit, to suspect the person charged with having committed an offense is clearly a judicial function, and cannot, under the provisions of Article 4, Section 1 of the Constitution, be delegated to the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas for New Castle County, an administrative officer, to be by him performed. <em>State v. Tunnell, </em>302 <em>Mo. </em>433, 259 <em>S. W. </em>128; <em>Toms v. Judge of Recorder\u2019s Court, </em>237 Mich. 413, 212 N. W. 69; <em>Cox v. Perkins, </em>151 <em>Ga. </em>632, 107 <em>S. E. </em>863, 16 <em>A. L. R. </em>918; <em>Ex parte Levy, </em>204 <em>Ark. </em>657, 163 S. <em>W. </em>2d 529; <em>State v. Van Brocklin </em>(Dissenting Opinion), 194 <em>Wis. </em>441, 217 <em>N. W. </em>277. To the contrary see <em>State v. Van Brocklin </em>(Majority Opinion), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It has been generally said that Courts and Officers, commendable as are their efforts to bring the guilty to punishment, \u25a0 may not be aided by the sacrifice of people\u2019s rights, nor may those rights be frittered away because expedient. If Courts and public officials charged with law enforcement violate the law of the land in their zeal to convict, it follows that the people who look to their knowledge and integrity cannot be expected to respect the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The enactment set forth in Paragraph 5343-DD, Section 65, being House Bill 300, Session of 1951 and amending Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>155 of the <em>Revised Code of </em>1935, contravenes Article 4, Section 1 of the Constitution insofar as it attempts to delegate to the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas for New Castle County the judicial power and authority required under the Constitution to issue a search warrant and is, therefore, unconstitutional in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas not having power and authority to issue a search warrant, the defendant\u2019s second objection, relating to the want of \u201cprobable cause\u201d concerning the averments in the affidavit, becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The prayers as indicated in the defendant\u2019s petition are granted. An order will be signed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
