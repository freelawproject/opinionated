Prior to the commencement of the action, the plaintiff employed private detectives to procure evidence of her husband\u2019s infidelity. The services of the detectives were completely performed before the divorce action was brought and the plaintiff has paid approximately $1,100 for the services thus rendered. The plaintiff obtained the funds for that expenditure by making a loan upon her own credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The plaintiff now seeks an allowance of suit money, under <em>Code </em>1935, \u00a7 3508, sufficient to include reimbursement for that disbursement. The question for decision is whether the Court has the power under the Statute to compel the defendant to make such reimbursement to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The scope and purpose of <em>Code </em>1935, \u00a7 3508, regarding the subject matter, is clarified, I think, by a review of the evolution of the Statute. In 1852, the Delaware Divorce Statute was amended by Sec. 5 of Chap. 75, <em>Rev. Code </em>1852, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cThe Court may grant alimony to the wife for her sustenance pending her petition for divorce * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In 1859, by 11 <em>Delaware Laws, </em>Chap. 638, the Statute was amended as follows to authorize what is generally called \u201csuit money\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cThe Court may grant alimony to the wife for her sustenance pending her petition for divorce and may order and direct the husband to pay such sum as may be necessary in conducting her case * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">In 1873, by 14 <em>Delaware Laws, </em>Chap. 548, the Legislature added to the foregoing the clause: \u201cwhether the application be on the part of either the wife or husband.\u201d In 1907, when our Divorce Statute was generally revised by 24 <em>Delaware Laws, </em>Chap. 221, the Statute was adopted in its present form and, as now appears at <em>Code </em>1935, \u00a7 3508, it provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">\u201cAlimony and Expenses of Suit to Wife; Compulsory Process: \u2014 The Court may grant alimony to the wife for her sustenance pending her petition for divorce, and may order and direct the husband to pay such stun as may be deemed necessary to defray the expenses in conducting her case, whether the application be on the part of either the wife or husband, and shall protect her from personal restraint. The Court, in the execution of the powers conferred by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Chapter, may employ such compulsory process as it may deem proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">I think that, with respect to suit money, the key word of the Statute is the word \u201cnecessary\u201d and that, it being a word of limitation, the Court is empowered to compel a husband to pay only such stuns as may be \u201cnecessary\u201d to enable a wife to prosecute or defend her case. The power is conferred in order to alleviate necessity and thus to prevent a failure of justice. If suit expenses have been paid by a wife, it cannot be said that it is necessary that her husband pay the same expenses in order to enable her to present her case. Under such circumstances the wife is not aided by financial hardship, her husband\u2019s guilt, or other factors of fairness. If the element of necessity cannot be found, there is no discretion in the Court because the power to make the allowance does not exist under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Our Statute is similar in scope and purpose to statutes generally existing elsewhere. In discussing the objective of a similar statute in <em>Loveren v. Loveren, </em>100 <em>Cal. </em>493, 35 <em>P. </em>87, the Supreme Court of California stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">* *. The plain object of this statute was to empower the court during the pendency of an action for divorce, upon a proper showing made by the wife for that purpose, to compel the husband to provide her with the means necessary to enable her to prosecute or defend the action. If the expenses of the action have been incurred or paid by her with means derived from her separate estate, or upon her credit, then there can be no necessity for an allowance by the court to enable her to do that which she has already done, and without such necessity the court has no authority under the statute to make such an order. And no better evidence can be adduced of her ability in this respect than the fact that she has been able, as the record shows, to incur these expenses and to pay them with money borrowed by her entirely upon the strength of her own credit. * * * Such an allowance can only be granted as to expenses neccessary to he incurred in the future prosecution or defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of the action, and cannot be made for the payment of past expenses, except where such payment is necessary to be made in order to enable the wife to further prosecute or defend her case. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">See also <em>Beadleston v. Beadleston, </em>103 <em>N. Y. </em>402, 8 <em>N. E. </em>735; <em>Mengel v. Mengel, </em>157 <em>Iowa </em>630, 138 <em>N. W. </em>495, 501; 1 <em>Nelson, Divorce and Annulment </em>(2d Ed.) \u00a7 12.04; 17 <em>Am. Jur. \u201cDivorce and Separation\u201d </em>\u00a7 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Accordingly, it is held that the Court is without authority to compel the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for detective fees paid by her. This ruling is based upon the ground stated, there being reserved for another day the question of whether suit money may he awarded for unpaid past expenses. See <em>Keezer, Marriage and Divorce </em>(3d Ed.) \u00a7 606; 19 <em>C. J. \u201cDivorce\u201d </em>\u00a7 549; 27 <em>C. J. S., Divorce, </em>\u00a7 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The application must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
