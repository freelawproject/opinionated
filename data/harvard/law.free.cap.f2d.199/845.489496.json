For full statement of facts and law pertinent to this case see opinion in case to which reference has just been made, Bridges v. United States of America, 9 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The trial court ordered Bridges\u2019 naturalization revoked under the provisions of Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738(e) which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">\u201c(e) When a person shall be convicted under this chapter of knowingly procuring naturalization in violation of law, the court in which such conviction is had shall thereupon revoke, set aside, and declare void the final order admitting such person to citizenship, and shall<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declare the certificate of naturalization of such person be canceled. * \u00edj* ifc <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">As the Supreme Court said in Knauer v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 654, 658, 66 S.Ct. 1304, 1307, 90 L.Ed. 1500:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">\u201cCitizenship obtained through naturalization is not a second-class citizenship. It has been said that citizenship carries with it all of the rights and prerogatives of citizenship obtained by birth in this country \u2018save that of eligibility to the Presidency\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">However, since naturalization is a privilege which Congress may extend or deny to aliens, where it was obtained through fraud on the prerequisites set forth by Congress, Congress possesses and has exercised its power under the Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to revoke such fraudulently obtained citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">In Schneiderman v. United States, 1943, 320 U.S. 118, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 87 L.Ed. 1796; Baumgartner v. United States, 1944, 322 U.S. 665, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 88 L.Ed. 1525, and Knauer v. United States, supra, the Supreme Court reversed, the orders revoking citizenship under Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738(a) which provides for such revocation in a civil action where naturalization has been illegally procured. The Supreme Court reversed for the reason that the government had not sustained its burden under Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738(a) of proving that the naturalization had been illegally procured. However, there is no such infirmity in the instant revocation of Bridges\u2019 naturalization. For that was done under the terms of Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738(e), since Bridges had been \u201cconvicted under this chapter of knowingly procuring naturalization in violation of law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Appellant is mistaken in his contention that he is not \u201cconvicted\u201d until all appellate remedies have been exhausted. As the Supreme Court said in Berman v. United States, 1937, 302 U.S. 211, 213, 58 S.Ct. 164, 166, 82 L.Ed. 204,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-14\">\u201cPetitioner stands a convicted felon and\u2019unless the judgment against him is vacated or reversed he is subject to all the disabilities flowing from such a judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">Secondly, the revocation under \u00a7 738(e) is meant to be a part of the criminal proceedings and not a separate proceeding. This is indicated by the language of the subsection itself which states that when a person is convicted of obtaining citizenship by fraud, his citizenship' shall \u201cthereupon\u201d be revoked in the same court where he was convicted. However, since this matter reaches us under another case number, we have treated it by a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">Appellant further contends that the revocation of his citizenship did not literally comply with the language of \u00a7 738(e) in that he had not been convicted under \u201cthis chapter\u201d, i. e., Chapter 11, Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738, for the reason that, although the indictment was framed within the language of Chapter 11, Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 746(a) (1), that section had been repealed in 1948 prior to his indictment and conviction, and had been replaced by Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1015 (a). Appellant\u2019s argument on this point is not convincing, for the 1948 revising Act, 62 Sta-t. 683, 862, \u00a7 21, 18 U.S.C.A. note preceding section 1, which repealed the penal provisions of the Nationality Act, Title 8 U.S.C.A. and consolidated all penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>provisions in Title 18 U.S.C., expressly saved \u201c[a]ny rights or liabilities now existing under such sections or parts thereof [which have been repealed]\u201d. Bridges was in fact indicted and convicted for a violation of Chapter 11, Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 746 (a) (1) which was in effect in 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">And, finally, appellant argues that he did not .\u201cknowingly\u201d procure naturalization in violation of law, and therefore all of the elements necessary for the revocation of citizenship under Title 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 738(e) were not present. All the elements of knowledge are present in the verdict of guilt and no error was committed in or during the cancellation and revocation of Mr. Bridges\u2019 citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-17\">.
