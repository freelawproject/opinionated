The district court denied the application and this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">A hearing was had upon the application and the trial court found that no proceedings had been instituted in the state court to test the validity of the detention and the record does not disclose that at the time of the hearing there was any justification for failure to exhaust the available state remedies. Under such circumstances, the Federal district court will not ordinarily entertain an application for habeas corpus. Darr v.
