Since the writing on which appellant relied was plainly not an agreement, the District Court was right in awarding summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-27\"> Appellant moved after judgment for leave to file an amended complaint which, his motion says, \u201cconforms the pleadings with the evidence * * The proposed complaint would allege, instead of an agreement in writing, an oral agreement evidenced by a memorandum in writing. The court declined to let appellant shift his ground after judgment had gone against him. This was not error, although appellant had informed the court, before judgment, that he wished .to amend. The matter was within the court\u2019s discretion under Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 15, 28 U.S.C.A. Moreover the \u201cmemorandum\u201d was only appellant\u2019s offer. It was nowhere signed by appellees or by any .one on their behalf, - as required by D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>12-302. It did not even name appellees. The fact that appellees\u2019 alleged agent initialed a handwritten <em>change </em>in appellant\u2019s printed and typed offer, before it was forwarded to appellees, is immaterial. Accordingly appellant could not have recovered upon the proposed amended complaint if the court had allowed it to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"A3jZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
