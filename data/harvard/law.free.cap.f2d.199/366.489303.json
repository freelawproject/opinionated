Prior to the entry of the judgment appealed from on June 19, 1952, Congress had ^passed an act, Public Law 248 of the 82nd Congress, 65 Stat. 710, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346, depriving the District Court of jurisdiction in this class of cases. Bruner v. United States, 343 U.S. 112, 72 S.Ct. 581. Motion is made to dismiss the appeal; but we think that the proper procedure is, not to dismiss the appeal, 'but to vacate the judgment appealed from and remand the case with direction to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">Judgment vacated and case remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
