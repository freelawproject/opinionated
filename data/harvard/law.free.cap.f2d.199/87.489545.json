In its response, the State of Oklahoma, referring to the litigation in Howington v. State, 30 Okl.Cr. 243, 235 P. 931 and Id., 35 Okl. Cr. 352, 250 P. 941, and the application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals in which the same issues were presented and denied, alleged that the Petitioner was in lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>custody, and prayed for discharge of the writ. After hearing on the application for the writ, in which the appellant was permitted to testify, the trial court denied the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Upon consideration of the whole record, we are of the view that the judgment of the trial court should he and is affirmed. See Gault v. Burford, 10 Cir., 173 F.2d 813; Odell v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 189 F.2d 300; Soulia v. O\u2019Brien, 1 Cir., 188 F.2d 233; Maxwell v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 175 F.2d 318; Sampsell v.
