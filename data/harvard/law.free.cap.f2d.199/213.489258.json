The members of the commission shall be entitled to compensation for their services, but the maximum compensation of the chairman in any year shall not exceed $1,-200 and of each other member in any year shall not exceed $600. * * * The commission may employ a secretary, treasurer, engineers, attorney, and other such experts, assistants, and employees as they may deem necessary, who shall be entitled to receive such compensation as the commission may determine. * * * After all bonds and interest thereon shall have been paid and all other obligations of the commission paid or discharged, or provision for all such payment shall have been made as hereinbefore provided, and after the bridge shall have been conveyed to the Illinois interests and the Indiana interests as herein provided, and any ferry or ferries shall have been sold, the commission shall be dissolved and shall cease to have further existence by an order of the Commissioner of Public Roads made upon his own initiative or upon application of the corn-mission or any member or members thereof, but only after a public hearing in the city of Carmi, Illinois, notice of the time and place of which hearing and the purpose thereof shall have been published once, at least thirty days before the date thereof, in a newspaper published in the city of Carmi. At the time of such dissolution all moneys in the hands of or to the credit of the commission shall be divided hito two equal parts, one of which shall be Paid to said Illinois interests and the other to said Indiana interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzHr\">The complaint discloses that the bridge was purchased for $895,000 in 1941, and that a ferry was purchased at about the same time for $50,000; that the purchase price of the bridge and ferry was obtained by bonds issued in the amount of $945,000, and that from June, 1941, to November,. *951, the Commission had collected $2,165,-700 in tolls&gt; but that $470&gt;000 of the bonds, lssued sti11 remain unPaid- Thus h appears, that the bridSe was built and financed by-Pnvate funds raised trough private borrowin? to be rePaid not from taxes but from authorized tolls collected for the use-tble biddge.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">The complaint makes no charge of misfeasance, malfeasance, or irregularity.against the Commission or any of the defendants. It does, however, allege that, plaintiff had demanded and been denied the-right to examine defendants\u2019 books and!, records, but had been referred to the trustee for the bonds issued by the Commission* where he might secure information regard-inS the Commission\u2019s financial affairs,</p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">In the District Court defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds., that plaintiff, as a citizen, and taxpayer, and a tollpayer and user of the bridge, was-not \u201ca person interested\u201d and had no right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>under the. Act to inspect defendants\u2019 records; that the provisions of the Act providing for the enforcement thereof by the attorneys general of the States of Illinois and Indiana, or the United States district attorney, are exclusive. The District Court sustained the motion, the complaint was dismissed, and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"APE\">The first question presented is whether plaintiff, as a citizen and taxpayer, is entitled to a declaratory judgment, requiring that all the books and records of the Commission be made available to him. He argues that he is entitled to such a judgment and makes the point that the Commission is a public corporation and its records are public records.</p>\n<p id=\"Ann\">It is true that where a corporation, or a public board or commission, ereated for some governmental purpose, derives its revenue from taxation, a taxpayer who, by taxation, is required to contribute to its revenues has a direct interest in the manner in which such revenue is expended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But where a corporation derives all its revenues from a service furnished and rendered, a taxpayer has no interest in it or its affairs other than or different from that of the public generally. In such case the corporation is treated exactly as a private corporation, and the right of the taxpayer to sue must be determined according to the law of the state where the action is brought. New York Evening Post Co. v. Chaloner, 2 Cir., 265 F. 204. In this connection Illinois courts have held that an individual, merely because he is a taxpayer, cannot be heard to complain against a public or quasi-public corporation or its officers, unless he shows that he has sustained a special injury or suffered a special damage different in degree and kind from that suffered by the public at large. Koehler v. Century of Progress, 354 Ill. 347, 188 N.E. 445; Price v. <em>City </em>of Mattoon, 364 Ill. 512, 4 N.E.2d 850. The remedy must be sought through those representing the public. City of Chicago v. Union Building Ass\u2019n, 102 Ill. 379, 398. There is no claim here that plaintiff has any interest other than or different from any other taxpayer, or that he has or will sustain a special injury or suffer a special damage, different in degree or kind, from what might be suffered by any other taxpayer,</p>\n<p id=\"AMk\">We nQW consider piaintiff\u2019s contention that as a tollpayer and user of the bridge he is a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">Although he makes no charge of malfeasance or irregularity against defendants, he argues that as a user of the bridge he has a direct interest in seeing that the provisions of the Act are fulfilled; that dissipation or misappropriation of the Commission\u2019s funds postpones the day when the bridge will become a free bridge and increases the amount in tolls which he has been and will be compelled to pay for the use of the bridge. He cites Freeland v. City of Sturgis, 248 Mich. 190, 226 N.W. 897. But that case was a suit by taxpayers against a city operating a municipally owned hydroelectric plant. It charged that the city was guilty of misapplication of receipts from the plant by using the receipts for general expenses of the city without retaining necessary funds for the payment of bonded indebtedness, and hence is not applicable to our case,</p>\n<p id=\"A6eG\">In disposing of this contention Judge Wham said: \u201cWas it the intention of the Congress by said provision of said Act to \u2018grant a free right of inspection\u2019 and to use the term \u2018persons interested\u2019 as indicating \u2018any persons sufficiently interested to re-quest the right of inspection\u2019 ? A careful consideration of the entire Act and the specific words \u2018for information of all persons interested\u2019 as used therein leads me to the conclusions (1) that said words may not be thus broadly interpreted and (2) that even if they were, plaintiff may not maintain this suit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adz\">\u201cIt seems to me that to give the words in question the broad interpretation insisted upon by plaintiff is to hold that the Congress, without any appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ent need, has imposed upon the Bridge Commission an unreasonable burden of standing in readiness to provide at all times for an inspection of its records by anyone interested enough to request the right of inspection. The number of such persons might well be legion. Such a burden might well become intolerable. If imposition of such burden were needed or would be reasonably required to protect the public interest it might be convincingly argued that the broad interpretation argued for by plaintiff was intended. But there would seem to be no necessity for such an unprecedented provision, if inter- , , .,, preted as plaintiff insists, m view of the <em>r </em>. . - , , \u2019 , provision made for the protection by , , ... , <em>rr \u25a0 i </em>, \u201e ... . duly qualified officials of all public m- , , , . terests that may be affected by any vi- , . . , . , , _ <em>J . . </em>olation of the Act by the Commission , ... , . ... or by any failure to comply with its : . <em>J </em>_ . . _ . <em>,J . </em>provisions. Section 12 of the Act pro-_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3M\">All provisions of this Act may be enforced or the violation thereof prevented by mandamus, injunction, or other appropriate remedy brought by the attorney general for the State of T11. . , , ,, Illinois, the attorney general for the c. , <em>\u00bf </em>T j- ,. tt -i ^ o. .

Undoubtedly, the officials named in said Section 12 are included. It is prob-able that bondholders are included under some circumstances,- as well as others who -have special claims that might be undermined by dissipation of moneys collected. Plaintiff seeks no relief except an establishment of his claimed right under the statute as \u25a0 a taxpayer and bridge user and tollpayer to examine the records and the en-forcement of that right by injunction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAA\">\u201cOn page. 26 of his Supplemental Brief plaintiff says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGv\">\u201e , A , ., . ,.

By , - , . ., , . . . analogy we find support therefor m what ., . T c- 00 tt \u2022 was said m L. Singer &amp; Sons v. Union Padfic Railroad Co_; 3n u s_ <em>2g5&gt; </em>61 S&gt;CL 254, 85 L.Ed. 198. That case involved an interpretation of the Transportation Act, <em>1920l </em>49' U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1. It provided that ,any \u201cparty \u00a1n interest\u201d could bring action t0 enj0in extensions of railroad lines which were undertaken without a certificate of convenience and necessity. The defendant kad constructed a spur to a newly con-structed market. Plaintiffs, commercial merchants doing business near the market, sought to enjoin this construction, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Supreme Court, in holding that plaintiffs were not a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d 311 U.S. at page 303-304, 61 S.Ct. at page 258 said: \u201cSuch a suit cannot be instituted by an individual unless he \u2018possesses something more than a common concern for obedience to law.\u2019 The general or common interest finds protection in the permission to sue granted to public authorities. An individual may have some special and peculiar interest which may be directly and materially affected by alleged unlawful action. * * * If such circumstances are shown he may sue; he is then [a] \u2018party in interest\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.
