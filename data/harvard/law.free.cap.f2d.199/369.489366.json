Sowers by the United States Department of the Interisr, Fish and Wildlife Service, authorizing the use of the employee\u2019s privately owned conveyanee, if desired, and the letter directed to the employee, Sowers, by W. R. Dillon, Acting Director, and the affidavit of Mrs. Lawrence M. Sowers, do not, taken together, constitute an adequate record upon which summary judgment should have been entered, it being the opinion of this court that proof revealing fully all the relevant circumstances of the case should be received before it could be properly determined whether the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671-2680, is appropriate-}y applicable to the circumstances of this action;</p>\n<p id=\"A79y\">The cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conform-ity with this order. See Estepp, Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Company, 6 Cir., 1952, 192 F.2d 889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
