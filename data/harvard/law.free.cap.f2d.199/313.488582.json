On the trial of the case the proprietor recovered judgment for damages against the defendant on account of the infringement in the sum of $312.00 and costs and also injunctive relief. It appeals from the judgment and contends that it is erroneous in that it awards too small an amount for damages which should have been awarded in the sum of $94,569.00. The appeal is rested on the pleadings and on the findings of fact made by the trial court as shown in the opinion of that court accompanying the judgment, reported as Advertisers Exchange v. Hinkley, D.C., 101 F.Supp. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The record here sufficiently establishes that the defendant in the case did infringe the plaintiff\u2019s copyright by causing 29 publications of items of its copyright matter to be made in the local newspaper at Clinton, Missouri, called the \u201cClinton Eye\u201d, and each publication was of 3,261 copies. The plaintiff drew its bill of complaint in 29 counts identical with each other except as a different issue of the newspaper and advertisement was set up. The contention the appellant made on the trial and urged on the appeal is that it was the duty of the court to award as damages one dollar for each infringing copy of the newspaper or 29 times 3,261 dollars, which makes 94,569 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">The provisions of the Act on which appellant relies are found in 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101. That section gives the proprietor of copyright the right to recover from an infringer \u201csuch damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement\u201d. But the copyright proprietor made no proof of actual damages or profits on account of the infringement. Its position was and is that the amount of recovery for infringement to which it became entitled must be determined by subsequent provisions of the section which prescribe a measure of damages for infringement to be awarded \u201cin lieu of actual damages and profits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">The \u201cin lieu\u201d provisions contained in the section include the following, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXz\">\u201c\u00a7 101. Infringement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AutV\">\u201cIf any person shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws * * * such person shall be liable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-j\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">\u201c(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor * * * in lieu of actual damages and profits, such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">\u201cSecond. In the case of any work enumerated in section 5 of this title<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * * $1 for every infringing copy made * * * by * * * the infringer or his agents * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYc\">Provisions prescribing a limitation upon the minimum and maximum amount of damages allowable \u201cin lieu o'f actual dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ages\u201d are also embodied in Section 101(b) which are specifically made applicable to -newspaper reproductions of copyright photographs and to certain infringements by -means of motion pictures, and then it is provided that \u201csuch damages [i. e. \u201cin lieu damages\u201d]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5,000 nor be less than the sum \u2022of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Then there is a provision that the limitation of the amount of recovery shall not apply to infringements occurring after the \u2018\u201cactual notice to a defendant, either by service of process in a suit or other written notice served upon him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Keeping these statutory provisions in mind, we turn first to the dispute between the parties as to whether the case \u25a0was one in which the court could award .actual damages or \u201csuch damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement\u201d within the terms of the \u2022statute. It was alleged in the complaint that \u201cthe damages which have been and may be suffered by the complainant are not capable of estimation\u201d and no evidence was \u2022offered to prove actual damage. When defendant\u2019s counsel attempted to show on \u2022cross examination of plaintiff\u2019s witness that plaintiff had suffered no actual damages objection was sustained and no such \u25a0evidence was received. There was, therefore, no basis for an award of damages in the amount of \u201cactual damages\u201d and there was no proof of loss of profits so that the \u201cin lieu\u201d provisions of the section alone must be looked to to fix the measure of the recovery of damages to which plaintiff was entitled on account of the infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">These provisions have been frequently considered and applied by the courts but we will first look independently at the wording in connection with the facts of the case. The section plainly declares that the infringer shall be liable to pay in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear just and that the court may in its discretion allow one dollar for every infringing copy made by the infringer\u2019s agents. If that were all it would scarcely be contended that the court would be compelled to award anything like Ninety Thousand Dollars in this case. It appeared to the district court that computing a dollar for each newspaper copy \u201cruns into a ridiculous amount\u201d, and so it does. It would not be \u201cjust\u201d nor compatible with judicial discretion or good sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We turn then to the limitation that \u201csuch damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5,000 nor be less than the sum of $250.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Appellant contends that the court could not apply that limitation in this case because of the provision of Section 101(b) that the limitation shall not apply to infringements occurring after the \u201cactual notice to a defendant\u201d and the fact.as found by the court in this case is that \u201cactual notice\u201d of the copyright was given to Mr. Hinkley in this case before the infringement in the letter to him of March 11, 1948, set forth in footnote 2 of the district court\u2019s opinion on page 804 of 101 F.Supp.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">We observe that if appellant\u2019s contention that the limitation is inapplicable be sustained, the appellant would be left as to its \u201cin lieu\u201d damages entirely to such damages \u201cas to the court shall appear to be just\u201d, arrived at in the exercise of judicial \u201cdiscretion\u201d up to the dollar a copy amount specified under \u201cSecond\u201d. To sustain the appellant\u2019s contention would not help to justify the judgment for $94,569 which it is seeking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">But this court in accord, as we think, with the Supreme Court, has held that the limitation provision of Section 101 (b) is applicable in such a case as is presented here. Although Mr. Hinkley had actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s copyright before he infringed, there was no law suit of which he had notice and he was not then \u201ca defendant\u201d within the contemplation of the statute. In Johns &amp; Johns Printing Co. v. Paull-Pioneer Music Corp., 8 Cir., 102 F.2d 282, 283, which was an appeal from a judgment for infringement of two copyrighted songs, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">\u201cNo proof of actual damages was offered or received on the trial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the court made no finding on that subject. Under these circumstances it is well settled that the discretion of the trial court in assessing statutory damages instead of actual damages is not reviewable. Douglas v. Cunningham, 294 U.S. 207, 55 S.Ct. 365, 79 L.Ed. 862. And in the absence of proof of both actual damages and. profits the trial court is required to award the minimum statutory sum of $250. Westermann Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U.S. 100, 39 S.Ct. 194, 63 L.Ed. 499; Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co. v. Buck, 283 U.S. 202, 51 S.Ct. 407, 75 L.Ed. 978; Douglas v. Cunningham, supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We think the cases cited from the Supreme Court fully support our decision and that it is controlling in this case to the extent that the limitation on the minimum amount of $250 and the maximum of $5,000 for \u201cin lieu\u201d damages contained in Section 101(b) must be applied in this case as in that one.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">But we were not confronted in that case with an attempt on the part of counsel to magnify and inflate the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cin lieu\u201d damages to an unconscionable great sum of money as has been attempted here. There the copyright lyrics of two very famous songs had been infringed, \u201cLet Me Call You Sweetheart\u201d and \u201cThe Sidewalks of New York\u201d, and \u201cin lieu\u201d damages were awarded in the sum of $250 in respect to the lyrics for each song plus an'attorney\u2019s fee. The infringer over a period of two years had copied, published and sold a pamphlet containing copies of the lyrics and it would undoubtedly have required no great ingenuity of counsel to have evolved a multiplicity of counts in the complaint as has been done here. But ther\u00e9 is no reason to hold that the court need be influenced in its award by such a device of pleading. The statute holds the \u201cin lieu\u201d damages down to \u201csuch damages as to the court shall appear to be just\u201d and that command is controlling. The minimum and maximum amounts are prescribed as to a \u201ccase\u201d and not as to counts that ingenuity may split a case into. The judgment awarding the plaintiff here an excess over $250, to-wit, $312 \u201cin lieu\u201d damages was clearly within the trial court\u2019s discretion and within the limitation of the statute and was fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It is argued for the appellee that a reading of the trial court\u2019s opinion shows that it found a certain amount of actual damages had been sustained by plaintiff and1 that it based the amount of its judgment on that finding. But we do not so understand the court\u2019s opinion. The court said, \u201cPlaintiff did not prove any specific damages or loss of profits\u201d, [101 F.Supp. 805] and we think it rendered its judgment with relation to that finding. We conclude that what was-said by the court following that explicit declaration was said in justification of the exercise of discretion in imposing the amount of \u201cin lieu\u201d damages arrived at. The court recognized its duty to impose just damages and not a penalty and in explanation of its exercise of discretion it stated what appeared to be \u201cthe only actual damages the plaintiff could possibly have suffered\u201d and that \u201cthe amount of damages suffered * * * would be * * * $312.\u201d' It did not find that actual damages in that or any amount had been established by pleading or proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s counsel had split the bill of complaint in the case up' into 29 counts, it was apparent that all that' was involved in the infringement was use of matter that had been obtained from' plaintiff in one transaction for use at $156-a year. The plaintiff\u2019s claim could just as well have been pleaded in one count. The court treated it as one case and gave damages which exceeded the statutory minimum, of $250 but which stopped short of imposing, any confiscatory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">An attorney\u2019s fee under section 40&gt; of the Act, 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 116, is prayed' for in this appeal and in cases where the copyright proprietor recovers for infringement, as it has done in this case, such allowance is usually appropriate. But we-cannot approve of counsel\u2019s attempt to inflate and exaggerate the claims in this case- and we deny allowance of attorney\u2019s fee. The \u201cin lieu\u201d provision of the statute is not' to accomplish the imposition of a penalty.as has been assayed here, but is an \u201cequit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>able substitute for cases which, present difficulty or impossibility of proof as to damages and profits\u201d.
