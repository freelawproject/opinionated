The basis for the demand for this extraordinary relief is that the district court has denied a motion for change of venue predicated upon a claim that the feeling against the defendants in the city where the case is to be tried has been aroused to the point where they .cannot get a fair trial. We do not think mandamus lies. The point raised can be reviewed normally and appropriately after final judgment, if that becomes necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">The motion will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
