The record of the District Court has been examined and it appears that petitioner\u2019s motion was entirely without merit. Petitioner had the benefit of counsel and through them entered a plea of guilty to the crime with which he was charged. Afterwards, at his own request, he took the stand and testified to the facts relating thereto. .\u2022 The District Judge properly refused to allow an appeal in forma pauperis from denial of the motion and found that the appeal was not taken in good faith. We find nothing in the record or in the allegations of petitioner which would justify us in bringing the case before us by certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-19\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
