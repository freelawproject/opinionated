The district judge having declined to issue a certificate of probable cause, the judges of this court have carefully examined the record to determine whether the appeal has enough merit to justify the issuance by them of such a certificate. Finding that it has hot, they decline to issue the certificate, and, on the motion of appellee, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Cf. Harris v. Ellis, 5 Cir., 194 F.2d 604, and Seymour v. Ellis, 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 495.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
