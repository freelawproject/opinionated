Applicant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He was confined in the District of Columbia reformatory at Lorton in the Eastern District of Virginia and filed petition for a writ of habeas corpus before one of the United States District Judges of that District alleging that he had been improperly convicted. The District Judge dismissed the petition for failure to make motion for relief before the sentencing court as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. This was clearly correct. Meyers v. Welch, 4 Cir., 179 F.2d 707, 708.</p>\n<p id=\"AGO\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
