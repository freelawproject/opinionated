If plaintiffs ever had, against defendant, a right of rescission and recovery back of premiums paid, and we do not think they did have, it is clear that the suit was barred by limitation, not only for the reasons given by the district judge, that they actually knew more than four years before they brought the suit that they had no insurable interest and, knowing, continued to pay the premiums, but because long before that time they could and should have known that this was so.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The representation complained of was not one of fact but of law, and, while such a representation may under appropriate circumstances- be the basis of a claim for fraud,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the fraud was not in the concealment of the cause of action, and the statute of limitations commenced to run against the suit to rescind and recover the premiums paid from the time the plaintiffs by reasonable diligence ought to have discovered that the law had been misstated to .them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">In addition, it is the settled law of Texas that the absence in the beneficiaries of an insurable interest did not avoid the' policy in. this case or prevent the beneficiaries from recovering on it as trustees for the insured or his estate if, instead of expiring according to its terms, the policy had matured into a claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">Unlike in the cases cited by appellant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which, though Texas cases, dealt with contracts made in Mexico which were void <em>ab initio, </em>and as to which no risk was assumed by the insurer, the policy contract in this suit was not void but fully enforceable against the insurer. The theory and justification therefore for allowing a recovery of premiums paid, on which those decisions were based, that if a policy is void its issuance exposes the company to no risk, and no consideration having been given for the premiums paid, they should be returned,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does n\u00aet apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">The true situation of the insurer in this case was very well stated in the letter<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>written -by defendant to Mrs. Gammill in reply to her inquiry i\u00f1 May, 1947, whether, if her sons had no insurable interest, the company would refund the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Further, it is the settled law in Texas that persons without insurable' interests, who in good faith pay premiums, would be entitled to a claim against the proceeds of the policy for their repayment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The law standing thus, it would be inequitable under the facts of this case to permit the plaintiffs to wait until the policy had expired and the company had carried the risk for its full term and then recover back premiums which, with interest, would be in excess of the face amount of the policy. Particularly is this so since, after receiving notice in 1947 of their lack of insurable interest, they continued to pay the premiums.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Finally, all these considerations aside, whatever might be said as to the liability of Planet, the record wholly fails to show any basis for a claim against Pyramid. Indeed it establishes beyond question that what Pyramid assumed was not a general obligation to make good Planet\u2019s promises and defaults but a specific obligation to carry out in accordance therewith the specific terms and conditions of the policy assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The same undisputed evidence shows: that Pyramid was in no way at fault in the original issuance of the policy; that nothing in its assumption agreement or in the insurance file put it upon notice of the claimed fraud of Planet or imposed any liability upon it to answer therefor. First States Life Co. v. Stroud, Tex.Civ.App., 120 S.W.2d 491, relied on by appellants for the contrary view, is an entirely different case. There the suit was not, as here, against the reinsurer for rescission of the contract and recovery of premiums paid on account of a claimed fraud of the original insurer in connection with the&gt; issuance of the policy. The suit, on the contrary, was brought by the reinsurer against the assured for fraud in obtaining the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Had Pyramid, during the life of the policy, undertaken to cancel it for fraud in the application, it could undoubtedly have done so, since, in assuming and reinsuring \u201cthe liability of the Planet Life under its policy and contracts of insurance * * * \u201d, it \u2022did so, \u201csubject to any and all defenses against claims and actions upon said policies which would have been available to said Planet Life\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">It is quite another thing, however, to hold, as appellants ask us to do, that Pyramid, which is liable under and because of its assumption agreement only upon policies issued by Planet and in force when assumed, can, after the policy has expired according to its terms, be held liable in a suit, not for the enforcement of the policy according to its terms, but in a suit for the rescission of the policy and the recovery back of all premiums paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">There was neither legal nor equitable basis for plaintiffs\u2019 suit. The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-15\">. This policy, along with others which had been issued by the Planet Insurance Co. was assumed under a reinsurance agreement executed by defendant with the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>proval of the Board of Insurance Commissioners of the State of Texas and the District Judge of the 98th District Court of Travis County, Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. The substance of these was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-8\">That the representations respecting the policy were made by the soliciting agent, D. T. Grammar, as claimed, and that the Holland brothers had no insurable interest in their uncle\u2019s life;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-10\">That Grammar had no authority from the Planet Company to represent to the Holland brothers they could collect the insurance policy, and that said company did not know of the representations having been made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-11\">That there is no evidence that The Planet Insurance Co. at the time it issued said policy or at any subsequent time had knowledge of the fact that the Holland brothers had no insurable interest in the life of Tom Holland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-12\">That in cause No. 56874 in the 98th Dist. Court of Travis County, Texas, styled The State of Texas v. Planet Insurance Co., a receiver was appointed for said Planet Insurance Co.; that said receiver for the Planet Insurance Co., with the approval of the Chairman of the Board of Insurance Commissioners of tho State of Texas and the court, entered into a re-insurance agreement whereby said policy No. 8950, along with other policies issued by The Planet Insurance Co., were reinsured and assumed by the defendant, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy and the reinsurance above mentioned, and insofar as said policy No. 3950 is concerned the defendant issued its Assumption Certificate No. 22607;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-17\">That from the date of the issuance of said policy by Planet until the assumption of said policy by the defendant, the Holland brothers timely paid to Planet all premiums due under said policy, and subsequent to the assumption of said policy by the defendant Holland brothers timely paid to the defendant all premiums due on said policy through April 10, 1951.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-18\">That at no time prior to June 25, 1951. when it received a letter from plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, did the defendant know of the alleged fraudulent representations made by Grammar, above mentioned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-19\">That Mrs. Texie Pearl Holland (Mrs. M. A. Gammill) was her sons\u2019 duly authorized agent to deal with the appellee with respect to the Tom Holland policy, and, as such and on their behalf, she received knowledge more than four years prior to the filing of the suit that her sons were without insurable interest and notwithstanding this continued to pay the premiums until the end of the term.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-21\">. These are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-22\">\u201cIn view of the foregoing findings, I have concluded that there is no action<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>able fraud that would form the basis of any recovery by the plaintiffs from the defendant herein. I have further concluded that even though plaintiffs might have had a cause of action against the defendant based on the fraudulent representations alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the plaintiffs (the Holland brothers) became aware of said alleged fraudulent representations within two or three days subsequent to May 23, 1947, and since this suit was not instituted until July 2, 1951, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is barred by the four year statute of limitation of the State of Texas, namely, Article 5529, Yernon\u2019s Ann.Oiv.St.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">In view of the foregoing findings and conclusions I do not deem it necessary to consider any of the other questions presented in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\">.
