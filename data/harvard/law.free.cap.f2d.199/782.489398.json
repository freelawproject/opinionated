The defendant counterclaimed to recover from plaintiffs dividends received by them on said shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they were bona fide owners of all the stock at the time of vesting, and therefore entitled to a return, was opposed by the contention that plaintiffs held the shares for German nationals and had conspired to cloak and conceal true ownership from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">The trial court\u2019s findings sustained the defendant\u2019s claim as to 408 shares, and the judgment denied return of same-. The counterclaim for dividends received by plaintiffs on those shares was also granted, with interest on the amounts thereof, but an off-set for federal income taxes paid on such dividends was allowed. As to the remaining 402 shares, the court\u2019s findings sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they were the true owners through bona fide purchase for their own benefit. Accordingly, the court ordered -return of those shares. Reference is made to the findings and conclusions of the trial judge, Vort v. McGrath, D.C.D.C.1951, 99 F.Supp. 57, and to his supplemental opinion, 108 F.Supp. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">In our opinion the findings are supported by substantial evidence; are not clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore should stand; also, the conclusions are in all respects correct. Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\">.
