Attys., Jacksonville, Fla., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b909-7\">Before BORAH, STRUM, and RIVES, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b909-8\">STRUM, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Appellant was convicted of having made and used a false document in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, knowing the same to contain false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. The trial was before a district judge, a jury having been waived. On appeal, the sole question is the sufficiency of the evidence to connect appellant with the \u201cmaking and use\u201d of the false document.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">There is evidence from which it could be reasonably found that appellant\u2019s co-defendant below, one Middleton, proposed to appellant Driver that a spurious income tax return be filed in Driver\u2019s name for the year 1950, which would show that sums withheld from Driver\u2019s salary by an employer overpaid his tax liability by $104.68, thus entitling Driver to a refund in that amount. Accordingly, a return falsely showing these facts was prepared by Middleton in appellant\u2019s name and submitted to the Collector of Internal Revenue at Jacksonville, who approved the claim for refund and mailed appellant a check for the sum claimed as overpaid. Both the employer and the sums allegedly withheld were entirely fictitious. Appellant and Middleton were fellow inmates of the Florida state prison at all times here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Appellant received the refund check, endorsed it, and deposited it to his account in the prison bank, which theretofore stood at zero. Shortly thereafter appellant drew against it checks aggregating $10.00, apparently for his own use, and two checks aggregating $40.00, the proceeds of which were transmitted through another prisoner to Middleton as his share of the proceeds of the fraud. While not seriously disputing these facts, appellant insists that they do not prove that he participated in the \u201cmaking or use\u201d of the false statement, which is the gravamen of the offense, but only that he received the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">It is clear that Middleton master-minded the project, and that he prepared and submitted the false return in appellant\u2019s name, as one of a series of false returns prepared by Middleton along the same general lines at about the same time. In an effort to exonerate appellant, Middleton testified that he did not discuss the matter with appellant, nor advise appellant of his plans, until after he, Middleton, had prepared and mailed the false statement. But this does not square with appellant\u2019s own testimony that he talked with Middleton about the plan \u201caround Christmas,\u201d 1950, and again in the early part of January, 1951. The return was not received by the Collector until January 15, 1951, well after these two conversations. There is ample testimony to support the trial judge\u2019s findings that appellant was aware of the plan, was a willing party to it, and knowingly acquiesced in the use of his name in furtherance of it. Appellant\u2019s ready acceptance of the refund check, and his prompt division of the proceeds with Middleton, strongly corroborate this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Of course, appellant also denied that he authorized Middleton to submit the return in appellant\u2019s name, claiming that he in fact told him not to do so. But the district judge, weighing this denial against the many countervailing circumstances in the evidence, was not convinced. It was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude from all the circumstances, as he did, that since Middleton\u2019s only object was to get money for himself, and since the refund would be sent to appellant who would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\u25a0complete control over its disposition, Middleton would not have submitted the return in appellant\u2019s name without first securing his authority to use his name, and an agreement as to the division of the \u25a0spoils, which would constitute appellant an \u25a0aider and abettor in the use of the false return. It is contended for appellant that he accepted the proceeds and divided with Middleton because he stood in fear of Middleton and agreed only through coercion. This contention is refuted by appellant\u2019s own testimony that he was \u201cnever afraid \u25a0of Clarence Middleton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">On the whole, the conclusion of the trial judge that the false return was \u201cmade and used\u201d for the purpose stated with appellant\u2019s knowledge, consent and co-operation, thus constituting him an aider and abettor, is supported by the evidence. Compare McCoy v. U. S., 9 Cir., 169 F.2d 776, certiorari denied 335 U.S. 898, 69 S.Ct. 298, 93 L.Ed. 433; Backun v. U. S., 4 Cir., 112 F.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
