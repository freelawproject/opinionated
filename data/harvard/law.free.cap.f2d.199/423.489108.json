Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055; that inconvenience to the defendant is not established by citing the number of witnesses for the plaintiff who live outside the district where the suit was begun nor by the defendants answering and appearing in a pre-trial proceeding before the District Judge prior to seeking removal; that it will not serve the plaintiff\u2019s convenience in securing the testimony of the driver of the defendant\u2019s car who is no longer in the defendant\u2019s employ and who lives in the Eastern District of Michigan where compulsory pi-ocess may be obtained, nor to the plaintiff\u2019s convenience in dismissing its Detroit counsel and retaining counsel in Grand Rapids. We, therefore, perceive no abuse of discretion in the denial of the respondent\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The petition for mandamus is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
