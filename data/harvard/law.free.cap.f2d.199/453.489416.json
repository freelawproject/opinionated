So standing it presents nothing whatever for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">No error is, or could be, assigned to any matter or thing occurring on the trial. The record shows that nothing occurred except the indictment, the entry of a plea of not guilty, the withdrawal of that plea, the entry of a plea of guilty, the judgment of conviction, the motion for reduction of sentence, and its denial. Nothing is pointed to, nothing appears in the record on which a claim of error is, or could be, assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
