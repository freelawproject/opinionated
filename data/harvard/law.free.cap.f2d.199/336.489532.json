The evidence established without contradiction that appellants, who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, disguised themselves in the regalia of the Klan and seized a man and woman at the woman\u2019s residence in North Carolina, forcibly carried them to a lonely spot in South Carolina where they were given a flogging and told to stop living together and making liquor and to attend church.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\"> It is contended that no violation of the kidnapping statute was alleged or proven because the abduction and transportation of the persons flogged was not for ransom or reward or other benefit to appellants. There is no merit in this contention. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the case of Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 127-128, 56 S.Ct. 395, 397, 80 L.Ed. 522, the purpose of the amendment made by the Act of May 18, 1934 to the kidnapping act was to \u201cextend Federal jurisdiction under the act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason, except that a kidnaping by a parent of his child is specifically exempted. * * * \u201d There is nothing to the contrary in Chatwin v. United States, 326 U.S. 455, 66 S.Ct. 233, 237, 90 L.Ed. 198, which held merely that the statute could not be applied to \u201csituations lacking the involuntariness of seizure and detention which is the very essence of the crime of kidnaping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-23\">The kidnapping statute as passed in 1932 required that the transported person be held \u201cfor ransom or reward\u201d. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>amendment of 1934, Congress enlarged the purpose and coverage of the act by inserting the words \u201cor otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof\u201d. The purpose of the amendment was set forth in the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee (Sen.Rep. No. 534, 73rd Cong. 2nd Session), quoted in a note to the opinion in Gooch v. United States supra, as follows: \u201c * * * The object of the addition of the word \u2018otherwise\u2019 is to extend the jurisdiction of this act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason.\u201d The House Judiciary Committee gave the purpose of the amendment (H.Rep. 1457, 73rd Congress, May 3, 1934), quoted in the body of the opinion in the Gooch case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A17\">\u201cThis bill, as amended, proposes three changes in the act known as the \u2018Federal Kidnaping Act.\u2019 First, it is proposed to add the words \u2018or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof.\u2019 This will extend Federal jurisdiction under the act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason, except that a kidnaping by a parent of his child is specifically exempted. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The lower federal courts have held that interstate transportation of a kidnapped person for the following purposes is punishable under the act, viz.: The extortion of a confession to enhance the reputation of the kidnapper as a detective, United States v. Parker, 3 Cir., 103 F.2d 857; securing the services of the kidnapped person by the kidnappers, Miller v. United States, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 715; robbery and the prevention of reporting of the crime, Langston v. United States, 8 Cir., 153 F.2d 840; securing transportation in the victim\u2019s automobile, Wheatley v. United States, 4 Cir., 159 F.2d 599, fiOO; the transportation of the kidnappers to aid his escape from penal confinement, United States v. McGrady, 7 Cir., 191 F.2d 829; the placing of the victim in a house of prostitution, United States v. Bazell, 7 Cir., 187 F.2d 878; the rape of the victim, Poindexter v. United States, 8 Cir., 139 F.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">It is argued that no conspiracy to violate the statute was shown because it is not alleged or proven that there was an intent to cross the state line. We need not consider this cont\u00e9ntion, however, since the same sentences were imposed under the conspiracy counts of the indictment as were imposed under the substantive counts and, since the sentences ran concurrently and those imposed under the substantive counts were unquestionably proper, any error with respect to the offense charged in the conspiracy counts, if there was error, would necessarily be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
