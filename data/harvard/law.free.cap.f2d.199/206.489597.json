The power sold to the Navy and to Mineral County is generated in and transmitted from petitioner\u2019s Northern Division plants in California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Most of it comes from three plants in petitioner\u2019s Mono Basin system, these being hydroelectric projects licensed by the Commission under \u00a7 4(e) of Part I of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 797(e), to operate on the public lands. The energy sold the Navy is delivered to Navy-owned transmission lines at petitioner\u2019s Mill Creek plant in Mono County, California. From there it flows through the Navy\u2019s line across the California-Nevada state boundary to the Naval Depot at Hawthorne, Nevada. Similarly the electric energy sold Mineral County is delivered at the Mill Creek plant to Mineral County, which transmits the energy across the state border over its own line for resale to consumers in Mineral County, These lines in each instance are 55,000 volt transmission lines. At Hawthorne, Nevada, the energy in both instances is transformed to lower voltages for distribution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeG\">As regards the Navy, the power it purchases or generates is used to operate the Navy\u2019s various facilities at the Depot, and, in addition, to supply the needs of the occupants of a housing project which was built for and is occupied by civilian employees of the Depot, as well as the energy needs of the operators of the Depot\u2019s various concessions. Each housing or business unit has a separate meter, and the occupant thereof is billed and required to pay for the energy which he consumes, From 1943 to 1948,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between 15.4% and 28.6% of the Navy\u2019s yearly total power supply was resold to these residents and business concessions, the amount resold averaging 18.7% of the yearly total. By contract entered int0 in 1943 Petitioner and the Nav^ aSreed uPon the rates to be charged for the ener^ furnished. This contract was not filed with the Powef Commission as a rate scbedtde, but petitioner charged the contract rates until 1948&gt; when * ob\u2018 tamed from the California Public Utilities Commission a rate increase m respect of certam designated customers, including ^av7&gt; whom petitioner was serving under sPecial contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">The properties and facilities of the Mineral County power system belong to and are operated by the County under the direction of its Board of Commissioners who ex-officio constitute the board of managers of the county-owned facility. Petitioner has sold to the County the power required for the system under a series of three-year contracts providing that at rates set forth in the contract petitioner would furnish and the County would purchase all of the ener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>gy required by the latter for resale and distribution to the ultimate consumers in the state of Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"Abuf\">Petitioner argues that since it is a licensee under Part I of the Federal Power Act its rates to Navy and to Mineral County are to be regulated by the Commissions of Nevada and California under \u00a7 20 of the Act, and that they are not subject to regulation under Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 201, 205 and 206.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contention is not different from that made and rejected in Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 343 U.S. 414, 418, 72 S.Ct. 843, where the Court said that Part II proceeds on the assumption that regulation of public utilities transmitting and selling power at wholesale in interstate commerce is a matter which necessarily must be accomplished by the Federal government. It was thought that the program formulated by the Act would 'be hindered, not helped, if Part I licensees were held impliedly exempt from the more expansive regulation provided by Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"AcV\">The transactions in question manifestly constitute sales by a public utility of electrie energy in interstate commerce. It is of no moment that petitioner\u2019s facilities for the transmission and sale of the energy are all located in California and that those used to transmit it across the line into Nevada are owned by the purchasers of the energy. Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam &amp; Electric Co., 273 U.S. 83, 47 S.Ct. 294, 71 L.Ed. 549; Federal Power Commission v. Arizona Edison Co., 9 Cir., 194 F.2d 679.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor is it of consequence, as the petitioner contends, that in one instance the energy is transmitted across the state line by the United States, Federal Power Commission v. Arizona Edison Co., supra, 194 F.2d at page 681. The question is not whether the United States is in, interstate commerce, but whether petitioner is. But it is urged that sales to the United States or to Mineral County are not at wholesale within the Act\u2019s in-tendment since \u00a7 201(d) defines sales at wholesale as sales to any <em>person </em>for resale&lt; and nelther the United States nor Mmeral County is by definition a person, Sections 3(4) and 3(3) of Part I and 201 ^art ^ 1dle ^ct are aPPeale&lt;i t0 in suPPort of the argument. Section 3(4) defines the word \u2018Vrson\u2019\u2019 as meaning \u201can individual or a corporation\u2019, and \u00a7 3(3), defining \u201ccorporation,\u201d excludes municiPalltles from the definition. Section 201(f) will be. noticed in a moment,</p>\n<p id=\"AAC\">The argument here predicated on \u00a7 201 (d) was made to the Seventh Circuit in the recent case of Wisconsin-Michigan Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 197 F.2d 472, where a number of municipalities were involved as purchasers for resale, Upon consideration of the legislative history and gradual development of the several provisions of the Act, together with the policy of the legislation as a whole, the court concluded, 197 F.2d at page 479, that Congress did not intend to exclude from definition of sales at wholesale sales t0 municipalities for resale. It thought that to construe the Act as the power comPally contended would be to neglect other provisions, such as \u00a7\u00a7 306 and 313(a), reling 1\u00b0 complaints by municipalities, and leave those bodies open to the rankest discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"Atb\">We agree with the Seventh Circuit that reference back to the early definitions contained in Part I should not be permitted to thwart the general policy manifested by the statute as a whole. It seems more than probable that the significance of those definitions was overlooked in the later formulation of Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"AmF\">Nor is \u00a7 201(f) of help to the petitioner. This section, states that \u201cNo provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>this Part shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a State * * \u201d It is clear that the intended exclusion or exemption is from the regulatory burdens of the statute. For the purposes of the Act these public bodies are simply not deemed to be public utilities. But it would be inconsistent with the policy of the legislation, as well as with certain of its provisions already mentioned, to hold that, as wholesale purchasers of power, they are excluded from the benefits of the regulation of the utilities from which they buy. The entire thrust of Part II is toward the seller at wholesale, not the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"APxS\">Petitioner\u2019s sales to Mineral County are substantially in their entirety sales of energy for resale. But in respect of the United States it is contended, on several grounds, that the sale to the Navy is not for resale within the intendment of the Act. The principal of these grounds is that only a minor percentage of the amount sold the Navy was resold by it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Another objection to Commission jurisdiction is that the Navy resells at a low rate; and a third is that petitioner\u2019s contract made no reference to resale and that petitioner did not intend to sell for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">We turn first to the latter objections. The Commission found as a fact that the energy in question was resold to ultimate consumers and consumed in Nevada. It found also that petitioner had knowledge of the resales. We are not persuaded that an express agreement or an intention on the Company\u2019s part that the energy shall be resold is required in order to confer jurisdiction. It appears without dispute that the only reason the service was not rendered by the local electric utility (Mineral County) was the latter\u2019s financial inability to undertake the business, hence the necessity of the Navy\u2019s action. As to the rate at which the Navy sells, we agree with the Commission that the public interest is involved in the Company\u2019s rate to. the Navy, whether the burden of possibly excessive rates were to fall on the ultimate consumer of the energy or on the nation\u2019s taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"Aut\">Petitioner\u2019s argument of lack of jurisdiction based on the percentage of power resold seems finally to have resolved itself down to the proposition that the percentage consumed by the Navy should be held subject t0 State regulation, and only the part resold regarded as subject to regulation by the Commission. In rebuttal the Commission cites Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 319 U.S. 61, 63 S.Ct. 953, 87 L.Ed. 1258; Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 324 U.S. 515, 65 S.Ct. 749, 89 L.Ed. 1150; and Hartford Electric Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 131 F.2d 953, certiorari denied, 319 U.S. 741, 63 S.Ct. 1028, 87 L.Ed. 1698, dealing with commingled flows of outstate and intrastate energy. It is unnecessary to discuss these cases in view of the very recent decision in Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, supra, which deals with the same problem, Although the situations are not identical, we are inclined to think that the Penn Water case in principle disposes of petitioner\u2019s argument. There the power company contested the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate its sales in Pennsylvania to Pennsylvania utilities on the ground that 83% of the energy so sold was intrastate energy developed in Pennsylvania, only 17% coming from Maryland. The Court said tha-t the Commission \u201chas complete authority to regulate all of this commingled power flow.\u201d [343 U.S. 414, 72 S.Ct. 846.]</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\">Here, as in the Penn Water case, the supposed non jurisdictional part of the energy is indistinguishable at the point of sale from the remainder. Moreover the amount resold is not constant, but fluctuating. The Conamission contends that it is not practicable to segregate the jurisdictional from the alleged nonjurisdictional part. It seems clear, although petitioner contends otherwise, that the only mode of segregation would be by separating the two loads and supplying each by an independent trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>mission line from the point of metering and purchase to the Depot.</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">In virtually all sales of power to a pub-lie body, such as a municipality, we would suppose that some part of the energy is used by the purchaser for its own purposes, the rest being resold to the consuming pub-lie. It would create untold difficulty and confusion if petitioner s argument in respect of severability for rate regulation purposes were to be given countenance.</p>\n<p id=\"ANC\">The Commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AeV\">. The Commission found that petitioner\u2019s facilities utilized in these sales are f\u00e1cilities used for the transmission of electric energy in bulk, not for local distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEq\">. In addition to the energy purchased from petitioner, the Navy generates a small part (approximately 7.5% of the amount purchased from the petitioner) of its own requirements on three Diesel generators located at the Naval Depot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Apj\">, The present proceeding was begun by order to show cause issued February 15, 1950.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A1W\">. The Commission found that the Nevada Commission has not been given jurisdiction by Nevada statutes over petitioner\u2019s charges to Mineral County or to the United States as contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 19 or 20, hence alternative jurisdiction is by those sections conferred upon the Federal Power Commission. Petitioner assails the finding, but we think it unnecessary to resolve the dispute,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AF0\">. Sec. 201(c) of the Act provides that \u201celectric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. As observed above, the actual percentage of power resold fluctuated rather widely, averaging 18.7% of the yearly total.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
