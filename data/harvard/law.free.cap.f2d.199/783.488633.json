Acting under the President\u2019s Loyalty Program,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a Deputy Administrator proposed Kutchfr\u2019s removal upon charges of membership in and activities connected with the Socialist Workers Party, an organization listed iby the Attorney General as seeking \u201cto alter the form of government o&gt;f the United States by unconstitutional means.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The charges were heard before a Branch Loyalty Board of the Veterans Administration., Kutcher attended with counsel; admitted membership in the Socialist Workers Party; and testified concerning his political beliefs. The Board found upon all the evidence that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d existed for 'belief that Kutcher was \u201cdisloyal to the Government of the United States, in accordance with standards [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] set forth in Executive Order No. 9835 dated March 21, 1947,\u201d and recommended his removal from employment by the Veterans Administration. He appealed to the Administrator and was suspended pending the outcome.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Administrator also found against Kutcher. However, his decision was not based upon any declared belief in Kutcher\u2019s disloyalty, but rested solely upon the ground of Kutcher\u2019s admitted membership in the Socialist Workers Party, which the Attorney General had determined to be \u201can organization that seeks to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\u201d These facts, the Administrator concluded, left him \u201cno choice but to affirm,\u201d as \u201cThe Veterans Administration is bound by that determination of the Attorney General.\u201d As authority for this conclusion the Administrator cited a directive of the Loyalty Review Board,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> issued after the Branch Board\u2019s decision against Kutcher. This document referred to a designation by the Attorney General of certain organizations, including the Socialist Workers Party, as seeking \u201c \u2018to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means,\u2019 \u201d and asserted that if an employee or applicant is found to be a member of one of the designated organizations, removal, or refusal of employment, \u201cis mandatory.\u201d Appeal was taken from the Administrator\u2019s decision to the Loyalty Review Board. They affirmed, upon the ground of Kutcher\u2019s active membership in the Socialist Workers Party, and requested his removal by the Veterans Administration. In so ruling the Board adhered to its Memorandum No. 32 of December 17, 1948, and held that \u201cIn accordance with the Regulations and Directives of the Loyalty Review Board, the Socialist Workers Party is an organization within the purview of Section 9A of the Hatch Act [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and Mr. Kutcher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>removal is mandatory.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">As a result of the foregoing proceedings Kutcher was removed 'by the Adminstrator. He then filed a complaint in the District Court praying for reinstatement to his position and for other related relief. Answers were filed with supporting papers, which brought before the District Court the record of the administrative proceedings. Whereupon cross-motions were filed for summary judgment. Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. rule 56, 28 U.S.'C.A. The defendants\u2019 motion was granted and judgment entered accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The discharge of Kutcher is attacked on several grounds, ranging from irregularity in the administrative proceedings to unconstitutionality of \u00a7 9A of the Hatch Act and the Executive Order. We shall deal only with those questions essential to the disposition we are making of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">It is contended here, as in the District Court, that although the Executive Order required a definitive determination by the Administrator, head of the Agency, as to Kuteher\u2019s loyalty, no such determination was made by that officer; therefore that Kutcher was deprived of the requisite review and decision by the Administrator and as a result his discharge was illegal and of no effect. The District Court rejected this contention and adopted that of the defendants. It held that Kutcher had been \u201cinitially removed\u201d 'by the Branch Loyalty Board upon their finding, supported by evidence, that reasonable grounds existed for 'belief that he was disloyal, according to standards set forth in Executive Order No. 9835; that the action of the Branch Board in removing Kutcher had been \u201caffirmed\u201d by the Administrator and the Loyalty Review Board, and that \u201cThe grounds for the affirmation were immaterial.\u201d The practical result of this ruling was to give final effect to the Branch Board\u2019s decision, notwithstanding Kutcher\u2019s appeal to the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Proceedings governing removal of a disloyal employee from the public service are laid down iby Executive Order No. 9835. If the employee be a \u201cpreference eligible,\u201d the administrative process must also conform to requirements of \u00a7 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although sufficiency of the notice to Kutcher is not questioned, the point is made that his discharge could not have been for \u201cefficiency of the service,\u201d as the Preference Act contemplates. In support of this proposition reference is made to undisputed evidence that Kutcher had performed his duties efficiently and that his position was of a \u201cnonsensitive\u201d nature. But \u00a7 14 has reference to efficiency of the public service as a whole, rather than efficiency of performance by a Single employee. So we think it cannot be argued that removal of a disloyal employee is not promotive of the \u201cefficiency of the service,\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 14. As the President declared in his Order 9835, \u201cit is of vital importance that persons employed in the Federal service be of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States.\u201d Furthermore, it is well settled \u201cthat the administrative determination. by the employing agency of what constitutes cause for discharge will not be judicially reviewed.\u201d Carter v. Forrestal, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 54, 175 F.2d 364, 365, certiorari denied, 1949, 338 U.S. 832, 70 S.Ct. 47, 94 L.Ed. 507, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">We come then to the crucial question. Did Kutcher have the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>benefits of Executive Order 9835? Standing accused of disloyalty as a cause for removal from employment, he was entitled to the benefit of all the safeguards provided by that Order. It was necessary for the proceedings to conform in all substance to the requirements of the Order. United States v. Wickersham, 1906, 201 U.S. 390, 26 S.Ct. 469, 50 L.Ed. 798; Deak v. Pace, 1950, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 185 F.2d 997; Borak v. Biddle, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 141 F.2d 278, certiorari denied, 1944, 323 U.S. 738, 65 S.Ct. 42, 89 L.Ed. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Turning to the Order we find that each department and agency head is charged with personal responsibility for effective execution of the Loyalty Program in his department or agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He is directed to appoint one or more \u201cloyalty boards\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for the purpose of hearing loyalty cases arising within his department or agency <em>and making recommendations with respect to the removal </em>of any officer or employee therein <em>on grounds relating to loyally.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A recommendation of removal by a loyalty board is \u201csubject to appeal\u201d before removal, to the <em>head of the employing </em>agency, and 'his decision is subject to appeal to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Loyalty Review Board <em>\u201cfor an advisory </em>recommendation\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Provision is made for establishment of the Loyalty Review Board within the Civil Service Commission,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with \u201cauthority to review cases involving persons recommended for dismissal on grounds relating to loyalty by the loyalty board [<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] of any department or agency and <em>to make advisory recommendations thereon to the head of the employing department or </em>agency.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Finally, there is the provision that \u201cThe standard for the refusal of employment or the removal from employment * * * on grounds relating to loyalty shall be that, on all the evidence, reasonable grounds exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United State\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\"> In the light of these explicit provisions of the Executive Order we think there can be no doubt that the decision of the Branch Board was in legal effect exactly what the Executive Order declares it should be, a \u201crecommendation\u201d to the Administrator for Kutcher\u2019s removal. It was just that,- \u2014 nothing more. The final decision rested with the Administrator. Upon him fell the duty to impartially determine on all the evidence whether there were reasonable grounds for belief that Kutcher was disloyal to the Government of the United States. That was the' ultimate, the controlling issue. Kutcher was entitled to the Administrator\u2019s decision of that very question. But the Administrator neither considered nor decided it. Instead, following the dictum of the Loyalty Review Board in its Memorandum No. 32, the Administrator held only that Kutcher's admitted membership in the Socialist Workers Party made his removal mandatory under \u00a7 9A of the Hatch Act, in accordance with the Attorney General\u2019s determination that the organization was one which sought to alter our form of Government by unconstitutional means. This is in substance the contention now made here by appellees. But that argument has-its fatal weakness. Neither \u00a7 9A of the Hatch Act nor the Executive Order does in terms proscribe membership in the Socialist Workers Party by an employee, and neither Congress nor the President has seen fit to make membership in any organization designated by the Attorney General cause for removal from Government em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ployment. On the contrary, the Executive Order, coming after the Hatch Act and designed in part to implement that Act in a fair and practicable way, makes disloyalty the test, and membership in organizations designated by the Attorney General, including those seeking to alter the form of Government by unconstitutional means, merely a factor \u201cwhich may be considered in connection with the determination of disloyalty.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If any clarification is needed for this provision, which seems to us very clear, it is found in a statement of the President, November 14, 1947,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that \u201c \u2018Membership in an organization is simply one piece of evidence which may or may not be helpful in arriving at a conclusion as to the action which is to be taken in a particular case.\u2019 \u201d So too, the Attorney General in transmitting his list of subversive organizations to the Loyalty Review Board advised that \u201c \u2018In connection with the designation of these organizations I wish to reiterate, as the President has pointed out, that it is entirely possible that many persons belonging to such organizations may be loyal to the United States; that membership in, affiliation with or sympathetic association with, any organization designated, is simply one piece of evidence which may or may not be helpful in arriving at a conclusion as to the action which is to be taken in a particular case. * * *\u2019 (Letter of November 24, 1947 to Seth W. Richardson, Chairman, Loyalty Review Board, Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C.)\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is significant too that although 'the Executive Order was promulgated March 21, 1947, nothing has since been done by Congress or the President to alter the original scheme of the Loyalty Progr\u00e1m instituted by Executive Order No. 9835, making disloyalty to the Government the bar\u2019 to employment, rather than membership or activity in a designated organization. Although the Executive' Order empowers' the Loyalty Review Board to make rules not inconsistent with provisions of the Order and advise departments and agencies on problems relating to employee loyalty,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we \u2022must conclude from the plain\" provisions of the Order that the ruling or advice of the Board in its Memorandum 32 is inconsistent with these provisions. Therefore' it is without validity or force and should be disregarded. Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 1944, 322 U.S. 607, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 88 L.Ed. 1488; Waite v. Macy, 1918, 246 U.S. 606, 38 S.Ct. 395, 62 L.Ed. 892; Hamilton National Bank v. District of Columbia, 1946, 81 U.S.App. D.C. 200, 203, 156 F.2d 843, 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">We do not mean to suggest that membership in and activities connected with a designated organization may not, in the circumstances of a case, justify disbelief in the loyalty of an employee. Obviously such evidence might fairly support that conclusion, and so require an employee\u2019s removal. Yet in each instance it rests with the head of the department or agency to make the final and controlling determination. In this case, involving Kiutcher\u2019s loyalty, the vital question still awaits the Administrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">One other contention must be noticed. Appellant attacks the competency as evidence of the designation by the Attorney General of the Socialist Workers Party as an organization seeking to alter our form of government by unconstitutional means. This action resulted from - the Executive Order, which 'charts the procedure for carrying out the Loyalty Program. As we have shown, the Order requires the Department of Justice to furnish the Loyalty Review Board with the names of organizations inimicable to our form of. government, including those seeking to alter its form by unconstitutional means.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>rects the Boat'd' to disseminate that information to all departments and agencies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It also provides, as heretofore indicated, that membership in or affiliation with any organization designated by the Attorney General as seeking to alter the form of Government by unconstitutional means may be considered in determining the question of disloyalty.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In fulfillment -of these -express provisions of the Executive Order the Socialist Workers Party came to be -classified by the Attorney General as an organization of that character, and was so-received in the Kutcher case for consideration in determining the issue of disloyalty. In Bailey v. Richardson, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 182 F.2d 46, affirmed by an equally divided Court, 1951, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 669, 95 L.Ed. 1352, we held that proceedings against an applicant or employee under the Loyalty Program are purely administrative in character, in no sense criminal, and do not require the constitutional and traditional safeguards of a judicial trial. Adhering to that view, we now-hold that the Attorney General\u2019s designation of the Socialist Workers Party was competent evidence in the administrative proceedings against Kutcher.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Both the designation, and its consideration in those proceedings, fell directly within the scope of the Executive Order, and come fairly within the -bounds of our decision in the Bailey case.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">We do not think, as appellant -contends, that the Hatch Act alters the situation. Section 9A <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> thereof is the only part with any direct relation to the charges against Kutcher. It nowise limits the -broad sweep of the President\u2019s power as recognized in the Bailey opinion; rather does it give support to the Executive Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In accordance with the views expressed, the order of the District Court dismissing the complaint is reversed; the cause is remanded with directions to enter .judgment setting aside the order removing Kutcher from -employment, without prejudice fo the order suspending Kutcher and -consideration and determination by the Administrator of the ultimate issue as to whether on all the evidence reasonable grounds exist for belief that Kutcher is disloyal to the Government of the United States; and for such further action by the Administrator as may be consistent with his decision made upon that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Reversed and remanded.-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">.
