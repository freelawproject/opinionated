Brower &amp; Co., entered into an agreement with Seattle, Washington, Building and Construction Trades Council, an association of construction labor organizations including the respondent Union, whereby it was agreed that the employers would \u201cemploy none other than members of the party of the second part [Trades Council],\u201d as enumerated in the agreement. In this enumeration were \u201casbestos workers\u201d, the group represented by the respondent Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">At various times between September, 1949 and February 8, 1950 the Union, insisting upon the closed-shop provisions of this contract, required Charles R. Brower &amp; Co., here called the Company, to lay off or refuse to hire six employees named in the complaint. These employees had previouslj been engaged as asbestos workers doing insulation work for the Company. They were not permitted to join respondent Union but previously had employment in this field under written permits from the Union. At the time in question the Union refused to issue further permits and required the Company to lay these men off.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">The Board concluded that the respondent Union had violated \u00a7 8(b) (2) and 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act, Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was based upon the Board\u2019s finding that the closed shop agreement was invalid because, although it had been entered into before the amendments to the Act, yet it had been \u201crenewed or extended\u201d thereafter within the meaning of \u00a7 102.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">Considered apart from the closed-shop agreement mentioned, the conduct of the Union unquestionably was in violation of the above sections of the Act. There is, also no question but that the operations of the Company were such as to affect commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>so as to confer jurisdiction on the Board to proceed in this matter. The only question which requires our attention is whether under the circumstances the closed-shop agreement was valid when the acts of discrimination occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The agreement of June 30, 1943, which as previously stated, contained the closed-shop clause, remained in effect without any modification by any act of the parties to the date of the hearing before the trial examiner on September 6, 1950. Neither the Company nor the Union took any step, or did any act to renew or extend it. The Board, however, held that the discriminatory acts were not, within the provisions of \u00a7 102, in \u201cthe performance of any obligation under a collective-bargaining agreement entered into prior to the date of the enactment\u201d of the amended Act, for the reason that the agreement between the Company and the Union was \u201crenewed or extended\u201d by operation of an \u201cautomatic renewal clause\u201d contained in the agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The agreement contained two paragraphs which the Board asserts brought about this automatic renewal. One of these paragraphs relates to an escalator or cost of living wage clause by which wages were to be determined for the period January 1, 1944 through January 1, 1947. It is as follows: \u201cParagraph 4 [escalator wage provision] of this contract shall remain in effect until January 1, 1948 unless notice is given 90 days prior to July 1, 1947 and <em>shall renew itself from year to year thereafter, </em>\u2014 Provided that wages shall be adjusted from time to time as provided for in Paragraph 4.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The duration clause relating to all other employment conditions specified in the contract is as follows : \u201cAll other conditions of this agreement shall take effect on July 1, 1943, and <em>continue in effect thereafter from year to year </em>until changed by the mutual agreement of the parties as provided herein. Proposed changes or modifications of this Agreement shall be made 'by either party giving notice thereof in writing to the other party at least 90 days before July 1, and such notice shall specify the provisions desired to be changed, and shall state the time and place at which negotiations may commence. The other party shall enter into negotiations not later than 30 days from the date of the receipt of said notice, after party has notified the other in writing of proposed modifications and changes in this Agreement. In the event no accord can be reached in the succeeding 60 days, arbitration as provided hereinafter shall be resorted to.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) This is the significant clause, as it is the one which refers to the duration of the closed-shop portion of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The Board contends that the provision of the quoted clause that the agreement shall continue \u201cfrom year to year\u201d means that at the end of each year the agreement was automatically renewed and that such automatic renewal means that the agreement was \u201c \u2018renewed or extended\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 102 at a date subsequent to the amendment of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In National Labor Relations Board v. Clara-Val Packing Co., 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 556, the Board sought a similar construction with respect to a union agreement which provided that its exclusive collective bargaining relationship \u201cshall continue without expiration date\u201d until terminated by written notice served by either party upon the other, or until modified in a manner specified in the contract. This court held that, 191 F.2d at page 559: \u201cAn agreement which \u2018shall continue without expiration date\u2019 until terminated or modified by the act of the parties within a fixed period from its anniversary date is not terminated on its anniversary where the parties take no action. It continues. It is not renewed.\u201d The Board urged the authority of a number of its own decisions dealing with agreements which recited that they were to continue for a period of a year and from \u201cyear to year\u201d thereafter. The Board had described the agreements in those cases as having been \u201cautomatically renewed\u201d. The court did not express any opinion as to the correctness of these decisions. It simply pointed out that the decisions relied upon by the Board dealt with contracts whose language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was not the same as that in the Clara-Val agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The respondent argues that the facts here even more emphatically than those in the Clara-Val case demonstrate the continued validity of the closed-shop agreement. It contends that by express terms the agreement is to continue in effect from year to year until changed by mutual agreement; that a proposal for change when made by either party if not agreed upon shall be submitted to arbitration. The provisions for arbitration were that the umpires\u2019 decision was to be \u201cfinal and binding upon both parties.\u201d Hence, the argument continues, the contractual relationship must go on regardless of what either party may do, because of this provision for compulsory arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We find it unnecessary to express an opinion upon this argument of respondent, for we think that there is a fundamental infirmity in the position taken by the Board. It is true that the agreement\u2019s reference to its continuing in effect \u201cfrom year to year\u201d is similar to the phraseology dealt with in the Board\u2019s decisions above referred to. None of those decisions had anything to do with \u00a7 102 or the meaning of the words \u201crenewed or extended\u201d as used therein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We feel that they furnish no assistance to this court in determining what Congress had in mind in its use of these terms. To say that this particular contract was \u201cautomatically renewed\u201d because of the fact that it uses the words \u201ccontinue in effect thereafter from year to year\u201d does not solve the problem now present. The inquiry is whether the renewal or extension mentioned in \u00a7 102 was intended to refer to a renewal or extension by some act of the parties. Where, as here, in the absence of notice or other act of termination the agreement will by its terms continue indefinitely, is it the kind of contract which Congress contemplated would be excepted tinder the terms of \u00a7 102?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Whoever drafted the Clara-Val agreement used the words: \u201cshall continue without expiration date\u201d. The draftsman of the present agreement made it state that it should \u201ccontinue in effect thereafter from year to year\u201d. Each says that in the absence of some action designed to terminate or modify the amendment, it would continue indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The Board asserts that \u201cCongress intended to defer the invalidity of a closed-shop agreement only for the balance of its unexpired term, and the expiration occurs when the period prescribed by the contract for the negotiation of changes arises.\u201d As we understand this contention, it is that the Congressional purpose was to protect the existing closed-shop agreement only until that date on which one of the parties might demand a change; that when that date arrived the mere inaction of the parties,\u2014 their failure to move for a change, results in an \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d and that this is the sort of renewal referred to in \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">It is our opinion that such a contention proves too much and is foreclosed by the decision in the Clara-Val case. Under the agreement in that case the exclusive collective-bargaining relationship was to \u201ccontinue without expiration date until: 1. Terminated by written notice served by either party upon the other as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Section, * * *. (b) [T]he anniversary date of this Agreement shall be March 1st of each year. If either party desires to terminate the exclusive * * * bargaining relationship and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>this Agreement on any anniversary date, written notice to such effect shall be served \u2022between February 16th and March 1st of the year then current.\u201d If the Board\u2019s argument that Congress intended to defer the invalidity of a closed shop agreement only to that period when one of the parties had the power to terminate it has any validity, it would have application to the facts of the Clara-Val case as fully as in the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As indicated, either party could have terminated the Clara-Val agreement by notice preceding March 1st of any year. Bearing that in mind, we must decide whether as a matter of substance there is any real difference between the Clara-Val contract and the one here presented to us. In each case the contract would continue indefinitely if neither party took any action to bring it to a conclusion. As a matter of substance we find it impossible to conclude that it made any difference whether the words accomplishing this result say that it shall \u201ccontinue without expiration date\u201d or it shall \u201ccontinue in effect thereafter from year to year\u201d. The duration clause relating to the escalator wage provision, that it \u201cshall renew itself from year to year thereafter\u201d is not substantially different. However that paragraph related to the wage provision, and not to the closed shop clause. It is not material here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Whether the agreement in question was \u201crenewed or extended\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 102, cannot be determined merely by calling the phraseology in question an \u201cautomatic renewal clause\u201d. The purpose of Congress was clearly to permit the enforcement of closed-shop agreements under existing contracts. But the parties to such an agreement could not prolong the protection which it furnished by renewing or extending it. We think this refers to a renewal or extension by some act of the parties. The very wording of the last clause of \u00a7 102 \u2014 \u201cunless such agreement was renewed or extended subsequent thereto\u201d \u2014 suggests that it refers to some subsequent act. We do not think Congress intended to make the section\u2019s protection turn upon any variation in phraseology whose differences are as lacking in substance as those presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"AlYY\">The agreement here before us, like that jn the Clara-Val case, had not terminated, No action was required to keep it in effect, The contract continued, and it was not renewed within the meaning of \u00a7 102. Accordingly, the discriminatory action of the Union was not an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">The order of the Board is set aside&gt;</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. \u201cRights of Employees.

When this court, in the Clara-Val case, was presented with the argument that the Board\u2019s decisions relating to contracts which contained provisions for their continuance \u201cfrom year to year\u201d were in point, and controlling, it found it unnecessary to pass upon the correctness of those decisions, for the contract before it was not couched in identical language. In the case now before us, the words \u201cfrom year to year\u201d were used, and in consequence we must now determine what the court previously was able to avoid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-15\">. The case of Patrick Cudahy Family Co. v. Bowles, 138 F.2d 574, decided by the Emergency Court, and cited in the Clara-Val case, does not help here. It dealt with the question of whether a certain lease agreement provided for one or two terms. The court had to decide as to the meaning of the word \u201cterm\u201d, under a certain maximum rent regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
