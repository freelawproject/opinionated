Heil and Carol W. Schuermann for the purpose of engaging in the business of selling beauty-parlor supplies. Mrs. Schuermann contributed $3400 in cash and Heil $1500, for which amounts stock was issued to them. The corporation thus had a paid-in capital of $4900, and this amount was never increased. Both contributors became officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Heil, who had previously been a beauty-supply salesman, was made president, took charge of the selling activities and devoted his full time to the business. The corporation had a force of four to seven salesmen. Mrs. Schuermann, who was the operator of a local beauty shop, devoted no regular time to the affairs of the corporation. \u201cFrom time to time\u201d, however, she did render \u201ccertain services\u201d, such as \u201caiding and assisting customers of beauty supply equipment by explaining hair dyes, permanent waving and hair tinting, and by showing them how to handle and use certain equipment.\u201d \u201cOn occasion she also participated in discussion * * * regarding the problem of business expansion.\u201d All of these services \u201cshe was always available to render * * * whenever needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Her position as officer carried no prescribed salary, but each year, the board of directors adopted a resolution allowing her \u201c5% of the total net sales for the year\u201d as \u201ccommission\u201d, the amount of which was computed and credited to her account at the close of the year. For the years 1943, 1944 and 1945, which are the taxable years here involved, these amounts had been, respectively, $6,305.75, $7,112.53, and $10,054.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">The Tax Court made the following appraisal of the various elements of the situation: \u201cThe record does not show that the sale of petitioner\u2019s products was in any way increased as a result of services rendered by Mrs. Schuermann. There is no showing that the petitioner\u2019s volume of business increased or decreased in any proportion to an increase or decrease in Mrs. Schuermann\u2019s activities. The so-called commissions paid by petitioner to its major stockholder apparently bear no demonstrable relation to any personal services actually rendered by the recipient. * * * The facts that the payments bore no relation to the amount of services rendered and were a fixed percentage of net sales, which percentage did not vary from year to year, coupled with the facts that the recipient was a 74 per cent [sic] stockholder and that there is no evidence that, although the business was profitable, any dividends, as such, were ever paid, leads us to conclude that these payments were, in fact and in reality, distributions of profits in lieu of dividends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Any payment arrangement between a corporation and a stockholder\u2014 and particularly a major stockholder, with his normal power of control \u2014 is always subject to close scrutiny for income tax purposes, so that deduction will not be made, as purported salary, rental or the like, of that which is in the realities of the situation an actual distribution of profits. 4 Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 25.46, pp. 399, 400. And we have previously held that whether-or to what extent payments made by a corporation to a stockholder represent compensation for services or constitute a distribution of profits is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>essentially the determination of \u201ca matter purely of fact.\u201d Twin City Tile &amp; Marble Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir., 32 F.2d 229, 231. See also Ecco High Frequency Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 167 F.2d 583; Gem Jewelry Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 165 F.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"Au7\">Such a determination is one that is entitled to be made on all the elements of the particular case. Ordinarily, where the payments are found to constitute a dostribution of profits, the evaluation will be one that has been arrived at by conclusionary inference. But where the inference has a rational basis, m the sense that there are circumstances of logical probative force to support it, m relation to and on a consideration of the evidence as a whole, there is no right on our part to touch such determination as the Tax Court may have made. All of the probative evidence-circumstances as well as direct testimony-necessarily is open to and should be considered by the Tax Court in resolving the factual probabilities of the situation, and it cannot be compelled to accept at face value the naked, interested testimony of the corporation or the stockholder, merely because that testimony is without direct contradiction by other witnesses-as the taxpayer here argues ought to have been done. Cf. Rand v. Helvering, 8 Cir., 77 F.2d 450; 451; Carmack v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 183 F.2d 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"Af-\">Appraising the record on this basis, as we must do, it is not possible for us to say that the Tax Court\u2019s finding here, that the payments made to Mrs. Schuermann were, \u201cin fact and in reality, distributions of profits in lieu of dividends,\u201d is without substantial evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">The annual payments of over $6,000, $7,000 and $10,000, successively made to her, were claimed to represent compensation for explaining or demonstrating \u201chair dyes, permanent waving and hair tinting\u201d and the use of \u201ccertain equipment.\u201d What had been the frequency of these explanations or demonstrations, or how much time they had consumed, was not shown, Whether they were engaged in formally at the corporation\u2019s place of business or occurred as mere incidents of permitted observation of routine operations at her beauty shop was similarly not revealed. All that the Tax Court was told was simply that, while Mrs. Schuermann gave no regular time to the corporation\u2019s business, she had been called upon \u201cfrom time to time\u201d to make explanations or demonstra- and that \u00abshe was always available to r\u00a3nder such scrvices whenever needed.\u201d Tbe record further .g without specific Hght Qn whether what she did was a normal factor ^ ^ operation of such a business Qr had any commercial value as contributing tQ tfae effecting or increasing of sales, so ^ tbe situation would not be subject t0 ^ inference that it had been engaged in by ^ corporation only as a stockholder actiyity becaus,e she chanced tQ be a beauty_ , ODerator</p>\n<p id=\"A3-\">ASain&gt; no Part of the s\u00b0-called commlssion\u201d was Pald or supposed to be paid to her throu^h the co\u201dse of th\" year\u2019 1 c clal\u201ced serJlces mfht be rendered, such as would be tbe <em>s*\u2122*\u2122 </em>no^ally m the case of servlces rendered and \u201ct\u201cded \u00ed0 be compensated for as one of the ordinary and ^cessary incidents of regular commer,clal \u00b0Peratlon- Instead she was to be Pald a sum annually ^ tbe corporation, whose amount was to await computation and ^location at the end of the year m relationship to total net sales , m the fasblon of a determination and distribution of earnings. And the making of payments to her in the manner and to the extent done always had the practical significance and result of leaving the corporation without need or occasion to concern itself about profits or dividends as such for. the two stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">Viewing ^ Qf these dements aga\u00a1nst the background and setting of Mrs. Schuermann\u2019s dominant capital contribution in getting the business started, of Heil\u2019s intended role as developer and operator of the business, of the growth which the business came to make, of the discussion shown by the record to have been had from time to time about expanding the business and its capital needs, and of Heil\u2019s testimony as to Mrs. Schuermann\u2019s readiness at all times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cto put more money into the business,\u201d we think it must be held that there existed an ample evidentiary basis of circumstances of logical probative force to warrant, a reasonable mind in concluding that what Mrs. Schuermann\u2019s contribution to the business was intended to be and what she was being compensated for was financial and not service relationship; that her concern was about obtaining, and her position was used to command, return upon her mvestment; that the fixed, unvarying percentage of total net sales for the year allowed her, from the time the corporation began, was, from its inception and throughout, related to the money which she had furnished and not to the vaguely described, incidental demonstrations of hair dyes, etc., which she sporadically may have been called upon to make; and that the amount paid her in a lump sum, after each year\u2019s business had been closed, represented m fact a distribution to her of net earnings or profits, which, except for her stockholder position, would not have been made the subject of the arrangement for purported compensation or of payment to her by the corporation , otherwise than m dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"AVD\">Mrs. Schuermann did \u00a1however perform \u201ccertain services\u201d for the corporation, as the Tax Court recognized. Services actually rendered, which are ordinary and necessary in the conduct of a business, and for which compensation has been paid, are of course properly a subject for deduction or credit, under section 23(a)(1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code, to the extent of their reasonable value, having due regard for such margin of prudent judgment as may within natural managerial prerogative be legitimately exercised. And deduction or credit on such a basis should be allowed, if the evidentiary situation is appropriate for the purpose, even though the corporation, in the payments which it has made, has gone beyond these bounds and has been guilty, in part at least, of attempting to distribute profits as purported compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"A4M\"> But the taxpayer is not in a posit\u00edon t0 complain of the Tax Court\u2019s failure to bave m,ade suob an allowance, in any case wiiere the evidence does not with suffident definiteness show the nature and the amount of the serviceSj to remove any stockholder sinecural tinge, to establish tbe;r ordinary and necessary relationship tQ &amp; carrying on of the businesS) and to enable their fair v\u00a3dlle t0, be reasonably determined. In such a situation it may properly be ,held that the taxpayer has failed to sustajn tbe burden resting upon him of demonstrating that the Commissioner\u2019s action, in mak\u00a1ng no sucb allowance, was wrong, See National Weeklies, Inc., v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir., 137 F.2d 39, 42. Miles-Conley Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 4 Cir., 173 F.2d 958, 960. Always a taxpayer can be required to c]early establish bis rigbt to any income tax deduction. Ingle Coal Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 7 Cir., 174 p 2d 559 571.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Ac\">TT .. . Here, as has been pointed out, it was not ... \u2019 . ., \u2019 . ^ . possible to say from the evidence that such services as Mrs. Schuermann rendered had been of any substantial nature, either in time expended, or in necessary incidence to the business, or in results contributed. On ad these as well as any other evaluative aspects of the services rendered, the record is wholly vague and unilluminating. And, as a matter of fact, the taxpayer\u2019s present brief does not attempt to argue that, if all tbe amount which. Mrs. Schuermann received was not entitled to be paid as compensation, -the Tax Court should have made a determination and allowance of what the services which she rendered were reasonably worth. What has been said is intended merely to make it impossible to attempt to inject any such contention by a petition for rehearing,</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
