Culbertson, <em>337 </em>U.S. 733, 69 S.Ct. 1210, 93 L.Ed. 1659. So tested the Court found that the agreement in which the trustees of the trust or trusts created by the petitioner were named as a partner was not made in good faith and with a business purpose with intent to carry on an enterprise in partnership with the trust or trusts. There is ample evidence in the record considered as a whole to justify that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
