We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 8 May 2001, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against defendant as owners of model years 1995 through 2000 minivans manufactured by defendant. These minivans did not include a brake shift interlock device (\"BSI\"). Plaintiffs sought damages to install BSIs, to compel defendant to both notify its customers of the lack of BSIs and install them, treble damages, attorneys' fees, compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, and costs of suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' amended complaint defines a BSI as \"a device that prevents a vehicle with an automatic transmission from being moved out of `park,' which keeps the transmission from being engaged, until the driver depresses the brake pedal.\" Plaintiffs assert the BSI ensures that \"the vehicle is not inadvertently moved into reverse or drive, whether by a driver or a passenger, including a child who may attempt to move the transmission lever while playing in the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege defendant promoted its minivans to be the \"safest in the world\" and emphasized their vehicles go \"beyond government requirements to ensure that the best available safety devices are used to protect its customers.\" Plaintiffs argue defendant intentionally failed to disclose to its customers that its minivans for the years stated did not include BSIs. Plaintiffs assert defendant declined to include BSIs despite both its own safety leadership team recommending them and that BSIs were becoming an industry standard. Plaintiffs also allege defendant continued to market its minivans as \"the safest in the world\" even without installing BSIs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' amended complaint sought recovery for: (1) violations of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"NC UDTPA\"); and (2) common law fraud and demanded: (1) compensation for their \"ascertainable loss\" which \"includes the cost of installing the BSI in Chrysler minivans and/or the difference in value between minivans with the BSI and those without it;\" and (2) defendant \"to install the BSI in the minivans of Plaintiffs and Class members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs expressly excluded from their amended complaint any allegation of personal injury or property damage. Plaintiffs also did not allege: (1) they had already installed the BSIs and were seeking reimbursement compensation; (2) they sold, or attempted to sell, their vehicles at a diminished price; (3) they have ever \"inadvertently moved [their vehicles] into reverse or drive;\" or (4) their vehicles have been damaged by any \"inadvertent\" shifting into reverse or drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 15 April 2003, the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court designated this case as a complex business matter under Rules 2.1 and 2.2 of the North Carolina General Rules of Practice, and referred it to\n   the North Carolina Business Court (\"Business Court\"). On 20 April 2003, defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs filed a \"motion\" and memorandum in opposition. Following oral argument, the Business Court concluded: (1) plaintiffs lack standing to bring the action since they have suffered no injury in fact; (2) the economic loss rule bars plaintiffs' claims; and (3) plaintiffs' claims are preempted and barred by the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. It entered an \"Opinion and Order\" on 5 January 2004 granting defendant's motion and dismissing plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The issue before this Court is whether the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    III. Abandoned Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs voluntarily abandoned assignment of error number three, regarding preemption by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle and Safety Act of 1966, and number four, preemption under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2004). These assignments of error are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Business Court erred in granting defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings when it concluded: (1) plaintiffs lack standing; and (2) plaintiffs' claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under a motion for judgment on the pleadings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [t]he trial court may consider, \"only the pleadings and exhibits which are attached and incorporated into the pleadings\" in ruling on the motion.\n   <em>\n    Helms v.

On the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the California Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims of fraud and unlawful business practices for lack of actual loss or injury. The court allowed the claim for unfair and fraudulent business practices because California's statute did not require plaintiffs' showing actual loss or injury in fact to sustain their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bell,\n   </em>\n   the matter before the Tennessee Circuit Court was the plaintiffs' requested class certification. The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   filed a complaint against the defendant for fraud, misrepresentation, and violations of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act due to the lack of BSIs in the defendant's vehicles. The court briefly considered the issue of whether the plaintiffs suffered a legally cognizable issue. The\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   court concluded the plaintiffs \"stated a sufficient a[sic] `legally cognizable injury' to satisfy class certification.\" The court cited\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

Our review of\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   shows the plaintiff in that case actually suffered monetary damages due to the defendants' fraud and misrepresentations prior to filing his complaint. Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Bell,\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs here had not realized any monetary loss and solely alleged a potential\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Solarz,\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendant for breach of implied warranties, breach of express warranty, breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (\"UTPCPA\"). The complaint alleged one of the plaintiffs' daughter knocked the gear selector from \"park\" into \"drive\" on a minivan manufactured by defendant, causing it to roll down the street. The\n   <em>\n    Solarz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs requested the defendant install a BSI pursuant to warranties received\n   with the minivan. The defendant refused. The class included other owners of similar minivans who alleged future injuries of diminution of value and installation costs. On review of the defendant's \"preliminary objections\" to the plaintiffs' complaint, the court determined each plaintiff alleged sufficient \"ascertainable losses\" to satisfy the UTPCPA. However, the court noted a UTPCPA claim \"does not fail as a matter of law even where damages are not easily quantified or where a claim has failed to quantify the damages suffered.\" The court also dismissed the plaintiffs' remaining claims that alleged solely future injuries of diminution of value and installation costs for lack of any actual injury or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Angelino, Bell,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Solarz\n   </em>\n   are each distinguishable from the facts at bar due to differing facts and the underlying case law and statutes. The\n   <em>\n    Angelino\n   </em>\n   court allowed the claim for unfair and state fraudulent business practices because California's statute did not require a showing of actual loss or injury in fact. Case No. GIC 785729 (Ca.Super.Ct., Dec. 11, 2002). We are not persuaded the legal precedent in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   court cites to find a \"legally cognizable injury\" supports that determination and\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   is not controlling here. Case No. CV003457 (Ten. Cir. Ct., June 4, 2002). In addition, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   arose during a class certification hearing, not during a hearing for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Solarz\n   </em>\n   court concluded future expenses caused by a lack of a BSI were an \"ascertainable loss.\" However, the court acknowledged Pennsylvania's UTPCPA did not require quantifiable damages and it also dismissed plaintiffs' remaining claims for lack of damages.

Count I seeks relief in the form of damages and/or injunctive relief for violations of Chapter 75, the UDTPA. Among the allegations under this claim are the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   76. Chrysler's wrongful conduct resulted in an ascertainable loss to Plaintiffs and Class members. The ascertainable loss includes the cost of installing the brake shift interlock in Chrysler minivans and/or the difference in value between minivans with the brake shift interlock device and those without it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Count II seeks damages for \"Common Law Fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The briefs to this Court, the order, and the transcript all refer to defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and accompanying memoranda to the trial court, but no such motion appears in the record on appeal. The only pleading which includes any such motions is the Answer, which lists some twenty-four defenses, only a few of which appear to relate to any of the issues before us. They are:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   FIRST DEFENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   FIFTEENTH DEFENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff's tort claims and those of the putative class members are barred by the economic loss doctrine . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   NINETEENTH DEFENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff's have not complied and cannot comply, with all prerequisites for maintaining a claim under the N.C.

It is well established that upon review of a dismissal on the pleadings, this Court is to review the pleadings (here, the complaint and answer) in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, to determine whether plaintiffs have alleged any legal theory under which they could prevail. \"In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must determine whether, taking all allegations in the complaint as true, relief may be granted under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   recognized legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Coley v.

Bryant,\n   </em>\n   asserts that because part of plaintiffs' argument differs from the theory \"upon which [the] case was tried\" in the trial court, those matters are not properly before us.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8608603\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/237/256/#p259\">\n    237 N.C. 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20S.E.2d%20726\">\n    74 S.E.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (1953). Since the case has not been tried at all, I believe that this analysis is misplaced. Rather, as to each of plaintiffs' claims, our task is to determine whether plaintiffs have set forth a legal theory under which they could prevail. As the plaintiffs' two claims require separate analysis, they are discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, plaintiffs have set forth a statutory claim under Chapter 75, alleging that defendants\n   have engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce. The majority uphold the dismissal of this claim, applying common law principles of standing. However, since this is a statutory claim, I conclude that such analysis is inappropriate, and the proper analysis requires determining whether plaintiffs have alleged a basis for the claim as created by the statute. Essentially, plaintiffs contend that the defendants advertised their minivans as the safest in the world, when they knew that they were not, and that plaintiffs purchased the van based on these representations, resulting in damages. The pertinent statutory provisions of the UDTPA are:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (a) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (b) For purposes of this section, \"commerce\" includes all business activities, however denominated, but does not include professional services rendered by a member of a learned profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (c) Nothing in this section shall apply to acts done by the publisher, owner, agent, or employee of a newspaper, periodical or radio or television station, or other advertising medium in the publication or dissemination of an advertisement, when the owner, agent or employee did not have knowledge of the false, misleading or deceptive character of the advertisement and when the newspaper, periodical or radio or television station, or other advertising medium did not have a direct financial interest in the sale or distribution of the advertised product or service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (d) Any party claiming to be exempt from the provisions of this section shall have the burden of proof with respect to such claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2001). In addition, treble damages are authorized under this chapter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   If any person shall be injured or the business of any person, firm or corporation shall be broken up, destroyed or injured by reason of any act or thing done by any other person, firm or corporation in violation of the provisions of this Chapter, such person, firm or corporation so injured shall have a right of action on account of such injury done, and if damages are assessed in such case judgment shall be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for treble the amount fixed by the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   N.C.

Thus, I cannot agree with the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs also cite several unpublished opinions from other states, involving identical claims and the very same defendants, brought under the unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes of California, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Angelino v.

Although we are not bound by these decisions, they add further support for my conclusion that the allegations here are sufficient to withstand dismissal. Indeed, the allegations of actual injury in\n   <em>\n    Solarz\n   </em>\n   are identical to those here, and the court there held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged damages for their claims of violations of the relevant unfair and deceptive trade practices statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition, although the majority contends that plaintiffs did not argue statutory standing for their claims of unfair and deceptive trade practices either before the business court or this Court, the record reflects otherwise. The first specific mention of standing in this record is in the oral argument before the business court. \"A challenge to standing is an affirmative defense. . . .\" 61A Am.

The first opportunity for plaintiff to address this issue after alleging their causes of action in the complaint, came after the defendants raised the defense. Assuming arguendo that the defendant has adequately raised this defense, plaintiffs responded. The transcript of the argument shows defense counsel stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   And in the absence of any other actual injury . . . there is no - there is simply no standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There was some discussion in the plaintiffs' opposition brief about the standing cases that we relied on being factually inapposite, but - and they are to some extent factually different scenarios. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Thus, it is apparent that plaintiffs did respond when necessary to the allegations of lack of standing, both in the opposition brief and in the oral argument to the business court, and again in their brief to this Court. Here, the first two sections of argument in plaintiffs' brief on appeal address the issue of their standing to pursue their statutory claims under Chapter 75. The issue was appropriately raised and argued both in the business court and here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To the extent that the majority treats the issue of the sufficiency of the pleadings to state a statutory Chapter 75 claim as an issue of standing to pursue a tort claim, I conclude that the discussion is misplaced. A claim under Chapter 75 is not a tort claim, but is a creature of the legislature, with a distinct purpose. That purpose has been described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We think it was the clear intention of the 1969 General Assembly in enacting Ch. 833, among other things, to declare deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce in North Carolina unlawful, to provide civil means to maintain ethical standards of dealing between persons engaged in business and the consuming public within this State, and to enable a person injured by deceptive acts or practices to recover treble damages from a wrongdoer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Hardy v.

Because I conclude that plaintiffs sufficiently allege a claim for violations of this statute and for damages, consistent with these precedents and with the purpose of Chapter 75, I would reverse the dismissal of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Turning to plaintiffs' claim for fraud, Count II in the complaint, I dissent on this issue as well. The majority opinion does not address the determinative issue on this count, which is whether the complaint alleges common law fraud sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(c). The plaintiffs argue on appeal that the business court erred by dismissing their fraud claims. They maintain that the \"economic loss doctrine\" has never been applied to common law fraud claims in North Carolina and should not be extended to do so here. Although the majority does not address this issue, I would reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs' fraud claim on the pleadings, and would specifically hold that the economic loss doctrine does not apply to claims for common law fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As defendant points out, \"North Carolina has adopted the economic loss rule, which prohibits recovery for economic loss\" in some kinds of tort actions.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wilson,\n   </em>\n   the Court was given the opportunity to apply the rule to claims for fraud and unfair and deceptive trade practices, but declined to do so. In fact, the only ruling that we can locate which applies the economic loss doctrine to bar a claim for fraud is the decision of the business court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Aside from the lack of precedent to justify such a ruling, I conclude that the majority decision is contrary to sound reasoning and to the policy considerations that underlie fraud and the economic loss doctrine, as well as Chapter 75. In claims for negligence, where the doctrine has been applied, the wrong for which plaintiffs seek redress is the breach of a duty of reasonable care in design and traditionally the harm is either personal injury or property damage. In claims for fraud on the other hand, the wrong addressed is the alleged misrepresentation by a defendant, relied upon by the plaintiff and typically resulting in an expenditure of money. Thus, the loss involved in a fraud claim is very often economic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Under the [economic loss] rule, a plaintiff who can claim only economic damages without being able to show any personal or property damage will not be allowed to bring a tort action for the loss, and must look to contract, warranty, and statutory actions instead. Courts use the rule to separate contract law, \"which is designed to enforce the expectancy interests of the parties, from tort law\" which is designed to keep persons from \"causing physical harm\" to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   National Consumer Law Center,\n   <em>\n    Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Manual,\n   </em>\n   S. 4.2.16.2.

UDAP claims are exempt from the economic loss rule because the rule is judicial, not legislative, and must give way to specific legislative policy pronouncement allowing damages for economic loss. In other words, by enacting a remedy for economic losses suffered by reason of an act deemed wrongful by the statute, the legislature has effectively preempted the economic loss rule for those cases covered by the act.\n   <em>\n    To apply the economic loss rule to UDAP claims would effectively eviscerate the statute.
