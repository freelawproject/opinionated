The jury also convicted defendant of one count of attempted first-degree murder and one count of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury against Michelle Carden (\"Carden\"). After consolidating the counts, the trial court sentenced defendant, a level IV offender, to confinement in the North Carolina Department of Correction for a minimum of two hundred and fifty-one months and a maximum of three hundred and eleven months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 27 November 2001, Carden and Colson were shot while sitting in Carden's car in front of a house located in Guilford County, North Carolina. After the shooting, Carden and Colson left the scene to find help. Upon finding police officers, Carden got out of the vehicle and Colson drove away. Carden had a gunshot wound to her right shoulder, and was bleeding from her left forearm. Colson was found in the vehicle into which defendant had fired. Both individuals were subsequently hospitalized for their injuries. Defendant was apprehended leaving the scene of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the scene, officers found three shell casings in the roadway. The windshield of the vehicle Colson was found in had a bullet hole in it. The passenger's side window had been shot out and there was blood located on that side of the vehicle. A 9mm Glock Pistol (the \"weapon\") was found a few weeks after the shooting near where defendant had been seen running away from the scene of the shooting. State Bureau of Investigation Agent Dave Santora (\"Agent Santora\"), a forensic firearms examiner, tested the weapon and determined that the four shell casings recovered from the scene were from the same weapon recovered by officers investigating the shooting. It was later determined that the gun used in the shooting had been stolen by Colson and Kevin Darden (\"Darden\"), approximately one month prior to the\n   shooting and that Darden subsequently had sold the weapon to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the scene, Detective James O'Connor (\"Detective O'Connor\") questioned Carden about the identity of the shooter. Carden stated that she did not know defendant and had never seen him before, but that she heard Colson yell, \"Teddy Bethea shot us.\" Carden also identified defendant as the shooter in a lineup and at trial, and provided a statement to the police, identifying defendant as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 30 June 2003, the trial court granted defense counsel's motion to continue in order to allow for additional time to prepare for the hearing and to investigate the facts relating to the weapon used in the shooting. On 2 September 2003, the first day of trial, the State provided defendant with a copy of a statement it had obtained from Darden. The State's attorney notified defense counsel approximately two hours prior to trial that they had located and interviewed a witness (Darden) incarcerated in the North Carolina Department of Correction, who was prepared to testify at trial that he had stolen the weapon during a breaking and entering and then sold that firearm to defendant. Defense counsel moved to continue the case because he needed more time to investigate this new information. The trial court denied defense counsel's motion, but recessed the hearing until the following morning to allow time for defense counsel to interview Darden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant, while testifying at trial, denied shooting Colson and Carden, denied buying the weapon from Colson and Darden, and denied accusing Colson of stealing from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant first asserts that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied defense counsel's motion to continue because defense counsel was not permitted sufficient time to investigate and prepare for the State's untimely disclosure of a new witness on the morning of defendant's trial. Defendant further contends that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied defendant's motion for a mistrial when there was impermissible contact with jurors, prejudicing defendant's jury panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is within the trial court's discretion to grant or deny a motion for continuance.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Darden's statement noted that in October 2001, he and Colson stole the weapon at issue, which they later sold to defendant.

You know, whether or not that's true doesn't change the fact that the State did voluntarily disclose it....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the interest of justice, the trial court postponed the trial until the following morning to allow defense counsel an opportunity to interview Darden, although it denied defendant's second motion to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Court: The Court having considered the arguments before it denies the motion to continue. However, in the spirit of accommodating counsel for the defendant, the Court will hold this matter open for jury selection until in the morning in order to allow counsel some time to investigate the matters that he has referred to here in his arguments for a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The record further indicated that prior to 2 September 2003, the trial court granted defendant's first motion to continue to allow defense counsel more time to prepare adequately, including more time to prepare for newly discovered information relating to scientific evaluation of the crime weapon. Defense counsel had ample opportunity to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the October 2001 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defense: The alleged weapon that was used ... was discovered some five or six weeks later.... It was sent away, and I learned in the discovery process that in fact, the gun had belonged in ... a breaking and entering.... One of the victims of the shooting in this case was a codefendant with ... Darden. That's the new witness that I found out about five minutes after twelve this morning.... Darden and ... Colson ... were codefendants on this matter.\n   <em>\n    I did an investigation. I talked to Officer Saintsing, I've seen all the records from that.

The trial court instructed the five jurors not to \"consider in any way what took place, set it completely out of your mind and not consider it in any way in your deliberations.\" The trial court then questioned each of the five jurors individually and asked if they could completely set aside the comment, not consider the spectator's comments, and not allow it to influence them in any way. All five jurors responded affirmatively. The trial court instructed the five jurors not to discuss what they had heard with other members of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When the jury was brought back into the courtroom, the trial judge informed the jury that two people expressed \"an opinion about the lack of credibility ... of a person or persons ... in this trial.\" The trial judge further instructed that the jurors were to \"base [their] verdict on the evidence presented in [the] courtroom, the law as given to [them] by this judge, and [their] common sense, not something that may have been said in an elevator or any other matter outside [the] court proceeding.\" The trial judge then made the following statement to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Court: It has been brought to my attention that there is a possibility that some other event or events or transactions may have occurred that should not have occurred with regards to the jury and other persons.... Has anything happened, anything been said in your presence, any gesture been made, has anything occurred at all since this trial began, that causes you to feel that you cannot be fair and impartial to both sides in the trial of this case? If anything of that sort has occurred, please raise your hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Jury: (No response)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Court: I have made arrangements for you to be able to use an elevator that's back here in the back, to spare you having to walk through the public lobby and use the public elevator. So when you leave\n   today, you will be escorted a different route than you've been taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At the conclusion of this inquiry, the trial judge once again asked the five jurors who had been in the elevator whether they could put aside the comments. The five jurors reiterated that they could. Subsequently, the trial court denied defendant's request to instruct the jury that there was no evidence this event was connected to either the State or defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, the trial court made an appropriate investigation into the matter and questioned the jurors individually. The trial court further questioned each juror regarding his or her ability to be fair and impartial. Defendant has not shown that any of the jurors were prejudiced by the alleged misconduct or that a different result would have been reached had the trial court granted defendant's request to give a limiting instruction regarding the impermissible contact with jurors.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Defendant's prior convictions included: (1) misdemeanor larceny, on 18 November 1992; (2) possession of cocaine, on 25 May 1993; (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   felony larceny, on 16 September 1996; (4) possession of stolen goods, on 11 April 1996; and (5) attempted assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict serious injury, on 11 April 1996. During the sentencing phase, the trial court, the State, and defendant engaged in the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   State: The only evidence I have on sentencing is the prior record work sheet that I prepared. I believe counsel has seen this. I show him with 11 prior record points, placing him in Record Level IV .... Do you stipulate he has 11 points, Record Level IV?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defense: I stipulate that that document is the same as what I looked at and researched; yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   State: Your Honor, that's the only additional evidence I have at sentencing. I would like to be heard at the appropriate time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Court: Will there be any evidence for the defendant?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defense: No, your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   No other documents were offered to the Court and the State did not present original or copied records of defendant's prior convictions. While the State did not offer any document other than their own worksheet of calculated points, defendant appeared to stipulate to the State's findings listed within that worksheet - that defendant had eleven prior record points. Defense counsel certainly failed to make clear that he was not stipulating to the State's prior record worksheet and presented no contrary information to the court at the time the stipulation was being discussed. Based on North Carolina General Statutes, section 15A-1340.14(f), stipulation of the parties is sufficient to prove defendant in fact had eleven prior record points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo,\n   </em>\n   that the State did not meet their burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that error was merely harmless.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant, relying on North Carolina General Statutes, section 15A-1340.14(d), contends in his brief that the trial court should have counted only one of defendant's two convictions on 11 April 1996. Pursuant to subsection (d), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"if an offender is convicted of more than one offense in a single superior court during one calendar week, only the conviction for the offense with the highest point total is used.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(d) (2003). Even if the trial court had included only the points for the conviction on 11 April 1996, the trial court still would have determined that defendant had a total of nine points, which is within the Record Level IV point range. Therefore, we hold that defendant was sentenced properly as a Record Level IV offender and this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Judge HUDSON concurs in results only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
