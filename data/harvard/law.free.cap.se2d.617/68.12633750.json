We find no prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that on 8 November 1999, United States Customs Special Agent Patrick McDavid (\"Agent McDavid\") was working in the Charlotte office. He was contacted by customs agents working in New York's JFK International Airport, who stated they had intercepted a package sent from Iran addressed to \"M. Rashidi\" at 2408 Margaret Wallace Road, Matthews, North Carolina. The New York customs agents had determined that the package contained two pictures or plaques with unusually thick frames. A probe inserted into one of the frames revealed that the frames contained opium estimated to weigh approximately 412 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The New York customs agents sent the package to Agent McDavid in Charlotte for a controlled delivery. After receiving the package, Agent McDavid confirmed through Division of Motor Vehicles' records that defendant lived at the address indicated on the package. Agent McDavid drafted an affidavit in support of an application for an anticipatory search warrant for defendant's address. The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina issued the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 17 November 1999, United States customs agents and Charlotte police officers attempted to deliver the package by a postal inspector posing as a postal carrier. When the inspector first attempted to deliver the package at 11:21 a.m., no one was home to receive it. The officers set up a surveillance of the house. At approximately 2:30 p.m., a red Mustang vehicle pulled up to the residence. The driver got out of the car and went inside. The postal inspector delivered the package to a male located inside the residence. After delivery, the inspector radioed the surveillance team and stated the man who received the package matched defendant's drivers' license photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The officers waited a few minutes to allow defendant an opportunity to open the package. At that point, Agent McDavid knocked on the door and yelled loudly, \"Police with a search warrant.\" Thirty to forty-five seconds later after having received no response, the officers forced the door open and found defendant talking on a cell phone. Officers asked defendant to get on the floor, frisked him, seized a film cannister, and handcuffed him. They found the package just delivered opened on the kitchen stove, surrounded by broken pieces of the picture frames.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and verbally waived them. In response to an officer's question whether the package had contained opium, defendant told the officers that he had been expecting a package of pictures from his brother-in-law, Ramin Sarmist (\"Sarmist\"), who lived in Iran. Defendant explained that he had previously received packages from Sarmist containing pictures and rugs for resale in the Charlotte area. Defendant stated he had not expected Sarmist to send opium, although he acknowledged having used opium before. Defendant admitted that when he opened the\n   package this time from Sarmist, he realized from its odor that it contained opium. Defendant claimed that when he heard a knock on the door, he thought his wife and child were coming home, and he hid the opium in the bedroom so that his child would not see it. Defendant then directed the officers to a trash bag of clothes under a desk in a bedroom. After searching the trash bag, the officers found an United States Customs' evidence bag, containing 381.93 grams of opium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant suggested to the officers that a telephone call to Sarmist could exonerate him. The officers allowed defendant to make the call, believing defendant would incriminate himself. After the telephone conversation, defendant reported to the officers that Sarmist did not admit to sending the opium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The conversation, which was conducted in Farsi, was taped and subsequently translated. In the call, Sarmist told defendant that he had taken two rugs and one picture to the Teheran Post Office to be boxed and mailed. Defendant told Sarmist that the package had instead contained two pictures and \"something unreal.\" Sarmist suggested that someone was trying to frame defendant and said he would find out who prepared and sent the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to the opium in the United States Customs bag, the officers determined that the film canister seized from defendant contained trace amounts of opium. While searching defendant's vehicle, the officers also found a safety pin or \"wire stem\" coated in opium, $1,160.00 in cash, and scales normally used to weigh drugs in the vehicle's console. Officers discovered empty mailing boxes in the carport of defendant's house that were addressed similarly to the one containing the opium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant was indicted with trafficking in drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia, and maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping controlled substances. At trial, defendant did not offer any evidence. On 15 August 2003, a jury found defendant guilty of trafficking in opium by possessing twenty-eight grams or more and possessing drug paraphernalia, but acquitted defendant on the maintaining a dwelling charge. Defendant was sentenced to a term of 225 to 279 months for the trafficking conviction and forty-five days for the possession of paraphernalia conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion to suppress due to false statements contained in an affidavit supporting an application for a search warrant; (2) denying defendant's motion to dismiss; (3) allowing a witness to testify regarding defendant's request for an attorney; and (4) denying his motion for a mistrial or, in the alternative, his request for a curative instruction when the State displayed information outside the record during closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    III. Denial of Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant argues that Agent McDavid's affidavit submitted in support of the application for an anticipatory search warrant was fatally flawed because it contained material falsehoods and was made in bad faith in violation of\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (1978). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In applying\n   <em>\n    Franks,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court held, \"[i]t is elementary that the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a factual showing sufficient to constitute `probable cause' anticipates a truthful showing of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the defendant shows in support of an application for a search warrant that: (1) the affiant knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth made false statements; and (2) the false statements are necessary to the finding of probable cause, then \"the warrant is rendered void, and evidence obtained thereby is inadmissible. . . .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=484%20S.E.2d%20350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues that his motion to suppress should have been granted under\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   because Agent McDavid's testimony at trial established that statements in his affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant were false. Agent McDavid's affidavit stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Customs Inspector Gattulli opened the parcel and found it to contain two large decorative plaques. Inspector Gattulli observed that the pictures were unusually thick and coated with fiberglass. The Inspector probed through tape on the picture, the probe revealed a black substance contained within. The substance was field tested . . . to be opium. The opium was estimated to be 412 grams. The opium was kept within the picture to maintain the integrity of the parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, Agent McDavid testified that the customs inspectors in New York, told him the box being sent to him in Charlotte contained pictures and approximately 412 grams of opium. He denied the inspectors told him what they did with the pictures and the opium before they sent the package to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's showing that an affidavit contains false statements standing alone is not sufficient to meet the showing required by\n   <em>\n    Franks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    438 U.S. at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    98 S.Ct. at 2681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p165\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Without the allegedly false statements defendant complains of, the other statements were sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   to support the issuance of an anticipatory search warrant.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Following the charge conference, defense counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   And again, I just want to make it clear, that as I recall the facts, the only evidence of flight is, he had a court date. He didn't show up. He was arrested later, that's it. There was no reference in the record about Canada or anything else. We would ask the State to be mindful of that when it makes its closing arguments and stick to the facts of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The State responded that he would \"be mindful\" and that he \"would not intend to introduce\" any information on this subject unless defense counsel put forth evidence of defendant's leaving the country and his reasons why. Defendant subsequently chose not to present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   During the State's closing argument, the prosecutor displayed to the jury a number of typewritten panels summarizing its case. The display was placed six feet in front of the jury box so that all the jurors could view the material. Panels 15 and 16 - which were each on 8\u00bd by 11 inch paper and printed in a 48-point font - stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   15.

Since the closing argument was not recorded in the transcript, we do not know exactly how long the panels remained before the jury. The State contends that the panels remained visible for only thirty seconds. When defendant placed his objection on the record, he requested a mistrial or, in the alternative, a curative instruction.

We hold that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. The State produced sufficient\n   evidence to prove the necessary elements of opium trafficking and possession of drug paraphernalia. Presuming the trial court erred in allowing testimony about defendant's invocation of his right to counsel, we hold any error was not prejudicial due to the overwhelming nature of the other evidence against defendant. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for mistrial or, alternatively, for a curative instruction. Defendant received a fair trial free from prejudicial errors he assigned and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The dissenting opinion declines to address the issue of whether denial of the alternative motion for a curative instruction merits a new trial because it would hold \"in light of the improper closing argument, the State cannot demonstrate that its questions regarding defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The dissenting opinion would award a new trial by linking these two errors under the rubric \"post-arrest\" conduct. Although the dissenting opinion implies the combination of an error not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and a non-prejudicial error justifies a new trial, no authority is cited for that proposition. We do not perceive a connection between these two alleged errors sufficient to warrant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   No prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Judge McGEE concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Judge GEER concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-89\">\n   GEER, Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   I agree with the majority's analysis regarding the denial of defendant's motion to suppress and his motion to dismiss. I respectfully dissent, however, because I believe the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction when the State presented information outside the record during closing arguments and by allowing testimony regarding defendant's request for an attorney. I would hold that the combination of these errors mandates a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it allowed McDavid to answer questions as to whether defendant requested an attorney. When the prosecutor was questioning McDavid about what happened at the residence and what defendant told the officers, he further asked:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Q: . . . At anytime, talking about all these statements the defendant made, and your conversation with the defendant, at anytime during any of those conversations, did he ever ask for a lawyer to be present?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   MR.

No, he wasn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   These three questions thus specifically reference defendant's invocation of his right to an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   It is error to allow questions regarding a defendant's request for an attorney because\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   [b]y giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, the police officers indicated to defendant that they were prepared to recognize his right to the presence of an attorney should he choose to exercise it.

In my view, the majority errs by considering the harm caused by these questions in isolation and not assessing it in conjunction with the harm caused by the State's closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As the majority explains, defense counsel specifically noted prior to closing arguments that the record contained no evidence of flight apart from defendant's having failed to appear at a court date. He stressed specifically that there was no evidence of defendant's having fled to Canada. The prosecutor assured defense counsel and the trial court that he would \"be mindful\" and that he \"would not intend to introduce\" any information on this subject unless defendant's counsel put forth evidence of defendant's leaving the country and his reasons why. Moments after this discussion, even though defendant had presented no evidence, the prosecutor displayed to the jury typewritten panels, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   15. D went to Canada when he KNEW he had a trial court dated back on 6/11/01 - he knew that he needed to get out of the U.S. b/c he knew he was guilty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   16. D didn't return to the U.S. and turn himself in, he hid (sound familiar?) - Officer Kolbay had to find him and arrest him to make sure he would make his next court date\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It is undisputed that the material contained in panels 15 and 16 went outside the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State suggests that the typewritten material was not error because our appellate courts' prior opinions have dealt only with spoken comments from the prosecutor and not written displays in front of the jury. This supposed distinction is immaterial. Indeed, a written display persistently confronting a jury may be more prejudicial than a fleeting remark once voiced, but not repeated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 Kenneth S. Broun,\n   <em>\n    Brandis &amp; Broun on North Carolina Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 252, at 298-99 (6th ed.2004) (observing with respect to illustrative evidence that jurors \"are quite likely to be influenced by what they see, without being overly concerned about whether it precisely illustrates what they hear\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   I agree with the majority that defendant has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. Nevertheless, because the court refused to issue a curative instruction directing the jury to disregard the information on the panels, the jury may well have considered defendant's flight to Canada and his subsequent hiding in reaching its verdict. The panels were before the jury long enough to be read, as demonstrated by the fact defendant's counsel had time to read them and object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It appears from the record that the trial court attempted to remedy the error by refusing to give an instruction on flight. Unless, however, instructed not to do so, a jury could conclude on its own, as a matter of common sense, that the fact defendant went to Canada and hid after being charged suggested he was guilty. The only method by which the court could have fully cured the error was to specifically tell the jury that they were shown information that was not part of the evidence and to instruct the jurors to disregard the panels.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v.

Elmore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549625\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/337/789/#p792\">\n    337 N.C. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792-93,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20S.E.2d%20501\">\n    448 S.E.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In this case, a witness did not simply mention defendant's request for an attorney in passing. Instead, the State asked three separate questions of McDavid that elicited three times the fact that defendant had asked to have a lawyer present, causing all questioning to cease. The State on appeal has offered no reason that the prosecutor would ask three such questions in a row other than to hammer home the fact that defendant had asked to have a lawyer present while the officers were searching his house and car (where incriminating evidence was found). The jury could readily conclude that this request suggested guilt. Then, in the closing argument, the State again focused the jury's attention on defendant's post-arrest conduct. The improper panels indicated that defendant had fled to Canada and hid because, according to the panel, \"he knew that he needed to get out of the U.S. b/c he knew he was guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I disagree with the majority's characterization of the evidence in this case as overwhelming. No one with personal knowledge testified regarding what the package looked like in New York, where the opium came from, or how it ended up in a United States Customs bag. Defendant's conduct in hiding the opium is not necessarily evidence of guilt since someone who unexpectedly receives contraband in a United States Customs bag and hears the police knocking at the door would likely behave in identical fashion. Although the officers uncovered additional incriminating material in defendant's car, the jury apparently did not view that evidence as compelling since the jury found defendant not guilty of the charge of maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping controlled substances. The jury could well have turned to defendant's post-arrest behavior- including the request for a lawyer as the search progressed and the flight to Canada- and decided that this behavior tipped the scales as to guilt on the trafficking charge. As a result, \"we cannot say that there is or can be no reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached\" if these errors had not been made.\n   <em>\n    State v.
