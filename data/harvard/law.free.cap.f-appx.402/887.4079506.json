We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Saldivar maintains that his revocation sentence must be vacated as being either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. He contends that the sentence was longer than necessary to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a). Citing \u00a7 3553(a)(1), Saldivar contends that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to the nature and circumstances of his supervised release violations. More specifically, he suggests that the district court did not consider the fact that the offense that served as one of his violations \u2014 illegal reentry into the United States \u2014 itself drew a 57-month prison term on the same day that his revocation sentence was imposed. He does not contend that the district court failed to consider any other \u00a7 3553(a) factors or otherwise erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it is unclear whether the validity of a revocation sentence turns on whether it is held to be reasonable or to be plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 n. 5 (5th Cir.2010). In Saldivar\u2019s case, however, review is for plain error only, since Saldivar did not present to the district court the objection that he now makes to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007). To meet this standard of review, Saldivar must first show a forfeited error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He must then show that the error is clear or obvious and that it affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If Saldivar makes all of these showings, we have the discretion to correct the error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">On revocation of supervised release, a district court may impose any sentence that falls within the statutory maximum term, but must consider the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Ch.7, Pt.B, and the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) before it does so. <em>Davis, </em>602 F.3d at 646. Saldivar does not dispute that his sentence was below the statutory maximum of three years imposable on the revocation of his supervised release. Instead, he contends that his sentence deviated too far above the policy statements range of four to ten months. We reject that contention. As we have previously observed, we have routinely affirmed revocation sentences above the advisory policy range but within the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The district court was fully aware that it had also imposed a separate, 57-month sentence in connection with Saldivar\u2019s illegal reentry offense. The district court expressed its concern about Saldivar\u2019s \u201chistory of drugs\u201d and convictions for firearm offenses. Clearly, in the district court\u2019s view the nature and circumstances of the supervised release violation, which involved violent and recidivist behavior, required a harsher sentence than was advised by the guidelines policy statements. Saldivar has not shown that the district court committed any error, much less error that is plain. <em>See Jones, </em>484 F.3d at 792. Because Saldivar has not satisfied even the first prong of plain error review, the district court\u2019s judgment must stand. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
