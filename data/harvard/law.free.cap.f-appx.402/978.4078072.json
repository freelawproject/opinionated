Davis moves for permission to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). The district court has certified that the appeal is not in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-23\">The district court had previously reduced Davis\u2019s sentence from life to 360 months in prison based on Amendment 505. However, the district court concluded that Amendment 706 was not applicable to Davis\u2019s case. Davis argues that Amendment 706 served to reduce his base offense level by two levels and asserts that the district court erred in concluding that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction and in not providing an explanation for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-24\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). A district court may reduce \u201ca term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s.; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-80 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The denial of Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion was not an abuse of discretion because the sentencing court is not required to provide its reasons for the denial. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. Furthermore, the sentencing court is under no obligation to reduce the sentence at all. <em>Id. </em>at 673. Additionally, because Davis was held accountable for sentencing purposes <em>for </em>more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, a sentence reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, Drug Quantity Table. Davis has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
