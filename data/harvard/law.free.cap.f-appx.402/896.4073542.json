Gar-nett argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendments 706 and 711 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He asserts that the district court abused its discretion by using marijuana equivalents to determine his base offense level because the marijuana conversion table contravenes the purpose of Amendment 706. He also asserts that the district court should have been unrestricted in its discretion to reduce his sentence based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, while its interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). However, Garnett did not challenge in the district court the utility of the marijuana conversion table, nor did he raise his argument concerning the district court\u2019s discretion based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; these arguments, therefore, are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 93, 178 L.Ed.2d 58 (2010); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-25\">Garnett has not established that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Garnett was accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction based upon the crack cocaine amendments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) &amp; comment, (n. 10(D)(ii)). His base offense level consequently was not modified, and his advisory guidelines range was not lowered as a result of the amendments. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Garnett was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">To the extent that Garnett seeks to challenge the calculation of the relevant drug quantity at his initial sentencing, that issue is beyond the scope of the guideline amendment and is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 674. Accordingly, Garnett cannot show error, much less plain error, concerning this issue. <em>See Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 276; <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Garnett also cannot establish clear or obvious error with respect to his contentions that <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) should apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that the district court should have been unrestricted in its discretion to resentence him under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 276; <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Garnett\u2019s argument based on <em>Booker </em>and its progeny is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
