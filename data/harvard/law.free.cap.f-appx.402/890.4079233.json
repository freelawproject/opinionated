He argues that the district court erred by upwardly departing from the guidelines range of 21-27 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">Although we ordinarily review sentences for reasonableness, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), because Owen did not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the unreasonableness of his sentence in the district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Given Owen\u2019s extensive criminal record, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, by upwardly departing based upon its finding that Owen\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood that he would recidivate. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 418 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24 (5th Cir.2005) (affirming an upward departure based upon the defendant\u2019s likelihood to recidivate). This court has previously upheld comparable, and even greater, departures than the one here at issue. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (affirming upward departure from 41 months to 120 months of imprisonment); <em>United States v. Rosogie, </em>21 F.3d 632, 633-34 (5th Cir.1994) (affirming upward departure from 30-37 month guidelines range to 150 months of imprisonment). We similarly conclude that the degree of departure was not unreasonable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
