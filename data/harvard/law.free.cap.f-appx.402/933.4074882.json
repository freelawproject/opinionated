Taylor contends that the district court miscalculated his amended offense level, provided insufficient reasons for denying his motion, and committed procedural errors. He asserts that the district court erred by denying his motion without considering his post-incarceration prison record and, for the first time on appeal, he contends that his access to the courts has been limited because he was not allowed access to his presentence report (PSR) when he filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court implicitly denied Taylor\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel, and Taylor requests that this court appoint counsel in his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">The district court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, while its interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). The district court correctly determined that Taylor\u2019s amended offense level was 42. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 715. Taylor\u2019s amended offense level of 42 and his criminal history category of IV result in an imprisonment range of 360 months to life for each of Taylor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>three conviction counts. U.S.S.G. Chap. 5, Sentencing Table (2006). Because the maximum of the guidelines range is greater than the statutorily authorized maximum sentence of 720 months, or 240 months per count, Taylor\u2019s post-amendment guidelines range remains at 720 months of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(l) (2006). As the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines do not result in lowering Taylor\u2019s guidelines range, the district court correctly determined that a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (2008); \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Given that Taylor was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, his argument that the district court erred by failing to consider his post-incarceration prison record is not persuasive. Also, a district court \u201cis not required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law when denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not full resentenc-ings, and the reasonableness standard derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentencing reductions. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 671-72. As Taylor was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, he cannot show that his lack of access to his PSR affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Finally, there is no recognized right to the appointment of counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366, 367-69 (5th Cir.2010) (unpub\u2019d). The interests of justice do not require the appointment of counsel on appeal because Taylor\u2019s appeal does not involve complicated or unresolved issues. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Taylor\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
