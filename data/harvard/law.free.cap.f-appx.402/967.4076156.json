Wesley David BOWDEN, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b993-11\">No. 09-10125</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AmC\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b993-12\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b993-14\">Nov. 30, 2010.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b993-15\">Susan Cowger, Sarah Ruth Saldana, Esq., Assistant U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Dallas, TX, for Plaintiff-Ap-pellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b993-16\">Wesley David Bowden, Dallas, TX, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b993-18\">Before JOLLY, GARZA and STEWART, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b993-19\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">Wesley David Bowden appeals his conviction on six counts of attempted tax evasion and his six concurrent prison terms of 24 months each. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal as frivolous or for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-25\">Bowden asserts that the only issue on appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction to convict him. He contends that it did not because he is a sovereign and not subject to the laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-26\">Bowden\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
