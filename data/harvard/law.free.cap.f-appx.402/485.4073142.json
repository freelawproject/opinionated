Thomas was convicted for one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Pearl to two mandatory life sentences as a career-offender. She sought a reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706, which provides a two-level reduction in the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. After review, we affirm Thomas\u2019 sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Sentences based on career-offender status or on a statutory minimum are not based on a range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and district courts are not authorized to reduce a sentence under that statute. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008). Thomas concedes she was sentenced as a career offender, and her prior convictions for drug offenses resulted in mandatory minimum life sentences. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851. Consequently, any adjustment to her advisory guideline range would not affect the length of her prison terms and she is ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
