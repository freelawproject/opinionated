The crack cocaine amendments are inapplicable to an offender whose offense level was based on 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 10(D)(ii)(I). Blount\u2019s offense level was based on 164.7 kilograms, and thus was not affected by the crack cocaine amendments. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Blount\u2019s offense level was not affected by the crack cocaine amendments, he was ineligible for relief, and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Blount\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Blount also contends that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing. He argues that his motion raised issues concerning the application of <em>Booker </em>and that all parties should have been present when these issues were resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a defendant need not be present at a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. Fed. R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4). Generally, a district court must hold a hearing only if it is necessary because the facts are in dispute. <em>See Dickens v. Lewis, </em>750 F.2d 1251, 1255 (5th Cir.1984). Because Blount was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Blount\u2019s motion for a reduction in sentence absent an evidentiary hearing. <em>See id.\\ </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b29-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
