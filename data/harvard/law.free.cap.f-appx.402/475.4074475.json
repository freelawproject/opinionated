The defendants moved to dismiss the action for improper venue on the basis of an arbitration clause in Betts\u2019s marketing contract with Ignite.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(3); <em>Lipcon v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>148 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.1998). The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, and Betts has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">Betts argues that the district court erred by dismissing his action in favor of arbitration because the defendants\u2019 promise to arbitrate was illusory and therefore unenforceable. We review the enforcement of a contract\u2019s arbitration clause <em>de novo. Emp\u2019rs. Ins. of Wausau v. Bright Metal Specialties, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">Under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, an arbitration agreement is valid unless it fails to meet the general contracting requirements of the law governing the agreement. <em>First Options of Chi, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). Texas law governs the parties\u2019 agreement here, so we turn to state-law principles regarding illusory promises in our assessment of Betts\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">Texas contracts \u201cmust be based upon a valid consideration,\u201d or \u201cmutuality of obligation.\u201d <em>Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., </em>951 S.W.2d 401, 408 (Tex.1997). \u201cConsider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ation is a bargained for exchange of promises,\u201d <em>id., </em>but an \u201cillusory\u201d promise that fails to bind the promisor cannot sustain a contract, <em>see In re Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., </em>195 S.W.3d 672, 676-77 (Tex.2006). In accordance with these general principles, the Texas Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that an arbitration agreement may be illusory if a party can unilaterally avoid the agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Betts argues that a modification clause in his contract would have allowed the defendants to \u201cavoid [their] promise to arbitrate by amending the [arbitration] provision or terminating it altogether.\u201d <em>In re Halliburton Co., </em>80 S.W.3d 566 (Tex. 2002). In support of this argument, Betts notes that the contract\u2019s \u201cPolicies and Procedures\u201d section gave Ignite the \u201csole discretion\u201d to modify the agreement and provided that any amendments would become binding \u201cupon notice ... or publication.\u201d By reserving a unilateral right to effect immediate changes to the contract, Betts argues, the defendants reserved an \u201coption to arbitrate\u201d without promising him anything in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The defendants respond that under the contract\u2019s \u201cTerms &amp; Conditions\u201d section, amendments would only \u201cbecome effective 30 days after publication.\u201d During that interim, Betts could accept the changes, by continuing his marketing relationship with Ignite, or reject them, by terminating the agreement. The defendants argue that those restrictions on their ability to modify the contract place it in a class of agreements approved by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>In re Halliburton, </em>80 S.W.3d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>Halliburton </em>involved an employment arbitration agreement subject to modification at the employer\u2019s option. In an attempt to avoid arbitration, an employee argued that the modification provision rendered the employer\u2019s promise to arbitrate illusory. But the Court rejected that argument. Given the agreement\u2019s notice requirement, the prospective effect of any amendments, and a 10-day delay on the employer\u2019s ability to terminate the agreement, the Court concluded that the arbitration agreement was fully enforceable. <em>Halliburton, </em>80 S.W.3d at 569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The defendants here insist that their contract\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions make this case like <em>Halliburton: </em>any changes to the arbitration agreement would only become effective after Betts had 30 days to decide whether to accept them. Betts, on the other hand, argues that the contract\u2019s Policies and Procedures \u2014 with their provision for amendments effective \u201cupon notice\u201d\u2014 overrode the Terms &amp; Conditions\u2019 purported 30-day notice requirement. The first question before us, then, is which of these provisions governs the parties\u2019 relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">As it turns out, the contract answers this question for us: \u201cIn the event of a conflict between these Policies and Procedures and the [Terms &amp; Conditions], the Policies and Procedures shall be deemed controlling.\u201d Accordingly, the next question is whether the defendants\u2019 ability to immediately amend or terminate the arbitration agreement made their promise to arbitrate illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">We conclude that the answer to that question under Texas law is yes. \u201c[I]f the terms of a promise make performance optional, the promise is illusory and cannot constitute valid consideration.\u201d <em>J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, </em>128 S.W.3d 223, 235 (Tex.2003). And nothing in Betts\u2019s contract would have prevented the defendants from avoiding their promise to arbitrate by modifying the agreement just before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Yet an illusory promise does not necessarily make a contract unenforceable. <em>Halliburton </em>involved a \u201cstand-alone arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tration agreement! ],\u201d for which \u201cbinding promises are required on both sides[,] as they are the only consideration rendered to create a contract.\u201d <em>In re AdvancePCS Health L.P., </em>172 S.W.3d 603, 607 (Tex. 2005). \u201cBut when an arbitration clause is part of an underlying contract, the rest of the parties\u2019 agreement provides the consideration.\u201d <em>Id.; accord In re Lyon Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>257 S.W.3d 228, 233 (Tex.2008) (\u201c[Arbitration clauses generally do not require mutuality of obligation so long as adequate consideration supports the underlying contract.\u201d). Betts has not argued that the whole contract here lacked consideration, and we accept his tacit concession. He promised to pay Ignite for training and an opportunity to earn income by marketing Stream Energy\u2019s services; this \u201cbargained for exchange of promises\u201d was sufficient to create a binding contract. <em>Fed. Sign, </em>951 S.W.2d at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Under Texas law, as long as an arbitration agreement is \u201cpart of a larger contractual relationship,\u201d even provisions that create a unilateral \u201cright to opt out of arbitration\u201d cannot undermine \u201cthe consideration of the underlying contract or the promises to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Palm Harbor Homes, </em>195 S.W.3d at 677. Because the underlying contract containing Betts\u2019s promise to arbitrate was supported by adequate consideration, the district court rightly enforced his promise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-12\">. The parties agreed that the arbitrability of Betts's claims against all the defendants turned on the enforcement of the arbitration agreement in his contract with Ignite. We therefore refer to the contract as an agreement with \"the defendants,\u201d where appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. Betts\u2019s reliance on <em>Morrison v. Amway Corp., </em>517 F.3d 248 (5th Cir.2008), is misplaced. For one thing, we are not bound by decisions from other circuits. And to the extent <em>Morrison </em>stands for the proposition that illusory promises to arbitrate can invalidate contracts otherwise supported by sufficient consideration, we decline to adopt the Fifth Circuit\u2019s logic. For similar reasons\u2014 and because we respect the Fifth Circuit's pronouncement that its unpublished decisions \"are not precedent,\u201d 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4 \u2014 we are unmoved by the result in <em>Toms v. S.G.E. Management., L.L.C., </em>397 Fed.Appx. 63 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
