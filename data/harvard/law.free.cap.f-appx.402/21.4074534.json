Borjas was found not guilty of carrying and using a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i) and (c)(l)(B)(ii). He was sentenced to 121 months on the drug count and to concurrent sentences of 120 months on each of the firearm counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Borjas appeals the firearms sentences, contending: the district court abused its discretion at the sentencing hearing by-admitting the transcript of an audio recording of one of the firearms transactions between Borjas and a confidential informant, which was used to enhance Borjas\u2019 sentence; and his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In claiming the district court abused its discretion by admitting the transcript, Borjas asserts: the recording was unreliable, and the Government did not comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(l)(5)\u2019s requirement that it show the proper predicate for its admission. The Rules of Evidence, however, do <em>not </em>apply at sentencing proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 1101(d)(3); <em>United States v. Young, </em>981 F.2d 180, 187-88 (5th Cir.1992). A district court at sentencing \u201cmay consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>e.g., United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2004). In other words, \u201cdue process merely requires that information relied on in determining an appropriate sentence have \u2018some minimal indicium of reliability\u2019 and \u2018bear some rational relationship to the decision to impose a particular sentence\u2019 \u201d. <em>Young, </em>981 F.2d at 187 (quoting <em>United States v. Galvan, </em>949 F.2d 777, 784 (5th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Borjas fails to demonstrate the information was \u201cmaterially untrue\u201d. <em>See Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d at 277. Special Agent Casey testified at sentencing: he tested the electronic recording device to ensure it worked properly; he was physically present during the surveillance; he could see both Borjas and the confidential informant during their conversation; and he had previously worked with the confidential informant and was familiar with his voice. That certain portions of the conversation might not have been recorded, as Borjas contends, does <em>not </em>amount to showing what was recorded \u2014 that Borjas understood the altered firearms would travel to Mexico \u2014 was unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Further, Borjas fails to show his within-Guidelines sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable. Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review, considering both the procedural propriety and substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed by the district court. 552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 <em>F.3d </em>750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutieirez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Borjas contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court misapplied the Guidelines by: (1) enhancing his offense level under Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(1)(B), based on the number of firearms involved in the collective offenses; and (2) enhancing his offense level under Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Borjas\u2019 \u201cknowledge, intent, or reason to believe [any of the firearms] would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>cross the border into Mexico. A sentence is procedurally sound if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The four-level enhancement imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) for Borjas\u2019 offenses involving between eight and 24 firearms was proper. Borjas concedes there were three separate transactions involving six firearms, as is listed in the indictment. The presentence investigation report (PSR) established Borjas attempted to sell a seventh weapon to the confidential informant, but it was rejected due to poor quality. The PSR also established Borjas sold an eighth weapon, an Uzi machine gun, to a co-defendant. Further, the district court found Borjas delivered two additional firearms to his co-defendants that were <em>not </em>already accounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Additionally, the four-level enhancement imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), based on Borjas\u2019 \u201cknowledge, intent, or reason to believe\u201d any of the firearms he sold the confidential informant would be \u201cused or possessed in connection with another felony offense\u201d, was procedurally proper. The transcript for the conversation between Borjas and the confidential informant on 29 March 2007 revealed Borjas understood the weapons were being transported into Mexico when he sold them to the informant. The district court found: Borjas had \u201creason to believe\u201d the firearms he sold the informant were being transported into Mexico after purchase; and transporting these types of automatic weapons into Mexico was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The district court imposed other enhancements, but Borjas fails to present any contentions relative to them. Therefore, any challenges to those enhancements are abandoned. <em>E.g,, United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Borjas contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he had no criminal history points, and because he \u201cled a decent and proper life\u201d prior to his arrest. Borjas did <em>not </em>object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in district court; therefore, it is reviewed only for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Even under the normal standard of review, his contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">Borjas was sentenced to the lowest end of the advisory-Guideline range on the firearm counts. A presumption of reasonableness applies to Borjas\u2019 within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Hernandez, </em>581 F.3d 251, 254 (5th Cir.2009). The sentencing judge noted he considered all the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and concluded a sentence within the Guidelines satisfied them. Borjas has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness because the sentencing judge \u201cis in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b47-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
