After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">In April 2008, V\u00edctores filed a counseled motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). V\u00edctores alleged that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because of Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the advisory guideline range for most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See generally United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2008). The district court acknowledged that Victores\u2019s 180-month sentence was above the amended guideline range, but stated that it \u201cwould still impose a sentence of 180-months\u201d because of \u201cthe statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and [Victores\u2019s] extensive criminal history.\u201d The court therefore denied Victores\u2019s motion, and he did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">In March 2009, V\u00edctores filed a second counseled motion to amend his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). V\u00edctores again relied on Amendment 706 to establish his eligibility for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, and contended that his. significant rehabilitative efforts warranted \u201crevisiting]\u201d the courts prior analysis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Despite lauding Victores\u2019s efforts, the district court again denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). Moreover, \u201c[w]e may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">We need not recount the district court\u2019s reasoning, because under the law of the case doctrine the court properly denied Victores\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Under this doctrine, courts are \u201cbound by findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d previously made in the same case unless \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996). Mr. V\u00edctores did not appeal the denial of his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and accordingly it became the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997). As a result, on the record before us, his failure to appeal the first motion forecloses the relief he now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of Mr. Victores\u2019s second motion to reduce his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">. Accordingly, we will liberally construe Mr. Victores's pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
