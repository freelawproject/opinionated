Riley appeals the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with the district court that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine deprives the court of jurisdiction to hear Riley\u2019s claims, and accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-27\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b882-28\">We begin by noting that this is not the first time Riley has asked this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>collaterally review a final judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Riley was disbarred from the Louisiana State Bar in 1987. After twice seeking readmission unsuccessfully, he sought readmission .for the third time in 2003. On November 19, 2004, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his application for readmission. Riley then sued the Louisiana State Bar Association (\u201cLSBA\u201d) and the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board (\u201cLADB\u201d) in United States District Court, for the Eastern District of Louisiana in what became <em>Riley I. </em>In <em>Riley I, </em>Riley claimed that he was denied readmission in violation of his civil rights, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court found, in part, that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s claims which amounted to nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling denying Riley readmission to the Louisiana State Bar. Riley appealed the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Riley I </em>to this Court, and we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Riley v. Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 456 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We now find ourselves presented with <em>Riley II. </em>On June 17, 2009, Riley again moved for readmission to the LSBA. On August 19, 2009, he received a letter from the LADB\u2019s Office of Disciplinary Counsel (\u201cODC\u201d), concerning allegations of misconduct from when Riley was employed by FEMA in 2006-07. The LADB then granted a stay of Riley\u2019s June 2009 readmission application, in order to pursue the disciplinary investigation concerning Riley\u2019s alleged misconduct during his tenure with FEMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">On December 10, 2009, Riley received a notice of sworn statement demand from the ODC. The next day, Riley filed an application for emergency writ, Objection, and Motion for Relief from the notice of sworn statement with the Louisiana Supreme Court. On December 14, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Riley\u2019s application for relief from the notice to give sworn statement. Two days later, on December 16, Riley filed the instant action in federal district court, once again against the LSBA and LADB, asserting that the application of Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX(6)(A) to him, as it applies to his conduct that he deems \u201cunrelated to the practice of law\u201d following the termination of his membership, amounts to an unconstitutional denial of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights afforded by the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">On February 3, 2010, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss for lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. In doing so, the district court found that, just as this Court had already explained in <em>Riley I, </em>the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to subsequent suits that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a final state court judgment \u2014 thus barring the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s claims. The district court dismissed Riley\u2019s claims with prejudice, and the instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">\u2018We review a ruling on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Budget Prepay, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>605 F.3d 273, 278 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe party assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ing jurisdiction bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We note that in the three and one-half years since we issued our decision in <em>Riley 1, </em>the law in this Circuit regarding the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine has not changed, evolved, or dissipated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Riley I, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine directs that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to entertain collateral attacks on state court judgments.\u201d <em>Riley I, </em>214 Fed.Appx. at 458 (citing <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994)). This is because \u201c[cjonstitutional questions arising in state proceedings are to be resolved by the state courts.\u201d <em>Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 317. Our decision in <em>Liedtlce </em>advises individuals like Riley that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">[i]f a state trial court errs the judgment is not void, it is to be reviewed and corrected by the appropriate state appellate court. Thereafter, recourse at the federal level is limited solely to an application for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The casting of a complaint in the <em>form of </em>a civil rights action cannot circumvent this rule, as absent a specific delegation!,] federal district courts, as courts of original jurisdiction, lack appellate jurisdiction to review, modify, or nullify final orders of state courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Accordingly, if Riley feels that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to grant his emergency relief and enjoin the LSBA from completing their disciplinary investigation constitutes a violation of his constitutional rights, Riley\u2019s recourse is with the United States Supreme Court\u2014 not the federal district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana. <em>See id. </em>Riley\u2019s \u201crequest for ... injunctive relief, stripped to essentials, is an attack on the judgment of the state district court. His ... suit, which arises from the state proceeding, is \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with that judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Thus, for the same reasons we iterated in <em>Riley I, we </em>once again conclude that \u201c[u]nder <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>the district court lacked jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s claims and properly dismissed his suit.\u201d <em>Riley I, </em>214 Fed.Appx. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">For the aforementioned reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">. On December 30, 2009, Riley filed an Amended Complaint, challenging the issuance of a subpoena in the disciplinary investigation, and adding a claim under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine refers to the doctrine derived from two Supreme Court cases, <em>see District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-24\">. In affirming the district court, we also recognize the sagacity in Judge McNamara\u2019s warning to Riley \"that if he files any further pleadings barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, his multiplication of proceedings may well be deemed 'unreasonable\u2019 and 'vexatious' to warrant the imposition of sanctions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
