The district court sentenced Johnson to 235 months of imprisonment, a sentence below the guidelines sentence range, based upon a joint request by Johnson and the Government. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">Johnson argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion simply because his sentence was within the amended guidelines range. He maintains that he should have received a sentence 10% below the amended guidelines range because his sentence was approximately 10% below the original guidelines range and that the district court should have considered the continuing discrepancy between crack and power cocaine sentences as noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Johnson further maintains that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that the district court erred by considering the Guidelines to be mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">Because Johnson was sentenced shortly after the opinion in <em>Booker </em>was issued, the probation officer prepared two different guidelines sentence range calculations. The original calculations were prepared normally, but the supplemental calculations considered only conduct that Johnson had admitted. At sentencing, the district court did not clearly indicate which guidelines sentence range calculations that it had adopted. Johnson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion whether the district court adopted the original or supplemental guidelines sentence range calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>In the presentence report, the probation officer found that Johnson was responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and this figure was reflected in the original guidelines sentence range calculations. Thus, if the district court adopted the original guidelines sentence range calculations, Johnson was ineligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not lower his offense level. <em>See </em>Amend. 706; \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In his factual resume, Johnson admitted that he was responsible for 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. This is the drug quantity upon which the supplemental guidelines sentence range calculations were based. Under these calculations, Johnson\u2019s sentence of 235 months of imprisonment falls within the amended guidelines sentence range. In denying Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court acknowledged that Johnson\u2019s sentence was within the amended guidelines range, and it specifically ruled that Johnson\u2019s sentence was appropriate based upon the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Given these circumstances, Johnson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Contrary to Johnson\u2019s assertion, <em>Booker </em>is not applicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
