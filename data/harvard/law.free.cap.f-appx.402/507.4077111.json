Mattox contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Under the specific, and somewhat unusual, facts of this case it is impossible to determine the basis for the district court\u2019s decision to impose a substantial upward variance from the guidelines range. Because the district court did not adequately explain Mattox\u2019s sentence, we vacate and remand for resentencing so that the procedural error can be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Mattox entered into a plea agreement with the government and later pleaded guilty to two counts of using a telephone to conspire to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 843(b), and 846. At Mattox\u2019s change of plea hearing in September 2009, the government explained to the district court that there was an error in Count Two of the information, which had charged Mattox with using a telephone to unlawfully conspire with intent to distribute \u201ccocaine base, also known as crack cocaine.\u201d The district court offered to amend the information by striking out the word \u201cbase.\u201d The parties agreed that the charges against Mattox involved powder instead of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court accepted that as a fact and asked Mattox if he understood Count Two. Mattox stated that he did. Mattox also agreed that the facts stipulated in the plea agreement were true and that for purposes of sentencing he would be held accountable for 60 grams of powder cocaine. The district court accepted Mattox\u2019s guilty plea and later entered judgment against him for two counts of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">About two months after the change of plea hearing, the district court held a sentence hearing. During that hearing, Mat-tox\u2019s counsel stated that the defense had no objections to the pre-sentence investigation report, which set Mattox\u2019s base offense level at 16 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(12) based on his accountability for 60 grams of cocaine. Mattox received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp; (b), making his total offense level 13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mattox\u2019s counsel pointed out to the court that Mattox\u2019s guidelines range was 33 months to 41 months and that the government had filed a motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The district court acknowledged the guidelines range and Mattox\u2019s criminal history category, which was VI because he was a career offender. The court accepted the PSR and imposed a sentence of imprisonment, with this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The pre-sentence report has been prepared, filed, considered, and accepted. Mr. Maddox is adjudicated guilty of Counts One and Two of the superseding information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">The sentencing guidelines have been considered and taken into account, and the Court has calculated and announced the guideline sentencing range, the offense level. The Court has considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">The Court has reviewed the guideline range in your case, Mr. Mattox, as well as the guideline range of your co-defendants. <em>One of your codefendants committed similar criminal conduct, </em>had a less severe criminal history category, and the advisory sentencing guideline range was calculated to be 84 to 96 months. Therefore, I have elected to consider a variance in your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">I have determined a term of imprisonment of 96 months will be appropriate^,] however, considering the government\u2019s motion for sentence reduction for substantial assistance pursuant to U.S.S.G. [\u00a7 ]5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]3553(e), you are committed to the Bureau of Prisons for a period of 42 months on each count to be served consecutively for a total imprisonment of 84 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Doc. 208 at 171-72 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">One of Mattox\u2019s codefendants, Nathaniel Bell, had been sentenced by the same district court judge, on the same day, just a few minutes before Mattox. The record indicates that Bell was the person the district court had in mind when it referred to Mattox\u2019s codefendant who \u201ccommitted similar criminal conduct, had a less severe criminal history category\u201d than Mattox did, and had a guidelines range of 84 to 96 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Bell\u2019s PSR<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> shows that he pleaded guilty to two counts of using a telephone to commit a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) and that Bell had stipulated in his plea agreement that he was accountable for 49 grams of crack cocaine. As a result, Bell\u2019s base offense level was 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6). Bell received a three-level reduction for substantial assistance to the government, making his total offense level 25. Applying Bell\u2019s category IV criminal history, the PSR calculated Bell\u2019s guidelines range as 84 to 105 months. There was a 48-month statutory maximum for each count, however, which made Bell\u2019s guidelines range 84 to 96 months. Mattox was convicted of the same offense as Bell, except that Mattox\u2019s crime involved powder cocaine, which has a lower base offense level than the levels set for crack cocaine crimes. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(12), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). Bell had a higher guidelines range than Mattox because Bell\u2019s crime involved crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">During Bell\u2019s sentence hearing, which was just before Mattox\u2019s, counsel for Bell told the district court that Bell had been an employee of the City of Macon, Georgia for four years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counsel stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that the two counts against Bell were based on two phone calls about drugs, and during one call Bell specifically requested \u201ctwo rocks of crack cocaine.\u201d Counsel commented that the government had filed a motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and he asked the court to sentence Bell \u201cat the bottom of the guidelines of whatever the 5K reduction is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The district court found that, based on the evidence presented, Bell had \u201cbeen a good employee for the city\u201d and had \u201cprovided commendable service to [his] employer and the public.\u201d The court noted Bell\u2019s criminal history category of IV and the fact that he had three prior convictions that included possession with intent to distribute cocaine, selling cocaine, possession with intent to distribute phenobarbital, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The court mentioned that Bell\u2019s guidelines range was 84 to 96 months, and defense counsel agreed that was correct. Then the court imposed this sentence of imprisonment on Bell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Having considered the government\u2019s motion for sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), I depart downward and commit you to the Bureau of Prisons for a period of 36 months on each count, to be served consecutively, for a total term of 72 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Thus, Bell had been sentenced to 12 months below the low end of his guidelines range, which was also 12 months below the 84-month sentence imposed on Mattox, who was sentenced to 43 months more than the high end of his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under that standard, \u201cwe will reverse only if we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). First we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">When sentencing Mattox, the district court stated that it was considering the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities. It also stated that it was considering Mattox\u2019s guidelines range in relation to Bell\u2019s, observing that Bell had \u201ccommitted similar criminal conduct, had a less severe criminal history category,\u201d and had a guidelines range of 84 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">There are two gaps in the district court\u2019s explanation of Mattox\u2019s sentence in relation to Bell\u2019s. First, Bell pleaded guilty to a crime involving crack cocaine, unlike Mattox, who pleaded guilty to a powder cocaine crime. Especially given the confusion about the charge against Mattox, it is not clear from the record that the district court recognized that Bell\u2019s crime was under most standards worse (crack instead of powder) than Mattox\u2019s and took that difference into account when it increased Mattox\u2019s sentence in light of Bell\u2019s. The court\u2019s statement that the two had committed \u201csimilar criminal conduct\u201d may indicate that it either thought Bell\u2019s crime had involved powder cocaine or that Mattox\u2019s crime had involved crack, either of which would have been a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The second explanation gap arises because the district court had varied downward when it sentenced Bell, going below his guidelines range of 84 to 96 months and sentencing him to 72 months. In light of that downward variance, it is not clear from the record how varying upward to sentence Mattox to 84 months would accomplish the district court\u2019s purpose, which it described as \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axv\">Those explanation gaps amount to a procedural error in Mattox\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although the district court was not required to \u201crecite a laundry list of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005), or \u201ccompose a doctoral thesis to explain\u201d the sentence, <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1195 (11th Cir.2010), more of an explanation of the variance from the guidelines range was necessary in this case in light of some of the ambiguities and contradictions revealed by the record. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We cannot tell if the district court took into account any guidelines sentencing disparity between Mattox\u2019s powder cocaine offense and Bell\u2019s crack cocaine offense when it found that codefendant Bell had \u201ccommitted similar criminal conduct.\u201d If the court concluded that Bell and Mattox\u2019s sentences should be adjusted to account for unwarranted sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses, that decision would not necessarily have constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 110, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (\u201c[I]t would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the present case, however, the district court did not indicate that the crack/powder disparity played any part in its sentencing decision and did not seem to focus on how the particular circumstances of Mattox\u2019s powder cocaine case could result in a sentencing disparity when compared to Bell\u2019s crack cocaine case. <em>Cf id. </em>at 111, 128 S.Ct. at 576 (\u201c[I]n determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough\u2019s case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Adding to the confusion is the error in the information charging Mattox with an offense involving crack instead of a powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>cocaine. That error was verbally corrected at Mattox\u2019s plea hearing when the government told the district court that his offense involved powder even though the indictment referred to crack. Even after that verbal clarification, however, it is impossible to tell from the record whether the district court concluded in sentencing Mattox or Bell that \u201cthe crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary5 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes,\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 111, 128 S.Ct. at 576, and on that basis decided to treat the two crimes as identical. If the district court did reach some kind of a <em>Kimbrough </em>conclusion, there is no explanation in the record for it. <em>Cf. Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (\u201cAfter settling on the appropriate sentence, [the district court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Particularly because the deviation from Mattox\u2019s guidelines range was substantial (from a 33 \u2014 41 months guidelines range to an 84-month sentence), more of an explanation of the sentence is required under the facts of this case. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that if the district judge \u201cdecides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d). Although the district court mentioned some differences between Mattox\u2019s and Bell\u2019s cases, such as Mattox\u2019s criminal history category of VI and Bell\u2019s category of IV, in light of the gaps in the explanation we cannot determine whether that actually was the sole basis for the substantial upward variance in Mattox\u2019s case or whether the variance was affected by the court overlooking the fact that Mattox\u2019s crime involved powder cocaine while Bell\u2019s involved crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">For these reasons, Mattox\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">. There was never any doubt that Count One, which also charged Mattox with using a telephone to conspire to commit a drag offense, involved powder cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">. The PSR also stated that Mattox qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which provided that, because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for his underlying offense of conviction was 4 years, his offense level was 12, which would then be lowered based on acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(G). The offense level for a career offender, however, is either the offense level from the table in \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) or the otherwise applicable offense level, whichever is greater. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.1(b). In Mattox\u2019s case the otherwise applicable offense level (13) was higher, so it applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">.Mattox had seven other codefendants, three of whom were convicted of using a telephone to commit a drug trafficking offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), but they received sentences ranging from 12 to 48 months imprisonment. Only Bell had a guidelines range of 84 to 96 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-16\">. The record in this case was supplemented with Bell's PSR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-17\">. We take judicial notice of the district court's record of Bell\u2019s sentence hearing. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>179 F.3d 1300, 1302 n. 5 (11th Cir.1999) (\"A court may take judicial notice of its own records and the records of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>inferior courts.\u201d); <em>see also Nguyen v. United States, </em>556 F.3d 1244, 1259 n. 7 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\">. <em>Kimbrough </em>involved a district court's determination that a guidelines sentence for a crack cocaine offense was too harsh in light of the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 91, 128 S.Ct. at 564 (explaining that a district court may find that a guidelines sentence for a crack cocaine offense is \u201c \u2018greater than necessary' to serve the objectives of sentencing,\u201d and \u201d[i]n making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Following the logic of <em>Kimbrough, </em>however, a district court might also consider the disparity between the guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses in reasoning that the punishment for a powder cocaine offense should be higher in order to be closer to that for crack cocaine. Under some circumstances, a higher sentence for a powder cocaine offense might comport with the district court's statutory directive under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to impose a \"sufficient\u201d sentence and might enable the court to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, which it is required to consider under \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
