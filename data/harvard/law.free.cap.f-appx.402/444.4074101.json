Man-zella-Oliveros argues on appeal that: (1) the BIA and the IJ erred in denying him withholding of removal because the IJ erred by concluding that he had not established the required nexus between his individualized fear of persecution and his political opinion, it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted as a result of being deported from the United States, he established that he was a member of a protected group of individuals who had been subject to a pattern or practice of persecution by Chavez\u2019s government; and (2) the BIA and the IJ erred in finding that he did not establish that he was eligible for withholding of removal under CAT since his credible testimony and supporting documentary evidence were sufficient to establish that it was more likely than not that he would suffer torture at the hands of the Venezuelan government or with its acquiescence. After thorough review, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">We review the decision of the BIA, and, to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ, we will also review the adopted portion of the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Here, although the BIA issued its own opinion, it expressly agreed with the IJ\u2019s determinations and adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>will review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law, but we review factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes <em>de novo, </em>but we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Our review for substantial evidence is highly deferential. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. When conducting that review, we \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision,\u201d and will reverse findings of fact made by the BIA or the IJ only when the record compels a reversal. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">First, we reject Manzella-Oliveros\u2019s claim that the BIA and IJ erred in denying him withholding of removal. An individual may qualify for withholding of removal to a particular country if he demonstrates that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country\u201d on account of, among other protected grounds, his political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An applicant may also demonstrate his eligibility based on \u201ca theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotations and alterations omitted). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not [that he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (quotation omitted). If an applicant for withholding of removal is found to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal on account of a protected ground, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened in the future. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">An applicant who has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that his life or freedom would be threatened in a country if he can establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted in that country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). The threat to life or freedom requirement may be met by showing either (1) that he would likely be singled out individually for persecution on account of a protected ground if returned to the country of removal, or (2) that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to him on account of a protected ground, and that he is included in, or identified with, the persecuted group such that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">We have noted that \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). We explained that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and alteration omitted). When assessing whether a petitioner has established past persecution, we consider the cumulative impact of the mistreatment he suffered. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">We have held that \u201cemployment discrimination which stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living does not constitute persecution.\u201d <em>Barre-to-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>1340 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that although petitioner suffered employment discrimination, lost his job as a taxi driver, and was forced to take menial work, he was not persecuted). Therefore, a petitioner\u2019s termination from his employment and later inability to find a job is insufficient to compel a finding of persecution. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that petitioner\u2019s job termination did not rise to the level of persecution where petitioner failed to show how long he searched for a replacement job in the same city and provided no evidence demonstrating that he sought employment after relocating to another city, such that he failed to show that \u201che was deprived of all means of earning a living\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Because Congress has not defined what constitutes a pattern or practice of persecution, we will defer to the BIA\u2019s definition of this term as long as it is not unreasonable, i.e., arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law. <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006) (deferring to the BIA\u2019s definition of what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d); <em>see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The BIA has defined a pattern or practice of persecution as persecution of a group that is both \u201csystemic and pervasive.\u201d <em>In re A-M-, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 737, 741 (BIA 2005) (citing <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When considering whether the applicant has established a pattern or practice of persecution in his home country, the BIA is entitled to \u201crely heavily on\u201d the State Department\u2019s country reports. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1354 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In this case, the record does not compel the conclusion that Manzella-Oliveros is eligible for withholding of removal. Any economic hardship he may have suffered before leaving Venezuela was not sufficiently severe to amount to persecution. He also has not shown that he would be individually targeted for persecution based on his political opinion. Further, because it does not appear that the \u201csystemic and pervasive\u201d standard announced by the BIA in <em>In re A-M- </em>is unreasonable, we will apply it when evaluating whether Manzel-la-Oliveros established a pattern or practice of persecution in Venezuela. However, Manzella-Oliveros did not establish that the persecution of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez\u2019s detractors was sufficiently systemic and pervasive to establish a pattern or practice of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">We also find no merit in Manzella-Olive-ros\u2019s claim that the BIA and the IJ erred in finding that he did not establish that he was eligible for withholding of removal under CAT. To qualify for CAT relief, an applicant carries the burden of proof to \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he [ ] would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is the intentional infliction of \u201csevere pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). The regulations re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>quire the applicant to demonstrate that the torture would be inflicted \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1239 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">An alien who fails to satisfy the statutory requirements for withholding of removal' under the INA rarely qualifies for CAT relief. <em>Compare </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2) (\u201cAn applicant [seeking withholding of removal] ... may demonstrate that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the future in a country if he or she can establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted.\u201d), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (\u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal under [the CAT] to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d). Because, as discussed above, the record does not compel a finding that Manzella-Oliveros is more likely than not to be persecuted in Venezuela, it also does not compel the conclusion that he is likely to suffer torture covered by the CAT. <em>Cf. id. </em>\u00a7 1208.18(a)(2) (\u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d). Therefore, the IJ and the BIA properly denied Manzella-Oliveros relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. As an initial matter, we deny Maduro de Manzella\u2019s petition for review because she was a derivative of Manzella-Oliveros's application. While the asylum statute explicitly creates derivative rights for a petitioner\u2019s spouse, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A), we have held that there are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal because, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding statute does not mention derivative rights. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007). We have not yet made a similar holding in a published opinion with respect to derivative benefits under CAT, but the CAT regulation also does not mention derivative rights, signifying that a derivative claim is likewise foreclosed under CAT. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2), (4); <em>see also Oforji v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 609, 615 (7th Cir.2003) (Seventh Circuit case holding that the CAT regulation \u201cseemingly forecloses\" a derivative claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">In this petition, Manzella-Oliveros abandoned any argument regarding his application for asylum because he did not argue it on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, even if he had preserved this argument, we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA's determination that the application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (precluding this Court from reviewing the BIA's determination that an asylum application is time-barred); <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). Therefore, only Manzella-Oliveros's claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief are before us, and the statutes and regulations covering withholding of removal and CAT relief do not confer derivative benefits on an applicant's spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\">. In addition to the Third Circuit, the First, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have all applied the same \u201csystemic and pervasive\u201d test to determine whether a pattern or practice of persecution exits. <em>See, e.g., Sugiarto v. Holder, </em>586 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir. 2009); <em>Raghunathan v. Holder, </em>604 F.3d 371, 377 (7th Cir.2010); <em>Tolego v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 763, 766 (8th Cir.2006); <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Woldemeskel v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1185, 1191 (10th Cir.2001). Moreover, although the Second Circuit did seek clarification as to how the standard might be reliably applied in \"particular instances,\u201d it noted that the standard appeared to be reasonable. <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
