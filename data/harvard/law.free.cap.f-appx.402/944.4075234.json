California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Loston has filed a response in which he argues that the district court erred in denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he is eligible for relief under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines and because relief was warranted. Loston also seeks the appointment of new counsel. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Loston\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, Loston\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b970-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
