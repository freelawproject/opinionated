He complains that the district court improperly considered the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in imposing his sentence because sub-section (a)(2)(A) is not among the provisions of \u00a7 3553 that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) directs courts to weigh in fashioning a revocation sentence. Because Combs\u2019 general objection \u201cto the sentence being unreasonable\u201d failed to adequately apprise the district court of the particular claim he now pursues on appeal, we review Combs\u2019 sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009). To the extent Combs claims that the district court\u2019s written Judgment of Revocation and Sentence reflects a basis for the district court\u2019s determination that is different than the district court\u2019s reasons announced at sentencing, our review of the record reveals no such inconsistency. Therefore, Combs had adequate opportunity to \u201cconsider, comment on, and object to\u201d the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"Acy\">At the time Combs was sentenced, this circuit\u2019s law did not clearly establish that a district judge could not consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in reaching a decision on a revocation sentence, and decisions of the other federal circuits on this issue remain at odds. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>369 Fed.Appx. 608 (5th Cir.2010); <em>compare United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir.2006), <em>with United States v. Lewis, </em>498 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir.2007). Therefore, Combs cannot show that the district court plainly erred in considering the factors of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause this circuit\u2019s law remains unsettled and the other federal circuits have reached divergent conclusions on this issue, ... Salinas cannot satisfy the second prong of the plain error test \u2014 that the error be clear under existing law.\u201d). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b986-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
