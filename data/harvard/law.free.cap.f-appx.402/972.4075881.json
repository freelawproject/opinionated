A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). A district court may reduce \u201ca term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s.; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-80 (5th Cir.2010). Because Richardson was held accountable for sentencing purposes for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, a sentence reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n,10(D)(ii)) (providing that \u201c[t]he 2-level reduction provided in subdivision (i) shall not apply in a case in which ... the offense involved 4.5 kg or more ... of cocaine base\u201d); <em>Carter, </em>595 F.3d at 578-80. To the extent that Richardson seeks to challenge the calculation of the drug quantity attributable to him for sentencing purposes, that issue is beyond the scope of the guideline amendment and is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Richardson argues that \u00a7 1B1.10 conflicts with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and impermissibly restricts consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Richardson\u2019s arguments regarding <em>Booker </em>are foreclosed by <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), and <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Lastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to appoint counsel for Richardson and in denying Richardson\u2019s motion for a reduction in sentence without conducting an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Dickens v. Lewis, </em>750 F.2d 1251, 1255 (5th Cir.1984); Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4); <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
