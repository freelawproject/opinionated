The district court stated its sentence was both an upward departure from the guidelines range of imprisonment based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n,19(a)(4)), 4A1.3(a)(1), and 5K2.0(a)(3), and a variance outside the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Palacios argues that, even if some upward departure from the calculated guidelines range was warranted, the sentence was ultimately unreasonable because of the extent of the departure. Reasonableness review, in the context of a guidelines departure, requires us to evaluate both \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly under \u00a7 4A1.3 was not an abuse of discretion. Palacios\u2019s criminal record shows that he is a repeat offender. Further, the district court\u2019s stated reason for the departure-concern with Palacios\u2019s recidivism-advances the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Likewise, the facts of the ease justified the departure. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. Palacios did not receive as many criminal history points as he could have. He received no points for the burglary that he committed when he was a juvenile, but he concedes that he would have received three points for that had it been counted. He received a single point for theft of stolen property and for interference with public duties, each of which could have resulted in two points had he been sentenced to the maximum sentence of one year in prison. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12.21, 31.03(e)(3), 38.15(b); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). The Presentence Report evinced a substantial risk that Palac-ios would continue to commit crimes insofar as he was already facing theft charges for two other incidents. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(D). Palacios had prior similar adult criminal conduct that did not result in convictions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E). Finally, Palacios had committed four offenses in just over two years, when he was only between 18 and 21 years old. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, comment, (backg\u2019d). Thus, as Palacios concedes, an upward departure to a Category VI was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion when it departed upwardly another seven levels because of the substantial risk of loss involved and the repeated victimization, given that Palacios stole mail on seven occasions, thereby increasing the risk of loss to his victims. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.19); 5K2.0(a)(3). That actual loss was not determined in this case does not preclude a finding that there was a substantial risk of loss. <em>See United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 278-81 (5th Cir.2010) (upholding increase in defendant\u2019s offense level based on intended loss). Further, the district court\u2019s reasons for departing under these Guidelines advanced the \u00a7 3553(a)(2) factors and the departure was justified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>facts of the case. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Insofar as the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to depart, the issue becomes whether the district court abused its discretion in the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 250 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion where the degree of the departure or the sentence as a whole is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Palacios\u2019s reliance on <em>Rajwani </em>is misplaced because his sentence \u201cas a whole\u201d is distinguishable. <em>Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d at 250. The defendant\u2019s criminal history was not at issue in <em>Rajwani. </em>Moreover, as set forth above, the aggravating circumstances in <em>Rajwani </em>were already accounted for in the Guidelines that governed the defendant\u2019s offense. The Guidebnes applicable to Palacios\u2019s offense did not provide an enhancement for the repetitive nature of Palacios\u2019s conduct \u2014 seven thefts in one month. Although the Guidebnes did provide an enhancement based on the number of victims, there was no provision for the increased risk of financial loss created by repeated thefts. Given the aggravating circumstances of Palacios\u2019s offense, the degree of the departure and the sentence as a whole is reasonable. <em>See Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d at 250; <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531-32 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming upward departure from guidebnes range of 21 to 27 months to 60 months when underlying circumstances rendered sentence reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
