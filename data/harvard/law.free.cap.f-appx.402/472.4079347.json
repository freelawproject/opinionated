Gainous claimed that she suffered from Meniere\u2019s disease<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and lower back problems so severely that she should be declared disabled. She last worked in 1996 as a professor and her last date insured was December 31, 2001. On appeal, Gainous claims that the ALJ violated the \u201ctreating physician rule\u201d when it did not give controlling weight the opinion of Dr. David Kaylie, who treated Gainous twice and said that she would not have been able to work a standard forty-hour week before her last date insured. The Appeals Council declined to review her case. After review, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">Gainous\u2019s appeal focuses on whether the ALJ gave proper weight to the opinion offered by her treating physician. She points out that our Circuit typically values the testimony of these doctors during DIB litigation. Accordingly, she argues that Dr. Kaylie\u2019s testimony regarding her condition prior to December 31, 2001, based on his review of her relevant medical history, should be fully credited. Gainous believes that Dr. Kaylie\u2019s testimony establishes that she was disabled as a matter of law on her last date insured and thus is entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">In the context of Social Security appeals, we review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision if (1) the ALJ denies benefits, and (2) the Appeals Council declines to review that decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The Commissioner\u2019s factual findings need only be supported by substantial-evidence, but his legal conclusions are subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). In order to satisfy the substantial evidence requirement, the Commissioner\u2019s decision must be based on evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992) (ci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tation omitted). \u201cThis limited review precludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Eligibility for DIB requires the claimant to prove that she was disabled on or before her \u201cinsured status\u201d expired. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. There is a well-settled five-step process used to determine whether an applicant is disabled for DIB purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">In order to receive disability benefits, the claimant must prove at step one that he is not undertaking substantial gainful activity. At step two, the claimant must prove that he is suffering from a severe impairment or combination of impairments. At step three, if the claimant proves that his impairment meets one of the listed impairments found in Appendix 1, he will be considered disabled without consideration of age, education, and work experience. If the claimant cannot prove the existence of a listed impairment, he must prove at step four that his impairment prevents him from performing his past relevant work. At the fifth step, the regulations direct the Commissioner to consider the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and past work experience to determine whether the claimant can perform other work besides his past relevant work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278 (internal citations omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In determining whether a disability exists, the ALJ must give the opinion of the treating physician<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997)). This is true even if the physician did not treat the claimant until after the relevant period. <em>See Boyd v. Heckler, </em>704 F.2d 1207, 1211 (11th Cir.1983), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, as recognized in Hand v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d 1545, 1548 n. 4 (11th Cir.1985). The ALJ is not, however, required to give controlling weight to issues reserved for the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e). Issues such as whether a claimant is disabled, unable to work, or has an impairment that meets the Social Security listings fall into that category. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Good causes for giving the treating physician\u2019s opinion less weight exists when (1) the treating physician\u2019s conclusion is not supported by the evidence, (2) the evidence supported a contrary finding, or (3) the opinion offered is conclusory or inconsistent with the treating physician\u2019s medical records. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. Additionally, the claimant\u2019s daily activities can contradict the treating physician\u2019s opinion and lessen its credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 1241. \u201cThe ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. If the ALJ does state specific reasons, however, failure to give the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight is not reversible error so long as it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The ultimate issue, whether Gainous is disabled, is left to the determination of the Commissioner, and thus Dr. Kaylie\u2019s opinion that Gainous could not work a typical work week is not binding on the ALJ. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). Beyond that, the ALJ had good cause not to give controlling weight to Dr. Kaylie\u2019s opinion. First, medical evidence contradicted the doctor\u2019s opinion. In reviewing Gainous\u2019s medical history, the ALJ pointed out physician assessments that showed Gainous enjoyed periods with little or no health problems in addition to her visits for various ailments. After discussing some of the points on Gainous\u2019s medical history roller-coaster, the ALJ stated that \u201c[d]espite evidence to the contrary and diagnosis soley indicating chronic disequilibrium, Dr. Kay-lie nevertheless concluded that the clai-maint was \u2018incapable of working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, even at a sedentary level due to fatigue and vertigo.\u2019 \u201d That statement, viewed together with the ALJ\u2019s description of periods of sickness and health that precede it, conveys that the ALJ believed such a eonclusory statement by Dr. Kaylie could not be justified based on the contrary medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Second, the ALJ believed that Dr. Kay-lie\u2019s opinion was contradicted by the activities Gainous performed after the expiration of her insured status. He cited two examples: (1) Gainous indicated that she exercised, which gave her back problems, and (2) she became the caretaker of her mother whose health was declining. The ALJ concluded that these activities provided evidence that she was capable of meaningful activity well after her insured status expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Gainous also suggests that the ALJ erred by finding that she did not have Meniere\u2019s disease. That determination, however, does not appear as if it would have altered the ALJ\u2019s final determination that Gainous was capable of completing gainful activity. Ultimately, Gainous\u2019s problem was upright stability. Whether it was called Meniere\u2019s or not would not have affected the ALJ\u2019s determination. Thus, any error in this regard does not undermine the ALJ\u2019s determination on whether she is able to work. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The ALJ\u2019s failure to give Dr. Kaylie\u2019s opinion controlling weight was supported by good cause and thus should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\">. Meniere's is a \"disease of the inner ear (the innermost of the three parts into which the hearing apparatus is divided) associated with a dilation of the membranous labyrinth____It is characterized by attacks of dizziness, ringing in the ears, deafness, peculiar movements of the eyes (from side to side), and vomiting. The attacks come on at irregular intervals. The cause of the disease is not understood. The treatment has never been satisfactory, but some of the medicines used include diazep-am, which relieves the vertigo and dizziness.\u201d J.E. Schmidt, 4 Attorney\u2019s Dictionary of Medicine M-122 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">. We assume that Dr. Kaylie qualifies as a \"treating physician\u201d for the resolution of this appeal. The Commissioner argues that since Dr. Kaylie treated Gainous \"on only two occasions, he had not acquired the 'longitudinal picture' necessary when assigning additional weight to a treating source.\u201d But we note that this Court has refused to give greater weight to the opinion of a physician who only examined the plaintiff once. <em>Gibson v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 619, 623 (11th Cir.1986) (\"[Plaintiff) relies on the rule that opinions of treating physicians are generally entitled to more weight than opinions of nontreating physicians. We are unable to accept the application of that rule in this case because [physician] saw [plaintiff] only one time.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>see also Hudson v. Heckler, </em>755 F.2d 781, 784 (11th Cir.1985) (\"The evidence submitted by appellant's treating physician ... received all the consideration it was due. [Physician] saw appellant twice and submitted only sketchy, conclusory notes.\u201d). Even construing this issue in favor of Gainous does not save her appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
