Boutte contends that the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was error. Although he concedes that, because he was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, his guidelines range was unaffected by the retroactive crack cocaine amendments, he nevertheless urges that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), should apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, allowing district courts to impose sentences lower than the two-level adjustment contemplated by the crack cocaine amendments based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997). As Boutte concedes, because his offense involved more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, the retroactive crack amendment does not lower his guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.lA) and 2D1.1. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Boutte\u2019s argument based on <em>Booker </em>and its progeny is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
