(Atlantic) finding that Atlantic had no duty to defend or indemnify its insured, PV Roofing Corp., against a lawsuit filed in Texas state court by Gonzalez. Gonzalez argues that policy exclusions do not excuse Atlantic from the duty to defend. We agree with the District Court that Atlantic has no duty to defend its insured under the broad language of the policy exclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">This case arises out of an underlying state court lawsuit by Gonzales against PV Roofing for injuries that resulted from PV Roofing\u2019s alleged negligence. Gonzalez\u2019s original complaint alleged that, while an employee of PV Roofing, he \u201clost both arms and legs as a result of an electrocution injury when a ladder came into contact with power lines and electrocuted him.\u201d Gonzalez amended his petition to allege he was injured \u201cwhile working in a home.\u201d Gonzalez then filed a second amended petition that eliminated any reference to working.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-17\">Gonzalez\u2019s third and fourth amended petitions allege that he was injured while \u201cat a home in Houston\u201d and was: (1) not an employee of PV Roofing; (2) not an independent contractor of PV Roofing; (3) not a subcontractor of PV Roofing; and (4) not an employee of an independent contractor or subcontractor of PV Roofing. He also alleges that PV Roofing \u201cwas engaged in residential roofing activities\u201d and had control over \u201cthe job\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-18\">Uncontroverted record evidence shows that PV Roofing engaged Bernardo Mejia as an independent contractor to complete a job for PV Roofing. Mejia was a personal friend of Gonzalez. On the day of the accident, Mejia went to do his final inspection at the job site and took Gonzalez with him. Mejia got on an aluminum ladder to make a repair. When he finished, he climbed down the ladder and moved around the house to make another repair. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Gonzalez followed him with the ladder. Mejia asked Gonzalez to hand him the ladder; when Gonzalez did so, it came into contact with a high voltage power line and Gonzalez was electrocuted. Gonzalez was not paid by Mejia or PV Roofing for any services, and PV Roofing was not aware that Gonzalez would be at the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Atlantic, PV Roofing\u2019s insurer, filed suit in the district court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify PV Roofing in the state court lawsuit. In its Rule 57 petition, Atlantic argued that it had no duty to defend or indemnify PV Roofing because Gonzalez\u2019s injury fell under a policy exclusion. The exclusion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-6\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">(i) \u201cbodily injury\u201d to any \u201cemployee\u201d of any insured arising out of or in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">(a) Employment by any insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-9\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of any insured\u2019s business</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">(ii) \u201cbodily injury\u201d to any \u201ccontractor\u201d arising out of or in the course of the rendering or performing services of any kind or nature whatsoever by such \u201ccontractor\u201d for which any insured may become liable in any capacity ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-11\">With respect to this endorsement only, the definition of \u201cEmployee\u201d in the DEFINITIONS (Section V) of CG0001 is replaced by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cEmployee\u201d shall include, but is not limited to, any person or persons hired, loaned, leased, contracted or volunteering for the purpose of providing services to or on behalf of any insured, whether or not paid for such services and whether or not an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">As used in this endorsement, \u201ccontractor\u201d shall include but is not limited to any independent contractor or subcontractor of any insured ... and any and all persons working for or providing services and or materials of any kind for these persons or entities mentioned herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">Atlantic and Gonzalez filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted Atlantic\u2019s motion, issuing a Declaratory Judgment declaring that Atlantic had no duty to defend or indemnify PV Roofing in Gonzalez\u2019s underlying state court lawsuit. The court reasoned that Gonzalez qualified as an \u201cemployee\u201d under the broad policy definition, and his claim for bodily injury was excluded from coverage. Gonzalez appeals that Declaratory Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-17\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo,\u201d </em>viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable ... to the non-movant.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Harris County, </em>571 F.3d 388, 393 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-18\">Texas law governs this insurance dispute. An insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to defend is determined by the third-party plaintiffs pleadings, considered in light of the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.\u201d <em>Zurich American Ins. Co. v. Nokia, Inc., </em>268 S.W.3d 487, 491 (Tex.2008). An insurer has a duty to defend if there is a possible \u201ccase under the complaint within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">Although Texas generally applies a strict eight corners rule, <em>GuideOne Elite v. Fielder Rd. Baptist Church, </em>197 S.W.3d 305, 308-09 (Tex.2006), this Circuit has held that reference to extrinsic evidence is acceptable when a petition\u2019s factual allegations are insufficient to determine if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>is a possible case for coverage. <em>W. Heritage Ins. Co. v. River Entm\u2019t, </em>998 F.2d 311, 313 (5th Cir.1993). This exception to the eight corners rule applies when the applicability of policy exclusions cannot be determined by the allegations in the complaint. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham, </em>473 F.3d 596, 603 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The question in this case is whether Atlantic\u2019s policy excludes coverage to PV Roofing for Gonzalez\u2019s claim based on the exclusion for injuries to employees or contractors. Although Gonzalez\u2019s complaint alleges that he was not an employee or a contractor of PV Roofing, those allegations were conclusory because no facts are alleged supporting those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">As the District Court observed, Gonzalez\u2019s complaint \u201ccontains no facts describing what Gonzales was actually doing when he was injured, or the nature of his relationship with PV Roofing or Bernardo Mejia.\u201d Because Gonzalez alleged insufficient facts to permit us to determine whether the exclusions are applicable, it is appropriate to consider extrinsic record evidence to determine whether Atlantic had a duty to defend PV Roofing. <em>See W. Heritage Ins. Co., </em>998 F.2d at 313; <em>Liberty Mut., </em>473 F.3d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Gonzalez testified that he does not remember what happened after arriving at the job site with Mejia. According to Mejia\u2019s deposition testimony, however, Gonzalez moved the ladder at Mejia\u2019s request so Mejia could make a roof repair as part of his subcontracting work for PV Roofing. Gonzalez has not contested this testimony or the use of this extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Despite Gonzalez\u2019s arguments that he was not an employee of PV Roofing because he received no payments from Mejia or PV Roofing, had no relationship with PV Roofing, and did not volunteer to help PV Roofing, we agree with the District Court that Gonzales fell within the broad definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the policy\u2019s exclusion. Under the policy, a person is an \u201cemployee\u201d if he is \u201cvolunteering for the purpose of providing services to or on behalf of any insured.\u201d Gonzalez \u201cvolunteered\u201d to help Mejia, who was repairing a roof on PV Roofing\u2019s behalf. When Gonzalez moved the ladder to assist Mejia in making the repair, his actions were also on behalf of PV Roofing. The policy does not require that Gonzalez have a direct, formal relationship with PV Roofing for his actions to qualify as a service \u201cto or on behalf of\u2019 the insured. As a volunteer who was performing a service on behalf of PV Roofing, Gonzalez was an \u201cemployee\u201d, and the \u201cemployee\u201d exclusion effectively excluded coverage to PV Roofing for Gonzalez\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Because Atlantic\u2019s policy provides no possibility of coverage to PV Roofing for Gonzalez\u2019s injury, Atlantic has no duty to defend or indemnify PV Roofing, and we need not reach Gonzalez\u2019s arguments concerning the proper construction of other parts of the exclusion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the summary judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
