Lockamy contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had not alleged that he suffered any adverse physical effects from missing any meals and had failed to state a claim of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-26\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Berquist v. Wash. Mut. Bank, </em>500 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir.2007). This court views all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hixson Bros., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006). If a motion for summary judgment is properly supported, the opposing party \u201cmay not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleadings\u201d but must, in its response, \u201cset out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court views all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hixson Bros., </em>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006). Even if we disagree with the reasons given by the district court to support summary judgment, we \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>Ber-quist, </em>500 F.3d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">\u201cPrison officials have a constitutional obligation to provide reasonably adequate food\u201d to inmates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To state an Eighth Amendment claim, Lockamy must show that the conditions were \u201cso serious as to deprive him of the minimal measure of life\u2019s necessities, as when denied some basic human need.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507. He also must show that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference, such that the officials were aware of facts from which an inference of the substantial risk of serious harm could be drawn and that the officials actually drew this inference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Courts consider the amount and duration of the deprivation of food in determining whether a constitutional right has been infringed and have recognized that the provision of two meals a day may be adequate to meet the minimal measure of life\u2019s necessities. <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">In <em>Berry, </em>we held that the deprivation of eight meals over a seven-month period did not deprive an inmate of the minimal measure of life\u2019s necessities. <em>Id. </em>at 506-OS. We concluded that Berry\u2019s allegations did not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation, because he had not alleged specific physical harm, other than hunger pains. <em>Id. </em>at 508. Nor had he alleged that he suffered weight loss, other adverse physical effects, or health risks or that he was denied a \u201cnutritionally and calorically adequate diet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The district court, relying on <em>Berry, </em>concluded that although there was a fact issue regarding whether Lockamy had been deprived of every meal during the 54-hour period, he still had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim, because he had not alleged that he suffered physical injury as a result of missing any meals. Locka-my contends that his assertion that he had caused two self-inflicted injuries as a result of being deprived food was sufficient to allege a physical injury. His summary judgment evidence, however, did not include any facts or medical evidence from which the district court could conclude that any alleged deprivation of food was the actual cause of his self-inflicted wounds. In fact, he acknowledged that he had a well-documented history of causing harm to himself that predated the events surrounding this case. His unsubstantiated assertion that he harmed himself because he was deprived of food cannot satisfy the summary judgment burden. <em>See Hathaway, </em>507 F.3d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">To state a retaliation claim, \u201ca prisoner must allege (1) a specific constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). After showing invocation of a constitutional right, the prisoner must \u201cproduce direct evidence of motivation\u201d or \u201callege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u201d <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Furthermore, the retaliatory adverse act must be more than <em>de minim-is </em>to state a viable retaliation claim; the act must be \u201ccapable of deterring a person of ordinary firmness from further exercising his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Morris v. Powell, </em>449 F.3d 682, 686 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Lockamy provides no concrete evidence to establish that any acts of food deprivation were directly motivated by retaliation. In addition, he fails to produce a chronology of events from which retaliation could be plausibly inferred. His speculation that officers maliciously deprived him of food as a result of a campaign of retaliation is not enough to state a constitutional claim. <em>See Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166. Moreover, his personal belief that he was the victim of retaliation is not sufficient to support a retaliation claim. <em>Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 325. An effort to show of retaliation places a heavy burden on prisoners, and mere con-clusional allegations are not enough.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
