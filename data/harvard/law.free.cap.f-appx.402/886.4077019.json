He argued that he has been deprived of benefits provided to other prisoners in light of his immigration status, including a possible one-year reduction of his sentence after completion of a drug treatment program under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e) and placement in a less restrictive facility at the end of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(c). The district court dismissed Cervante\u2019s habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that his claims involved the conditions of his confinement and thus should be presented in a civil rights action. Cerrante now seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal in order to challenge the district court\u2019s adverse ruling. We grant the motion for leave to proceed IFP. Additionally, given our determination of the subject-matter jurisdiction question, we dispense with further briefing of the merits of Cer-vante\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Cervante\u2019s challenges to his inability to receive a one-year sentence reduction after completion of a drug treatment program and to his ineligibility for placement in a halfway house or other less restrictive confinement designed to prepare a prisoner for reentry into society affect the execution of his sentence. Thus, such claims may be raised under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 214-17 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Cleto, </em>956 F.2d 83, 84 (5th Cir.1992). As a result, we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">IFP GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
