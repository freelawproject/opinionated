Williams, federal prisoner #84106-012, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as untimely of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, challenging his conviction for conspiracy to launder money. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), (h). The district court granted Williams a certificate of ap-pealability on the issue \u201cwhether [the district court] can determine that <em>[United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) ] is retroac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>tively applicable for purposes of [ ] \u00a7 2255(f)(3), and, if so, whether <em>Santos </em>is retroactively applicable such that Williams\u2019 motion [was] timely filed under \u00a7 2255(f)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Redd, </em>562 F.3d 309, 311 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 308, 175 L.Ed.2d 204 (2009). The limitation period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion runs from, inter alia, \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d \u00a7 2255(f)(3). As the Government concedes, for purposes of retroactivity concerning the limitations period, any court can hold that a new rule applies retroactively; it need not be the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>248 F.3d 427, 431-32 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Williams argues that in light of <em>Santos, </em>the conduct underlying his conviction for conspiracy to launder money was not criminal because the money at issue did not constitute \u201cprofits.\u201d In <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 397 (5th Cir.2010), we recently held that <em>Santos </em>applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. As the Government concedes, Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3) because his \u00a7 2255 motion, filed in May 2009, was filed within one year of the June 2, 2008, <em>Santos </em>decision. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as barred by the statute of limitations, and we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings. We express no opinion on the issue of procedural bar, raised by the Government for the first time on appeal, or on the merits of Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
