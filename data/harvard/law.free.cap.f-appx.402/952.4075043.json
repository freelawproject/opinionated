Ramos argues that the district court erred by denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 3E1.1. He contends that his explanation regarding the presence of drugs found in his vehicle was not essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>tial to the conduct of the offense. Ramos asserts that he is entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he pleaded guilty and did not contest the factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">A defendant may receive a two-level reduction in offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(a). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the reduction is warranted. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>988 F.2d 544, 551 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cWhile the district court\u2019s findings under the sentencing guidelines are generally reviewed for clear error, a determination whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed with even greater deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cWe will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 unless the decision is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The district court did not err in denying credit for acceptance of responsibility. The court did not find credible Ramos\u2019s explanation of his possession of the methamphetamine. Ramos\u2019s claim that he believed he was in possession of a pair of shoes when he stole a fruit snacks box containing methamphetamine was an attempt to minimize his conduct by denying his knowledge of the methamphetamine. <em>See Watson, </em>988 F.2d at 551. Contrary to Ramos\u2019s argument on appeal, guilty knowledge is an essential element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 446 (5th Cir.2002). Given the deference owed to a district court\u2019s findings on acceptance of responsibility, Ramos has not shown that the denial of the reduction was without foundation. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
