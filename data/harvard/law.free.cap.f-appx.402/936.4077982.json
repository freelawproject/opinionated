Because we cannot conclude that the ARB\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Prior to his termination, Klopfenstein worked as the vice-president of strategic operations for PCC Flow Products, (\u201cFlow\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He initiated the present action after he was discharged in 2003, for violation of the company\u2019s revenue recognition rules. Klopfenstein argues that the company\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext. Klopfenstein asserts that the firm discharged him because he informed co-workers about discrepancies with inventory balance sheets, which he believed could have resulted in a misstatement of the company\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Klopfenstein filed a SOX whistleblower complaint with OSHA alleging that Flow had retaliated against him for what he asserted was protected reporting activity. After an investigation, OSHA determined that Klopfenstein\u2019s complaint lacked merit. Klopfenstein objected to the findings and requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">In 2004, the ALJ issued its first Recommended Decision and Order, which recommended dismissing Klopfenstein\u2019s complaint. Klopfenstein appealed to the ARB, which reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and found that the ALJ had applied the wrong legal standard. The ARB also concluded that ALJ incorrectly determined that Holdings and Respondent Alan Parrott, a former vice-president of Flow, were not proper parties to the complaint. The ARB remanded the case for further consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">On remand, the ALJ affirmed his conclusion as to Parrott, but ruled that Holdings was an agent of PCC and therefore, section 806 applied to the company and its employees. The ALJ also determined that Klopfenstein\u2019s purported whistleblowing activities did not contribute to his termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the ALJ determined that Flow had terminated Klopfenstein because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>he had violated the firm\u2019s revenue recognition policies. Klopfenstein appealed to the ARB, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ARB denied Klopfenstein reconsideration of its second decision. Klopfenstein petitioned us for review of the ARB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">We affirm a decision of the ARB unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a); <em>Willy v. Admin. Review Bd., </em>423 F.3d 483, 490 (5th Cir.2005). The ALJ is granted broad discretion regarding evidence. His factual findings are subject to substantial evidence review. <em>Willy, </em>423 F.3d at 490. Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Williams v. Admin. Review Bd., </em>376 F.3d 471, 476 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, under this standard, the ALJ\u2019s and ARB\u2019s decisions \u201cmust be upheld if, considering all of the evidence, a reasonable person could have reached the same <em>conclusion____\u201d Id. </em>The ARB\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Section 806 of SOX, creates a private cause of action for an employee of a publicly-traded company who is retaliated against because they provided information about corporate fraud to a federal agency or their employer. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a). To succeed in a whistleblower action, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: \u201c(1) [he] engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer knew that [he] engaged in the protected activity; (3)[he] suffered an unfavorable personnel action; and (4) the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action.\u201d <em>Allen v. Admin. Review Bd., </em>514 F.3d 468, 475-76 (5th Cir.2008). If the four elements are satisfied, an employer may still avoid liability by demonstrating with clear and convincing evidence that the same unfavorable personnel action would have taken in the absence of the protected behavior. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(a)-(b)(2)(B)(iv); <em>see also Allen, </em>514 F.3d at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Klopfenstein argues that the agency\u2019s decision failed to comply with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires an ALJ\u2019s decision to contain the basis for the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. Klopfenstein asserts that in whistleblower cases under SOX, the ARB and other reviewing courts should enforce \u00a7 557 with \u201clittle leeway\u201d and should require a \u201cheightened-reasoning requirement.\u201d These arguments are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">We review the ALJ\u2019s conclusions under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard, which focuses on \u201cwhether an agency articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.... \u201d <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. Wilson N. Jones Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>374 F.3d 362, 366-67 (5th Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted). Simply put, the arbitrary and capricious standard requires us to find the existence of a rational basis for the ALJ\u2019s treatment of the evidence. In the present case, such a rational basis exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">The record clearly demonstrates that Klopfenstein\u2019s reporting activity was not a contributing factor in his termination. As demonstrated by the evidence, the decision to terminate Klopfenstein was the result of his violation of the firm\u2019s revenue recognition policies. In addition, the evidence demonstrates that Klopfenstein\u2019s abrasive management style was a secondary reason for his termination. And, the record contradicts Klopfenstein\u2019s contention that the termination reasons offered by the compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>ny*s officers were a pretext or misrepresentations of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings that the decision to terminate Klopfenstein was made by three Holdings\u2019 employees, none of whom knew that Klopfenstein had raised concerns about inventory discrepancies. Further, the record contains substantial evidence that demonstrates the reason for Klopfen-stein\u2019s discharge was his unauthorized change of the company\u2019s revenue recognition policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Klopfenstein asserts that the ARB\u2019s second decision was \u201cunexplained.\u201d But this statement is not accurate. The ARB\u2019s review of the case after remand involved an examination of the ALJ\u2019s new findings of fact and decision. Because substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and conclusions, the ARB\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">The second argument presented by Klopfenstein is that the ARB\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it accepted the ALJ\u2019s erroneous evaluation of whether the alleged protected activity was a contributing factor in Klopfenstein\u2019s termination. We disagree with Klopfen-stein\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">As the ARB correctly stated in its first decision, a contributing factor is \u201cany factor, which alone or in combination with other factors, tends to affect in any way the outcome of the decision.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>514 F.3d at 476 n. 3 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">On remand, the ALJ made additional fact-finding and credibility determinations along with an analysis of what constituted a contributing factor. And the ALJ considered the circumstantial evidence offered by Klopfenstein, which Klopfenstein believed demonstrated why his reporting act was a factor that tended to affect the company\u2019s decision to discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">The ALJ did not err by concluding that this evidence failed to prove that Klopfen-stein\u2019s purported whistleblowing contributed to his termination. Testimony from several of Klopfenstein\u2019s co-workers, along with other evidence contained in the in the record, confirms that substantial evidence supports for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that it was not Klopfenstein\u2019s reporting of inventory recording procedures that resulted in his termination. Rather, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s reasonable conclusion that it was Klopfenstein\u2019s breach of the company\u2019s accounting policies that resulted in the loss of his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Accordingly, we DENY Klopfenstein\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-8\">. Flow is a division of PCC Flow Technologies, LP, a limited partnership owned by two LLCs, which are in turn, wholly-owned subsidiaries of PCC Flow Technologies Holding, Inc., (\"Holdings\u201d). Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp. (\"PCC\"), which is a publicly-held corporation, subject to SEC regulation and SOX.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Although Klopfenstein worked for Flow, according to the ALJ's second findings, his termination stemmed from recommendations and decisions made by three Holdings employees. The decision to ultimately terminate him was made by Wayne Robbins, who served as the president of Holdings and the executive vice-president of PCC. Klopfenstein filed his complaint against Holdings, the subsidiary of PCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\">. The ARB rejected the AU\u2019s initial conclusion that neither Holdings nor Parrott, a former employee of Flow, were proper parties to the action. On remand, the ALJ found that Holdings was a proper party under Section 806 of SOX, but that Parrott was not. The ARB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Holdings did not appeal the ARB's decision and Klop-fenstein did not appeal the ARB\u2019s conclusion regarding Parrott.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">The SEC has filed an amicus brief that discusses the applicability of Section 806 to employees of contractors and agents. The brief presents several arguments as to why Section 806 is applicable to Holdings. We will not address the brief\u2019s arguments, however, because neither party sought review of the ALJ\u2019s second decision on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-16\">.The ALJ did not determine whether Klop-fenstein\u2019s reporting of the inventory discrepancies actually constituted engaging in a protected activity under SOX.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">.
