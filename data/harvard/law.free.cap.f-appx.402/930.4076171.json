The district court imposed a total term of 200 months of imprisonment, consisting of 140 months of imprisonment on count one, 60 months of imprisonment on count two, and 60 months of imprisonment on count three. The terms of imprisonment on counts one and three were to run concurrently, while the term of imprisonment on count two was to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Powell argues that the district court erred by sentencing him as a career offender. He also contends that the district court erred by failing to state the applicable guidelines range and the specific reason for imposing the 200-month sentence, which was below the advisory guidelines range of 262-327 months of imprisonment. In addition to these arguments, Powell, who is represented by counsel, has provided conclusional assertions regarding disparity in the Guidelines, the drug quantity determination, and his criminal history score. These difficult-to-decipher assertions are inadequately briefed, as Powell has failed to clearly identify a theory with regard to these issues as a proposed basis for deciding the case. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 158, 178 L.Ed.2d 95 (2010). Issues regarding disparity in the Guidelines, the drug quantity determination, and Powell\u2019s criminal history score are therefore waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">Regarding Powell\u2019s challenge to the career offender enhancement, to the extent that Powell is presenting arguments to this court that differ from the argument that he presented to the district court, plain error review governs this issue. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, it is not necessary for this court to determine whether the plain error standard of review is applicable, as Powell\u2019s argument fails to demonstrate error in the district court\u2019s decision under the de novo standard of review. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 355-56 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-21\"><em>Post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), although the Guidelines are advisory, the district court must still properly calculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>the guidelines range of imprisonment. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 52-53, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) applies if, inter alia, the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. A controlled substance offense within the meaning of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3) is an offense that, inter alia, prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). A prior controlled substance offense qualifies as one of the two predicate \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3) if the offense was \u201cpunishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense [was] specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Powell submitted a Texas state criminal complaint and judgment of conviction that establish that in 2006 he was convicted in Texas state court of delivery of less that one gram of cocaine by constructive transfer, an offense that was a state jail felony that was punishable for a term that exceeded one year. Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. 481.112(a); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35(a). Although the state sentencing court exercised discretion and sentenced Powell at the misdemeanor level pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.44(a) and Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.21(2), Powell\u2019s offense is nonetheless considered a prior felony conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l); <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 534 n. 3 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1015, 175 L.Ed.2d 621 (2009); <em>United States v. Rivera-Perez, </em>322 F.3d 350, 351-52 (5th Cir.2003). Also, Powell pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, delivery of cocaine by constructive transfer. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe actual or constructive transfer of a controlled substance is rationally understood to be distribution, which is specifically included in the definition of a controlled substance offense set forth in \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 849, 851 (5th Cir.2007). For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err when it applied the career offender enhancement in its calculation of Powell\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Regarding Powell\u2019s assertion that the district court did not comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) when it failed to state at sentencing the applicable guidelines range and the specific reason for imposing the 200-month sentence, as Powell did not make this argument in the district court, plain error review governs this issue. <em>Pel-tier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92. However, to the extent that Powell is challenging the lack of reasons in the written judgment, Powell did not have an opportunity to object to the written judgment. The abuse of discretion standard is therefore applicable to Powell\u2019s challenge to the written judgment. <em>See United States v. Warden, </em>291 F.3d 363, 365 n. 1 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">The sentencing hearing transcript, written judgment, and statement of reasons, together provide details of the district court\u2019s rulings on Powell\u2019s objections to the presentenee report, its adoption of the presentence report, its determination that the Guidelines resulted in an advisory range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment, and its rationale for imposing a 200-month, nonguidelines sentence. The district court sufficiently complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(2), <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 819-20 (5th Cir.2006), and Powell\u2019s conclusional assertions regarding this issue do not demonstrate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
