Dedrick argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender because his prior convictions are not controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>substance offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. He also asserts that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, erred in denying a two-level decrease for his minor role in the offense, and erred in enhancing his sentence based on facts that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He maintains that because the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender, he is entitled to a sentence reduction based on the recent crack cocaine amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The district court did not err in denying Dedrick\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dedrick\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, Dedrick\u2019s arguments challenging his original sentencing are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as such a motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Dedrick argues that the Guidelines were only advisory in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). In addition, given that Dedrick was sentenced as a career offender, the district court did not err in declining to conduct a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) hearing or in refusing to appoint counsel for Dedrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Simply put, Dedrick is not eligible for any sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED. Dedrick\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
