On appeal, Robinson argues that: (1) the district court violated his due process rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts embodied in counts dismissed under the plea agreement; (2) the government breached the plea agreement; and (3) his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1012, 175 L.Ed.2d 620 (2009). We review sentencing arguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error, finding plain error only when there is (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2361, 176 L.Ed.2d 575 (2010). Further, the decision to correct the error is within our sound discretion, and should only be exercised if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Generally, we review whether the government has breached a plea agreement <em>de novo. United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cIf, however, the district court affords a defendant an opportunity to object after the imposition of sentence, and he fails to do so, any objections to the sentence are barred absent manifest injustice. This [Cjourt equates the manifest injustice inquiry with review for plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Robinson\u2019s argument that the enhancements included in the district court\u2019s sentencing calculation for possessing at least three firearms, and for possessing a stolen firearm, violated his due process rights because they were based on facts embodied in counts dismissed under Robinson\u2019s plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court may consider all relevant conduct in calculating a defendant\u2019s offense level. <em>See United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). District courts may consider acquitted conduct at sentencing so long as the sentence imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, as set forth in the U.S. Code, and relevant conduct may be applied so long as proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2005). Relevant conduct must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see id., </em>but alleged relevant conduct is deemed to be true when a defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the allegations. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Conduct that is the basis of counts dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement may be used to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1214 (11th Cir.1989). For instance, a sentencing court may properly consider quantities of drugs that were the subject of dismissed counts of the indictment. <em>United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362, 1371-72 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Here, the inclusion of base offense enhancements for possessing four firearms, one of which was stolen, did not violate Robinson\u2019s rights even though that conduct was the basis for counts dismissed in the complaint. We have also explicitly rejected the argument that the Due Process Clause requires that conduct not covered by the counts of conviction, such as conduct underlying dismissed counts of an indictment, be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the factual allegations giving rise to the contested enhancements were either deemed true, or proven beyond a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in considering Robinson\u2019s possession of multiple firearms when sentencing him for possession of a single firearm, and the district court\u2019s determination that one of those firearms was stolen was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">We also find no merit in Robinson\u2019s claim \u2014 also reviewed for plain error, <em>see Mahique, </em>150 F.3d at 1332 \u2014 that the government circumvented its implicit promise in the plea agreement that the allegations contained in the three dismissed counts of the indictment dealing with his possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of firearms would not be relevant to the offense of conviction. Whether the government violated a plea agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding at the time he entered his plea. <em>United States v. Horsfall, 552 </em>F.3d 1275, 1281 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009) (quotation omitted). Moreover, the government\u2019s agreement to dismiss a count in the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement \u201ccannot bind the sentencing discretion of the district judge\u201d to consider relevant conduct underlying the dismissed counts. <em>See Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Given Robinson\u2019s concession that the district court warned him that it would be considering the conduct that prompted the dismissed counts of the indictment, it was not reasonable for him to believe that the district court would not consider that conduct, or that the government would not support the court\u2019s consideration of that conduct. Additionally, regardless of the plea agreement, the government could not prevent the district court from exercising its sentencing discretion and considering all relevant conduct. Thus, the government did not breach its plea agreement, and the district court did not plainly err in considering Robinson\u2019s conduct that formed the basis for the dismissed counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Finally, we reject Robinson\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s statement that it \u201c[found] no reason to depart from the sentencing ranges called for by the guidelines\u201d constituted an impermissible presumption that the Guidelines are reasonable. When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we will ensure \u201cthat the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. When sentencing within the guidelines range, \u201cthe district court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, 525 </em>F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">In this case, the district court\u2019s statement was not an improper presumption of reasonableness. Rather, it was an acknowledgment that Robinson\u2019s case was typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See id. </em>There is no error when a district court recognizes that the Guidelines are advisory and acknowledges that the Guidelines adequately cover the case before it. Accordingly, the district court did not apply an improper presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">. Because Robinson did not raise this issue before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d at 1238.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
