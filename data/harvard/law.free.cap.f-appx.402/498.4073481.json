Sanchez-Pedro entered a conditional plea of guilt and challenges the denial of his motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-26\">We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence as a mixed question of law and fact, with rulings of law reviewed <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2007). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Sanchez-Paz contends that detectives Alejandro Angulo and Theresa Edmiston of the Polk County Sheriffs Office violated the Fourth Amendment when they recruited Tim Farrans, an employee of Progress Energy, to inspect an electrical installation on property where Sanchez-Paz later was found. Sanchez-Paz maintains that Far-rans acted as a state agent during the inspection; that Polk County Sheriffs Office detective Theresa Edmiston\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant did not contain sufficient information about a confidential source\u2019s veracity or reliability; and that Edmiston deliberately and recklessly included inaccurate and misleading information in the affidavit. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The district court did not err when it denied Sanehez-Paz\u2019s motion to suppress. The record supports the finding by the district court that Farrans acted as a private individual when he entered the property. Although Edmiston and Angulo knew of and acquiesced in Farrans\u2019s inspection of the installation, Farrans entered the property for the private and legitimate purpose of investigating whether electricity was being stolen. Farrans did not act as a state agent. The record also supports the finding that Edmiston\u2019s affidavit did not contain any material misrepresentations and was more than sufficient to establish probable cause for the search of the property. The affidavit established that a confidential and reliable source provided information that someone at the property was cultivating marijuana and stealing electricity, and that information was independently corroborated by the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We affirm Sanchez-Paz\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AzE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
