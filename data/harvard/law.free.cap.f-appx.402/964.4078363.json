Lam argues that the sentence imposed on revocation was unreasonable because it was imposed to run consecutively to the 80-month sentence imposed for the underlying conviction and that the court abused its discretion in denying his request to impose a concurrent sentence. Lam contends that the district court failed to state its reasons for imposing a consecutive sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>tence and that the failure to state such reasons evinced a failure to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">We have yet to address whether sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release are to be reviewed under the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standard of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Prior to <em>Booker, </em>we applied a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005). We need not decide the correct standard today because Lam\u2019s sentence is appropriate under either standard. <em>See id. </em>at 120. To the extent that Lam challenges the district court\u2019s failure to provides reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence, plain error review is applicable because Lam did not object in the district court on this ground. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">\u201cThe decision to impose a consecutive ... sentence upon revocation of supervised release is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 512 (8th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s decision to run the revocation sentence consecutive to the sentence on the underlying charge was authorized by statute and is preferred under the guidelines policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) &amp; comment, (n.4.). Additionally, the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Lam\u2019s revocation sentence. Although the district court did not expressly identify its reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence, any error in failing to explain that choice does not warrant relief under plain error review because Lam cannot show that any error had an effect on the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361; <em>see also United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261-65 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Accordingly, Lam\u2019s revocation sentence satisfies the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d and <em>Booker </em>\u201cunreasonableness\u201d standards. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
