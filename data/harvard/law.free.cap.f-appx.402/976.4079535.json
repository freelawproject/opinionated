The district court dismissed Lang-ston\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The district court denied Langston\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified, for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report, that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Langston is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">Langston\u2019s IFP motion addresses only his indigence. He does not brief any argument regarding the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint or the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinlcmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Langston has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith was incorrect. The instant appeal is therefore without arguable merit and frivolous. Accordingly, Langston\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Langston is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Langston is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1003-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
