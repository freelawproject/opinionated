The district court sentenced him to 96 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. He now moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Brown is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). He has not shown any error in connection with the district court\u2019s good faith determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Brown\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it treated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as mandatory is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). <em>See also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Brown\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s fact finding that drugs and loaded firearms were accessible to children is unavailing insofar as \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not the appropriate vehicle to raise issues related to the original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Last, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant Brown a reduction in his sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 671-72. The district court referenced the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noted the seriousness of Brown\u2019s crime and the danger to the community that would result if Brown were to be released earlier; that Brown stored, packaged, and distributed numerous types of drugs out of his residence where small children also resided; that many of the drugs and an arsenal of firearms (most loaded) were accessible to the children; and, that Brown\u2019s criminal background exhibited a history of drug distribution and violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Brown has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
