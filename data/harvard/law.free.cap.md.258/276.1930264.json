The contract of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>provided for its continuance \u201cfrom school year to school year unless terminated by either party giving to the other a written notice to terminate * * * on or before the 1st day of June of the year in which the contract is to be terminated.\u201d In February 1968 Griffin filed suit in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County against May Russell, the president of the College. He set forth in his declaration statements attributed to her which are alleged to be defamatory. The ad damnum paragraph in each of the five counts demands $500,000 compensatory damages and $1,000,000 punitive damages. On 10 May 1968 Miss Russell served written notice on Griffin that she did \u201cnot plan to recommend * * * [his] contract for renewal for 1969-70.\u201d On 15 May Griffin wrote to Wm. Aleck Loker, Esq., the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the College, requesting a \u201chearing before the Board with reference to * * * [his] discharge from the faculty to take effect a year hence.\u201d He was advised by Mr. Loker that the Board would hear from him and his witnesses on 14 June but that no formal charges would be filed against him. Griffin, still insisting that he be furnished with a list \u201cof the charges against him\u201d appeared with his attorney at the scheduled meeting of the Board. His attorney subjected the Board to a lengthy and somewhat irrelevant harangue. He suggested an absence of \u201cbasic American fairnesshe questioned the good faith \u201cof the institution itselfhe inveighed against the Board\u2019s lack of \u201cAmericanism\u201d equating it with the \u201chot dog on the Fourth of July at the ball game;\u201d suggesting that \u201cmilk * * * [had been] spilled on the table\u201d he insisted he and his client were \u201centitled to th[e] opportunity to see who is going to wipe it up;\u201d he charged the Board with being \u201cafraid to set forth what the charges are and have a hearing;\u201d he demanded, in conclusion, that the Board \u201clet some fresh air in.\u201d Mr. Loker, for the Board, replied that they were \u201cvery happy\u201d to have heard from him; he assumed they wouldn\u2019t \u201chear anything from Dr. Griffin.\u201d Counsel replied, \u201cNot \u2019til we know, sir, what he is charged with.\u201d He did have his client deny, however, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>done anything \u201cthat would be ground for * * * [his] dismissal.\u201d On the following day, 15 June, Mr. Loker wrote to Griffin formally notifying him that the Board had affirmed Miss Russell\u2019s decision not to renew his contract for \u201cthe school year 1969-70.\u201d The record does not disclose all that transpired during the succeeding months but it seems that the Board offered, on 28 September, to renew Griffin\u2019s contract for the 1969-70 school year if he would dismiss the libel suit. Apparently he declined to do so and the offer was withdrawn some months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On 28 February 1968 the Board adopted a \u201cpolicy statement.\u201d The parties seem to consider that only the portion quoted below has any relevance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cTermination for cause of a continuous appointment, or the dismissal for cause of a teacher previous to the expiration of a term appointment, or <em>nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who alleges a prima facie case of a violation of academic freedom </em>shall be considered by both a faculty committee and the governing Board. If the teacher has tenure or an unexpired appointment extending beyond the period of the proposed dismissal, the burden of proof is upon the administration to show adequate cause why he should be dismissed. <em>If he does not have tenure, but contends that the nonrenewal of his contract constitutes a violation of his academic freedom, the burden of proof is upon the faculty member. </em>In all cases where the facts are in dispute, the <em>accused </em>teacher should be informed in writing before the hearing of the charges against him and should have the opportunity to be heard in his own defense by all bodies that pass judgment upon his case. He should be permitted to have with him an advisor of his own choosing who may act as counsel. There should be a full stenographic record of the hearing available to the parties concerned.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>On 2 June 1969,12 days short of a year after the \u201chearing\u201d before the Board, Griffin filed a \u201cPetition for Mandamus\u201d in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. After alleging substantially what we have set forth above he prayed the issuance of an injunction restraining the Board from employing a teacher to replace him, the passage of an order rescinding the notice that he would not be reappointed and the issuance of a writ of mandamus ordering the Board \u201cto provide * * * [him] with a copy of the charges and reasons for the notice of his non-reappointment\u201d and an opportunity \u201cto present evidence in repudiation of these charges and reasons.\u201d The Board demurred because, it said, neither the contract nor its rules and regulations require it to provide copies of charges for the \u201cnonrenewal\u201d of his contract of employment or to give \u201cany reasons\u201d therefor, and, because if had already hired a replacement, Griffin\u2019s \u201caction is barred by laches.\u201d The trial judge, Powers, J., sustained the Board\u2019s demurrer and granted Griffin leave to amend within 15 days. A month or so later Griffin noted an appeal to this Court \u201cfrom the order of court granting defendant\u2019s demurrer.\u201d The notice of appeal concludes with a grace note; the clerk was invited to \u201ckindly further note that plaintiff does not elect to amend his declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">We shall dismiss Griffin\u2019s appeal because it is not an appeal from a final judgment. We have held quite often that an order sustaining a demurrer with leave to amend is not appealable. Our most recent expression in this regard will be found in <em>Porter v. Bingham, </em>257 Md. 213 (1970). Nor does it make any difference that the action in the court below was a petition for a writ of mandamus. <em>Walter v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>179 Md. 665 (1941). <em>See also Whittle v. Munshower, </em>221 Md. 258 (1959). That Griffin allowed the time within which he could have amended to expire without taking any action does not improve his position. <em>Read Drug &amp; Chemical Co. v. Colwill Constr. Co., </em>250 Md. 406, 422 (1968); <em>Maas v. Maas, </em>165 Md. 342 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Perhaps we ought to point out that had we chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>rest our decision on a consideration of the merits of Griffin\u2019s case we would have concluded that Judge Powers was entirely correct in sustaining the College\u2019s demurrer. Griffin concedes that he does not have tenure and that, absent the \u201cstatement of policy,\u201d the College had the right to elect not to renew his contract without a hearing and without giving him reasons therefor. His concession is in accord with the weight of authority. <em>See Williams v. School District, </em>447 S.W.2d 256, 270 (Mo. 1969); <em>Bonner v. Texas City Indep. School District, </em>305 F. Supp. 600, 618 (S.D. Tex. 1969) ; and <em>Parker v. Board of Education, </em>237 F. Supp. 222, 227 (D. Md. 1965), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>348 F. 2d 464 (4th Cir. 1965). But, says Griffin, the \u201cpolicy statement\u201d adopted 28 February 1968 confers Such a right upon him. We do not agree. The statement saddles him with the necessity of alleging \u201ca prima facie case of a violation of academic freedom.\u201d He has come no closer to this than to quote from the \u201cstatement\u201d in his letter of 22 May 1968 to Mr. Loker. Nor, indeed, have we found in the transcript of the record anything which, prior to the hearing of 14 June 1968, could be said to be a \u201ccontention\u201d that his academic freedom had been violated in any respect. Nor can he claim to be an \u201caccused teacher\u201d in a case where \u201cfacts are in dispute.\u201d It does not appear that his appointment was being terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d or that he was being dismissed \u201cfor cause,\u201d prerequisites, it seems to us, to being considered an \u201caccused teacher.\u201d Neither does there seem to be any dispute in respect of the facts. It is clear, we think, that, in the circumstances, the College, although content to have him remain on the faculty for another full school year, had a right not to extend his employment beyond that year. Since we would not, in any event, have reached the question of laches we shall forego any comment in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
