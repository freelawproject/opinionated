B. Mathias, J., directed a verdict for the defendants, appellees here, who seem to have succeeded in persuading him that <em>Larsen v. Romeo, </em>254 Md. 220 (1969), is controlling. They have adopted the same approach here but, as will be seen, we are rather less susceptible to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>suasion. We have compared the facts in the case at bar with the facts related in <em>Larsen; </em>we think they present a horse of a somewhat different color. In our recital of those facts we shall, of course, be at all times mindful of the familiar rule that the evidence and all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered In a light most favorable to the appellants. <em>Ackerhalt v. Hanline Brothers, </em>253 Md. 13 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">In the late afternoon of 3 May 1967, Lynda Lee Craft (Lynda), then 16, was in the student\u2019s seat (left front) of a \u201cdriver education car\u201d owned by the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education. The instructor\u2019s seat (right front) was occupied by Ravis G. Stickney (Stickney) the football coach and a member of the faculty at her school. They had been driving around the Oxon Hill area for an hour or so when Stickney, needing gasoline, told her to turn in to a service station managed by the appellant, Dennis W. Greenway (Greenway). Lynda, after entering the station, made a wide sweeping turn and then headed straight for the right side of the two door Mercury sedan of the appellant, Clara Jean Kramer (Mrs. Kramer), which was standing just beyond the outboard side of the pump island. Greenway was standing alongside Mrs. Kramer\u2019s car cleaning her windshield; an attendant was filling her fuel tank. Greenway noticed Lynda enter the station but he continued to give his undivided attention to Mrs. Kramer\u2019s windshield. He said he heard \u201can engine * * * rev * * * like somebody * * * [just] hit the accelerator * * * wide open all the way to the floor.\u201d He \u201cturned to look and * * * [saw Lynda\u2019s car] two or three\u201d feet away and coming \u201cright on top\u201d of him. He was pinned against Mrs. Kramer\u2019s car and he thought it \u201cabout cut * * * [him] in two.\u201d The right door of Mrs. Kramer\u2019s car was stove in; she was shaken but not hurt. Greenway and Mrs. Kramer filed suit in May 1968. The case was reached for trial on 3 September 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Lynda was called by the appellants as an adverse witness. Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 9 (1965 Repl. Vol.). She testified the car had an automatic transmission and \u201cdual brakes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and that she had received from Stickney a total of \u201cabout three hours\u201d instruction, at different times. As she made her sweeping turn she \u201ctouched the brake\u201d to slow the car. When she reached a point \u201cabout a car length * * * or two\u201d from Greenway \u201c[her] foot just hit the gas.\u201d She said this was \u201cjust a mistake,\u201d that it \u201chappens to a lot of beginning drivers.\u201d What follows is an excerpt from her cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-5\">\u201cQ. And you are aware that after you hit the accelerator pedal he [Stickney] stepped on the brake; is that right? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\">Q. And the brake broke? A. Yes; it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-7\">Q. About how far away? A. About a car length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-8\">Q. When he put on his brake? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-9\">Q. He put on his brake very shortly after you made your mistake? A. Yes; right away. Broke right off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">It was explained to us at argument that on Stickney\u2019s side of the car there was a device, connected by a cable to the brake pedal on the driver\u2019s side, which was designed to allow Stickney to make an emergency application of the brakes from his side of the car, in case the driver (Lynda) failed to do so. According to the record before us Stickney\u2019s only comment immediately after the accident was, \u201cMy goodness, what happened?\u201d A somewhat inconsistent later statement was made to Dennis Auth, an employee of Greenway. He said Stickney told him that \u201cwhen the car started to go forward he stepped on the dual brake and it then broke.\u201d The only witnesses called to establish liability were Greenway, Mrs. Kramer, Auth and Lynda.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">In <em>Larsen, </em>the plaintiff Larsen was southbound on Route 1 (four lanes, no median divider) in Prince George\u2019s County. When he came to its intersection with Rhode Island Avenue he stopped in the extreme right lane, in obedience to a red light. While waiting for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>light to change he was struck in the rear by Romeo\u2019s tractor-trailer. His car was driven forward into a pole on the right side of the road and he was severely injured. He called Romeo as an adverse witness. Romeo testified he approached Larsen\u2019s car at a speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour and about 25 feet from Larsen he applied his brakes but they failed. He said also that his tractor had passed an I.C.C. inspection \u201ca week or two prior to the accident\u201d and that they had worked perfectly before the accident. Judge Marbury, for the Court, reaffirmed the rule announced in <em>Langville v. Glen Burnie Coach Lines, </em>233 Md. 181, 185-86 (1963), and quoted from the opinion of Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u201c \u2018At this point, we are confronted by the well-established rule of evidence that the burden mentioned above is not met by proof adduced by the plaintiff to the effect that defendant\u2019s negligence may have caused the injuries, or even that it probably did cause them, if it also appears from plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the injuries may have resulted from some other cause for which the defendant is not responsible. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">\u201c We think the evidence produced by the plaintiffs in the instant case falls directly within the pattern of the above rule, and precludes their recovery against the defendant. It is obvious that the defendant could not properly be held responsible for a sudden and unforeseeable brake failure such as that proved by the plaintiffs, and which they showed could have caused the injuries; therefore it was incumbent upon them to eliminate the brake failure as the efficient and proximate cause of the injuries complained of, before they could recover for the negligence of the appellee\u2019s driver, which we have had to assume. This, they failed to do; consequently, the action of the trial judge in taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the case from the jury was correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226- . 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">At the trial below there were admitted into evidence, without objection, four photographs of the right door of Mrs. Kramer\u2019s car, taken just after the accident. As in most two door sedans the door is large. Asked if the indentation in the side of the door represented \u201cthe point where Mr. Greenway was standing\u201d Mrs. Kramer answered, \u201cYes, sir. You could see his knee prints right in the side of it.\u201d The cost of repairing the door (the only damage to her car) was only $188.74. Greenway sustained \u201ca mild fracture of the proximal third of the right fibula\u201d and \u201can internal derangement of the knee.\u201d Quite unlike the collision in Larsen, the obvious inference here is that Lynda\u2019s car was just short of a complete stop when it came in contact with Greenway and the door. She (Mrs. Kramer) said there was \u201cnone of that hard metal behind the door,\u201d suggesting that very little force would be required to push in the thin metallic outer covering of the door. Greenway\u2019s knees, it is clear, were caught between Lynda\u2019s bumper and Mrs. Kramer\u2019s door. If Lynda\u2019s car had not been just short of a complete stop the bones in Greenway\u2019s legs would surely have been crushed requiring, perhaps, the amputation of both legs. We do not make light of his injuries. There is no doubt he experienced pain and disablement. We merely point out that if Lynda\u2019s car had not been almost stopped his injuries would have been massive and perhaps fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">In Larsen, Romeo testified the brakes failed when he was about 25 feet from Larsen going 15 to 20 miles per hour. There is no evidence of \u201cbrake failure\u201d here. Lynda said she slowed down as she entered the station by putting her foot on the brake. When she was \u201cabout a car length and a half\u201d from Greenway she stepped on the accelerator, \u201cwide open all the way to the floor.\u201d As the car lurched forward \u201cStickney then hit the brake,\u201d i.e., the device on his side of the c\u00e1r. What then made the car stop where it did stop ? Certainly not Lynda\u2019s foot on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>accelerator. The conclusion seems to be inescapable that Stickney\u2019s application of the brakes brought the car almost to a stop before it struck Greenway. The fact that something \u201cbroke off\u201d on his side of the car suggests only that he stepped so hard on \u201csomething\u201d that it broke. There is no evidence that the braking effort was thereby impaired. Indeed we think it is a quite reasonable inference that the braking effort had been completed and that, as a result, the car had been brought almost to a stop when \u201cit\u201d broke.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">That there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of negligence on Lynda\u2019s part seems not to he questioned. And we think the same is true in respect of Stickney. To allow a neophyte with only a few hours training to drive a car into a service station and to make the conspicuously erratic manoeuvre described in the evidence is, in our judgment, quite enough to support a verdict against him. In <em>Opecello v. Meads, </em>152 Md. 29 (1926), the instructor, sitting beside the driver, was found to be negligent in not seizing the wheel and stopping the car upon becoming aware of the likelihood of danger to the plaintiff. Our predecessors upheld the refusal of the trial judge to direct a verdict for the instructor.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">While we are fully persuaded that the evidence falls short of supporting a \u201cbrake failure,\u201d there is another reason why the judgment of the trial court must be set aside. In <em>Mintzer v. Miller, </em>249 Md. 506 (1968), the plaintiff testified that the defendant said he \u201cwas sorry, that his brakes gave away.\u201d At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the trial judge directed a verdict for the defendant. We reversed. Judge Barnes, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">* * It is the defendant who claimed that there was a failure of his brakes, but he did not state and the evidence of the plaintiffs does not show that there was a proper inspection and a sudden failure without warning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">* [T] he Maryland law is that where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>owner or <em>operator </em>of a vehicle causing a rear end collision depends on the grounds of defective brakes, the burden of showing proper inspection and a sudden failure without warning rests upon the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 508, 509-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">There is not a trace of evidence in the case at bar dealing with, or even suggesting, a proper inspection of Stickney\u2019s brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Since the case must be retried a brief additional comment suggests itself. The general rule is that \u201c[a] person learning to operate a motor vehicle under the tutelage of another is liable for injuries resulting from his own negligence in the operation of such vehicle. He is not relieved from liability for such negligence because of reliance upon the promise of his instructor to render assistance in avoiding danger.\u201d 8 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Automobiles &amp; Highway Traffic </em>\u00a7 698 at 249 (1963) ; <em>see Opecello v. Meads, supra. </em>Also, a driving instructor cannot be held liable for the operator\u2019s negligence if he himself is free of negligence. <em>See Opecello v. Meads, supra; </em>and 60A C.J.S., <em>Motor Vehicles </em>\u00a7 444 at 1085 (1969). However, one who undertakes to teach an unlicensed operator to drive may be liable for injury to a third person caused by the operator where he does not act as a reasonably prudent driving instructor, in teaching or supervising the pupil, or where he fails to take the proper precautions. <em>See White v. Parks, </em>154 Md. 195 (1928) ; 8 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 565; Annot., <em>Liability, For Personal Injury or Property Damage, For Negligence in Teaching or Supervision of Learning Driver, </em>6 A.L.R.3d 271 (1966). The latter rule also applies where the operator is not negligent. <em>White v. Parks, supra; </em>60A C. J.S., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\n<em>Remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\n<em>Appellees to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
