Suit was instituted in Hilton\u2019s behalf in the Superior Court of Baltimore City. Williams pleaded the general issue; interrogatories were filed and answered by both parties; and Williams deposed two witnesses, Gertrude Friedel, who was a passenger in Williams\u2019 car, and Roy Goad, another pedestrian. Williams then moved for summary judgment, filing his own affidavit and the depositions of the two witnesses in support of his motion. The lower court granted the motion and entered judgment absolute in Williams\u2019 favor. Hilton would have us reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The facts which were before the court at the time the motion was granted can be briefly told. On the morning of the accident, Hilton, a man 72 years of age with the mentality of a four year old, was walking in an easterly direction along the sidewalk on the north side of Frederick Avenue in Baltimore City. Williams, with Mrs. Friedel as his passenger, was driving in the center lane of Frederick Avenue\u2019s three westbound lanes. According to Williams\u2019 affidavit, he was driving at a speed of 25 miles an hour, and had reached a point 40 feet west of the point where Long Island Drive enters Frederick Avenue from the south, when Hilton \u201csuddenly and without warning ran from the north curb of Frederick Avenue towards the south curb directly into the path of [his] automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In her deposition, Mrs. Friedel responded to a question about the speed limit on Frederick Avenue and the speed of Williams\u2019 car -:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">\u201cI think the speed limit there is about 30. We were only going about, approximately, 25 I would say* * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>When asked about the scene of the accident, she said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cI guess it would be about 45 feet \u2014 40 feet \u2014 50 feet \u2014 something to that effect [west of the point where Long Island Drive enters Frederick Avenue from the south].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Mrs. Friedel said that she first saw Hilton when he was 15 or 20 feet from Mr. Williams\u2019 car, but could not remember whether he was on the curb or in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Roy Goad was walking in a westerly direction on the sidewalk on the north side of Frederick Avenue with a friend who was on Ms way to school. He was a block or a block and a half away when he first saw Hilton, and about \u201cthree or four houses from him\u201d when Hilton was struck. When asked about the scene of the accident, Goad said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u201cWell, that\u2019s where it practically all happened, right across from Long Island and Frederick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Later Goad said it was \u201cfurther up\u201d Frederick Avenue. When asked about the speed at which the Williams car was travelling, Goad said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cHis car was going 35-40 miles an hour, the same as most of the cars were going. I mean, he wasn\u2019t speeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In response to a question about the speed limit, he replied :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 I am pretty sure it\u2019s 45, or 40. I know it isn\u2019t too high. Of course, I don\u2019t drive myself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I am not sure, really.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Goad was quite positive that Hilton had been hit by the right front of the Williams car; Mrs. Friedel, by the \u201cleft fender\u201d; and Williams said in answer to an interrogatory, by the front of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Maryland Rule 610 a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cIn an action, * * * a party against whom a claim is asserted, may at any time make a motion for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part of the claim on the ground that <em>there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In several recent cases, we have had occasion to comment on summary judgment procedure under the Rule. In <em>Lipscomb v. Hess, </em>255 Md. 109, 118, 257 A. 2d 178 (1969), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201cThe limitations on summary judgment procedure are too well known to require elaboration. It is not a substitute for trial but a hearing to determine whether a trial is necessary, <em>Whitcomb v. Horman, </em>244 Md. 431, 224 A. 2d 120 (1966) ; <em>Strickler Engineering Corp. v. Seminar, Inc., </em>210 Md. 93, 122 A. 2d 563 (1956), when there is no genuine controversy, <em>Pullman Co. v. Ray, </em>201 Md. 268, 94 A. 2d 266 (1953). The purpose of the hearing is not to determine disputed facts, but to determine whether such issues exist. <em>Horst v. Kraft, </em>247 Md. 455, 231 A. 2d 674 (1967) ; <em>Carroccio v. Thorpe, </em>222 Md. 38, 158 A. 2d 660 (1960) ; <em>Tellez v. Canton R.R. Co., </em>212 Md. 423, 129 A. 2d 809 (1957); <em>White v. Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 123 A. 2d 303 (1956). If facts are susceptible of more than one inference, the inferences must be drawn in the light most favorable to the person against whom the motion is made, <em>Lawless v. Merrick, </em>227 Md. 65, 175 A. 2d 27 (1961), and in the light least favorable to the movant, <em>Howard Cleaners of Baltimore, Inc. v. Perman, </em>227 Md.. 291,.176 A. 2d 235 (1961); <em>Roland v. Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc., </em>221 Md. 11, 155 A. 2d 691 (1959).\u201d ,.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>See also, <em>Jordan v. Malloy, </em>255 Md. 473, 258 A. 2d 182 (1969); <em>McDonald v. Burgess, </em>254 Md. 452, 255 A. 2d 299 (1969) and <em>Dudley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>255 Md. 247, 257 A. 2d 437 (1969) where a summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff was reversed and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant by this Court despite the fact that the summary judgment rules had not been complied with by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As the case stood when the motion for summary judgment was considered, there was a dispute as to at least four facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">(i) The speed limit on Frederick Avenue;</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">(ii) The speed at which the Williams car was travel-ling;</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">(iii) The exact place where Hilton was struck;</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">(iv) What part of the Williams car struck Hilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">It is quite apparent that the speed limit and the speed of the car were material, so that it is unnecessary to consider the materiality of the other issues. Whether Williams was driving his car at a speed which was excessive under the circumstances, Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 6614 \u00a7 211 (a), or exceeding the speed limit, Code, Art. 66!4 \u00a7 211 (c), were questions to be determined by the trier of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201c[T]he violation of a statutory regulation is evidence of negligence, and if such violation causes or contributes to the injuries complained of it constitutes negligence * * <em>Ford v. Bradford, </em>213 Md. 534, 541,132 A. 2d 488 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">To the same effect are <em>Khoyan v. Turner, </em>255 Md. 144, 147, 257 A. 2d 219 (1969) ; <em>Alston v. Forsythe, </em>226 Md. 121, 172 A. 2d 474 (1961) ; <em>Reid v. Humphreys, </em>210 Md. 178, 122 A. 2d 756 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">Because the testimony adduced by Williams regarding speed and the speed limit was clearly conflicting, the motion for summary judgment should not have been granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>It is unnecessary to reach the other questions raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>Judgment, reversed, case remanded for further proceedings, costs to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-14\">. On the admissibility of Goad\u2019s testimony as to the exact speed of the Williams car, see <em>Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 218 A. 2d 549 (1965); <em>People\u2019s Drug Stores v.
