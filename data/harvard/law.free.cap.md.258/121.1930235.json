The question here is whether the McDonalds facility proposed for Frederick is a \u201ccafe\u201d or a \u201crestaurant,\u201d as those terms are used in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Frederick. The appellants say it is a \u201crestaurant;\u201d the appellees hold out for \u201ccafe;\u201d we cannot see that it matters much either way. The trial judge, Clapp, J., was of the opinion that the pertinent sections of the Zoning Ordinance \u201care not models of clarity.\u201d We \u25a0are of a mind to agree with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Zimmerman, one of the appellees, is the owner of a corner lot in downtown Frederick, the zoning classification of which is B-O-Limited Business District. As stated by Judge Clapp:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cIn a B-O-Limited Business District, in addition to R-4-Multi Family District uses, the principal permitted uses under Section 11.102 of the Ordinance are medical offices, artists\u2019 studios and galleries, shops for the sale of gifts, antiques, articles, flowers, stationery, clothing, jewelry, candy and similar specialties for personal use and pharmacies primarily for prescriptions and pharmaceutical items.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201cSection 11.30 permits certain conditional uses upon authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals and under this heading Section 11.304 designates \u2018hotels, inns, <em>cafes, </em>soda fountains, tearooms, and taverns, not including dancing or entertainment\u2019 as some of such conditional uses.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In February 1969 Zimmerman, as owner and as agent for McDonalds, applied to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a permit \u201cto construct a cafe\u201d on his land and for the conditional use of it as a \u201ccafe.\u201d As Judge Clapp ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>served, \u00a7 11.304 of the ordinance lists \u201ccafe\u201d as one of the conditional uses but it should be observed also that the term \u201crestaurant\u201d is omitted. Zimmerman\u2019s application, in the words of Judge Clapp, \u201cwas vigorously resisted before the Board of Appeals * * * [; its] decision * * * [was] reached after four lengthy hearings\u201d and, we might add, some 400 pages of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Appellants argue that, absent from the ordinance a definition of either <em>cafe </em>or <em>restaurant, </em>the intention of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen (the legislative body) in adopting \u00a7 11.304 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> must be determined by an examination of the three succeeding categories; i.e., B-l-Shopping Center District, \u00a7\u00a7 12.00 to 12.60, B-2-Central Business District, \u00a7\u00a7 13.00 to 13.50, and B-3-General Business District, \u00a7\u00a7 14.00 to 14.60. They point out that \u00a7 12.802c<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allows as a \u201cpermitted use\u201d both <em>restaurants </em>and <em>cafes. </em>In the B-2-Central Business District \u00a7 13.101<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any use permitted in the B-0 and B-l districts is a principal permitted use. They point out also that in the B-3-General Business District \u00a7 14.1111 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permits as a principal permitted use \u201cdrive-in eating and drinking places.\u201d Thus they conclude that it was the intention of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen to distinguish between <em>drive-in eating jslaces, restaurants </em>and <em>cafes </em>and that the question thus becomes whether McDonalds is a cafe, consistent with \u00a7 11.304 or a restaurant, consistent with \u00a7 12.302c. Appellants insist that McDonalds is in fact a restaurant, whether it be called a \u201ccafe, inn, tavern or what have you,\u201d because there will be about 40 employees, because the facility will be visited by 800 to 900 cars per day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and because 2000 customers, more or less, will be served generating gross receipts of about $350,000 per year. Their principal witness, Julian Tarrant, a professional planning consultant, was \u201cpretty much * * * responsible for the drafting\u201d of the ordinance. He said we (himself and the Mayor and Board of Aldermen) \u201cwere intending to permit in the B-0 [District] only those kinds of limited professional office and business uses as would be quiet and modest and unobtrusive in residential surroundings.\u201d Asked if McDonalds was consistent with such a use he said, \u201cNo, it certainly is not.\u201d Yet he testified as follows:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">\u201cA. It [a cafe] is a more limited type. I would say this \u2014 that a restaurant is a rather general term that may be applied to a whole variety of eating places.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201cA. * * * A cafe, on the other hand, because of its name \u2014 the word itself is a French term derived from the word \u2018coffee/ and in fact in French it does mean \u2018coffee/ and therefore a coffee house, one that features coffee and similar beverages as distinguished from alcoholic beverages, and with that, of course, <em>light meals </em>or refreshments, pastries, delicacies, <em>light lunches </em>and maybe more substantial \u2014 there\u2019s no particular limit; * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201cA restaurant, on the other hand, is generally conceived of as being <em>an all-purpose kind of an eating establishment, </em>inside \u2014 you have very few outside restaurants any more \u2014 with principally tables and chairs and waiters or waitress service, and serving a full scale of meals \u2014 entire meals, full meals, as a rule; * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">It appears to be conceded that the \u201cmain items\u201d on McDonalds\u2019 menu \u201care hamburgers and french fries.\u201d The addition of fried chicken was said to be still under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>consideration. Applying Mr. Tarrant\u2019s concept of \u201ccafe\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d one could easily reach the conclusion that McDonalds will be more nearly a \u201ccafe\u201d than a \u201crestaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Appellants contend also that \u201cregardless of what Mc-Donalds chooses to call itself, it is not a limited business.\u201d They cite \u00a7 11.305 which authorizes other conditional uses \u201cdeemed by the Board to be of a similar character to those permitted, and not of a general commercial or industrial nature.\u201d But there is testimony sufficient to support a contrary conclusion. Mr. Tarrant thought a cafe was \u201ca more <em>limited </em>type\u201d of restaurant. (Emphasis added.) Mr. Brunk, a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission, was asked if he considered McDonalds \u201cto be a limited type business.\u201d He replied, \u201cI certainly do.\u201d The parties stipulated that the word \u201ccafe\u201d has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Cafe \u2014 a coffee house, restaurant with music and entertainments, often in open air. <em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Cafe \u2014 a coffee-house, refreshment room or restaurant; sometimes (U.S.) a bar room. <em>Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s New Standard Dictionary </em>Cafe \u2014 a coffee-house; restaurant. <em>Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s Standard</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Cafe \u2014 a coffee-house, a restaurant; strictly a French term but recently introduced in this country for the name of a class of restaurant. <em>Oxford English Dictionary, 1933 Unabridged Edition</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">1.

A coffee house or restaurant. <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">The term \u201crestaurant\u201d and \u201ccafe\u201d are generally considered as being synonymous \u2014 reference to State v. Shoaf, 179 N.C. 744, 102 S. E. 705, 9 A.L.R. 426. <em>IpO Am.Ju/r.2d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>On page 878 the word \u201ccafe.\u201d It has been said that the word was originally a French word meaning \u201ca coffee house,\u201d but that as the word is now ordinarily and properly used in English it means a restaurant or house for refreshments, and that, in common parlance, the terms \u201ccafe\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d are substantially synonymous. <em>Corpus Juris Secundum</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlZ\">The word \u201ccafe\u201d as ordinarily and properly used means a restaurant <em>or </em>house for refreshments. <em>6 Words and Phrases</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It should be understood that the Board, in granting the conditional use, imposed 18 conditions and restrictions which, if literally observed, may well bring the facility within the business use contemplated by Mr. Tarrant, i.e., \u201cquiet, modest and unobtrusive.\u201d We have set forth below some of those restrictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cD. There shall be no signs allowed except: the word \u2018McDonalds\u2019 which shall be limited to forty-five (45) square feet, placed on the front of the building facing West 7th Street and not to be illuminated; * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201cE. That no attendant employees of the cafe may serve customers in or on vehicles in any outside areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cF. That no exterior ordering device will be installed whereby a customer may place an order from a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cG.

That one employee * * * shall be primarily assigned * * * to the policing of the interior and parking lot and off-premises litter which might be created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201cJ. That no exterior trash receptacles be located off premises and particularly on the sidewalks, nor in the prescribed front yard area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">\u201cM. No \u2018arches\u2019 shall be used on the building or the premises * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201c0. Any lighting used to illuminate the building or the parking area shall be so arranged as to direct the light away from adjoining premises in the \u2018R\u2019 District and from the public streets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cP. Business hours shall be limited to 9:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M., Monday thru Friday; 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M., on Saturday; and 11:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M. on Sunday. All exterior lights shall be extinguished at the conclusion of business hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We quote again from Judge Clapp\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cCafes, admittedly, are a conditional use in such district [B-O] and under Section 21.34 of the Ordinance authorizing the Board of Appeals to hear and decide applications for conditional uses, the Board must give \u2018due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures\u2019 and may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance and operation as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201cMoreover, under Section 21.342 the Board may require the installation, operation and maintenance in or in connection with the proposed use of such devices and methods of operation as may in its opinion be reasonably required to prevent or reduce hazardous or congested traffic conditions, odor, dust, smoke, gas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>noise or similar nuisances and it may impose such other conditions and requirements as may be necessary in its opinion to protect adjacent properties and neighborhoods and prevent conditions which may become obnoxious or offensive. The Section further contains a provision for compelling compliance with any conditions imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201cFurther, Section 21.40 requires the Board of Appeals in deciding these conditional uses applications to study the property involved and the neighborhood and to give specific consideration to some 14 matters relating to the effect of the grant of such a conditional use on public health, safety, security, morals, or general welfare including the contribution, if any, such proposed use, building or addition would make toward the deterioration of areas and neighborhoods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cThis review of conditional uses in a B-0 zone and the safeguards placed around their issuance makes it apparent that the Board of Appeals, by conditions, may keep the building and the operation of the use, compatible to surrounding areas. The Board of Appeals has undertaken to do this by the conditions imposed and the fact that the operation will be McDonalds or any other large operator does not mean that such large operation will be conducted on the land in question. The Board is given a broad discretion within the guidelines outlined above and has exercised this discretion by the conditions imposed. In an appeal to the court from a decision of the Board of Appeals in matters of this type, <em>the question, simply put, is whether there was sufficient evidence before the Board to make the issue fairly debatable. </em>In this instance <em>much evidence was taken </em>and the Board decided <em>to follow one line of evidence rather </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>than the other. </em>This it had authority to do and the court is without authority, since there was ample supporting evidence, to overrule the Board. Accordingly, * * <em>* </em>the action of the Board must be affirmed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Since Judge Clapp seems to have it just about right nothing more need be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-5\">. \u201cHotels, inns, cafes, soda fountains, tea rooms, and taverns, not including dancing or entertainment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">. \u201cRestaurants, cai'es, or soda fountains, not including dancing or entertainment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. \u201cAny Principal or Conditional Use or structure permitted in the B-0 and B-l Districts (without the same conditions), except an automobile service station, a.nd except as otherwise modified by this Section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">. \u201cDrive-in eating and drinking places, summer gardens, and road houses, including dancing and entertainment \u2014 provided the principal building shall comply with the specified distance requirements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
