In 1984, Joseph did retire and retained an engineering firm to design a house for the lot. A notice of intent to construct a dwelling was filed by the plaintiffs with the conservation commission of Harwich (commission), as required under the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>(act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This petition sought commission approval for construction of a two-bedroom house, gravel driveway, and subsurface septic system. Plans for the proposed septic system were also submitted for approval. On June 26, 1987, the commission entered an order denying approval of the project on grounds that it involves the \u201cfilling of wetland\u201d and that the proposed \u201cseptic system fails to meet the standards of the [Harwich] Board of Health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">1. <em>The wetlands issue. </em>Two avenues of appeal are available to applicants aggrieved by an order of the Harwich conservation commission: the first, under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, thirteenth par.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is to the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; the second, under St. 1981, c. 569, and a Harwich by-law (\u00a7 9-108), is to the District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>When the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to build their house and driveway was denied by the commission, they appealed to both the DEQE and the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On September 9, 1988, the DEQE issued a superseding order which approved the project subject to certain conditions. According to the DEQE, the areas in question are not \u201cAreas Subject to Protection Under the Act\u201d as that term is defined in its regulations. The commission had concluded that the two areas were connected and that \u201cthere is groundwater movement between ponds.\u201d The DEQE, on the other hand, determined that the two \u201cisolated\u201d depressions are too small to be regulated as \u201cIsolated Land Subject to Flooding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">As noted, the plaintiffs also filed an action in the District. Court challenging the commission\u2019s order of conditions which imposed a ban on construction, pursuant to St. 1981, c. 569, \u00a7 1. A trial de nova was held on various dates. On June 29, 1989, the judge issued findings, rulings and order for judgment and affirmed the decision of the commission. The judge found that the DEQE\u2019s determination that neither of the two areas is \u201cconnected as far as surface topography is concerned does not compel the conclusion that they are \u2018isolated,\u2019 \u201d He also concluded that the commission is not required to accept or be bound by the determination . . . [of] the DEQE\u201d and that the commission \u201cis entitled to impose more stringent standards than those utilized by the DEQE, [and thus include] any subterranean connection between the two areas and larger bodies of water in the area.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The parties appear to have assumed that the District Court judge was to determine whether the ruling of the commission or the ruling of the DEQE would stand. This was error: the District Court judge had no power to disturb the ruling of the DEQE. Any appeal from the order of the DEQE would have to have been made pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. (None was taken.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u25a0 \u201cThe legislative history of [G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40] demonstrates that the Legislature has always reserved to the Commonwealth, acting through its various agencies, the final decision on applications for projects affecting statutory concerns as to wetlands protection.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 364 (1981). The language of the act itself lends support to this position. It specifically states that \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d by an order of the commission may request the DEQE to review those concerns considered by the commission, and the DEQE\u2019s determination and order shall \u201csupersede the prior order of the conservation commission . . . and all work shall be done in accordance therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The amendments to the act lend further support. Statute 1972, c. 784, amended the act and gave local authorities the power to \u201cimpose such conditions as will contribute to the protection of the [wetland values] described [in the act]\u201d and to require that \u201call work shall be done in accordance\u201d with any conditions that they might impose. Notwithstanding this legislative delegation of power to the local authorities, the 1972 amendment did not, however, \u201cdivest the Commonwealth of its right to the final say on project applications decided on the basis of those interests recited in \u00a7 40.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 366. Rather, the amendment expressly reserves this right to the Commonwealth, acting through the DEQE.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Local authorities do have final power, however, where they are acting pursuant to an ordinance or by-law which is consistent with the act, but which permissibly imposes \u201cmore stringent controls\u201d than the minimum Statewide standards set by the Legislature. See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Fal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>mouth, </em>358 Mass. 519, 525-526 (1970). \u201cThus, where a local authority disapproves a proposed project pursuant to a bylaw or ordinance which provides greater protection than \u00a7 40, the applicant has no right to seek DEQE approval of the project on the basis that it would be acceptable under the statute. . . . Where, however, the local authority approves or disapproves an application under \u00a7 40, the Commonwealth, through the DEQE, has the final word.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Here, the commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application for construction was not based on a by-law \u201cwhich provides greater protection than \u00a7 40.\u201d <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 368. Rather, the town\u2019s by-law specifically adopts and incorporates by reference the definition section of the act. In so doing, the town necessarily adopted and incorporated the definition section of the regulations promulgated by the Commonwealth pursuant to the act. Since the town chose not to impose \u201cmore stringent controls\u201d than those set by the Legislature concerning those areas which are subject to wetland protection, it follows that the DEQE had the authority to issue a superseding order.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We conclude that, once the DEQE issued its superseding order, the appeal from the commission\u2019s order to the District Court was moot, and the District Court judge should have dismissed the case before him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Principles of judicial economy also support our decision; we cannot condone a procedure which would allow two separate avenues of appeal. Cf. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>392 Mass. 788, 792 (1984) (allegedly inconsistent statutes are construed to give reasonable effect to both and to create a consistent body of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">2. <em>The septic system. </em>The DEQE found that \u201c[njone of the components of the septic system are located within a wet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>land resource area\u201d and that the system is beyond the jurisdiction of the Wetlands Protection Act. The order of conditions issued by the DEQE requires, however, that prior to construction a valid board of health permit be obtained. Obviously, that hurdle still remains for the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and an order is to be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The purpose of the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, is to protect wetlands from destructive intrusion, and all use of \u201cproperly denominated wetlands\u201d is barred or limited to activities compatible with the wetlands. <em>Southern New England Conference Assn. of Seventh-Day Adventists </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 706 (1986). The act established \u201ca comprehensive scheme of administrative action and remedies with local authorities, i.e., conservation commissions, making the initial review [of restrictions on an owner\u2019s use of wetlands] \u2018for the familiar purposes of bringing local knowledge to bear on local conditions and reducing the administrative burden on [the DEQE.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Envtl.
