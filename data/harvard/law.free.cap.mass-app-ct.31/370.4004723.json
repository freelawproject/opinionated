L. c. 90, \u00a7 32. A judge of the District Court found the search was without the consent of the defendant and a subterfuge to avoid the burden of establishing probable cause to support a criminal investigative search. The judge allowed, on State constitutional grounds, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the search. The Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>findings were clearly erroneous. We affirm the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We take our facts from the judge\u2019s findings, supplemented, where relevant, by the supportive testimony of Robert Youngclaus, the supervisor of the auto theft unit of the Registry of Motor Vehicles and the only witness at the suppression hearing. The defendant was the owner and proprietor of an auto body shop in Cambridge called Collision Auto Repair. After receiving a tip from a confidential informant that a stolen Jaguar and possibly other stolen vehicles were located at the defendant\u2019s garage, Youngclaus attempted to verify the tip. He drove by the premises two or three times in the ensuing two to four weeks, took down the license plate numbers of motor vehicles in the defendant\u2019s lot, and checked whether the plates were stolen. He was unable to corroborate the information received from the confidential informant. The latter had not previously provided Youngclaus with accurate data, and Youngclaus did not know the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A week or so prior to January 4, 1990, Youngclaus decided to conduct an administrative inspection of the defendant\u2019s garage pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32. The relevant portions of that section are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>inspections by his unit of the Registry of Motor Vehicles were not conducted on a regular schedule but rather were made on the basis of complaints and tips of suspicious activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">When asked, on cross-examination, whether the reason he had \u201cdecided to conduct an administrative search\u201d of the defendant\u2019s garage was that he \u201chadn\u2019t been able to independently verify the information about a stolen Jaguar that [he] had been given ... by a confidential informant some weeks earlier,\u201d Youngclaus answered: \u201cThat was part of the reason, but the reason was to conduct an administrative inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also acknowledged that had he \u201cbeen able to corroborate what [his] confidential informant had told [him] prior to-January 4th, [he] would have gotten a search warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>To effect the January 4, 1990 administrative inspection, Youngclaus assembled a team of five police officers from the \u201cGovernor\u2019s Auto Strike Force.\u201d In the course of briefing his men, he told them that he was looking for a stolen Jaguar.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On January 4, 1990, Youngclaus and five police officers in civilian clothes, armed but with weapons concealed, went to the defendant\u2019s premises in unmarked vehicles. Entering alone, Youngclaus informed the defendant that he was there \u201cto conduct an administrative inspection\u201d to examine the records of the vehicles the defendant was working on, and that there were other officers with him who would be checking vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Within moments of Youngclaus\u2019s entry into the building, the other men entered the building and the adjacent parking lot outside. The search lasted about an hour and a half and included examination of vehicles and vehicle identification numbers. In some instances, the officers looked under the hoods of vehicles and also scratched off paint from the vehicles. Auto parts were discovered on top of a paint shed located in the building. When Youngclaus asked the defendant if he had access to these parts, the defendant answered that he had a ladder. An officer used the ladder and found parts from a stripped Jaguar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After Youngclaus learned that the identification number found on that Jaguar matched a Jaguar which was reported stolen, the defendant was arrested and two Jaguars were seized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Based on the foregoing evidence, and noting that c. 90, \u00a7 32, \u201cdoes not contain the obvious regulatory purposes and breadth of chapter 140, sections 57 to 69,\u201d the judge concluded that 1) the search was not a valid administrative search, but rather was a criminal investigative search using G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32, \u201cas a subterfuge to avoid the burden of establishing probable cause for such a search\u201d; and 2) that the defendant did not consent to the search and only cooperated because he was told to do so by Youngclaus and the five other police officers. He ruled that the search was in violation of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Although the Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous, the facts of the search are not disputed. Indeed, the Commonwealth acknowledges in its brief: \u201cAt the time they entered the defendant\u2019s business, the police were admittedly looking for a particular vehicle which they suspected was stolen and believed was located on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">What the Commonwealth contends, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 393 (1981), is that in conducting the search, the police were acting in aid of one of the regulatory purposes of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32, that is, the prevention of the theft of motor vehicles or their parts. See also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691 (1987). Since this is so, the fact that the police suspected criminal activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>when they entered the defendant\u2019s premises did not, the Commonwealth maintains, render the search invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">By citing <em>Baldwin, </em>the Commonwealth may be suggesting that the line of demarcation between regulatory and criminal enforcement activities is sufficiently blurred in this case so as to render irrelevant the motives of the officers conducting the warrantless administrative investigation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frodyma, </em>386 Mass. 434, 443 (1982). We need not, however, consider whether the search was a subterfuge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (as the judge found) because here there was not an objectively reasonable administrative inspection in accordance with art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass. 249 (1990), is the first and only case which specifically discusses the requirements of a warrantless administrative inspection under art. 14. <em>Id. </em>at 256. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass. 199, 202 n.5 (1988). In holding valid a warrantless administrative search to determine whether a fishing vessel has a State permit to land raw fish, the court in <em>Tart </em>applied the Fourth Amendment analysis of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>but pointed out that it expressed \u201cno opinion whether art. 14 would require more stringent standards for a warrantless administrative inspection which [as here] involved more than a request to produce a State permit.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tart, 408 Mass, at 257 n.3. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass, at 206 and n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The Fourth Amendment requirements are explained in <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass, at 253-254:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201cIn <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 700, the United States Supreme Court stated that an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy in commercial premises was \u2018particularly attenuated\u2019 when the premises were, utilized in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>context of a \u2018closely regulated\u2019 industry. Therefore, the Court reasoned, \u2018the warrant and probable-cause requirements, which fulfill the traditional Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness for a government search . . . have lessened application in [the context of such premises]\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 702. A warrantless administrative search of the commercial premises of a \u2018closely regulated\u2019 industry would be considered reasonable, and therefore permissible, under the Fourth Amendment so long as three criteria are met. First, the State must have a \u2018substantial\u2019 interest in the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the administrative search is made. \u2018Second, the warrantless inspections must be \u201cnecessary to further [the] regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594, 600 (1981). \u2018Finally, \u201cthe statute\u2019s inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, [must] provid [e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 703, quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 603. See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>[489 U.S. 602, 627] (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blinn, </em>399 Mass. 126, 128 (1987).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We turn first to whether the defendant was in a \u201cclosely regulated\u201d industry. As the judge correctly noted, garage owners and repairmen are far less regulated under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32, than under the statute upheld for Fourth Amendment purposes in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>see <em>id. </em>at 694-695 &amp; nn. 1 and 3, or the statutory scheme of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 57-69, whose warrantless inspection scheme was upheld against a Fourth Amendment challenge in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass, at 206,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 393. Even were we to assume-that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>repairmen, although not licensed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are a \u201cclosely regulated business,\u201d and were also to assume that the purpose of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32, is to further the substantial governmental interest in the control of automobile theft, and that warrantless inspections are necessary to implement that goal, the third criterion of <em>Burger, </em>at least for art. 14 purposes, was not here met. \u201c[T]he statute\u2019s inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application,\u201d does not provide a \u201cconstitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u201d 482 U.S. at 703. There must be \u201ca proper limitation on the \u2018time, place, and scope\u2019 of the inspection in order to restrain the discretion of the inspectors.\u201d <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass, at 205, citing to <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. at 703, 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Section 32 (note 2, supra) did not limit the scope of the search to records or to motor vehicles, and permitted what the judge found happened here, \u201ca general search\u201d of the premises, 79 Hurley Street. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lipomi, </em>385 Mass. 370, 382 (1982), for a discussion of the similar shortcomings of G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 25, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frodyma, </em>386 Mass, at 440, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 441 (1980), explaining that \u201cthe entire justification for \u2018[t]he lesser standard of probable cause required to obtain an administrative inspection warrant [or to justify a warrantless search] is inexorably linked to the limited scope of an administrative search.\u2019 \u201d Compare <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass, at 205 and n. 11. Compare also the narrow scope of the statutory search upheld in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass, at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In addition, and particularly troublesome under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights, the Registry of Motor Vehicles did not have any standard. procedures governing administrative searches. Such guidelines \u201cwould tend to eliminate any element of discretion in a decision to conduct a search\u201d and would \u201chave a greater chance of meeting constitutional requirements than an ad hoc practice.\u201d <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass, at 203 n.8, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>394 Mass. 421, 427 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass, at 257. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 347 (1989) (roadblock must \u201cmeet standard, neutral guidelines, and be conducted pursuant to a plan devised in advance by law enforcement supervisory personnel\u201d);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>402 Mass. 449 (1988) (written standard policies required for inventory search).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The inspection here was not \u201cconducted systematically and pursuant to clear statutory or regulatory guidelines,\u201d <em>Eagleton, </em>at 203, but rather was on an ad hoc basis calling for searches instigated by a complaint or tip given to the Registry. This procedure gives almost unlimited discretion to the investigating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Because of these serious shortcomings of the search as a regulatory, and hence necessarily limited, inspection, let alone as a vehicle for the search for stolen goods and their seizure, we agree with the motion judge that, in the absence of consent to the search, the evidence must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The judge\u2019s finding that the defendant did not consent to the search and only cooperated because he was told to do so is not clearly erroneous. The evidence warranted the finding that there was no more than a showing of \u201cacquiescence to a claim of lawful authority\u201d when the defendant was told by Youngclaus that he, accompanied by other government agents, was conducting an administrative search. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-549 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmond, </em>376 Mass 557, 561-562 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion, based on the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, claimed that the administrative search was a \u201csearch for criminal evidence upon the pretext of an administrative inspection and [that] the scope of the search exceeded any reasonable limits of an administration inspection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1966, c. 222, \u00a7 2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cEvery manufacturer of and dealer in motor vehicles or trailers, and every owner, proprietor, person in control or keeper of a garage . . . shall keep or cause to be kept in a book a proper record of every motor vehicle or trailer which enters and which leaves his garage, stable, shop or place of business; provided, however, that any dealer in motor vehicles or trailers, or person engaged in the repair or servicing of motor vehicles or trailers, who makes no charge for the storage of motor vehicles or trailers, shall be exempt from keeping the record book above referred to if and so long as he keeps adequate records of the repairs and services performed with respect to the motor vehicles or trailers which come into his custody, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>records show in substance the information required to be shown in said book.

At oral argument, the Commonwealth conceded that the validity of the January 30 search depends on the validity of the one on January 4. The Commonwealth does not argue that we should distinguish among the items or statements sought-to be suppressed. Accordingly, we need not discuss the second search or consider separately the evidence suppressed. If a <em>proper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>inspection discloses evidence of wrongdoing, the information gained therefrom may be used to establish probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frodyma, </em>386 Mass. 434, 445 and 449 n.18 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Article 14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">\u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.
