An unoccupied, white Mercedes automobile with District of Columbia license plates was parked in the area, as was a gray Chrysler with two occupants, Rick and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The jury could have found that the following events then took place. Stevens parked his car and walked over to the Chrysler where Rick introduced him to the defendant. The defendant got out of the Chrysler and, together with Stevens, walked toward the Cadillac. Rick, meanwhile, drove away in the Chrysler.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">After Stevens and the defendant were seated in the Cadillac, the defendant asked Stevens whether he had the money. Stevens said that it was in the glove compartment. Stevens then asked the defendant whether he had the \u201ckilo of coke.\u201d The defendant replied that it was in the trunk of his car, and he added, \u201cDid Rick tell you that it was going to cost $27,000?\u201d Stevens said he was aware of the price and reached into the glove compartment, removed a canvas bag, and handed it to the defendant. Inside the bag were twenty-seven $1,000 bundles of United States currency. The defendant \u201cthumbed through it like you would a deck of cards.\u201d After he was satisfied that all the money was there, the defendant returned the bag to Stevens. The two then walked to the Mercedes, and the defendant opened the trunk of the automobile. Inside was a miscellaneous collection of clothes, papers, a vacuum cleaner, cleaning agents, sprays for the upholstery, and, finally, an off-white bathing towel which, when unfolded by the defendant, revealed a white plastic case about one foot long, two inches thick, and six inches wide. Inside the case was a square object, \u201clike a brick,\u201d wrapped in tape with a small hole in the center of the brick.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Stevens examined the brick and said to the defendant, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s good stuff.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d The defendant then returned the brick to the plastic container, wrapped the container in the bath towel, shut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>trunk, and, with Stevens directly behind him, walked toward the Cadillac, presumably to retrieve the cash in the canvas bag. As they were walking, Stevens asked the defendant, \u201c[C]ould this be done on a monthly basis?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cIt could be done on a daily basis, just get in touch with Rick.\u201d At this point Trooper Stevens, stepping up from behind the defendant, wrapped his left arm around the defendant\u2019s chest, with his other hand put his service revolver to the defendant\u2019s head, identified himself as a State police officer, and told the defendant he was under arrest. He then advised him of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The defendant appeals from his conviction of trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(6)(3), as appearing in St. 1983, c. 571, \u00a7 3, claiming that he was wrongfully denied access to a known informer, that there was insufficient evidence to justify the submission of the case to the jury on the theory that the defendant brought cocaine into the Commonwealth, and that the judge erred in permitting the admission of certain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">1. <em>Access to a known informer. </em>The first claim arises out of the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto secure access to informer.\u201d The relevant facts, which are not in dispute, are these. By letter dated February 28, 1989, the prosecutor informed defendant\u2019s counsel of \u201cpotentially exculpatory evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter disclosed Rick\u2019s identity as Richard Esta\u00f1o and that, following the arrest of the defendant, Charles Risio and Charles Rubino provided the State police with information about the drug activity of a third person. It later turned out that the information given to the police about the third person, the letter continued, had in fact been fabricated, and Risio and Rubino were now charged with obstruction of justice and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">There matters stood, so far as appears from the record, until June, 1989, when the defendant filed a pretrial motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>which sought to \u201csecure access\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Esta\u00f1o by requiring the Commonwealth to produce him at a hearing in order to determine \u201cwhether or not the informer is presently amenable to questioning by the defense.\u201d At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion the prosecutor told the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u2018\u2018[T]he defendant isn\u2019t entitled to an evidentiary hearing. . . . As to the informant in this case, . . . Mr. Esta\u00f1o, his identity has been disclosed to the defense attorney. <em>I can give whatever information I\u2019m able to give as to the latest location that we know of I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incumbent upon the Commonwealth to do anything further. </em>If he feels it necessary to contact this informant whose identity has been disclosed, defense counsel can do that. He can contact him. He can interview him. He can determine whether or not there is any information that this informant can produce that will be helpful to his defense, and in that case he can produce the informant himself.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Defense counsel replied that he had no information as to the whereabouts of Esta\u00f1o and that it would \u201c.not be difficult for the District Attorney\u2019s office to produce him ... so that my office might have the opportunity to conduct an inquiry . . . .\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded, however, that if they were given Estano\u2019s address and if \u201cit would be possible for us to contact him, that way, <em>then that would probably serve the </em>purpose\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The judge, who said that he regarded the request for oa hearing as \u201cunusual,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> denied the motion, and the issue was not reopened by the defendant until the trial, nine months later (March 28-29, 1990). Trial testimony <em>on </em>March 28, 1990, revealed that Esta\u00f1o was then incarcerated in Danbury Federal prison and that he had been there for \u201cat least two years, maybe three.\u201d This would put Esta\u00f1o in Danbury \u2022 prison when the prosecutor wrote her letter in February, 1989,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and at the time of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion in June, 1989. \u201cWhy, oh, why,\u201d asked defendant\u2019s counsel at trial in support of his oral motion to dismiss the indictment, \u201chaven\u2019t we been told where Mr. Esta\u00f1o has been all these years?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The argument then was, and on appeal now is, that given the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to provide the address \u2022 of Rick to the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMiller, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 407 (1990), the failure to do so was a denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Even accepting the defendant\u2019s argument that his motion to secure access should be treated as a request for the address of Rick,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it does not follow that the defendant was deprived of his asserted State and Federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The transcript of the hearing on the motion suggests that the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion because he believed that the defendant already possessed Estano\u2019s address, see note 4 <em>supra, </em>and because the need for an evidentiary hearing had not been demonstrated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the judge may have misunderstood the prosecutor, defendant\u2019s counsel certainly could not have misunderstood the judge, whose statement concerning the delivery of Estano\u2019s address quoted in note 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>sppra, </em>appeared to support what the judge understood the prosecutor to have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Given the proffer of all available information by the prosecutor in open court at the hearing on the motion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s argument to this court that he was \u201cdenied access\u201d to Esta\u00f1o lacks substance. It is a quibble to say that the Commonwealth failed in the performance of its constitutional obligations by failing to provide Estano\u2019s address when it offered to deliver that information to the defendant\u2019s counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 747 (1989) (where the defendant required the address of a known informer in order to serve him with a subpoena, the Commonwealth \u201cmust <em>offer </em>the defense whatever information it had about the informer\u2019s location\u201d [emphasis added]). If for any reason the Commonwealth had not been forthcoming in its response to the specific request for information as to Estano\u2019s whereabouts, the defendant could have had prompt access to a judge for the relief to which he would have clearly been entitled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The defendant does no better by insisting on an' evidentiary hearing. The judge, in denying the motion, could reasonably have expected that the defendant would attempt to interview Esta\u00f1o before applying to the court for relief, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 915, 917 (1991), and counsel offered nothing to the judge which made it reasonable to expect that an out of court interview with Esta\u00f1o would have been entirely futile. Indeed, trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>conceded at the hearing that possession of Estano\u2019s address \u201cwould probably serve the purpose. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We do not suggest that trial counsel was neglectful or indifferent to his responsibility to prepare the case for trial. To the contrary, it is clear to us that when he showed no interest in Estano\u2019s whereabouts for nine months, only to be intensely interested in that subject at the trial, he demonstrated a deliberate strategy which eschewed an interview with Esta\u00f1o<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in favor of a missing witness instruction \u2014 which the judge gave along with an instruction on entrapment. \u201cThat was excellent, Judge,\u201d the defendant\u2019s trial counsel told the judge following the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>535 F.2d 130, 135 n.5(1976) (\u201cThe request for [a missing witness] instruction sometimes indicates that defense counsel is more interested in exploiting the witness\u2019s absence than seeing him produced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">2. <em>The importation of cocaine. </em>In response to a question from the jury during their deliberations as to whether trafficking is \u201call one charge\u201d or whether \u201cbringing in [is] separate from intent to manufacture or distribute,\u201d the judge read the statute to the jury and added that trafficking may consist either of the knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute 200 grams or more of cocaine, or of \u201cknowingly and intentionally bring [ing] into the Commonwealth 200 grams or more of cocaine.\u201d Counsel did not object to this instruction, but on appeal he now claims it was error, requiring reversal of the judgment because of the asserted absence of evidence of \u201cbringing in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Assuming the issue is open on appeal as a result of the defendant\u2019s generalized motion for a required finding of not guilty on all charges at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, </em>403 Mass. 194, 197 (1988), there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to have found beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123, 129 (1989), either on the theory of \u201cbringing in\u201d or on the theory of possession with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>intent to distribute, the essential elements of the crime of trafficking. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, supra </em>at 197 (insufficient evidence of one of the several theories given to the jury required reversal of the judgment of conviction and a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, supra </em>at 129, and on that basis we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the \u201cbringing in\u201d theory. In the absence of Massachusetts authority describing the elements of \u201cbringing in,\u201d we follow decisional authority under the Federal analogue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) (1988).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There must be satisfactory proof that (i) the cocaine was brought into the Commonwealth from someplace outside and (ii) the defendant in some manner participated in the act of importing. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Manbeck, </em>744 F.2d 360, 385 (4th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Evidence that the defendant resided, as he admitted, outside the Commonwealth,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that he was in control of an automobile (which he referred to as \u201chis\u201d car) with out-of-State license plates and in which cocaine, likely to have come from South America,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had been hidden, that the automobile was parked in a rest area on a major motor highway awaiting the rendezvous with Trooper Stevens, and that inside the automobile were men\u2019s clothing, toiletries, jewelry, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cmaps throughout the interior compartment of the car\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is sufficient in the aggregate to permit the jury to infer that the defendant drove into the Commonwealth from someplace outside, knowingly and intentionally bringing more than 200 grams of cocaine with him. There need not be testimony of an observed territorial crossing: <em>Ibid. </em>Federal cases cited by the defendant have no bearing on the factual pattern present in this case: In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nusraty, </em>867 F.2d 759, 764, 766 (2d Cir. 1989), there was no evidence that the defendant ever took possession, either actual or constructive, of the cocaine; in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>908 F.2d 728, 735 (11th Cir. 1990), the evidence failed to connect the defendant (Bucchiere) with any activities of importation; in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>591 F.2d 1091, 1104 (5th Cir. 1979), there was no evidence the boat in question had ever left the territorial waters of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">3. <em>The admission of a prior consistent statement. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the judge erroneously permitted the prosecutor to inquire into a statement made by Trooper Stevens in his police report. The defendant\u2019s counsel, on cross-examination of Trooper Stevens, had sought to show that his trial testimony was inconsistent with his grand jury testimony. The prosecutor offered in rebuttal Stevens\u2019 police report, which had been made prior to the grand jury testimony and was consistent with Stevens\u2019 trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Following a timely objection by the defendant, the judge said, \u201c[Y]ou brought up something. . . . She\u2019s trying to show that this isn\u2019t a recently contrived story on the part of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We have read the testimony, and it is clear to us that the judge did not abuse his discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healey, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 35 (1989), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In a written pretrial conference report the Commonwealth agreed to provide the defendant with \u201cexculpatory evidence within the possession, control, or custody of the Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pizzone, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 382 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The quoted phrase came, no doubt, from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 746 (1989). In <em>Curcio, </em>unlike this case, the defendant had an address for the informer, but he could not find the informer to serve him with a subpoena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Indeed, in counsel\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the motion to secure access, counsel asserted only that the Commonwealth \u201cmust <em>offer </em>the defense whatever information it has about the informer\u2019s location\u201d (emphasis added). That offer was made, but the defendant remains unsatisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judge also said, referring to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks quoted above, \u201cShe said she had given you his last address.\u201d It would appear that the judge misunderstood the prosecutor on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">It does not appear that the prosecutor had this information when she wrote her letter in February, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Other than the motion, counsel made no request of the prosecutor for Estano\u2019s address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel suggested at the hearing that the problem was the possibility of Estano\u2019s refusing to talk to him; however, counsel, it seems, had made no attempt to obtain Estano\u2019s address or to interview him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Information available to the prosecutor necessarily includes information in the possession of the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>382 Mass. 154, 157 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">If, at that point, the Commonwealth refused to provide the information, the defendant would have been entitled to an order of the court requiring the release of the information. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, 427 </em>U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (\u201cWhen the prosecutor receives a specific and relevant request, the failure to make any response is seldom, if ever, excusable\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 572 (1990). If the Commonwealth did not then have the information, but later came to possess it, it would have had the continuing duty to disclose it. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(4), 378 Mass. 875 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Estano could have been required to testify in a Massachusetts court.
