L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, or Mass.R.A.P, 25, as amended, 376 Mass. 949 (1979). The plaintiff questions the court\u2019s authority to tax substantial expert witness fees, as contrasted with the nominal witness fees taxable under G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29 (six dollars a day and ten cents a mile), and contends that the judge abused her discretion in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\n<em>Expert Witness Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">There is precedent in decided cases for the taxation of expert witness fees and costs against the losing party. See <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 389-390 (1979); <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 547, 555 (1987); <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 194-195 (1990); <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 607 (1991). See also <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Biotti, </em>404 Mass. 112, 113 (1989), describing how such an order was affirmed in <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Manchester, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (1987). In <em>George </em>v. <em>Coolidge Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>360 Mass. 635, 640 (1971), the court, in affirming an order denying taxation of \u201cexpenditure for depositions, expert witness fees, transcribing of testimony, printing of the record and testimony, and costs of printing for briefs,\u201d said: \u201cWe do not know why the judge did not award those costs, but G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 13, places the matter \u2018wholly in the discretion of the court,\u2019 and no abuse of that discretion has been shown.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The <em>George </em>decision, if it stood alone, could be understood as saying only that such costs as may be awardable are, by G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 13, discretionary with the judge \u2014 no implication being intended that each item sought as costs was in fact legally allowable. The decision seems to have been read more broadly. In the <em>Linthicum </em>case, a G. L. c. 93A action in which the successful plaintiff sought to recover his expert witness fees under \u00a7 9(4) (requiring that, where a violation of the act is found, \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with said action\u201d be awarded), the court stated: \u201cAlthough the award of expert witness fees is usually discretionary,\u201d citing the <em>George </em>passage, \u201cwe think that reasonable expert witness fees should normally be recoverable in a c. 93A case in order to vindicate the policies of the act.\u201d 379 Mass, at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., supra </em>\u2014 a case not involving c. 93A \u2014 an order allowing expert witness fees was affirmed over a contention of abuse of discretion, the court first discussing the source of the authority for such an award. This was said to be G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1, which provides in broad terms that a \u201cprevailing party shall recover his costs, except as otherwise provided,\u201d and G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 345, which provides that where \u201cno provision is expressly made by law, the costs shall be wholly in the discretion of the court . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">It is often said that the \u201cusual rule in Massachusetts is that the litigant must bear his own expenses.\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass, at 389. The decision in <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977), listed three exceptions to that general rule: where (1) a statute permits awards of costs; (2) a valid contract or stipulation provides for costs; or (3) rules concerning damages permit recovery of costs. This formulation was repeated in <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 721-722 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 376-377 (1978), this court, relying on the \u201cusual\u201d rule (as had the trial judge), held nontaxable the cost the defendant incurred in purchasing a letter of credit, required by a surety company as collateral security for a surety bond that was required to dissolve an attachment which the ultimately unsuccessful plaintiff had placed on the defendant\u2019s property. A statute, G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 122, authorized taxing as costs the premiums paid to the surety company for the bond: thus, the premiums were held properly taxed. But the statute was silent as to the cost of any security the surety company itself might require. On further appellate review the Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that, in the absence of a statute or rule expressly or impliedly to the contrary, Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(d) (\u201ccosts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs\u201d) controls. Rule 54(d), the court stated, \u201cis consistent with G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1, which provides that \u2018[i]n civil actions the prevailing party shall recover his costs, except as otherwise provided.\u2019 \u201d 377 Mass, at 524. The court stated that the \u201cbroad generality that \u2018in Massachusetts, a litigant must bear his own expenses\u2019 . . . has many exceptions and must be tempered by the policies expressed in Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(d), and G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 13.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525. The case was remanded to the judge to exercise her discretion whether to allow the additional amount. The <em>Goulet </em>case cited <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog </em>in holding that the award of costs, including expert witness fees, was authorized by G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The dicta in the <em>George </em>and <em>Linthicum </em>cases and the holding'in <em>Goulet </em>refute the plaintiff\u2019s contention that expert witness fees are taxable as costs only to the extent specified in G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29 (six dollars a day, ten cents a mile) and that Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(d) should be interpreted to adopt the</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Federal practice under the corresponding Federal rule. That would be our normal approach, since the operative language of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) (\u201cExcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute ... or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs\u201d) reads identically to our own rule. <em>Rollins Envtl. Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 179-180 (1975). Here, however, the underlying Federal statutory scheme has been construed very differently from our own. The Federal statute listing taxable costs, including witness fees (at thirty dollars per day), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(3) (1988), is interpreted as limiting the fees that the court may allow: this reflecting the original language of the predecessor statute, Act of Feb. 26, 1853, 10 Stat. 161: \u201cThat in lieu of the compensation now allowed by law to attorneys, solicitors, . . . and . . . witnesses ... in the several States, the following and no other compensation shall be taxed and allowed.\u201d <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 440 (1987). Although the quoted language of exclusivity no longer appears in the statute, it has been held that the omission was \u201cwithout any apparent intent to change the controlling rules.\u201d <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc., </em>421 U.S. 240, 255 (1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In practical effect, then, the usual rule seems to be that the victorious party\u2019s actual costs are taxable in the discretion of the judge under the authority of G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 13. The formulation of <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>that the usual rule is that the litigant bears his own expenses, subject to three exceptions, is technically true; but the first of those exceptions, where \u201ca statute permits awards of costs,\u201d in effect swallows the \u201cusual rule,\u201d G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1, having been interpreted in accordance with its broad and seemingly plain mandate: that a \u201cprevailing party shall recover his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>costs, except as otherwise provided.\u201d If some categories of costs fall outside the governance of G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1, such as attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <em>Goulet </em>decision makes clear that expert witness fees fall within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We cannot say, on the record before us, that it was an abuse of discretion to allow the expert witness fees in this case. It is probably unusual for an injured plaintiff to be assessed substantial costs in favor of a corporate defendant in a products liability action; more commonly cost shifting is justified as balancing the litigating power of indigent plaintiffs against moneyed interests. See Note,. Expert Witness Fees: Protection for the Indigent Party, 48 Nw. U.L. Rev. 106 (1953), cited in <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass, at 389. The statute and the rule, however, are drafted in neutral terms, not reflecting a socioeconomic leaning. Accordingly, on a bare record,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we cannot say that this particular shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of costs was necessarily improper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">There is also no merit to the argument that the plaintiff should not be taxed for those portions of the expert witnesses\u2019 fees that paid for pretrial preparations, time spent in travel-ling, reimbursements for meals, and the like. These experts happened to bill for time spent plus expenses. Others may charge a flat fee; the distinction the plaintiff suggests would in all likelihood merely lead all experts, in the future, to adopt the flat fee method of billing. A sounder approach would be to recognize that, as between the expert witness and his client, the fee may be computed as they agree. The question for the judge is whether the total fee, however computed, was reasonably and necessarily incurred and, as this is a discretionary cost,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> whether all, some, or none thereof should be taxed to the losing party. If a decision is made to tax such costs, conservative principles should normally be applied, see <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 596-597 (1950); <em>Rex Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Acton Block Co., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 510, 521-522 (1990); but, again, on this record we cannot say the judge abused her discretion in taxing the entire fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\n<em>Deposition Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Rule 54(e) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, 382 Mass. 829 (1981), which does not have a counterpart in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides for the taxation of deposition costs in \u201cthe discretion of the court, but in no event shall costs be allowed unless the court finds that the taking of the deposition was reasonably necessary, whether or not the deposition was actually used at the trial.\u201d This standard reflects Federal case law interpreting the application of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1920(2) (1988) (fees for \u201cstenographic transcript [s] necessarily obtained for use in the case. . . .\u201d) to deposition transcripts and copies thereof. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kolesar, </em>313 F.2d 835, 838-840 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The plaintiff argues that the award of deposition costs must be reversed because the judge made no explicit finding that the costs were reasonably necessary. The finding was implicit, however, in the order allowing the deposition costs. The purpose of the rule is to fix a standard by which the judge is to be guided in taxing deposition costs; it would not measurably protect the party against whom costs are to be taxed to require the judge to recite the .standard in his order. Contrast Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), which requires that a partial judgment may be entered \u201conly upon an <em>express </em>determination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The plaintiff properly concedes that the present record generally does not enable us to review the basis for the implicit finding that the costs were reasonably necessary. This is true even of the deposition (apparently Langelier\u2019s) that was the subject of the March 28, 1985, order that the defendants pay for its cost; the order, being interlocutory, was subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment. <em>Trudel </em>v. Gagne, 328 Mass. 464, 465 (1952). We cannot say, as matter of law, that the videotaping of the Zimbler deposition was unnecessary, nor do we know the added cost of that method of preservation of deposition testimony. The same is true of the $308 spent for an expedited trial transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>plaintiffs testimony. That added cost may have been found unnecessary in <em>National Bancard Corp. </em>v. <em>VISA, U.S.A., Inc., </em>112 F.R.D. 62, 64-65 (S.D. Fla. 1986)(the party ordering the daily transcript had several attorneys in the courtroom at all times taking notes), but this is a matter for the discretion of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\n<em>Order on costs affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-20\">The case was here before, on appeal from the judgment on the merits. See 27 Mass.

There, the insurer sought and was denied its counsel fees. The <em>Chartrand </em>decision, affirming the denial, stated that \u201c[cjommonly such allowances are made\u201d under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 40 (a general inter-pleader statute now repealed), but, because this case was governed by G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 13, \u201ccosts shall be wholly in the discretion of the court,\u201d and \u201c[i]t cannot quite be said that there was abuse of discretion in refusing to allow the request of the insurer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The <em>Fuss </em>decision upheld an award of costs of deposition under Rule 3:15, \u00a7 9, of the Supreme Judicial Court, 351 Mass. 812 (1967), the predecessor of Mass.R.Civ.P. 30-32, 365 Mass. 780-790 (1974)(depositions), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>but reversed an award of unspecified \u201cgeneral costs\u201d (in the round amount of $5,000) under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38; c. 209, \u00a7 33; and c. 215, \u00a7 45. The <em>Broadhurst </em>decision reversed an award of costs against the Commonwealth but relied not on the general rule but on specific provisions of rule (Mass.R.Civ.P. 54 [d]) and statute (G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 14) restricting the taxing of costs against the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cThe 1948 Code does not contain the language used in the 1853 Act and carried on for nearly 100 years that the fees prescribed by the statute \u2018and no other compensation shall be taxed and allowed,\u2019 but nothing in the 1948 Code indicates a congressional intention to depart from that rule.\u201d <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv.

Perhaps\" to create a substitute record, new counsel for the plaintiff sought a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion for costs. The judge acted on the motion without a hearing. This was not error; still less was it error not to make findings. The usual rule in our practice is that motions may be acted on without hearing, where the same is not particularly required by statute, rule, see Superior Court Rule 9A(b)(l) and (2), or decision, and without giving a statement of reasons. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 817 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">This is true of posttrial motions concerning costs, which \u201cshould not deteriorate into ancillary major litigation.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass.

Posttrial motions relative to taxing discretionary costs are usually considered on affidavits and vouchers, as in this case, see, e.g., <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass, at 194-195, although the judge may in his discretion afford a hearing. An evidentiary hearing would be required if the underlying facts disclosed by the affidavits and vouchers were contested.
