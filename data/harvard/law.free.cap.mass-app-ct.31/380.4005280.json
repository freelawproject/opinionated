They also found $900 in currency as well as numerous rent receipts and other indications that the apartment was rented and occupied by the defendant. In this appeal from his convictions of trafficking in cocaine in excess of 200 grams (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E) and possession of cocaine (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant claims numerous errors. We affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the affidavit of Officer William Taylor, a narcotics officer in the Lowell police department, met the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363 (1985),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and set forth sufficient facts for the issuance of a search warrant for apartments 4 and 10 at 151 Wood Street in Lowell and for its issuance with a no-knock provision. The affidavit alleged the following. On May 28, 1988, Carlos Serna of 151 Wood Street in Lowell was arrested when narcotics officers observed him in an alleged drug transaction with occupants of a vehicle bearing Maine license plates. A substantial sum of money ($22,400), as well as a substance believed to be mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>huana, was found in the car. A similar substance was also found on Serna\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On June 23, 1988, Taylor learned from the Maine Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement that an informant, alleged to be reliable and who feared physical harm, had informed the Bureau that a cocaine trafficking operation in Old Orchard, Maine received its cocaine from 151 Wood Street in Lowell and that on June 24, 1988 two people using a gray Ford van with Maine license plates would be going from Old Orchard to 151 Wood Street, apartment 10, to purchase cocaine from a Colombian named either Carlos or Augusto Serna. The informant had purchased cocaine from Carlos Serna or Augusto Serna at that apartment on five different occasions within the last two months. He claimed these persons used elaborate surveillance techniques to detect police, including people on bicycles to check unknown cars, and that he had seen a handgun in the possession of one of the suspects inside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As a result of this information, Maine and Lowell police set up a joint surveillance operation. On June 24, 1988, they saw a Ford van with Maine plates parked in a lot on Wood Street and a passenger leave the van on foot and return to the van from the direction of 151 Wood Street. Officers followed the van and stopped it in Old Orchard. A search revealed a large quantity of white rock powder, subsequently determined to be cocaine. The passenger, Richard Littlefield of North Conway, New Hampshire, was placed under arrest and, after being advised of his Miranda rights, told the police that the cocaine found in the van had been purchased by him in Lowell at 151 Wood Street. Having rung the doorbell at apartment 10 and informed a Spanish man who answered that he needed five and one half ounces of cocaine, Littlefield was taken to apartment 4 in the same building. From a cabinet in the kitchen area he was given two bags of cocaine for which he paid $5,000. He also saw several similar bags in the cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">One of the police officers watching the building on June 24, 1988 was approached by a Spanish male on a bicycle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201cchecked out.\u201d Two minutes later the same male returned with a black Subaru, the type of car the Maine informant had described as used by Carlos Serna.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">From a discussion with the building manager of 151 Wood Street, the police learned that Augusto Serna was the listed tenant for apartment 10 and that the defendant and Maria Perez were the listed tenants for apartment 4. On the rental application, the defendant had named Augusto Serna as a co-renter.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass 343, 346-348 (1984), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 435-437 (1989), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 293 (1990), the information came from a named participant in a crime, Littlefield, rather than from a \u201cfaceless informer.\u201d His purchase of the cocaine satisfied the basis of knowledge test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 45 (1991). His assertion of firsthand knowledge, coupled with the specificity of the facts that he furnished, lent credence to the belief that he personally saw criminal activity and warranted a finding of reliability. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass, at 348. That his statement of participation in the cocaine transaction was against his penal interest at a time when he would have \u201ca reasonable fear of prosecution\u201d lent additional credibility to his information. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>407 Mass. 53, 56-57 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Further support for the warrant was provided by the unnamed Maine informant whose information, in large part, corroborated Littlefield\u2019s account. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 627 (1983) (informants\u2019 detailed statements corroborating each other in significant, detailed respects can establish their veracity); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 323-324 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 110, 115 (1988). Like Littlefield, the Maine informant admitted to having purchased cocaine at 151 Wood Street \u2014 on five occasions over the previous two months \u2014 from Carlos or Augusto Serna in apartment 10, and he also believed that the cocaine sellers kept the cocaine in a separate \u201cstash\u201d apartment in the same</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>building. He also provided other valuable information: he correctly predicted the June 24 purchase of cocaine by a person in a Ford van with Maine plates (Littlefield); he described the car that Carlos Serna drove; he knew of the surveillance that Carlos' and Augusto Serna used to protect their operation; and he had recent information that there was a large supply of cocaine on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Independent police corroboration of these two accounts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 897-898 (1990), was also set forth in the affidavit. Augusto Serna was linked to both apartments, and police observed both the predicted drug purchase by occupants of the Ford registered in Maine and the surveillance techniques described by the Maine informant. The affidavit established probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">There was also sufficient basis for the issuance of a no-knock warrant. The extensive surveillance undertaken by the persons selling drugs made destruction of the drugs more likely if the police were required to knock and announce their presence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, </em>387 Mass. 413, 422-423 (1982). Moreover, the Maine informant had said that the suspects in apartment 10 had a gun, and the police could reasonably fear for their safety and the safety of others. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 147-148 (1980), cert, denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">2. <em>Expert testimony on drug trafficking. </em>Relying .on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass 719, 723 (1991), the defendant claims that expert testimony concerning the operation of drug dealers, including the use of stash pads, the keeping of a low profile in dress and habit, and the use of a dollar bill to show samples to customers, and the opinion that such evidence showed an intent to distribute were inadmissible as drug profile or other irrelevant or overly prejudicial testimony. <em>Day, supra, </em>at 723, held that a \u201cchild battering profile\u201d did not meet the relevancy test, \u201cbecause the mere fact that a defendant fits the profile does not tend to prove that a particular defendant physically abused the victim.\u201d The admissibility of drug profile testimony is also suspect. See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Cuartas, 111 </em>F.2d 552, 555 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beltran-Rios, </em>878 F.2d 1208, 1210-1211 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At least some of the expert evidence, however, was admissible in the judge\u2019s discretion as an aid to the jury in understanding matters beyond their common experience. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 202 (1991), a case decided subsequent to <em>Day, </em>the court pointed out, \u201cThe use of narcotics investigators as experts in drug cases has an impressive history.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony as to the use by drug dealers of samples wrapped in dollar bills was substantially similar to the evidence approved of by <em>Johnson, </em>at 202, when it cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. <em>777, </em>788 (1978), as allowing a \u201cpolice officer to testify as to use of small manila envelopes for bagging heroin.\u201d In addition, the opinion given in the case at bar that chunk cocaine wrapped in a dollar bill in the defendant\u2019s pocket was more consistent with a dealer\u2019s sample than with personal use does not differ materially from the opinion, held admissible in <em>Johnson, </em>that the amount of cocaine possessed by the defendant in that case was not consistent with personal use but was consistent with an intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We need not consider whether the more troublesome expert testimony concerning the keeping of a low profile by certain drug dealers and the expert testimony as to stash pads<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unrelated to this defendant fall within the bar of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day. </em>In this case the expert testimony concerning stash pads and a typical drug courier\u2019s low profile was admissible as evidence to rebut the defendant\u2019s trial strategy, which immediately became apparent in the defendant\u2019s opening. Counsel urged the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s simple life-style in light of the value of the cocaine found, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201chundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d He depicted the defendant as an \u201cimmigrant from Colombia, a man who worked two jobs, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d a man who in 1988 drove a 1981 car. Counsel stressed that the cocaine was hidden in an inaccessible area and suggested that another person, a Mr. Serna, had access to the defendant\u2019s apartment. This strategy continued throughout the trial. Through cross-examination and direct evidence the defendant elicited testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s simple living standard and his two jobs. He also brought out that Augusto Serna had rented apartment 10 at 151 Wood Street, that a search warrant had also been issued for that apartment, that Augusto Serna was a cosigner for apartment 4, and that Carlos Serna had been arrested for drugs. He also presented evidence that the cocaine would likely belong to a \u201chigh or middle high level dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Thus, it was the defendant\u2019s aim to connect the two apartments to show that others had access to apartment 4, and to portray the defendant\u2019s low-key life-style as inconsistent with participation in a lucrative narcotics distribution ring. Even if the expert testimony as to stash pads and keeping a low profile were otherwise objectionable, the evidence was admissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the facts. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beltran-Rios, </em>878 F.2d at 1211-1213 (evidence of characteristics of typical drug courier admissible where defendant \u201copened the door\u201d by introducing potentially misleading testimony emphasizing the defendant\u2019s poverty). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>787 F.2d 28, 34 (2d Cir. 1986) (evidence of price of heroin, dress of drug dealers, and transactions in Pakistan admissible to rebut defendant\u2019s argument that he was a poor man rather than a major drug dealer).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Moreover, none of the expert testimony now questioned was objected to at trial. Accordingly, the standard of review is whether the admission of the evidence creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). In view of the Commonwealth\u2019s powerful case against the defendant apart from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>expert testimony now challenged, there is here no such risk. Cocaine of a value of $250,000 was hidden in a broiler where the jury could infer it would have been burned unless known to the defendant. Food stains on top of the stove and a greasy pan in the oven indicated that the oven was in use. The apartment was controlled by the defendant, and no one else was shown to have keys. When the defendant came to the apartment with his keys in his hand and saw the officers, he turned around and left. He had cocaine in his shirt pocket, wrapped in a dollar bill, which looked similar to the cocaine found in the oven. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 495-497 (1991). Both the quantity of the cocaine found in the apartment, over 670 grams, and its quality, eighty-nine percent pure, indicate that it was intended for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">3. <em>References to Colombian drug culture and other alleged prosecutorial errors. </em>In the course of qualifying Officer Taylor as an expert in drug trafficking in eastern Massachusetts, the prosecutor and Taylor, in the presence of the jury, made the references to Colombian drug trafficking and Colombian cocaine networks set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant objected, and, at a bench conference, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>qualified the expert but instructed the prosecutor not to refer again to Colombia. The prosecutor complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">There is no question that the jury knew that the defendant was Colombian. The defendant\u2019s opening statement contained this information, and defense counsel also, on occasion, asked questions using the term \u201cColombian.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not refer \u201cto race or national origin principally to inflame jurors or appeal to their racial or ethnic prejudices or fears,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 693 (1983), but rather, as a bench conference indicates, considered the methods of Colombian narcotics traffickers to be unique. There was no attempt to suggest that the defendant was guilty because he was Colombian. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>903 F.2d 16, 20 (D.C. Cir. 1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallego, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 718 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor in his closing distorted an expert\u2019s testimony by stating that the Commonwealth had not tested the small chunk of cocaine found in the defendant\u2019s shirt pocket because it was too small to be tested. The defendant objected, and the judge immediately stated that that was not the testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During his final charge, the judge raised the issue again and reminded the jury that \u201cthere was no evidence in the case that the quantity of cocaine in that dollar bill was too small to be qualitatively tested . . . . \u201d Any prejudice to the defendant resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s argument was cured by the judge\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant contends that his trial counsel\u2019s decision to concede possession of the cocaine found in the defendant\u2019s shirt pocket denuded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>him of a defense<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. The tactical decision to admit to possession of the cocaine found in the shirt pocket was not, as the defendant contends, \u201ctantamount to admitting possession of the larger quantity\u201d nor was the decision \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273 (1991). By conceding possession of the smaller quantity, which he argued was for personal use, defense counsel avoided a credibility contest between the defendant and the arresting officers and was able to take advantage of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to request a qualitative analysis of the substance found in the defendant\u2019s pocket, thereby undermining the argument that the substance in his pocket was part of the cocaine found in the apartment. In view of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, it was probably the most rational option available to the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 386 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The conviction for possession was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent and is therefore not before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass, at 374-376, incorporated the principles of <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), and <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), which require an affidavit based on information from an unknown informant to satisfy, what have come to be known as \u201cthe basis of knowledge test\u201d and the \u201cveracity test\u201d (that the informant was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable\u201d).
