We agree with Arthur that the judge committed prejudicial error in refusing to admit evidence of Lisa\u2019s reputation for lying and exaggerating from two of Lisa\u2019s female eighth grade classmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The judge stated that the voir dire of the first witness<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had not provided a sufficient foundation for reputation testimony because defense counsel had not complied with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 933 (1981); had not established what community the witness was talking about; and had only produced specific instances of lying rather than general reputation evidence. These conclusions were incorrect. The judge properly cited <em>Gomes, </em>which summarizes the applicable principles,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but failed to recognize relevant distinctions between its facts and those here. There the witness\u2019s testimony (to impeach the victim in a sexual assault case) was based on \u201cfive other people\u201d who \u201cknew\u201d the victim, but no foundation was laid as to the identity of those people or the context in which they knew the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 934. Accordingly, the defendant there failed to establish the necessary community or territory of repute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In contrast, defense counsel here established, through the impeaching witness\u2019s voir dire: a discrete, identifiable community familiar with Lisa (her middle school eighth grade class of 150 students); a large group of persons in that community who had expressed views about Lisa\u2019s reputation for veracity (fifty or sixty classmates); and a witness who was a member of that community, had known Lisa for at least six years, and was in a position to know of that reputation. In <em>Gomes, </em>we recognized that such a school group might be an acceptable community from which reputation may be drawn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>See also G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21 A. The witness\u2019s voir dire testimony about Lisa\u2019s reputation among her schoolmates emanated \u201cfrom an identifiable group which has had sufficient contact with the child to justify a statement about reputation,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Healey, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 39 (1989), and which provided sources for the witness\u2019s information that were \u201csufficiently numerous and general that they are viewed as trustworthy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPierre, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 871 (1980). The judge should not have excluded the reputation evidence in these circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The judge also erred in ruling that the reputation witness based her testimony on specific instances of lying. It is unquestioned that evidence of specific events and personal opinions are not admissible to prove reputation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Food Corp., </em>374 Mass. 765, 769 (1978), but those truisms are not applicable here. Defense counsel did not attempt to introduce evidence of specific instances of Lisa\u2019s lying. Only during the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination, and in response to explicit questions seeking examples of such lying, did the reputation witness mention any particular events. It was entirely proper for the cross-examiner to test the witness\u2019s knowledge of Lisa\u2019s reputation by asking for specifics regarding the events and opinions that formed the basis for that reputation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>119 Mass. 342, 345-346 (1876); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>122 Mass. 501, 504-505 (1877); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry., </em>254 Mass. 441, 443 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The judge, however, appeared to confuse this legitimate effort to discredit the impeaching witness with the foundational requirements for reputation testimony, which were sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>isfied here. See <em>ibid, </em>and 3, 3A, 4, 5 and 7 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 691-692, 988, 1111, ' 1608-1619, 1985</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">(Chadbourn Rev. 1970, 1972, 1974, 1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The impeaching witness\u2019s direct voir dire examination established that among \u201cpractically all the kids that know her,\u201d at least fifty to sixty (and possibly as many as one hundred and fifty) individuals in her school class, Lisa had a reputation for lying and exaggeration. That was \u201cimpeaching evidence ... of general reputation and not the private opinions of a few persons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPierre, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 871. It would undermine the common law and statutory principles of admissibility to permit qualifying general reputation testimony to be excluded by cross-examination eliciting specifics as to the source or basis of the evidence. The thrust of such cross-examination goes to the weight of the testimony and is a matter for the \"jury under appropriate instructions. See <em>F.W. Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Dellapenna, </em>217 Mass. 503, 507 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Given the crucial role of Lisa\u2019s testimony to the prosecution, as the victim of and only eyewitness to the crimes charged, and the materiality of the impeaching reputation evidence, the exclusionary ruling was highly prejudicial, and we order a new trial on that' ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We comment briefly on other issues raised by the appeal that may arise at any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">1. <em>Evidence of prior bad acts. </em>We assume that Arthur\u2019s complaints about the judge\u2019s admission of testimony from Lisa, her mother, and a police detective, regarding prior interactions between Arthur and Lisa of a sexual nature that were not the subject of any indictment, will be appropriately addressed in pretrial proceedings. Evidence of such prior sexual contacts may be admissible to show inclination to commit the acts charged in the indictments if sufficiently similar and not too remote in time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Mass. 464, 469-470 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calcagno, ante </em>25, 26-27 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">2. <em>Access to Department of Social Services (DSS) records. </em>As to the issue of Arthur\u2019s right to discovery of the G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 51A and 5IB, records regarding the underlying notification and investigation of the alleged abuse,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 884 (1991), indicates that Arthur\u2019s counsel may, under an appropriate protective order, be permitted to examine the DSS records to search for evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias, prejudice, motive to lie, or prior inconsistent statements; the admissibility of any such evidence is to be passed on by the trial judge at an in camera hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">3. <em>Jury instructions on fresh complaint. </em>Arthur\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s charge failed to inform the jury that they should not consider the prosecution\u2019s fresh complaint evidence unless they themselves found that it was in fact sufficiently fresh does not strike us as persuasive. The instructions, read as a whole, did convey to the jurors that they must make that preliminary determination, as the authorities require. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 626-627 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Densten, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 981, 982 (1987). Any fresh complaint instructions on retrial will presumably be clear and explicit as to this \u201culti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>mate responsibility\u201d of the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 510-511 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Alk\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-16\">We use a pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defense counsel did not conduct a voir dire of the second witness because of the similarity of her proposed testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u201cA party\u2019s reputation is based on information from sources in the community who have come in contact with the person in question and who have the means of knowing what that person\u2019s general character is. \u2018It is what is said of the person under inquiry in the common speech of his neighbors and members of his community or territory of repute, from which his reputation for truth or falsehood arises, and not what the impeaching witness may have heard others say who numerically may be few and insignificant.\u2019 <em>F.W. Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Dellapenna, </em>217 Mass. 503, 506 (1914). A judge has discretion to exclude evidence of reputation if he determines that it is based on the opinions of too limited a group. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPierre, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 871 (1980). \u2018It is only where the sources are sufficiently numerous and general that they are viewed as trustworthy.\u2019 <em>Ibid.\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>11 Mass.
