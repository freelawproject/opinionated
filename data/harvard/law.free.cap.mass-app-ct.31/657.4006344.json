L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. The reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents found that it did not and denied his widow benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. The matter was reported to panel of this court pursuant to the Standing Order Implementing the Interim Rule for Processing Appeals to a Single Justice in Workers\u2019 Compensation Cases (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">We summarize the facts, which are not in dispute. Gerald R. LaRocque was employed as a custodian at the Berkshire Community College. On January 26, 1984, the college terminated his employment based on an unrelated matter. On February 6, 1984, he testified at a grievance hearing that he had filed a false report concerning the cause of a hand injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>for which he had collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits in 1983. As a result, on February 10, 1984, the dean of the college telephoned him at his home to request that LaRocque and his union steward meet with him to discuss LaRocque\u2019s 1983 claim for workers\u2019 compensation. Immediately following this conversation, LaRocque telephoned his brother-in-law, a college employee, to report his conversation with the dean. After speaking with him, LaRocque said to his wife, \u201cWe got a problem.\u201d He then collapsed and died. His death was a result of a myocardial infarction. The only medical evidence presented to the hearing officer was the testimony of LaRocque\u2019s physician, who had treated him for heart disease since April 6, 1981. The physician testified that LaRocque\u2019s angina was induced by emotional stress and that there was \u201ca very probable relationship between the telephone calls and the cause of death\u201d and that the call from the dean of the college was \u201cthe principal call . . . that was probably related to the acute heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The single member of the Industrial Accident Board found that LaRocque\u2019s death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment and dismissed the claim for benefits. On appeal, the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board affirmed the denial of benefits on the ground that his death did not occur in the course of his employment. Accordingly, the reviewing board found it unnecessary to determine whether his death \u201carose out of\u201d his employment. We affirm the reviewing board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The determination whether an injury \u201carose out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment is a question of fact to be decided by the single member. <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359 (1980). The decision of the reviewing board is not to be reversed unless it is based upon an error of law, made upon unlawful procedure, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 395 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In order for an injury to be compensable, the injury must not only \u201carise out of\u2019 but also \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. \u201cArising out of\u2019 refers to the causal origin, see <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>(1982), while \u201cin the course of\u2019 refers mainly to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury in relation to the employment, see <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass, at 359-361; see also Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 261 (2d ed. 1981); 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 6.10 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In determining whether LaRocque\u2019s death occurred in the course of his employment, we first consider the time and place of his death in relation to his employment. It is undisputed that LaRocque\u2019s death occurred at home at least two weeks after his discharge. Generally, termination of employment extinguishes an employer\u2019s liability for an injury to an employee which occurs after his discharge. <em>Harvey\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 300 (1936); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 549 (1980). However, the Supreme Judicial Court, in the only post-termination case in this jurisdiction, extended coverage under the act to an employee who, subsequent to discharge, was injured while leaving his employer\u2019s premises and winding up his affairs. <em>Zygmuntowicz </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>240 Mass. 421, 423-424 (1922). Other jurisdictions have extended workers\u2019 compensation benefits to employees who sustain injuries while, leaving or returning to their employers\u2019 premises to wind up their affairs within a reasonable time after termination. <em>W.B. Davis &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Ruple, </em>222 Ala. 52 (1930). <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., </em>76 Ariz. 105 (1953). <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>111 Cal. App. 2d 766 (1952). <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Hizer, </em>73 Cal. App. 3d 499 (1977). <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Gregg, Gibson &amp; Gregg, Inc., </em>260 So. 2d 193 (Fla. 1972). <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. of Atlanta, </em>160 Ga. App. 676 (1981). <em>Guntrop-Warren Printing Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., </em>74 Ill. 2d 252 (1979). <em>Leonhardt Enterprises </em>v. <em>Houseman, </em>562 P.2d 515 (Okla. 1977). <em>INA of Texas </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>686 S.W.2d 614 (Tex. 1985). See also Annotation, Workmen\u2019s compensation: injury after discharge, 56 A.L.R. 859 (1928) and 69 A.L.R. 1121 (1930). The key to coverage in all these cases is that the post-termination activity is closely related to the employment, both in time and place. In contrast, LaRocque\u2019s fatal heart attack here lacked proxim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ity, both in time and place, to his employment because it occurred two weeks after his termination and at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Also to be examined in determining whether the employee\u2019s heart attack occurred in the \u201ccourse of his employment\u201d are the circumstances of its occurrence. Even though an injury occurs off the employer\u2019s premises or outside normal working hours, it may be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, if the employee at the time of the injury was engaged in the furtherance of his employer\u2019s business or in pursuit of some benefit to his employer. <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 710 (1947). <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>364 Mass. 762, 765 (1974). See <em>Thore </em>v. <em>Chesterfield County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>10 Va. App. 327, 334 (1990) (A deputy sheriff who had resigned her position was allowed to recover compensation for injury received in a fall at the court house where she appeared to testify in a criminal case as the arresting officer). In this case, at the time of his heart attack, LaRocque was at home and riot performing any work for the college or engaging in any activity for the benefit of the college. See <em>Hepp </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., </em>67 Pa. Commw. 330 (1982) (employee\u2019s psychiatric illness precipitated by receipt of notice of termination at home by a telephone call from his employer deemed not to have arisen out of the furtherance and pursuit of the business affairs of the employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We conclude that the board properly determined that the myocardial infarction sustained by the employee, resulting in his death, did not occur in the course of his employment. The report of the single justice is discharged. The decision of the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
