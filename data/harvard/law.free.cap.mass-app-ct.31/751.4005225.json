Contrary to the general rule, see <em>Trustees of Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admn. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 565 (1976), we consider this issue, although not raised below, because of the ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>risdictional gloss which the plaintiff has given his argument and also because we find no reported decision which addresses the common practice in the Superior Court of permitting, with the agreement of the parties, all impanelled jurors to decide civil cases. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">By authority of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fourteen jurors were impanelled at the start of the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim. One juror was excused when the parties rested. The remaining thirteen jurors, after receiving the judge\u2019s instructions, which included a reference to a jury verdict by a count of \u201cll-to-2, 12-to-l, 13-to-all,\u201d deliberated and returned a special verdict by which they found that the defendant had not been negligent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record discloses no objection or discussion with respect to this instruction or to the number of deliberating and deciding jurors before the jury retired to deliberate. The plaintiff, without intimating that a timely objection was raised, suggests in his brief that jury composition was the subject of an off-the-record conference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the circumstances, we treat the absence of objection as tantamount to agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Amado </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>349 Mass. 716, 722 (1965); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 411-412 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The plaintiff claims that the mandatory provisions of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B, raise a jurisdictional barrier to the receipt of a verdict from a jury of more than twelve persons in a civil action. That argument misperceives the purpose and function of \u00a7 26B, which is \u201cdesigned to accommodate the public\u2019s interest in avoiding a second \u2018long and expensive trial\u2019 while protecting the . . . right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 768 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bellino, </em>320 Mass. 635, 642 (1947). The statute establishes a reasonable and economical mechanism for dealing with the death or incapacity of an impanelled juror. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bellino, supra </em>at 642. While the anomalous references to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7 26B might be read as buttressing the court\u2019s established authority to receive the verdict of a twelve-member jury, they cannot reasonably be construed as speaking to the validity of a verdict of a lesser or greater number in a civil trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That a jury of twelve is not a jurisdictional requirement in civil trials is evident in the statutory leeway given to proceeding with as few as ten jurors in the absence of agreement and with any lesser number if the parties agree. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34B.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Trial by a jury of twelve is not constitutionally mandated. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 86-103 (1970). <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>360 Mass. 877, 879 (1971). Article 15 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, while guaranteeing trial by jury in certain civil cases, does not prescribe the number of jurors. \u201c \u2018[T]he fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a <em>historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system </em>and wholly without significance . . . \u201d <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 879, quoting from and supplying emphasis to <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">As part of its inherent authority, the Superior Court \u201chas wide power to do justice and to adopt procedure to that end.\u201d <em>Fanciullo </em>v. <em>B.G. &amp; S. Theatre Corp., </em>297 Mass. 44, 51 (1937). See <em>Boyajian </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>312 Mass. 264, 266 (1942). \u201cShort of impairment of the vital elements of the jury . . ., there is no constitutional obstacle to its regulation and modification in the light of changed conditions or perceptions, or to the abandonment of older modes, or to the introduction of new . ones.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>379 Mass. <em>777, </em>779-780 (1980). \u201c[Wjhat matters is whether [an adopted] procedure strikes at the fundamentals of the jury . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. Concern for the avoidance of mistrials in protracted cases frequently results in more than twelve jurors participating in civil trials in the Superior Court. Given the five-sixths rule of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a jury of thirteen can participate i\u00f1 the decisional process without altering significantly the mathematics or substance of any party\u2019s statutory burden of persuasion. It is not unreasonable, therefore, for a judge, with the agreement of the parties, to permit all thirteen jurors who have heard a civil case to decide it. No jury fundamentals are undermined by such practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Even were we to conclude that the agreement of the parties in a civil case was insufficient to relieve the court of the \u00a7 26B directive to reduce the jury to twelve members, we would be disinclined to apply a per se rule of reversal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>harmless error standard of Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 829 (1974), is sufficient to test the validity of the verdict rendered, and nothing before us indicates that the decision by thirteen jurors in this case was inconsistent with substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We briefly touch on the plaintiff\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The collision that gave rise to the plaintiff\u2019s claim occurred in Rhode Island in 1984, and, with the acquiescence of the parties, the substantive law of that State was applied throughout the trial. The plaintiff claims that the judge erred by refusing his request that the jury be instructed on the doctrine of last clear chance. Assuming, for the purposes of this decision, the continued vitality of that doctrine after the enactment of Rhode Island\u2019s comparative negligence statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we hold the refusal to instruct was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The plaintiff was injured when his parked truck was struck by the defendant\u2019s train at a railroad crossing. Basic among the issues addressed and argued at trial was whether the defendant\u2019s employees negligently failed to stop the train once they knew, or should have known, that the plaintiff\u2019s truck was \u201cfouling\u201d the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The last clear chance doctrine as enunciated in the case law of Rhode Island generally is applicable to a defendant who fails to exercise due care to prevent an avoidable injury to a plaintiff at a time when the defendant is aware or charged with awareness of the plaintiff\u2019s having negligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>placed himself in a position of peril which he does not comprehend or from which he is unable to extricate himself. <em>New England Pretzel Co. </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>75 R.I. 387, 391 (1949). The fundamental principle of that doctrine is that the negligence of the defendant is not excused by the negligence of the plaintiff if the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the injury. <em>Malfetano </em>v. <em>United Elec. Ry., </em>58 R.I. 129, 141 (1937). <em>Major </em>v. <em>Grieg, </em>102 R.I. 379, 388 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Where, as here, the issue whether the defendant negligently failed to avoid injuring the plaintiff was fully tried, and a jury specifically found the defendant not negligent, the doctrine of last clear chance is irrelevant. The linchpin of the doctrine is proof of negligence on the part of the defendant. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>84 R.I. 240, 244-245 (1956). The jury verdict renders harmless any failure to instruct on last clear chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We decline to review other claimed errors in the judge\u2019s instructions to which objections were not taken. Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>James Hanrahan &amp; Sons, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 712 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-6\">General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 26B, as amended through St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 9A, states in pertinent part: \u201cIn a civil or criminal case, including a capital case, to be tried with a jury in the Superior Court, which trial, in the opinion of the court, is likely to be protracted, the court may order impanelled a jury of not more than sixteen members and the court shall have jurisdiction to try the case with such jury subject to the following provisions of this section. If at the time of the final submission of the case by the court to the jury more than twelve members of the jury who have heard the whole case are alive and not incapacitated or disqualified, the court shall direct the clerk to place the names of all of the remaining jurors, except the foreman, in a box and draw the names of a sufficient number to reduce the jury to twelve members. . . .

Doc. No. 144) (1944) entitled \u201cEmergency Jurors and Waiver of Full Jury in Criminal Cases.\u201d The report expressed a need to \u201cgive the Superior Court jurisdiction\u201d to continue a trial in the event of the death or other incapacity of a juror. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The proposed legislation and the first committee bills contained references to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in sections dealing with <em>criminal trials. </em>They also contained a separate section dealing with impanellment of more than twelve jurors in civil trials which made no reference to \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.
