This led to the defendant\u2019s indictment and subsequent conviction in a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court for trafficking in marihuana. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E. Alleging that the affidavit supporting the search warrant contained misrepresentations, the defendant filed a pretrial motion for an evidentiary hearing to challenge the affidavit\u2019s veracity. The motion was denied on May 3, 1989, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>after a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search, on the ground that the warrant failed to establish probable cause, was also denied after a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant challenges the denial of his pretrial motions and further claims, for the first time on appeal, that insufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish his possession of the marihuana seized in the search of the automobile. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">1. <em>The pretrial motions. </em>The affidavit supporting the search warrant was prepared by Boston police Detectives John Rogers and William Gavin. It stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On May 5, 1988, the police responded to a reported breaking and entering at 48 Brighton Avenue. There they found a white substance that appeared to be cocaine in various plastic bags, four sets of scales, packages of disposable syringes, three glass vials containing white powder, and identification in the name of Marshall H. Dion, \u201coccupant of the apartment.\u201d On that date, an arrest warrant was issued against the defendant for trafficking in cocaine and possession of marihuana with intent to distribute. Subsequent investigation disclosed that the defendant had an \u201cextensive criminal record of narcotic drug violations,\u201d including seizures of large quantities of drugs in Texas in 1974 and from a motor vehicle in Arizona in 1982, as well as possession of cocaine and an attempt to bribe a police officer in California in 1986. The information concerning drug violations was obtained from the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. On May 24, 1988, the police were again called to the defendant\u2019s apartment concerning a reported break-in. When they arrived, they saw the defendant fleeing the building and running into an alley. They apprehended and arrested him pursuant to the May 5 warrant. While the defendant was being booked, police officers saw him attempting to \u201csecrete on his body\u201d an automobile key. A yellow tag attached to the key described a 1986 white four-door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Chrysler Fifth Avenue sedan. Police officers returned to the vicinity of the arrest and saw a white four-door Chrysler Fifth Avenue with Arizona license plates parked and locked on Fordham Road approximately eighty feet from the intersection of Brighton Avenue. Based on this information, the police obtained a warrant to search the automobile for drugs, records, and money obtained from the sale of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The defendant claims that the affidavit contains misrepresentations which entitled him to an evidentiary hearing concerning the affidavit\u2019s veracity. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution entitles a defendant to an evidentiary hearing if he \u201cmakes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause . . . .\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-156 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-two Dollars, </em>383 Mass. 764, 767 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Honneus, </em>390 Mass. 136, 142-143 (1983). \u201cTo mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory .... Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained.\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 171. If a defendant merely offers his own version of the facts, \u201c[tjh'is does not rise to the level of a substantial preliminary showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>of intentional falsity or reckless disregard for the truth in the affidavit accompanying the warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>402 Mass. 209, 215-216 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Two of the defendant\u2019s claims \u2014 that he did not \u201csecrete\u201d the key to the Chrysler automobile and that he could not have been seen to \u201crun\u201d when he fled his apartment building because an unspecified injury prevented him from running \u2014 do not require discussion as they merely pit his version of the facts against that of the affiants.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Two of the defendant\u2019s allegations, however, merit attention. First, he states that at the time the affiants alleged that a white substance, believed to be cocaine, had been found in the defendant\u2019s apartment, they knew that it had been tested and found negative for cocaine, and they also knew that the criminal charges against the defendant based on its seizure were going to be dismissed. An affidavit signed by Mr. Conrad J. Bletzer, Jr., the defendant\u2019s attorney, supported this allegation. The affidavit states that at approximately 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon of May 24, 1988 (the date the search warrant was issued), affiant John Rogers told Bletzer \u201cthat the powder seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment had been analyzed and came back as [containing] \u2018no narcotic substance.\u2019 \u201d An affidavit filed by another attorney, Mr. Dennis Ditelberg, made essentially the same assertions but stated that he had received the information from either John Rogers or Federal Drug Enforcement Agency members. Based on these affidavits, the motion judge determined that the affiants\u2019 statement concerning the white substance found in the defendant\u2019s apartment appeared to be misleading. He concluded, however, that the drug paraphernalia found there \u201cwould weigh heavily\u201d in a magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination and that the defendant had not made the showing necessary to require a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The defendant further alleged that, at the time of the affiants\u2019 allegations concerning the defendant\u2019s prior record, they knew \u201cthat the defendant did not have an extensive criminal record of narcotic drug violations,\u201d and they knew that none of the cases mentioned in the affidavit had resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>in a conviction. This claim of misrepresentation came before the motion judge unaccompanied by further substantiation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and he properly determined that the defendant had not made a substantial preliminary showing of reckless or intentional misrepresentation concerning this allegation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, however, Rogers testified that at the time he prepared the affidavit supporting the search warrant, he did not know of any convictions obtained as a result of the narcotics violations alleged in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The general rule is that we \u201cmay not use subsequent evidence in deciding the correctness of an earlier ruling.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 132 (1981), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Singer, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 708, 709 n.l (1991). However, because the search warrant application affidavit apparently provided misleading information concerning the white substance found in the defendant\u2019s apartment, we assume, without deciding, that \u201cthis is a \u2018case where the record indicates circumstances justifying a departure from the rule,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, supra </em>at 132, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 476, 482 (1976), and we take into account, for purposes of discussion, Rogers\u2019 trial testimony. We further assume, without deciding, that a substantial showing has thus been made that the allegations concerning the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record constituted a reckless misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The question then becomes whether the two pieces of allegedly misleading and false information, or either one of them, was necessary to the finding of probable cause. <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 155-156. In order to establish probable cause, a search warrant affidavit \u201cmust contain enough information for the issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they reasonably may be expected to be found in the place to be searched .... A nexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation and may be found in \u2018the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide [contraband].\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 661 (1990). After excising the alleged misrepresentation concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal record and supplying the omitted information concerning the laboratory findings on the white substance found in the defendant\u2019s apartment, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parcels of Land, </em>903 F. 2d 36, 47 (1st Cir. 1990), we conclude that sufficient facts remain to support a finding of probable cause that the automobile contained contraband connected to the defendant\u2019s drug-related criminal activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in illicit narcotics activity included the drug paraphernalia found in his apartment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 73 (1987) (informant\u2019s \u201cobservation of . . . white powder, presumably to be used for cutting cocaine\u201d considered in probable cause determination); his attempt to flee from the police, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ceria, </em>13 Mass. App. 230, 234 (1982), and cases cited (defendant\u2019s flight \u201cwould naturally create a strong suspicion that he had committed a crime or was about to do so\u201d); and his attempt to secrete the car key, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 613, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>616 n.2 (1980), and cases cited (furtive gesture relevant in probable cause determination); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wooden, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 417, 422 (1982) (\u201cact of concealment,\u201d in conjunction with other circumstances, relevant in probable cause determination). The association of the defendant and the automobile searched was established by the fact that he had on his person an automobile key with a descriptive tag attached and that an automobile fitting that description was found parked and locked near his home. Finally, the connection between the automobile and the contraband was established by the defendant\u2019s suspicious behavior in attempting to hide the automobile key while he was being booked on a drug charge. See <em>Jetmore </em>v. <em>State, </em>275 So. 2d 61, 64-65 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1973) (attempt to conceal automobile trunk key during roadside stop for suspicion of burglary may be considered in determination of probable cause to search automobile); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>209 Neb. 371, 375 (1981) (attempt to conceal automobile trunk key during roadside stop for traffic violation a factor in finding probable cause to search trunk). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fenderson, </em>410 Mass. 82, 88 (1991) (discovery of cocaine and safety deposit box keys in defendant\u2019s apartment, viewed in light of defendant\u2019s trafficking activities and fact that drug traffickers often use safety deposit boxes to hide money, established probable cause to search safety deposit boxes). Additionally, as the motion judge noted, the break-ins at the defendant\u2019s apartment could \u201clead to the inference that the defendant was storing drugs in the automobile as a safer depository.\u201d While none of the facts recited alone sufficed to establish probable cause to search the automobile, taken together they supported a rational inference that the automobile probably contained contraband. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 751 (1971) (\u201cThe sufficiency of the affidavit is to be decided on the basis of a consideration of all of its allegations as a whole, and not by first dissecting it and then subjecting each resulting fragment to a hypertechnical test of its sufficiency standing alone\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 412 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>2. <em>Possession of the marihuana. </em>The defendant contends that insufficient evidence was presented at trial to show that he had possession of the marihuana found in the automobile searched, an element of an offense under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E. He failed to move for a required finding of not guilty below, see Mass.R.Crim.P.25(a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), and on appeal cites no authority to support his allegations, as required by Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). We nevertheless address his claim because a \u201cfinding [ ] based on legally insufficient evidence [is] inherently serious enough to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986), and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 204 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u201c \u2018Possession implies \u201ccontrol and power,\u201d exclusive or joint . . ., or, in the case of \u201cconstructive possession,\u201d knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u2019 . . . \u2018Proof of possession of a controlled substance may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 617-618 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>410 Mass. 1005 (1991). Compelling evidence of the defendant\u2019s control over the automobile containing the marihuana was introduced at trial. The morning of the automobile search, the defendant was seen at a storage bin he had rented in Lynnfield, standing beside a white four-door Chrysler with Arizona license plates. That day, while he was being booked, he had on his person an automobile key with a tag inscribed \u201c1986 Chrysler, four door, white in color.\u201d On the same day the police discovered, parked beside the defendant\u2019s apartment building, a white, four-door Chrysler with Arizona license plates fitting the description on the tag. On the front seat lay a receipt to a storage area in Lynn. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>357 Mass. 741, 751-753 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 704 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 613 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fiore, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 623-624, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 938 (1980) (all demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>strating sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s connection to the place where the contraband was discovered). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>358 Mass. 817, 818 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pursley, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 910 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duffy, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 655, 659-661 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 780-781 (1991) (all involving insufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s connection to the place where the contraband was found).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Convincing evidence was also presented that the defendant knew the marihuana was in the Chrysler. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426-427 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, </em>317 Mass. 270, 273 (1944) (\u201cKnowledge \u2018may be, and generally is, proved by circumstantial evidence; and it may be inferred from a great variety of circumstances\u2019 \u201d). Evidence was presented of the defendant\u2019s illicit drug activity, including the discovery of drug paraphernalia in his apartment and the discovery of eight hundred dollars in cash on the front seat of the Chrysler. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 410 (1989) (possession of large amounts of cash evidence of drug dealing); <em>Mercedes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>405 Mass. 693, 693-694 (1989) (possession of drug paraphernalia and large amounts of cash evidence of drug dealing). His attempt to put the key to the Chrysler automobile in his mouth while he was being booked on a drug charge, taken in the context of the other evidence of his drug dealing, provided a sufficient basis for inferring that he was attempting to secrete the key because he knew the marihuana was in the trunk of the automobile. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>,378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989), a fact finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had been in possession of the marihuana seized from the trunk of the Chrysler automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The orders denying the motions to suppress and for a <em>Franks </em>hearing and for reconsideration of those actions are affirmed.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Assad, </em>393 Mass. 418, 422-423 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>402 Mass. 209, 215 n.4 (1988). The defendant\u2019s challenge relies only on <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra. </em>Therefore, we base our analysis on the Federal constitutional principles established in <em>Franks. </em>Additionally, at the hearing held to determine whether the defendant had made the preliminary showing required to entitle him to a <em>Franks </em>hearing, he stated that he was not alleging that knowingly false representations had been made, but rather that false representations had been made with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit stating that he had never been arrested in Texas or California and that he had never been convicted of any crimes other than in Massachusetts is not supportive of the allegation with respect to the affiants\u2019 knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The record appendix prepared by the defendant contains a copy of an affidavit dated December 6, 1989, signed by Mr. Bletzer.

However, there is no indication in the record that this affidavit was ever filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\">This conclusion necessarily disposes of the defendant\u2019s arguments of error in the denial of the motion to suppress, as well as those related to the denial of the <em>Franks </em>motion and the reconsideration of both.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
