See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16A. He was sentenced to probation for one year with an order with respect to restitution. The defendant timely appealed for a de nova trial in the District Court jury-of-six session, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, where a mandatory pretrial conference, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a), 378 Mass. 862-863 (1979), was scheduled for March 27, 1987. When the defendant failed to appear at the conference, a default warrant for his arrest was issued. He was arrested on the warrant on July 22, 1988, almost sixteen months from the date of the default. Thereafter, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for imposition of the bench trial sentence was allowed. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that his failure to appear at the pretrial conference was not a \u201csolid\u201d default justifying reinstatement of the lower court sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>372 Mass. 818, 821 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 552, 558 (1987) (in order for judge to apply G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24, and impose the lower court sentence, the defendant\u2019s default must be \u201csolid\u201d). Alternatively, the defendant claims that the judge failed to perceive the discretionary nature of the imposition of a default under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">1. A solid default occurs \u201cwhen a defendant fails through his own conduct to appear in court for proceedings which require his presence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McVicker, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 716 (1985). The defendant\u2019s presence for purposes of an appeal to a District Court jury session under G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, is required at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espinoza, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 65, 66-67 (1989). Such an escalated trial is not, however, the only related court proceeding which demands a personal appearance by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The procedural rule with which we are concerned provides: \u201cThe defendant <em>shall </em>be available for attendance at the pretrial conference\u201d (emphasis supplied). Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(1), 378 Mass. 862 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s availability is required pursuant to that rule in order to facilitate (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>agreements amounting to the waiver of a constitutional right; (2) stipulations of material fact; and (3) other agreements which do not involve constitutional waivers. See Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Crim. P. at 196 (Law. Co-op. 1979). Those concerns are \u201cbeneficial to all parties and not just the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McVicker, supra </em>at 717. In this respect, a pretrial conference is distinguishable from a pretrial defense motion, which the defendant may unilaterally withdraw, waive, or forfeit. <em>Id. </em>at 716-717. Given the explicit requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 807, 810 (1980) (rule is explicit in requiring that defendant be available for pretrial conference), the failure to appear for a pretrial conference warrants default under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">2. The defendant next argues that, even if the failure to attend a pretrial conference may constitute a solid default, the judge proceeded under the misapprehension that he was without discretion in applying G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24. As a result, the defendant says, the court deprived him of the \u201cinformed exercise of . . . discretion,\u201d to which he was entitled. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 952, 953 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Attempting to determine whether to default the defendant and impose the lower court sentence, the judge asked, \u201cWhat other possible remedy does the court have if [the defendant] decides not to appear\u201d for the pretrial conference? The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tian invited a response which would help inform the judge of available options. The question was understood in that sense by defense counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear from the record that the judge did not perceive default under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24, to be an automatic or exclusive remedy. Rather, he thoughtfully attempted to gather, and to apply, the information necessary for an \u201cinformed exercise\u201d of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cIn testing whether the exercise of discretion to declare a solid default has been sound, we consider the conduct of the defendant and the inquiry made by the judge into the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s absence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espinoza, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 68. In addition to inquiring about alternative remedies, the judge specifically asked the defendant\u2019s counsel for an explanation of his client\u2019s absence. Counsel responded: \u201cHe had to attend a funeral for ... a friend of the family. That\u2019s the only reason he is offering to the court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To be solid, a default need not be wilful; \u201c[i]t is enough that the defendant has not acted as a responsible person in the face of the demand of lawful authority.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parillo, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 969, 971 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Understandably, the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s explanation at the hearing on the default motion that the defendant decided to attend the funeral of an unidentified \u201cfriend of the family\u201d rather than the pretrial conference, made some sixteen months after the default and after the defendant\u2019s arrest on the warrant, could have been, and was, viewed skeptically by the judge. His implicit conclusion that the defendant\u2019s decision reflected a conscious disregard of the duty to be avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>able is fully supported. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Espinoza, <em>supra </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The statute provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf [an] appellant fails to enter and prosecute his appeal, he shall be defaulted on his recognizance and the jury-of-six session may impose sentence upon him for the crime of which he was convicted, as if he had been convicted in said court. . . .\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">At oral argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel properly conceded that the record supports a conclusion that the defendant was not \u201cavailable,\u201d even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>on his own version of his whereabouts on the day of the pretrial conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>374 Mass. 744, 745, 748 (1978), is misplaced. While the Supreme Judicial Court held in that case that the failure to appear for a pretrial conference was not a solid default, the case was decided before the promulgation of Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McVicker, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Nor is the defendant aided by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espinoza, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 66. In <em>Espinoza, </em>this court suggested that the failure to appear for a pretrial conference leading to a <em>bench </em>trial would not ordinarily be a solid default. Because the defendant in <em>Espinoza </em>had not been tried and convicted prior to missing the scheduled conferences, the default provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24, were inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In reply, the defendant\u2019s counsel proposed that the case be \u201cdeemed fully conferenced and set down for trial,\u201d and that \u201call motions [be] waived.\u201d These suggested sanctions are those outlined conjunctively in Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2)(B), 378 Mass. 864 (1979), for the failure to file a pretrial conference report and to appear at a scheduled pretrial conference. Assuming, without deciding, that these remedies also apply to the failure only to appear at the pretrial conference itself, they are not exclusive. \u201cThe parties shall be subject to such other sanctions as the judge may impose.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
