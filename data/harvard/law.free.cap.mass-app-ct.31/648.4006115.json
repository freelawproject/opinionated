First, he claims that the trial judge should not have allowed two police officers who participated in a search to give detailed testimony concerning the search warrant application and its approval by the magistrate. Second, he claims that the judge should not have admitted certain hearsay statements as adoptive admissions. We conclude that there is no basis for reversal. We do agree with the defendant\u2019s claim, however, that misinformation from the prosecutor about the effect of the sentence, which the prosecutor recommended and the judge imposed, requires that the defendant be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Only two witnesses, Boston police detectives Nicholas Saggese and Joseph Mugnano, testified at trial. Their testimony was as follows. While conducting a surveillance of the New England Air Freight (NEAF) offices in East Boston from inside a boat stored nearby, Detective Saggese saw the defendant engage in three separate drug transactions on two days. Based on information from Detective Saggese about the first of these transactions, Detective Mugnano obtained a warrant to search the NEAF premises and the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">NEAF occupied three rooms, an entrance hall and two offices. The defendant, who knew Detective Saggese, was present when Detectives Saggese and Mugnano, and three other Boston police officers, arrived to conduct the search. The defendant opened the front door to NEAF and let the police in. When he was informed of the search warrant, he said, \u201cGo ahead and search.\u201d The defendant identified one of the two offices as his own but told the officers that he had nothing to do with the second. That office, he said, was used by several other persons whose names he did not know. The police opened the unlocked door to the second office and found Brother Pearson seated at a desk. In the defendant\u2019s presence, an officer asked Pearson what he was doing there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Pointing to the defendant, Pearson said he worked for the defendant. The defendant made no response. Allen Smith, the owner of the building in which NEAF was located, entered the premises during the search. In the defendant\u2019s presence, Smith told Detective Mugnano that he had leased the premises to the defendant under the name of NEAF. Again, the defendant made no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">A considerable amount of drugs (at least $25,000 worth), packaging materials, mixing agents, and other usual paraphernalia of the drug trade were found throughout the premises, but mostly in the office occupied by Pearson. Papers similar to those used in packaging the drugs found in that office were found in the office the defendant claimed was his. A rifle was found in the office occupied by Pearson, but ammunition was found in the office the defendant claimed was his. The NEAF name was found on objects in both offices, and various papers were found throughout the premises which linked the defendant with NEAF. According to the NEAF articles of organization, the defendant was an officer of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">After the search was completed, the police arrested the defendant, took him to the station, read him his Miranda rights, and searched him. Keys to the main NEAF door and to both offices were found in his pockets as well as $1,324 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">1. <em>Evidence regarding search warrant procedure. </em>During her opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned that the police had obtained a warrant to search the N\u00c9AF offices and that they searched the offices pursuant to the warrant. Detective Saggese was permitted to testify, in some detail, that Detective Mugnano had applied for a warrant from the East Boston District Court because he believed that the defendant was selling drugs and that the magistrate \u201cgranted\u201d the warrant. In her closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the magistrate \u201capproved\u201d the warrant, which was \u201cvalid,\u201d after reading the evidence about the surveillance. Defense counsel objected to a few of the questions put to the officers about the search warrant procedure but never explained the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>for his objections. Nor did he object to the references made to the search warrant procedure during the prosecutor\u2019s opening or closing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Some testimony about the search warrant application procedure is generally permissible to explain to a jury why the police were present at the scene of a search and why they did certain things at the scene. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sepulveda, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 868, 869 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 554-555 (1989). Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sapoznik, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 236 (1990), however, the defendant contends that it was error for the judge to allow so wide a range for the two officers\u2019 testimony in this case about the search warrant. In <em>Sapoznik, </em>we stated that the evidence of the details of the warrant procedure was improperly admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thought that, by referring to the magistrate\u2019s finding of \u201cprobable cause\u201d and his \u201capproval\u201d of the warrant, the prosecutor, in effect, \u201cused a magistrate to vouch for the credibility of the police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246-247.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because there were no objections to most of the allegedly improper questions, and because nothing said by defense counsel was sufficient to alert the trial judge to the problem with the testimony referred to on appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> our inquiry is limited to the question whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We think there is no such risk. As no witness mentioned that the magistrate had made a finding of \u201cprobable cause,\u201d the testimony of the officers had little, if any, tendency to bolster the credibility of the officers about the contents of the search warrant application. Moreover, much of the testimony about the warrant was a proper response to cross-examination by defense counsel on two points: first, defense counsel had suggested, through' cross-examination, that an arrest should have been made as soon as the defendant was first seen selling drugs; and, second, he suggested that there was an inconsistency between Detective Saggese\u2019s testimony that he had observed three drug deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>and the search warrant application - which referred only to one. To counter those suggestions, some elaboration of the warrant procedure was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">2. <em>Adoptive admissions by silence. </em>The defendant argues that it was error to admit, over his objection, testimony about two statements made to the police officers while the search was being performed: Pearson\u2019s statement that he worked for the defendant; and Smith\u2019s statement that he leased the office space to the defendant \u00f3n behalf of NEAF. The testimony was hearsay. Under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule, however, when an accused remains silent after hearing a statement tending to incriminate him, both the statement and the defendant\u2019s failure to deny it may be admissible (but with the exercise of caution, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 317 [1944]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 316 [1973]) if he heard, understood, and had sufficient knowledge to reply to the statement, and if it would have been natural for a person, in the circumstances, to respond. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>318 Mass, at 317; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>339 Mass. 521, 532 (1959). No admission by silence may be inferred, however, if the statement is made after the accused has been placed under arrest, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 238 (1847); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 634 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 653, 657 (1978), after the police have read him his Miranda rights,' see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass, at 316, or after he has been so significantly deprived of his freedom that he is, in effect, in police custody, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corridori, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 480 (1981), and cases cited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The defendant does not contend that he was unable to hear, understand, or adequately reply to the statements of Pearson and Smith, or that the statements were not incriminatory. Pearson\u2019s statement that he was the defendant\u2019s employee contradicted the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had nothing to do with the office in which the rifle and most of the drugs and drug-related objects were found. Smith\u2019s statement further established the defendant\u2019s possession and control of the entire suite of offices. In the circumstances, such statements, if false and if made prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest or custody, would have had a natural tendency to provoke a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The difficult question is whether, although the defendant was not formally under arrest at the time the statements were made, he was subjected to so coercive an environment that he was, in effect, in \u201ccustody.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 551 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984). The standard for determining whether there was such a coercive environment is an objective one based on such factors as the place of interrogation, the extent to which the investigation has begun to focus on the suspect, the words and actions of the officers, and the suspect\u2019s reasonable understanding as to whether he is free to leave. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass, at 736-737; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass. 249, 258 (1990). \u201cAlthough the officer may have an intent to make an arrest, either formed prior to, or during the questioning, this is not a factor in determining whether there is present \u2018in-custody\u2019 questioning. It is the officer\u2019s statements and acts, the surrounding circumstances, gouged by a \u2018reasonable man\u2019 test, which are determinative.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The issue, whether at the time the statements were made the defendant was in police custody, was presented to the trial judge before he overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to the admission of the statements. The prosecutor first referred to the statements during his opening, and the defendant objected on the ground that the statements were hearsay. The prosecutor responded that in each instance the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>silence was an adoptive admission. Defense counsel countered that the defendant had no duty to respond to the statements since he was in custody at the time they were made. The judge recognized that the question turned on the defendant\u2019s custody status at the relevant times and deferred a ruling until the officers\u2019 testimony was heard. Although the renewed objections during the officers\u2019 testimony did not make specific reference to the defendant\u2019s custody status at the time the statements were made, by overruling the objections, the judge, at least implicitly, found that the defendant was not in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We accord deference to the trial judge\u2019s finding if supported by the record. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980). The circumstances attending the search here support the judge\u2019s finding. The search was conducted during the daytime at the defendant\u2019s place of business. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 452 (1980). The defendant had known Saggese and had admitted the officers willingly to the business premises. The questions the officers asked were routine. The Pearson statement was made early in the search; the Smith statement was made at a mid-point in the search. Although five police officers were involved, there is no evidence that any threatening language or undue force was used, and no restraints were placed on the defendant. Compare <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692 (1981) (when the police arrived to execute a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s house, the defendant was descending the front steps to leave; the Supreme Court held that the warrant implicitly authorized the action of the police in detaining the defendant during the search).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">It is true that the defendant was the focus of the investigation, that after the initial surveillance the police had probable cause to arrest him, and that they also had authority to search his person. It is unlikely, therefore, that the police were of a mind to allow him to leave. The officers\u2019 subjective intent, however, was not dispositive. The record gives no indication that during the search the officers conveyed to the defendant any intention to arrest him. Although detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Mugnano told the defendant when he entered the premises \u201cthat [he] had a search warrant to execute, and that [he was] going to search his premises,\u201d he said nothing about searching the defendant\u2019s person. Detective Mugnano never showed the defendant the warrant, which included authority to search his person, and the defendant merely \u201cacknowledged\u201d the warrant without looking at it. No search of the defendant\u2019s person took place, in fact, until he was formally placed under arrest and taken to the station. In addition, the defendant had no reason to know that Detective Saggese had observed him selling drugs and had probable cause, therefore, to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Considering all the circumstances, we think the judge could warrantably have found that, at the relevant time, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation would not have considered himself to be in custody. Even if the judge erred in admitting the two statements, however, we think the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Other evidence in the case was overwhelming to the effect that the defendant was in control of the NEAF premises, that he was in possession, even if constructively and not exclusively, of all the drugs on the premises, that he had been engaging in drug transactions from the premises, and that he intended to distribute the drugs found in the course of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">3. <em>Sentencing. </em>When the offenses were committed, trafficking in cocaine of over 100 grams, but less than 200 grams, carried a mandatory minimum State prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to fifteen years. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(6)(2), as appearing in St. 1983, c. 571, \u00a7 3. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor recommended a sentence of twelve to fifteen years, and defense counsel recommended a sentence of five years to five years and a day. In response to a question from the judge about the effect of the sentence recommended by the prosecutor, the prosecutor stated, incorrectly,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the defendant would serve four years. The judge imposed the sentence recommended by the prosecutor. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>unclear whether the misinformation influenced the sentence. In fairness to the defendant, we conclude that the trial judge should have the opportunity to reconsider the sentence on the conviction of trafficking in cocaine. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 238, 245 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The convictions shall stand, but the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> We do not consider the defendant\u2019s firearm conviction as that indictment was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s assent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The case was reversed, however, on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The <em>Sapoznik </em>case was decided after the trial in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em> </em>Some States go further than Massachusetts in restricting the use of adoptive admissions. For example, in Arizona and Pennsylvania, the prosecution is barred from introducing evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence in response to any question from a police officer or to any statement made in the presence of the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Villareal, </em>126 Ariz. 589, 590 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dravecz, </em>424 Pa. 582 (1967). In Iowa, adoptive admissions are inadmissible against a defendant in any criminal trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>201 N.W.2d 921, 927 (Iowa 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> The Commonwealth so conceded in oral argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
