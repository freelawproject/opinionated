L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 11A and 11 Al\u00f3, applies to the defendant animal care and use committees created by the defendant Board of Trustees of the University of Massachusetts (the board) in compliance with the Federal Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2131 et seq. (1988). The plaintiffs, three registered voters, brought a complaint in the Superior Court under \u00a7 11 A, seeking an order that the committees conduct open meetings. On the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>summary judgment, the defendants argued that \u00a7 11A did not apply to meetings of committees within the University\u2019s infrastructure because the Legislature, by G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, as amended by St. 1977, c. 991, had limited the requirement of open meetings to the board itself. The judge determined that, because the board was not one of the entities expressly excluded by the Legislature from the definition of a \u201c[gjovernmental body\u201d set out in \u00a7 11 A, the meetings of the board and the committees created by it must be open. On the defendants\u2019 appeal, we conclude that, even if these particular committees are governmental bodies, they do not conduct \u201c[mjeetings\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in \u00a7 11 A, and, therefore, they need not convene in public. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">1. <em>The animal care and use committees. </em>Because the University and its medical school use live animals for research, tests, and experiments and receive Federal funds for such research, they are research facilities which must comply with the Federal Animal Welfare Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(e). The purpose of the Act is to insure that \u201canimals intended for use in research facilities . . . are provided humane care and treatment.\u201d \u00a7 2131(1). Research facilities are required to register with the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary), \u00a7 2136, who is mandated to promulgate standards for the handling, care, and treatment of animals. \u00a7 2143(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Further, although these standards must include requirements \u201cfor animal care, treatment, and practices in experimental procedures to ensure that animal pain and distress are minimized,\u201d \u00a7 2143(a)(3)(A), the Secretary has no authority \u201cto promulgate rules, regulations, or orders with regard to the design, outlines, or guidelines of actual research or experimentation by a research facility as determined by such research facility.\u201d \u00a7 2143(a)(6)(A)(i). The Act balances society\u2019s commitment to the humane treatment of animals with its need for research. See <em>International Primate Protection League </em>v. <em>Institute for Behavioral Research, Inc., </em>799 F.2d 934, 939 (4th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Compliance with the Federal standards is assured by the statutory mandate that \u201ceach research facility establish at least one Committee,\u201d with no less than three members, all of whom are appointed by the facility\u2019s chief executive officer. However, one member must be a veterinarian and one must not be affiliated with the facility in any way. \u00a7 2143(b)(1). It is the function of the committee to inspect, at least semiannually, all animal study areas and research facilities and to review all practices involving pain to animals and the condition of such animals. \u00a7 2143(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">These inspections are followed by inspection certification reports which must include information concerning \u201cany violation\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s standards, \u201cany deviations of research practices from originally approved proposals that adversely affect animal welfare,\u201d and \u201cany minority views of the Committee.\u201d \u00a7 2143(b)(4)(A)(ii) and (iii). The reports are then filed at the facility, where they must remain for at least three years and be open for \u201cinspection by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and any funding Federal agency.\u201d \u00a7 2143(b)(4)(B). Noncompliance with the Secretary\u2019s standards results in a suspension or revocation of \u201cFederal support for the project.\u201d \u00a7 2143(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In addition to the Federal standards, the University and its medical school must comply with regulations issued by the Commissioner of Public Health (the commissioner) under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 174D. See generally 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As required by 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.030(E), a licensed research facility is to submit annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>reports to the commissioner \u201cregarding its care and treatment of research dogs and cats on a form developed by the Commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the commissioner must inspect the facility, with or without prior notice, \u201cat least four . . . times a year,\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.24(A), and \u201c[a] 11 inspection reports will be held by the Commissioner and shall be considered public records.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.031.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A failure to comply with the commissioner\u2019s regulations or to pass inspections constitutes grounds for a suspension or revocation of the license necessary for use of live animals for \u201cscientific investigation, experiment or instruction or for the testing of drugs or medicines.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 174D, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 631, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">2. <em>The cross motions for summary judgment. </em>Nowhere in their complaint do the plaintiffs state the specific duties or function of the committees. They allege only that the committees are governmental bodies which refuse to comply with the open meeting law. In their answers to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and interrogatories, the defendants denied that they were governmental bodies and that they were required to conduct open meetings. The defendants did, however, in response to the interrogatories, describe the role of the committees at the University and its medical school.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In moving for summary judgment, the plaintiffs simply recited that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Although the defendants\u2019 motion contains the same recital, it also states that the motion \u201cis made upon the pleadings on file [and] the four sets of answers to interrogatories filed by various defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Turning to the interrogatories, we learn what it is that the committees do at the University and its medical school. Their activities are those \u201cdescribed in the Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Animals.\u201d See generally 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.30 through 2.38 (1991). The committees alone, according to the requisite assurance filed with the National Institute of Health, approve research projects involving the use of animals. The decision to approve, modify, or reject any proposed project is made through application of the Animal Welfare Act, the Public Health Service Guide, State regulations, the Report of the American Veterinary Medicine Association Panel on Euthanasia, and the Recommendations for Governance and Management of Institutional Animal Resources, as made by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of American Universities. The board has never reviewed, modified, or reversed a decision of the committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The plaintiffs accepted the answers to interrogatories and produced nothing which even suggests that the committees\u2019 functions include activities beyond those described in the responses. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 714-716 (1991). The narrow question before us, then, is whether the committees must hold open meetings in the course of overseeing compliance with Federal and State standards which control the use and treatment of animals at the University and its medical school.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">3. <em>The open meeting laws. </em>Our open meeting laws (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 11A and 11Afc; G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A through 23C) encompass State and local government. They are framed in common, sometimes identical, language, and they have the same purpose: \u201c[t]o eliminate much of the secrecy surrounding the deliberations and decisions on which <em>public </em>policy is based\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, </em>376 Mass. 70, 72 (1978). These statutes are important to the democratic process. \u201cThe people must be able to \u2018go beyond and behind\u2019 the decisions reached and be apprised of the \u2018pros and cons\u2019 involved if they are to make sound judgments on questions of policy and to select their representatives intelligently.\u201d Note, Open Meeting Statutes: The Press Fights For the \u2018Right to Know,\u2019 75 Harv. L. Rev. 1199, 1200-1201 (1962). The most basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>requirement of these statutes is that governmental bodies must conduct public business in the open.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Because of the purpose of these statutes, we choose not to decide this controversy on the basis urged by the defendants, that by reason of G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, as amended\u2018by St. 1977, c. 991, the Legislature intended to exclude all committees created by the board from c. 30A, \u00a7 11 A. Rather,,we assume without deciding that committees created by the board could be governmental bodies subject to the open meeting law, and we confine our analysis to the question whether these particular committees are required to comply with \u00a7 11 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">As defined in \u00a7 11 A, as amended through St. 1976, c.- 397, \u00a7 1, and as here pertinent, a \u201c [governmental body\u201d is a \u201cstate board, committee, special committee, subcommittee or commission, however created or constituted within the executive . . . branch of the commonwealth . . . .\u201d See also G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23A. The committees were created by the board, through delegation of their authority to University officers, as required by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.010 and \u00a7 910.200. See and compare <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Superintendent Search Screening Comm., </em>405 Mass. 465 (1989), with <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Hanover, </em>409 Mass. 232 (1991). Proceeding on the assumption that these committees are governmental bodies, we will accept the premise that, by approving or rejecting research proposals, the committees make decisions of some form. Compare <em>Nigro </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Canton, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 435-436 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Even if these committees are decision-making governmental bodies, it does not necessarily follow that they are subject to \u00a7 11 A. As we read \u00a7 11 A, keeping the purpose of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>in mind, we think more is required. A public policy matter must be under discussion or consideration before a governmental body need meet openly. \u201cMeeting\u201d is defined in \u00a7 11 A, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 1, as \u201cany corporal convening and deliberation of a governmental body for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision at which any <em>public policy matter </em>over which the governmental body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power is discussed or considered; but shall not include any on-site inspection of any project or program\u201d (emphasis added). The element of \u201cpublic\u201d is also expressed in the definition of \u201c [deliberation\u201d which is a \u201cverbal exchange between a quorum of members of a governmental body attempting to arrive at a decision on any <em>public business </em>within its jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">These terms, \u201cpublic policy\u201d and \u201cpublic business\u201d require us to consider the meaning of the word \u201cpublic\u201d as used but not expressly defined in \u00a7 11 A. In so doing, we return to the definition of \u201c[governmental body\u201d which includes not just boards and committees within the executive or legislative branches of our government but also encompasses the \u201cgoverning board or body of any authority established by the general court to serve a <em>public purpose </em>in the commonwealth or any part thereof\u2019 (emphasis added). Whether an authority serves a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d turns on a variety of factors, all having \u201creference to the object sought to be accomplished and to the degree and manner in which that object affects the public welfare.\u201d <em>Allydonn Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Hous. Authy., </em>304 Mass. 288, 292 (1939). See generally Celia, Administrative Law &amp; Practice \u00a7\u00a7 1141-1144 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Those factors deemed appropriate and nonexclusive in <em>Allydonn, </em>304 Mass, at 293, for consideration in determining whether an authority serves a public purpose are consistent with the general purpose of open meeting laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Ghig</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>lione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, </em>376 Mass, at 72; Note, Open Meeting Statutes, 75 Harv. L. Rev. at 1200-1201. We can discern no reason for ascribing different meanings or connotations to the word \u201cpublic\u201d as used in \u00a7 11 A, whether the word modifies \u201cbusiness,\u201d \u201cpurpose,\u201d or \u201cpolicy.\u201d See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>327 Mass. 694, 700 (1951); <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Drawing upon and applying those considerations discussed in <em>Allydon </em>to the animal care and use committees, we conclude that these entities do not convene \u201c[m]eetings\u201d within the meaning given that word by \u00a7 11 A. These committees were established in compliance with 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(b)(1), so that the University and its medical school could receive Federal funding for research proposals. Although that research benefits the public, the benefit is more remote and circumstantial than direct and immediate. We also think it most important to consider that governmental control over or interference with academic research is not \u201cin line with the historical development of the Commonwealth and with the general purpose of its founders.\u201d <em>Allydonn Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Hous. Authy., </em>304 Mass, at 293. Nor is it in line with the express language of the Animal Welfare Act. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(a)(6)(A), withholding from the Secretary authorization to promulgate rules or otherwise interfere with actual research or experimentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We do not suggest that the law does not recognize that there is public concern about the manner in which animals are cared for and used. The Animal Welfare Act and G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 174D, are results of that concern. The place for public expression and vigilance, however, is not at the research facility but at the public hearings where care and use standards are formulated (see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 [1988]; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 3) and violations punished (see 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143[f]; G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 174D), as well as at the facility inspection report repository. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.030.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Although the defendant committees determine whether the care and use of animals for research purposes at the University and its medical school are consistent with Federal and State standards, they do not consider or discuss public policy matters in order to arrive at a decision on any public business.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Sections 2143(a)(8) and 2145(b) of the Federal act expressly allow States to promulgate standards in addition to those of the Secretary and require the Secretary to cooperate with State and local officials in carrying out laws \u201con the same subject.\u201d We rely on these provisions of the Act to reject the defendants\u2019 argument concerning Federal preemption. See <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>407 Mass. 559, 564-565 (1990), quoting from <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Commn. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>476 U.S. 355, 368, 369 (1986), and <em>Schneidewind </em>v. <em>ANR Pipeline Co., </em>485 U.S. 293, 299 (1988). To the extent the preemption argument is based upon \u00a7 2143(a)(6)(B), which protects a facility from public disclosure of \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential,\u201d we note that there is nothing in the materials before us which suggests that such infer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>motion is at issue. In any event, the open meeting law also protects against public disclosure of such facts. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11A(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Although the regulations speak to cats and dogs, they apply to \u201canimals in general.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 910.001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Because the Federal Act requires that animal care and use committees be created by the facility\u2019s chief administrative officer, the defendants make a fleeting protest (but see Mass.R.A.P. 16 [a] [4], as amended, 367 Mass. 921 [1975]) to the statement in the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that the board created the committees. Noting that \u00a7 llA provides \u201chowever created or constituted,\u201d we, again, assume without deciding that the committees were created by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">They are also consistent with the factors to be considered in deciding whether an entity is a governmental body.
