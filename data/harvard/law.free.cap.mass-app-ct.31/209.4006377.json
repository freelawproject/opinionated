L. c. 152, \u00a7 66<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (which recites certain advantages afforded by the \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>when the city, a self-insurer, has not elected to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to its teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows. The plaintiff was allegedly injured during the course of his employment as a school teacher for the city on January 27, 1986. The plaintiff has not returned to work. The plaintiff has not received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the city even though the city has accepted the provisions of St. 1913, c. 807 (now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75) and self-insures its \u201claborers,\u201d \u201cworkmen,\u201d \u201cmechanics,\u201d and \u201cnurses,\u201d but has never taken the opportunity afforded by the 1939 revision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69 (St. 1939, c. 435) to extend workers\u2019 compensation benefits to \u201cteachers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">After learning that the city had not provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage for teachers, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court on July 13, 1988, seeking damages in tort. The plaintiff\u2019s sole theory of recovery was that under \u00a7 66 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), the city was strictly liable. The city filed a motion for summary judgment, which was allowed on the grounds that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 66, only applies to entities required to have insurance coverage pursuant to \u00a7 25A and the city was excluded from the requirements of \u00a7 25A by virtue of \u00a7 25B. The essence of the plaintiff\u2019s argument on appeal is that \u00a7 66 of the Act applies equally with respect to public and private employers and permits any public employee to bring a civil action against his public employer where such employer has failed to comply with the compulsory insurance provisions of \u00a7 25A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Chapter 152, \u00a7 25A, provides that every employer, with the exception of the governmental entities enumerated in \u00a7 25B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall compensate its employees for job related injuries by obtaining compensation insurance, or by becoming self-insured in accordance with the procedure set out in subsections (1) and (2) of \u00a7 25A. The obligation to provide in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>surance for the .protection of employees under \u00a7 25A is \u201cmandatory\u201d with respect to private employers, but \u201celective\u201d with respect to public employers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, where a private employer should have, but has not, become insured for workers\u2019 compensation, \u00a7 66 imposes liability on the employer, with the usual defenses eliminated, for injuries to its employees arising in the course of employment. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Transformer Serv., Inc., </em>374 Mass. 704, 705 (1978). See <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>J.A.L., Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 450 (1991), and cases cited. However, the strict liability provisions of \u00a7 66 do not apply to employees of the Commonwealth and its local subdivisions for the reason, set out by Justice Kirk in his concurring opinion in <em>Moschella </em>v <em>Quincy, </em>347 Mass. 80, 86-87 (1964), that St. 1913, c. 807 (now c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75) \u201csets apart for separate consideration the employees of the Commonwealth and of its subdivisions as distinguished from employees in private industry.\u201d The rationale for treating \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d sector employees differently is derived, in large part, from long standing principles of governmental immunity from tort liability, in the absence of statutory exception. Section 69 of the Act departs from traditional immunity doctrine by extending the principle of compensation to cities within the Commonwealth, but only to such cities as have \u201caccepted\u201d the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 87. See also <em>Stone\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 530, 531 (1935). By voluntarily \u201caccepting\u201d the Act, a city (or town) effectively waives its common law immunity and thereby covenants to compensate its \u201claborers, workmen, mechanics, and nurses\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for job related injuries. Note 3, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476 (1948), for a discussion of the changes in common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>law doctrine effected by the Act. Since the obligation to provide insurance under \u00a7 25A is elective with regard to public employers, a city, if it has elected to provide coverage at all, is only obliged to insure against such liability \u201cto the extent of its acceptance\u201d of the Act. <em>Stoltz\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 692, 695 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In 1939, the Legislature amended \u00a7 69. See St. 1939, c. 435. That amendment gave those cities and towns which accepted the Act the discretion to determine which employees would be covered within the definition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of \u201claborers, workmen, and mechanics.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the city of Beverly accepted the Act, it nevertheless declined to include \u201cteachers\u201d within the definition of those occupations (i.e., \u201cworkmen,\u201d \u201claborers,\u201d and \u201cmechanics\u201d) which were covered as part of the city\u2019s self-insurance policy. See <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Cambridge Jr. College, </em>364 Mass. 367 (1973). Since this decision was a valid exercise of the city\u2019s discretion, the most that can be said is that the \u201cextent\u201d of the city\u2019s obligation to insure did not reach \u201cteachers.\u201d See <em>Stoltz\u2019s Case, supra; Tracy </em>v. <em>Cambridge Jr. College, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As mentioned earlier, the strict liability provisions of \u00a7 66 only apply to those employers who should have complied, but failed to comply, with the compulsory insurance mandate of \u00a7 25A. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Transformer Serv., Inc., </em>374 Mass, at 705. Although the city voluntarily \u201caccepted\u201d the Act, it cannot reasonably be said that it was under a duty to do so. Moreover, by \u201caccepting\u201d the Act and electing to provide insurance for the protection of its employees, the city was only obliged to insure to the extent of its acceptance. Stated differently, the city, having accepted \u00a7 69, assumed the obligation to pay compensation only within the prescribed limits of the section. The city\u2019s acceptance did not include teachers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>within the class of covered employees. Consequently, the city cannot be held strictly liable for exercising its discretion not to provide coverage to such employees. Therefore the decision of the trial judge granting summary judgment in the city\u2019s favor was not error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Section 66, as amended through St. 1971, c. 700, \u00a7 1, states: \u201cIn an action to recover damages for personal injury or consequential damages . . . by an employee in the course of his employment... it shall not be a defense: 1. That the employee was negligent; 2. That the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee; 3. That the employee had assumed \u2018 voluntarily or contractually the risk of the injury; 4. That the employee\u2019s injury did not result from negligence or other fault of the employer . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 25B, inserted by St. 1943, c. 527, \u00a7 7, provides that the provisions of \u00a7 25A \u201cshall not apply to the commonwealth or the various . . . cities . . . provided for in [\u00a7\u00a7 69 to 75], inclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Section 69 (1986 ed.) states in pertinent part that any city which has accepted St. 1913, c. 807, \u201cshall pay to laborers, workmen, mechanics, and nurses employed by it who receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment, ... the compensation provided by this chapter. It further states that \u201c[a]ny . . . city . . . which accepts this section may provide for payment of compensation of certain or all of its employees by insurance. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Section 69 defines these terms to include \u201call employees\u201d of a city except those specifically enumerated in the Act.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 51, in order to sustain the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
