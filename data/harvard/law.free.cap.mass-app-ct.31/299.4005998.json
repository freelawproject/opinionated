He was indicted for first degree murder along with James All. At trial, the defendant testified that he struck Moran with the bat because he believed Moran was reaching for a knife during an altercation with All, the defendant\u2019s friend. The defendant tried to strike Moran on the shoulder, but Moran ducked, and the bat hit him on the side of the head. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of second degree murder. He appealed, and new counsel filed a motion for a new trial. The motion was denied after a hearing. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>is a consolidated appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>The New Trial Motion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion was grounded on All\u2019s refusal, based on his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to testify for the defense at trial. All pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the first day of his and the defendant\u2019s trial. His plea was accepted, and his sentencing was postponed. The defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial for three reasons. (1) All\u2019s potential testimony constitutes newly-discovered evidence because All, having been sentenced at the time of the new trial motion, could no longer invoke his privilege against self-incrimination to avoid testifying at a new trial. All\u2019s testimony, the defendant asserts, would bolster his unsuccessful claim that he acted in defense of another. (2) The Commonwealth exercised improper influence over All\u2019s availability as a witness by agreeing to his guilty plea before the defendant\u2019s trial and to the postponement of sentencing until afterward. (3) The defendant\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to introduce as evidence at trial a statement All had given to the police. The defendant\u2019s motion was accompanied by a supporting affidavit consisting of a statement by his new attorney asserting his belief that if All were to testify, his testimony would be favorable to the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u201cA trial judge upon motion in writing may grant a new trial if it appears that justice may not have been done. Mass. R. Grim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 [1979]. A motion for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. Reversal for abuse of discretion is particularly rare where the judge acting on the motion was also the trial judge\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To succeed in his claim that he is entitled to a new trial in order to present All\u2019s potential testimony, the defendant \u201cmust establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305 (1986). The motion judge correctly found that no showing had been made that All would provide material testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion was not accompanied by an affidavit stating what All\u2019s testimony would be or whether he would be willing to testify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>392 Mass. 604, 618-619 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 923 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 487 (1986). In light of the defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate that All\u2019s testimony \u201cwould probably have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 306, the motion judge did not consider, and we need not, whether such testimony could properly be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>sidered \u201cnewly discovered\u201d under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 580 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendant claims that he was deprived of his right to present a defense, his right to compulsory process, and his right to a fair trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, because the Commonwealth improperly influenced All\u2019s availability as a witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To substantiate these claims, the defendant must show that the prosecution\u2019s actions caused a loss of material and favorable testimony. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867-872 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>832 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 782-784 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 957-959 (1990). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>372 Mass. 590, 593-597, cert, denied, 434 U.S. 869 (1977). The defendant has failed to demonstrate that any action of the prosecutor influenced All\u2019s decision not to testify. He has not shown that it was, in fact, the Commonwealth that moved for the postponement of All\u2019s sentencing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the prosecutor stated that he might call All as a rebuttal witness, after All had earlier refused to testify for the defense, does not demonstrate that the Commonwealth wielded an improper influence over All. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>thermore, as we have said, the defendant has made no showing that All\u2019s testimony would have been material and exculpatory. The motion judge correctly found that the defendant had not substantiated his claims in these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Likewise, the judge correctly found that trial counsel\u2019s failure to attempt to have All\u2019s statement to the police admitted in evidence did not constitute ineffective assistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) (the court must determine \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d). The judge determined that \u201cAli\u2019s statement, although somewhat supportive of Colantonio\u2019s claim of self-defense, also contained information that was damaging to Colantonio.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She further observed that All\u2019s statement would have had limited corroborative value because All was the defendant\u2019s friend and an alleged participant in the crime who had pleaded guilty. As the judge concluded, the decision not to attempt to introduce All\u2019s statement was not a \u201cmanifestly unreasonable trial tactic.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>401 Mass. 627, 634-635 (1988). The judge properly exercised her discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>The Direct Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The defendant asserts numerous grounds of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">1. <em>All\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege. </em>The defendant contends that the trial judge erred in permitting All to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>crimination, thereby violating the defendant\u2019s rights under the Federal and State Constitutions and a State statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the time All refused to testify for the defense, he had been indicted for first degree murder and his guilty plea to manslaughter had been accepted by the judge. The trial judge ruled that All had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. Defense counsel agreed. The defendant now argues that, because All\u2019s guilty plea to manslaughter had already been accepted, his testimony could not have incriminated him and that it was therefore error to permit him to invoke a Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201cWe apply Federal standards to determine whether a claim of privilege is justified. Under those standards, a refusal to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds must be upheld unless it is \u2018 <em>\u201cperfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer [s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u201d to incriminate.\u2019 The privilege \u2018not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction .... but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original, citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>388 Mass. 453, 456 (1983), quoting in part from <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 488 (1951). A witness who may be \u201ceffectively immunized from further prosecution by his prior conviction [ ] . . . \u2018does not lose his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify concerning <em>other </em>matters or transactions not included in his conviction. Furthermore, neither a practical unlikelihood of prosecution nor the prosecutor\u2019s denial of an intention to prosecute negates an otherwise proper invocation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, supra </em>at 459. Moreover, we do not \u201c \u2018balance\u2019 [a defendant\u2019s] rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the Sixth Amendment against his witness\u2019s decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment. Rather, we examine the record only to determine the propriety of the witness\u2019s refusal to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 215, cert, denied, 439 U.S. 872 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Although All\u2019s testimony could not expose him to prosecution for the crime to which he had pleaded guilty, testimony concerning the episode could expose him to prosecution for a related crime, such as conspiracy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra </em>at 215-216. As we have observed, whether, \u201cas a practical matter,\u201d such a prosecution is \u201cunlikely\u201d has no bearing. <em>Id. </em>at 216. The judge was correct in allowing the claim of privilege \u201cif there was even slender ground for apprehending that testimony on the part of [All] might tend to incriminate him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBonte, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 190, 196 (1987). The defendant has failed to demonstrate that \u201cthere is no real possibility that the witness\u2019s answer[s] will lead to disclosure[s] injurious to him.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 183, 189 (1975). The judge\u2019s proper ruling certainly did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 561-562 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">2. <em>The jury instructions, </em>(a) <em>Self-defense and defense of another. </em>The defendant alleges errors in the jury instructions on self-defense and defense of another. He did not object to these alleged errors at trial. We review the charge to determine whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>402 Mass. 321, 327-328 (1988). We judge the \u201clegal sufficiency of the instructions to the jury ... on the basis of the charge as a whole, and not on the basis of limited or isolated portions of it\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 857-858 (1984) . \u201cIf the instructions as a whole convey to the jury a fundamentally correct appreciation of the law of self-defense and, in particular, of the allocation of the burden of proof, any flaws along the way will not necessitate a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 335 (1985) , and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The defendant claims that the judge improperly shifted to him the burden on the issue of self-defense or defense of another, violating his right to due process under standards established in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 (1975), and <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 (1979). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth must bear the burden of proof that a defendant did not act in self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, supra </em>at 857, and cases cited. The Commonwealth similarly bears the burden of proof that a defendant did not act in defense of another. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>369 Mass. 640, 650 (1976) (\u201c[T]he trend . . . has been to interweave closely the justification of defense of a third person with self-defense\u201d); Nolan &amp; Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 680 (2d ed. 1988) (\u201cThis justification [defense of others] appears to be coextensive with the right of self-defense\u201d). \u201cBecause \u2018self-defense is a \u201csensitive part of jury instructions in a criminal trial, [an error in which] can readily lead to a miscarriage of justice,\u201d \u2019 \u2018increased expectations appropriately arise as to trial counsel\u2019s efforts to preserve the defendant\u2019s appellate rights\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, supra </em>at 334-335. In this case, trial counsel twice requested, and received, reinstruction on defense of another. \u201cThe lack of [other] . . . objection [s] . . . suggests that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was satisfied . . . that the jury had received competent guidance on the legal principles governing the issue of self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. 318, 329-330 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The instructions were flawed in some respects. They contain some disapproved language. The judge, within a very short space, twice told the jury that if they found that \u201cself-defense is present in the case,\u201d they must then go on to consider other questions. While \u201cfinding\u201d language or its equivalent should be avoided, it is not necessarily fatal. See and compare <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527, 535 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 404-405 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, supra </em>at 859; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, supra </em>at 328; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, supra </em>at 338 &amp; n.4. Here, the \u201cfinding\u201d language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was closely tied to a correct statement of the burden of proof. Immediately after the second use of the term, the judge stated: \u201cI\u2019ve indicated the burden is at all times on the Commonwealth.\u201d The judge\u2019s introduction to . the instruction on deadly force \u2014 \u201cin order to create a right to defend one\u2019s self with a dangerous weapon\u201d \u2014 was likewise followed immediately by a correct statement of the burden of proof \u2014 \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant used excessive force in either defending himself or another.\u201d The defendant also criticizes as burden-shifting the judge\u2019s reference to a \u201cprecondition\u201d to the \u201cright\u201d of self-defense. It would have been better to avoid this terminology. However, \u201cit is imperative that judges not be left completely tongue-tied when they must explain principles of law essential to the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, supra </em>at 338. Finally, the judge\u2019s statement early in the charge that \u201c[bjefore the issue of self-defense is present in a case, the Commonwealth must prove that a defendant first took advantage of every opportunity to avoid contact\u201d is confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Despite some lapses, the charge as a whole conveyed to the jury that the burden remained with the Commonwealth throughout to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense or defense of another. The general charge on burden of proof was thorough and clear. It emphasized that the Commonwealth must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and quoted from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). Early in the charge on self-defense and defense of another, the judge clearly and forcefully instructed the jury that the burden of proof on this issue remains with the Commonwealth at all times. Her language tracked the language approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 692 n.10 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123, 129-130 &amp; n.4 (1979). Toward the end of the charge, the judge stated that the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove the use of excessive force beyond a reasonable doubt and then repeated that the burden remains \u201cat all times\u201d on the Commonwealth concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass, at 858; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe </em>402 Mass, at 328; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 335-337 (charge conveyed proper allocation of burden of proof). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>374 Mass. 596, 600 (1978); <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass, at 533-536; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 551-553 (1984) (charge improperly allocated burden of proof). We reiterate, however, that care must be used in crafting instructions on self-defense and defense of another to \u201celiminate any lam guage that might convey to the jury the impression that a defendant must prove that he acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, supra </em>at 339-340.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The defendant\u2019s further objections to the instructions on self-defense and defense of another may be dealt with summarily. He objects to the phrase \u201cyou will make a determination, based upon the believable evidence, whether or not self-defense is present in the case.\u201d It is, however, \u201cappropriate for the judge to \u2018remind the jurors that they had first to <em>determine </em>whether self-defense existed as an issue in this case.\u2019 Performing that inquiry requires the jury to evaluate, as a threshold issue, the over-all reasonableness of the force used in the name of self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, supra </em>at 338. The defendant asserts the judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthe right of self-defense ordinarily is not present when a person provokes or initiates an assault, unless that person withdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces his intention to retire,\u201d gave the impression that the defendant had to prove he was not the aggressor and precluded, as a justification for initiating an assault, the reasonable belief that the victim was reaching for a deadly weapon. The defendant neglects to note that the judge instructed the jury four times that a person may act in self-defense if he <em>\u201creasonably believes he is about to be physically attacked </em>or is about to be physically attacked\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant contends that the instructions on self-defense and defense of another were confusing. He also points to an instruction concerning self-defense which does not mention defense of another and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tends that the judge thereby precluded the jury from considering whether the defendant acted in defense of another. The judge frequently intermixed her instructions on self-defense and defense of another and sometimes referred to self-defense without mentioning defense of another. She did, however, give specific and clear instructions concerning the elements of defense of another. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Martin, 369 Mass, at 649. At defense counsel\u2019s request, she twice repeated those instructions and later reminded the jury that \u201cwhen I say \u2018self-defense\u2019 I mean defense of another as well.\u201d The jury would not have been confused or believed themselves precluded from considering whether the defendant had acted in defense of another. The defendant\u2019s contention that the jury should not have been instructed on self-defense because it was not an issue in the case is foreclosed by his request for an instruction on self-defense and his own testimony which indicated that he had fear for his safety during the altercation. The defendant\u2019s contention that the judge failed to instruct that \u201cexcessive force in the lawful exercise of self-defense or defense of another negates malice\u201d ignores the judge\u2019s repeated instructions that the use of excessive force in self-defense may reduce murder to manslaughter. Finally, as the trial judge observed, the jury\u2019s request for reinstruction on malice and premeditation indicated a concern with the distinction between first degree murder and second degree murder, not, as the defendant contends, confusion with the concepts of self-defense and defense of another. We conclude that the instructions as a whole do not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">(b) <em>Consciousness of guilt. </em>The defendant testified that he did not turn himself in to the police until five days after he killed Moran, although he learned that Moran had died and that the police were looking for him after two days. During that time, he stayed first at the home where his girlfriend was babysitting and then at his sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that this behavior showed consciousness of guilt. The defendant contends that the unobjected-to instructions on consciousness of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>failed to inform the jury that the defendant could not be convicted on the basis of consciousness of guilt evidence alone, as required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass, at 582-585. In this regard, the jury should be instructed \u201c(1) that they are not to convict a defendant on the basis of evidence of flight or concealment alone and (2) that they may, but need not consider such evidence as one of the factors tending to prove the guilt of the defendant\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 585. The charge in this case was nearly identical to the. charge in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 371 n.14 (1985), cert, denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986). In that case, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the instruction on consciousness of guilt, while \u201cnot a model of clarity regarding the fact that a defendant may not be convicted on consciousness of guilt evidence alone, . . . contained the substance of what we required in <em>Toney.\u201d Id. </em>at 371. This aspect of the charge created no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>402 Mass, at 327-328.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The defendant also claims that the instructions \u201cimproperly created a mandatory presumption of consciousness of guilt if the jury found that the defendant fled from the scene of the crime and hid to avoid apprehension. . . .\u201d This claim has no merit, as the plain words of the charge make clear: \u201cUnder no circumstance, may you presume a defendant\u2019s guilt from flight or concealment. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence of malice. </em>The defendant argues that his motion for a required finding of not guilty, made at the close of. the Commonwealth\u2019s case, was erroneously denied because insufficient evidence of malice was presented to support the second degree murder conviction. Malice, the \u201crequisite mental element\u201d for murder, \u201cincludes any unexcused intent to kill, to do grievous bodily harm, or to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous harm will follow.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 408 (1980). Malice can be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>375 Mass. 308, 312 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 762-763 (1985). The jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>found that the defendant intentionally used a deadly weapon. There was testimony of eyewitnesses that he took the bat from a car, walked over to the victim with it, and then swung it at the victim. Evidence was also presented that he \u201cswung the bat really hard\u201d and that he \u201cmoved back with the bat, just like you were going to hit a baseball, and hit [Moran] in the head with a really good, hard whack.\u201d The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979), amply supported the jury\u2019s inference of malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 312.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The defendant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s case deteriorated between the time the Commonwealth rested and the close of the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant did not, however, renew his motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of all the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 n.l (1976). The defendant\u2019s claim of deterioration relies solely on his trial testimony that he wielded the bat because he feared harm to himself and All, that he was aiming for Moran\u2019s shoulder, not his head, and that he did not intend to kill Moran., The defendant admitted at trial that he intentionally swung the bat at Moran. \u201cA jury is not required to believe any or all of a defendant\u2019s statements; rather, it may believe only such portions of the statements as it may consider trustworthy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 313. There was no deterioration of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 80 n.5 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ricardo, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. .345, 350-351 (1988). Even if the defendant had renewed his motion, he would not have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in various respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(a) <em>Failure to request the court to conduct an \u201cadequate colloquy\u201d regarding All\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. </em>A brief colloquy was held at which All invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. The court then excused him. The defendant\u2019s claim of inadequacy rests on the assumption that All did not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege and that his testimony would have provided the defendant with a \u201csubstantial ground of defence.\u201d As we have said, the defendant has not shown that All\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege was improper. Neither has he established that All\u2019s testimony would have been materially beneficial to the defense. In fact, the defendant has never made any showing as to the contents of All\u2019s potential testimony. The defendant has not demonstrated that a more exhaustive colloquy was warranted or that such a colloquy would have provided the defendant with \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass, at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">(b) <em>Failure to move for a mistrial and a hearing concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged exercise of undue influence over All to prevent him from testifying. </em>For the reasons we have discussed, the defendant has not demonstrated that by filing such motions, his trial counsel \u201cmight have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">(c) <em>Failure to object to errors in the jury instructions on self-defense and defense of another and consciousness of guilt. </em>We have held that the charge as a whole correctly conveyed to the jury the law of self-defense and defense of another. As to the instruction on consciousness of guilt, we have concluded that it adhered to the substance of the <em>Toney </em>requirements and was otherwise correct. The lack of objections did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">(d) <em>Failure to file motion for required finding. </em>Finally, the defendant claims ineffective assistance \u201cif this court determines that trial counsel failed to file a proper motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and the defendant\u2019s case to so much of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dictment as charged murder in the second degree and that the evidence only supported a finding of manslaughter. . . .\u201d The short answer is that, as we have held, ample evidence was presented to permit the jury to find that the defendant killed Moran with malice aforethought. We do not require trial counsel to engage in \u201cexercise [s] in futility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Servidori, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 969, 970 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The defendant has failed to show that his counsel\u2019s behavior fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and that this behavior \u201chas likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">After review of the entire record, we also reject the defendant\u2019s final argument that there were errors of law which, although individually insufficient to require reversal, cumulatively \u201cpresent a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 568 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The defendant failed to include in his appendix a copy of his new trial motion or the affidavit accompanying the motion. Our information as to their contents comes from the motion judge\u2019s thorough memorandum of decision. The defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to attempt to introduce in evidence All\u2019s statement to the police constitutes ineffective assistance appears in the defendant\u2019s brief, along with a number of other ineffective assistance claims. Since the motion judge\u2019s memorandum discusses this ineffective assistance claim, we consider the claim in the context of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his new trial motion. We consider the other ineffective assistance claims in the context of the direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In this case, the judge acting on the motion was also the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The motion judge reviewed a statement All had given to the police during the investigation of the crime and concluded that if All were to testify to the contents of that statement, it would not \u201ccreate]] a substantial risk that a jury exposed to such evidence would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d The statement contained some information corroborating the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim: \u201cAll told police . . . that \u2018the [victim] reached back\u2019 as if for a weapon and that \u2018[the defendant] said \u201cI thought [the victim] had a knife or something.\u201d \u2019 \u201d All\u2019s statement also contained inculpatory information: All \u201cstated that he did not know what the [victim] was doing \u2018when he reached back there,\u2019 that he had \u2018no idea,\u2019 why [the defendant] hit the [victim] with a bat, that it \u2018bothered\u2019 him that he did not know why [the defendant] had hit the [victim], and that [the defendant] threatened another person at the scene with the bat.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The motion judge determined that All would continue to have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination even though his case had been concluded. On appeal, the defendant merely asserts that All can no longer invoke .that privilege. Because he does not argue the issue, the defendant has waived it. Mass.R.A.P. 16 (a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). In any event, a determination of the issue would have no effect on the outcome of this appeal, since the defendant\u2019s failure to show the materiality of All\u2019s potential testimony is fatal to his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The defendant also asserts violation of his rights under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. He does not argue a State claim in his brief, however, and we therefore consider his claim under principles of Federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The defendant states in his brief that the docket entries in All\u2019s case reveal that the Commonwealth postponed All\u2019s sentencing on its own motion. To the contrary, the docket entries do not reveal the source of the motion to continue All\u2019s sentencing. Had the Commonwealth requested the postponement of All\u2019s sentencing, that fact alone would not, of course, demonstrate wrongdoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\">See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The motion judge did not reach the question whether the hearsay statement would have been barred as evidence at trial. The defendant made no argument to show that it would have been admissible under any exception to the rule against hearsay. In his brief the defendant asserts that the statement would have been admissible under \u201cvarious\u201d hearsay exceptions, but offers no support for the assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Specifically, the defendant claims deprivation of his right to present a defense, compulsory process, due process of law, and a fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution and G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 231-233 (1975), is misplaced. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McInerney, </em>373 Mass. 136, 145-148 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court declined to follow the allegedly relevant reasoning in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
