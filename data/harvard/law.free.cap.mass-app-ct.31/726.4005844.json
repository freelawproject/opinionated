L. c. 140, \u00a7 54; a class 2 used car dealer\u2019s license and a class 3 motor vehicle junk license, both issued under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Goldie\u2019s complaint in the Superior Court, filed on June 6, 1989, sought injunctive relief and judicial review of the proceedings before the selectmen, citing G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 (relief in the nature of certiorari), and G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59 (granting judicial review to any person aggrieved by a decision of a licensing board refusing to grant a license under \u00a7 59).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing, the application for a preliminary injunction was denied, and the judge ordered a hearing, which he set down for July 13, 1989, on a proposed, but unfiled, motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">On June 29, 1989, the selectmen filed a motion for summary judgment supported by the affidavit of the keeper of the records of the selectmen. The affidavit incorporated (i) a copy of a letter dated January 18, 1989, notifying Goldie\u2019s of a hearing on February 7, 1989, on its application for the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>newal of its class 2 and class 3 licenses; (ii) the minutes of the meeting of the selectmen dated February 7, 1989 (reciting that \u201cthis meeting was [called] because of the concerns of the Conservation Commission, the Board of Appeals and the Fire Chief,\u201d but that no conclusions were reached and no vote was taken); (iii) the minutes of the meeting of the selectmen dated March 14, 1989 (reciting that the selectmen voted to hold a hearing on Goldie\u2019s class 2 and class 3 license applications); (iv) a copy of a letter dated April 13, 1989, notifying Goldie\u2019s that there would be a hearing on the class 2 and class 3 license applications on May 9, 1989, that the selectmen intended to consider seven issues, which the letter identified, and that Goldie\u2019s might be represented by counsel and might present and cross-examine witnesses; and (v) a copy of a letter dated June 1, 1989, in which the selectmen notified Goldie\u2019s that the board, following the hearing held May 9, 1989, had voted to deny Goldie\u2019s applications for the renewal of its \u00a7 59 class 2 and class 3 licenses as well as Goldie\u2019s applications, filed one day after the May 9 hearing, for the renewal of its \u00a7 54 junk dealer and junk collector licenses. The selectmen cited six reasons , as the basis of their decision, which we set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and added that Goldie\u2019s place of business was not suitable for its continued use as a class 2 and class 3 licensed establishment. Although the transcript of the hearing held on May 9 was not attached to the motion for summary judgment or to the accompanying affidavit, it was in fact before the judge without objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>from Goldie\u2019s, and he considered the transcript in reaching his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On July 12, 1989, one day before the hearing on the selectmen\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Goldie\u2019s counsel filed an affidavit under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(f), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), seeking the opportunity to obtain answers to interrogatories,. responses to document requests, and deposition testimony of various persons on the basis of which counsel, according to his affidavit, expected to be able to establish that certain testimony at the May 9 hearing, and the six reasons assigned by the town, were not accurate and that there were genuine issues of material fact which needed to be tried. The judge, in allowing summary judgment and denying Goldie\u2019s the requested continuance, cited the absence of any vested right to the renewal of the licenses, the broad discretion of the town in denying licenses, the adequacy of the reasons set forth by the town, and the absence of any arbitrary or capricious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">1. <em>Statutory background. </em>The statute governing junk collector and junk dealer licenses, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 54, differs markedly from G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 58, governing class 2 and 3 licenses for dealing in used automobiles and their parts. Section 54 authorizes cities and towns to adopt an ordinance or by-law which \u201cmay provide for the licensing ... by the selectmen ... of suitable persons to be collectors of, [or] dealers in . . . junk,\u201d and the selectmen may make such additional regulations and restrictions as \u201cshall be expressed in all licenses.\u201d The license may be \u201crevoked at pleasure,\u201d and, in any event, expires on May first of each year. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 202. There is no provision in \u00a7 54 for any hearing on an application for a \u00a7 54 license, and there is no provision for any judicial review of action taken by the licensing authority with respect to a \u00a7 54 license. Article XVI of the Walpole by-laws provides that the selectmen \u201cmay license suitable persons\u201d as junk dealers and junk collectors. The bylaw, like \u00a7 54, contains no provision for any hearing or for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Section 59, on the other hand, provides that the licensing authorities of cities and towns, in their discretion, \u201cmay grant\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a license to a \u201cproper person\u201d to engage in the motor vehicle business (class 1, class 2, or class 3) if (i) that business is to be his or her principal business and (ii) the applicant has a \u201cplace of business suitable for the purpose.\u201d All such licenses expire on January first of each year. .Section 59 also contains a provision for a hearing, prior to the issuance of a class 3 license only (motor vehicle junk license), with notice of the hearing to abutters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is also a provision for judicial review: an appeal may by taken by any person aggrieved by any action taken by the licensing board under \u00a7 59 to a judge of the superior court who, after due notice, shall \u201cgive a summary hearing on such appeal, and shall have jurisdiction in equity to review all questions of fact or law . . . and may make any appropriate decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Even though the selectmen were only required by statute to hold a hearing with respect to Goldie\u2019s class 3 license application,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is clear that the selectmen, without objection from Goldie\u2019s (on the possible ground that the \u00a7 54 license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>applications were filed one day <em>after </em>the hearing), either at the hearing or in its brief to this court, conducted the hearing as bearing on all four applications,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and they relied on the evidence produced at the May 9 hearing as the basis for their decision in respect to all four applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">2. <em>Standard of judicial review. </em>The appropriate standard of review of the denial of the \u00a7 54 licenses \u2014 a certiorari case \u2014 \u201cmust be determined according to \u2018the nature of the action sought to be reviewed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 877 (1983), quoting from <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 49 (1977). Section 54 and the town\u2019s by-law permit the exercise of broad discretion by the selectmen, rather than specifying \u201cnarrow and objective criteria\u201d for the issuance of a license, in consequence of which the standard of review applicable to the two \u00a7 54 applications is \u201cerror of law or abuse of discretion, as measured by the \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Caswell, supra, </em>at 878, and <em>Yerardi\u2019s, supra </em>at 300 n.7. Under this standard of review, where, as here, a hearing has been provided, the record to be reviewed is the entire record of the hearing before the selectmen, including the reasons for their decision. We must determine whether the Superior Court correctly decided that the record of the proceedings before the selectmen showed no error of law or abuse of discretion. See <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The standard of review provided by \u00a7 59, in a case where a hearing has been provided, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>is a different matter; it is not altogether clear what the Legislature had in mind by providing. for a \u201csummary hearing\u201d together with \u201cjurisdiction in equity to review all questions of fact or law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>No reported decision appears to have considered the question presented here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The provisions for judicial review under \u00a7 59 are broader than those under \u00a7 54, where there is no specific provision for judicial review. The provisions in \u00a7 59 requiring a \u201csummary hearing\u201d and a \u201creview [of] all questions of fact or law,\u201d when read in the context of an \u201cappeal\u201d from a decision of the licensing authority in \u201crefusing to grant, or revoking a license for any cause,\u201d imply strongly that only the record before the licensing authority, including the reasons for its decision, must be reviewed, both as to the facts and the law. We conclude, then, that Goldie\u2019s is entitled to a review of the transcript of the hearing on May 9, 1989, as well as the decision of the selectmen. The standard in the Superior Court is whether the decision of the selectmen is based upon an error of law or is unsupported by substantial evidence. Compare G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c) and <em>(e). </em>Our review is to determine whether the Superior Court correctly made those determinations. Compare <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., 377 </em>Mass. 897, 903 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">3. <em>Conclusions. </em>The record appendix includes only excerpts from the transcript of the hearing before the selectmen, and we shall assume, therefore, that the parties agree that those excerpts contain all the testimony material to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The decision of the selectmen recites six reasons for the denial of the four license applications. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>We need not review either the correctness or the adequacy of all six reasons, for one of the assigned reasons is sufficient to justify the decision of the selectmen. We refer to the finding that Goldie\u2019s was in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 54A and 59A, as inserted by St. 1967, c. 600, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. Those two sections contain provisions requiring the licensee\u2019s place of business to be \u201cscreened from view either by natural objects or well-constructed and properly maintained fences at least six feet. . . .\u201d Absent compliance with these provisions, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>licenses may be granted under \u00a7 54 (by virtue of \u00a7 54A) or under \u00a7 59 (by virtue of \u00a7 59A).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We have reviewed the transcript included in the record before us, having in mind that the \u201cevidentiary niceties found in the courtroom\u201d need not be observed at a hearing before selectmen. See <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 303-305 (1985). There was undisputed testimony by the building inspector of Walpole that a 110 foot natural barrier of trees \u2014 a \u201cbuffer barrier for the property,\u201d according to the inspector \u2014 had been \u201cdestroyed by taking down of trees.\u201d This destruction of the screening of Goldie\u2019s property \u201cby natural objects\u201d is evidence sufficiently substantiated to support the conclusion of the selectmen that the issuance of the \u00a7 54 licenses was prohibited by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 54A, and the issuance of the \u00a7 59 licenses was prohibited by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59A. It follows that there was no error of law or abuse of discretion with regard to the refusal to issue the \u00a7 54 licenses, and the decision to refuse to issue the \u00a7 59 licenses was supported by substantial evidence untainted by any error of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Finally, given the limited review provided by G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, and by \u00a7 59, there is no merit to Goldie\u2019s claim that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>should be permitted the opportunity to obtain discovery and introduce evidence extrinsic to the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 54, provides that licenses thereunder may be issued to \u201csuitable persons.\u201d General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 58, as appearing in St. 1987, c. 289, \u00a7 2, provides that a class 2 license may be granted under \u00a7 59 to \u201c[a]ny person whose principal business is the buying or selling of second hand motor vehicles. ...\u201d A class 3 license may be granted to \u201c[a]ny person whose principal business is the buying of second hand motor vehicles for the purpose of remodeling, taking apart or rebuilding the same, or the buying or selling of parts of second hand motor vehicles or tires, or the assembling of second hand motor vehicle parts. . . .\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 58.

See also <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 302 (1985), where the court observed that \u201cthe judicial review contemplated by the certiorari action of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 [which Goldie\u2019s cited and is applicable to the \u00a7 54 license applications], suggests to agencies that hearings should be allowed even when the governing statutes remain silent on the point. The general observation to be made is that judicial review, as accorded by such a statute as G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, naturally draws with it the advisability if not the necessity of some appropriate hearing.\u201d The court also stated, \u201cIn this Commonwealth the right to a hearing where government exerts power upon an individual in a matter of consequence has been related, on occasion, not strictly to the Constitution, but to an ethic that pervades our legal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.

In general, the selectmen may not use the denial of the licenses as a means of enforcing other provisions of public laws. See <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 462 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>220 Mass. 552, 554 (1915) (the actions of a licensing authority acting under G.
