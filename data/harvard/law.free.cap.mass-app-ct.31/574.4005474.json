After a jury trial in the Superior Court, he was convicted of trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Officer Robert Fratalia of the Boston police anticrime unit was the sole witness at the hearing on the motion to suppress. The facts found by the motion judge, supplemented by additional undisputed evidence presented at the hearing, are as follows: Officer Fratalia received a telephone call from a confidential informant at approximately 8:30 p.m. on June 14, 1989. As a result of the call, he met with the informant about fifteen minutes later. One or two days earlier, the informant had given Officer Fratalia information about an individual named Charles Mebane. He described Mebane\u2019s physical appearance (including that he walked with a serious limp) and said that Mebane would be coming off a train at the Amtrak Back Bay station at a certain time and date; he would be carrying cocaine. Mebane\u2019s time of arrival and physical appearance matched the informant\u2019s description, and Mebane was found to be carrying cocaine. Mebane was arrested and the cocaine was seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">At the June 14 meeting, the informant told Officer Fratalia that Steven Brown would arrive at the Amtrak Back Bay station on a train from New York at approximately 9:15 that evening. He would be carrying cocaine. The informant described Brown as a black man in his twenties, with medium-dark skin, of medium build, about six feet three or four inches tall, weighing between one hundred eighty and one hundred eighty-five pounds. He would be dressed casually and would be wearing glasses. As a result of the tip, Officer Fratalia and two partners went to Back Bay station and learned that a train was scheduled to arrive from New York at 9:15 p.m. The train arrived at 9:25 p.m. The defendant got off the train. His appearance fit the description the informant had given. He was wearing a green and white striped polo shirt and jeans, and he carried a maroon colored bag over his shoulder. He looked over his left shoulder \u201cas if someone were behind him\u201d as he walked through the train station.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The officers stopped the defendant as he left the station. They identified themselves, told him that he fit the description of a suspect they were looking for, and asked his name. He responded \u201cSteven Brown.\u201d Asked where he had come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>from, he answered, \u201cthe Amtrak train.\u201d Officer Fratalia told the defendant to set the maroon colored bag down on the ground. He complied by placing it at his feet. Fratalia then told him to sit down; he did so. Next, Fratalia searched him for weapons and found none. He then squeezed the bag to feel for weapons and felt a hard object inside. He opened the bag and found a package containing a kilo of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Article 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution requires that a search grounded on information provided by an unnamed informant must meet the standard of probable cause established by <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 164 (1988). The Commonwealth must \u201cdemonstrate (1) some underlying circumstances from which the law enforcement officials could have concluded that the information was reliable (the veracity test); and (2) some underlying circumstances which demonstrate a basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge (basis of knowledge test).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-165. \u201cEach prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test \u2014 the basis of knowledge and the veracity of the informant \u2014 presents an independently important consideration .... [Ejach element of the test must be separately considered and satisfied or supplemented in some way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 375-376 (1985). \u201cThese are vital, not merely perfunctory requirements. To justify the intrusion of [a] . . . search, the tip must not only come from a credible person, but he must be shown to be relying on something more than a casual rumor or an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>365 Mass. 59, 63 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 165. Independent police corroboration of a detailed tip may compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs of the test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The motion judge correctly ruled (and the defendant conceded at oral argument) that Officer Fratalia\u2019s testimony concerning the informant\u2019s previous tip satisfied the veracity prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. It was \u201csupported by . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>facts relating to . . . the accuracy of the informant\u2019s information on that prior occasion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>411 Mass. 108, 111 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 486 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapine, </em>410 Mass. 38, 41-42 (1991). The informant had described Mebane, his mode of transportation and time of arrival accurately, had correctly predicted that he would be in possession of cocaine, and the tip had resulted in the seizure of cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17, 21 (1975) (informant\u2019s veracity was established by the provision of accurate information during a police investigation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapine, </em>410 Mass, at 40-42 (informant\u2019s veracity was established by the provision of accurate information concerning the presence and amount of drugs and the description of a house, leading to drug-related arrests); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 45-46 (1991) (informant\u2019s veracity was established by the provision of information leading to two arrests and a seizure of cocaine). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>411 Mass, at 108-114 (affidavit which stated that an informant had given the police information that led to three past arrests but did not provide details of the arrests or the accuracy of the information failed to establish the informant\u2019s veracity).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">As the motion judge found, the informant failed to reveal the basis of his knowledge that the defendant was carrying cocaine. The close question here is whether, under standards developed by our cases, the information in the tip, corroborated by independent police work, was sufficiently detailed to show that it was based on \u201csomething more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass, at 165, quoting from <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. at 416.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>States, </em>358 U.S. 307 (1959), provides a \u201cbenchmark\u201d for determining whether police corroboration of the details of an informant\u2019s tip satisfies the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 165-166, quoting from <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>\u201c[T]he detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper . . . </em>[is] a suitable measurement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>403 Mass. 172, 175 (1988). In <em>Draper </em>the informant described the defendant as a black male, twenty-seven. years old, five feet eight inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds, and wearing a light-colored raincoat, brown slacks and black shoes. The informant accurately predicted that the defendant would be arriving by train on one of two particular mornings, that he would be carrying a tan zipper bag and that he walked at a fast pace; he would be bringing three ounces of heroin. <em>Draper, </em>358 U.S. at 309 &amp; n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In this case, the informant gave the defendant\u2019s name and accurately described the defendant\u2019s physical appearance and his approximate age, his mode of travel and time and place of arrival. Other than a description of \u201ccasual clothes,\u201d the informant did not give particulars as to the defendant\u2019s clothing nor did he say that the defendant would be carrying a maroon colored shoulder bag or any baggage at all. The informant gave no indication of his source of knowledge as t\u00f3 these details.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cAs frequently occurs in search and seizure cases, we are dealing here with line-drawing of a difficult nature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 797 (1985) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring). The task is especially difficult because of the fragile premise that police corroboration of innocent detail and easily predictable events described by an informant can compensate for deficiencies, as here, in the basis of knowledge prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. See 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3(f)(2d ed. 1987). As applied in cases decided by the Supreme Judicial Court, <em>Draper </em>requires police corroboration of an informant\u2019s detailed tip of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>physical appearance, clothing, baggage, if any, and time and place of arrival. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 164; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>403 Mass. 167, 168 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>403 Mass, at 173 &amp; n.2; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrow, </em>403 Mass. 176, 177 (1988). (In addition, in all of these cases, except <em>Farrow, </em>the informant accurately predicted the mode \"of transportation; in <em>Farrow </em>the informant correctly predicted the defendant\u2019s arrival at a particular address.) The facts in this case do not \u201ccompare favorably,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 166, with those in <em>Draper. </em>The informant did not give a detailed description of the defendant\u2019s clothing or state that he would be carrying a maroon colored shoulder bag. The tenuous probative value of the confirmation of innocuous detail (when there is no information about alleged criminal activity) demands at least a comparable level of particularity of description and corroboration to that which was present in <em>Draper </em>and in the Supreme Judicial Court cases we have just cited. In cases involving this kind of information, there should be no whittling of underpinnings considered essential to satisfaction of the basis of knowledge prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test in the Massachusetts progeny of <em>Draper. </em>We hold that in this case \u201c[t]he information provided and the . . . corroboration of innocuous details in unsuspicious circumstances were insufficient to support probable cause, \u2018for the description of criminal activity was without the detail, either as to its content or the process by which the content was obtained, that could raise it above the level of casual rumor.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. <em>777, </em>784 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>381 Mass. 301, 302-303 (1980).
