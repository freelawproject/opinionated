The plaintiffs own property abutting the locus. We are asked to decide whether the trust\u2019s ownership interest in the locus was sufficient to obtain approval of its definitive subdivision plan, and if not, whether the board had the power to waive \u201cthe requirements of its regulations relative to the applications [for approval of a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>division plan] and the presence at any hearing of the owner of record.\u201d We conclude that the trust lacked standing to apply for definitive plan approval and that the board\u2019s purported waiver of the so-called \u201cowner of record\u201d requirement was inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the Subdivision Control Law. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 8IK et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The pertinent facts giving rise to this dispute are as follows. In 1982, the trust filed a complaint in the Land Court to register a parcel of land in South Yarmouth consisting of 6.44 acres (the locus).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint was based solely on the trust\u2019s \u201cclaim of title to [the] locus ... by adverse possession.\u201d The Land Court, as required by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1981, c. 658, \u00a7 19, referred the complaint for registration to one of its title examiners to \u201csearch the records and investigate all facts stated in the complaint or otherwise brought to his notice, and [to] file in the case a report thereon, concluding with a certificate of his opinion upon the title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">During the pendency of the registration proceeding, on July 14, 1986, the trust filed an application with the board for approval of a preliminary subdivision plan of the locus. This application identified the trust as the owner of record and was signed by one of its trustees, Dewitt Davenport, in the space reserved for \u201csignature of owner of record.\u201d In the space requesting a deed reference for the property, the trust inserted a reference to a deed recorded in the Barnstable registry of deeds in book 4572, page 155, which covered real property in West Yarmouth more than one mile away from the locus and having no connection with the locus. The application for approval of the preliminary plan was subsequently denied by the board at a meeting held on September 4, 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>By an application dated January 16, 1987, the trust filed a plan with the board seeking approval of a definitive plan. The application identified the owner of record as \u201cJohn Doe, c/o Town of Yarmouth.\u201d The title reference provided in the application referred to the docket number assigned to the trust\u2019s land registration complaint. The definitive plan was subsequently approved by the board on May 20, 1987, and a certificate of approval was filed with the town clerk on June 1, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Subsequent to the board\u2019s approval of the definitive plan, the Land Court examiner concluded that the trust \u201cdid not have good record title to one hundred percent (100%) of [the] locus\u201d as of the date either plan had been submitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trust thereafter voluntarily withdrew its land registration complaint to all but one-half acre of the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On June 10, 1987, the plaintiffs commenced this action to annul the decision of the board approving the. definitive plan, alleging that the board\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious, and in excess of its authority. The trust was allowed to intervene. On July 19, 1989, a judge of the Superior Court entered a judgment annulling the action of the board as having been in excess of its authority. This appeal from that judgment ensued pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The trial court\u2019s duties in hearing and deciding appeals under \u00a7 8IBB are to conduct a hearing de nova, find the relevant facts, and determine the validity of the planning board\u2019s decision. <em>Fairbairn </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Barnstable, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 173 (1977). This court will not upset the factual determinations of the lower court unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">1. It is settled that a planning board regulation requiring the applicant for definitive plan approval to be an \u201cowner of record\u201d is a reasonable regulation. <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Wakefield, </em>357 Mass 123, 129 (1970). We think it important that the \u201cowner\u201d of a site be properly identified on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>a definitive plan to be recorded. In <em>Kuklinska, </em>the plaintiffs sought to overturn a definitive plan on the ground that the applicant did not own all the land included within the plan. Because the planning board regulation at issue in that case required that the \u201capplicant must be the owner of all the land included in the proposed subdivision,\u201d the court held that the definitive plan did not conform to the regulation and was thus invalid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The opinion underscored the point that the regulation was consistent with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, as amended by St. 1961, c. 331, which defines a subdivision applicant as an \u201cowner or his agent\u201d. See also <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Stoughton, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 556 (1987), where this court reiterated that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, defines an applicant as an \u201cowner or his agent,\u201d and upheld the validity of a planning board regulation requiring that the applicant must hold record title to the land shown on the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Here, the regulations promulgated by the board relating to the requirements for obtaining plan approval are not dissimilar to those at issue in <em>Kuklinska </em>and <em>Hahn.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, the crucial issue is whether the trial judge erred in ruling that the mere filing of a complaint to register land, based solely upon a claim of title by adverse possession, is not sufficient to clothe the plaintiff with \u201cowner of record\u201d status (as required by the board\u2019s regulations, note 5, <em>supra) </em>for purposes of applying for subdivision approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The defendant filed a complaint to register the property pursuant to G. L. c. 185. The effect of such a complaint, if allowed, is to vest title to the land in the petitioner, thereby making ownership certain and indefeasible. G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 1 <em>(\u00e1). Deacy </em>v. <em>Berberian, </em>344 Mass. 321, 328 (1964). Contrary to the board\u2019s contention, however, the mere act of filing a complaint for registration does not, in itself, affect the state of title. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 36. Here, the trust withdrew its registration complaint before the Land Court issued a final decree establishing title to the locus. Therefore, there was no sufficient basis upon which the trust could establish that it was the \u201crecord owner\u201d of the locus at the time it submitted the preliminary and definitive plans. Accordingly, the trust had no standing to apply for subdivision approval as of the dates the plans were submitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">2. The board argues that the trial judge erred as matter of law when it ruled that the board did not have the power to waive its regulation that the \u201cowner of record\u201d must sign its application forms and be present at the hearings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. While it is true that a planning board may, when appropriate, waive strict compliance with its rules and regulations, it may not do so unless such waiver \u201cis in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law.\u201d G. L. c 41, \u00a7 81R, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7. See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 440 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Chief among the policy concerns underlying the enactment of the Subdivision Control Law was to ensure the provision of \u201cadequate drainage, sewerage, and water facilities, without harmful effect to adjoining land and to the lots in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>subdivision.\u201d <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westport, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 170 (1990). See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M. One of the ways in which this objective is achieved by local planning boards is to secure a covenant from the \u201cowner of record\u201d which provides for the installation of adequate municipal services. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U. If the owners of record are not fully identified or if the planning board has been misled as to the record owners, the public would not be protected because the board would be unable to ensure that it would receive a properly executed covenant, or in the event of a modification or amendment of a plan approval, a properly executed consent. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81W. See <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Agawam, </em>358 Mass. 709, 715 (1971). Therefore, a waiver, as here, of the board\u2019s regulations which require the record owner to be the applicant for plan approval, or at a minimum to participate in the application process by executing forms B and C and appearing at the hearing, would undermine one of the principal aims of the statute. <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The locus, owned by the trust since 1962, abuts the Blue Rock golf course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">As will be seen, we are not faced with the question whether a planning board properly may allow filing of a preliminary plan by a person who expects to own but does not yet have record title.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The judge found that the trust had \u201capparently . . . acquired by deed dated May 11, 1987, . . . good record title to [only] a fractional interest, less than 7/28, in the locus.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Implicit in the court\u2019s reasoning in the <em>Kuklinska </em>decision was the determination that it is reasonable under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, for a planning board to require that an applicant be an owner of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Yarmouth planning board regulation \u00a7 III, par. 312, requires that the \u201cowner or his representative\u201d be present at the hearing. Section III, par. 332, requires that applicants for preliminary plan approval must submit \u201cForm B\u201d which in turn requires \u201cName of Owner of Record,\u201d a title reference from the Barnstable registry of deeds, and a \u201cSignature of Owner of Record.\u201d Section III, par. 333(b), requires that the preliminary plan must contain the \u201cnames and addresses of the record owner and the applicant,\u201d Section III, par.-341(a), states that the applicant must submit copies of a properly executed form C which requires the \u201cName of Owner of Record,\u201d a registry of deeds title reference, and \u201cSignature of Owner of Record.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 III, par-. 342(b); requires that the name of the \u201crecord owner\u201d be placed on the application for definitive plan approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We have no occasion to address the board\u2019s argument that the trust\u2019s subsequent purchase of a fractional interest in the locus relates back to the time the plans were filed, and thus is sufficient to confer \u201cowner of record\u201d status (see <em>Kuklinska, </em>357 Mass, at 129), because on the date the definitive plan was approved, the trust had title only t\u00f3 a portion of the locus. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The trial judge concluded that although the board never specifically waived these requirements of its regulations, \u201cit attempted to do so de facto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
