(CPI), had a contract with the Plymouth Housing Authority to build a housing complex for the elderly. The individual plaintiffs are the principal of CPI, John F. Gamache (Gamache), and his wife. The contract required CPI to carry builder\u2019s risk insurance. The defendant, Dobax Insurance Agency, Inc. (Dobax), is an insurance brokerage firm from whom CPI had purchased a builder\u2019s risk policy covering the Plymouth project while in the construction phase. The policy expired on March 31, 1986, before the project was completed. A fire on July 24, 1986, caused considerable damage to the project which, as of that date, still had not been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Having learned that it had no builder\u2019s risk insurance to cover the loss, the plaintiffs brought this action against Dobax claiming liability in tort, contract, and under G. L. c. 93A. Dobax moved for summary judgment, supporting its motion with a memorandum of law and Gamache\u2019s deposition. Concerning liability, the defendant relied on Gamache\u2019s deposition testimony that he had been informed by Warren Baxter, a principal in Dobax, that the policy would expire on March 31, 1986, and had not requested that Dobax renew the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dobax contended, therefore, that it had no duty to renew the policy. Alternatively, in support of its motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Dobax argued that, even if it was negligent, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by contributory negligence. In addition, Dobax asserted that there was no evidence of any actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The plaintiffs opposed the motion, relying on the same deposition and a supplemental affidavit of Gamache. In his affidavit, Gamache described the relationship of the parties. He stated that for several years prior to the fire CPI used Dobax exclusively to meet its insurance needs which were varied and included automobile, liability, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance in addition to surety bonding and builder\u2019s risk insurance. Gamache asserted that CPI relied on Dobax for advice and for obtaining proper coverage. Among other things, CPI relied on Dobax to renew policies as necessary, and often policies were renewed automatically by Dobax without consulting Gamache. Gamache stated, further, that Dobax\u2019s principals were familiar with CPI\u2019s business and were aware of CPI\u2019s reliance on Dobax.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Gamache confirmed in his affidavit that in mid-March, 1986, he had a brief conversation with Dobax\u2019s principal about the builder\u2019s risk policy. Gamache stated that in the course of that conversation he was informed of the March 31st expiration date, and he responded that the project would not be completed until at least mid-April. He stated, further, that nothing was said by either party to the conversation about renewal, but he assumed that Dobax would renew it. Gamache was never sent a copy of a letter from Dobax informing the insurer that the policy was not being renewed, and Gamache did not know that it had not been renewed until after the fire. In his deposition, Gamache stated that, in the past, he had received premium bills for renewals as late as four months after the effective date of the renewal. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory of damages was discussed in both Gamache\u2019s deposition and affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The judge allowed Dobax\u2019s motion for summary judgment, noting only, \u201cNo contract executed, no damages shown.\u201d We conclude, on the basis of the evidence before the motion judge, that there were material issues of fact as to common law liability in tort or contract as well as damages, but not as to the claim under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Although an insurance broker who is an agent for a client is generally bound to use due care in implementing the agency, see <em>Rayden Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Church, </em>337 Mass. 652, 660 (1958); <em>Rae </em>v. <em>Air Speed, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 187, 192 (1982), the broker ordinarily has no duty, absent a request from the client or an undertaking by the broker, to obtain insurance or to renew a policy about to expire. See <em>Gabrielson </em>v. <em>Warnemunde, </em>443 N.W.2d 540, 542 (Minn. 1989); <em>Stacy </em>v. <em>J.C. Montgomery Ins. Corp., </em>235 Va. 328, 331 (1988); 18 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 68.12, at 15 (Rhodes rev. 2d ed. 1983); 16A Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 8836, at 64, 69-71 (1981). \u201c[S]pedal circumstances of assertion, representation and reliance,\u201d <em>Rapp </em>v. <em>Lester L. Burdick, Inc., </em>336 Mass. 438, 442 (1957), however, may give rise to such a duty. See <em>Bicknell, Inc. </em>v. <em>Havlin, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 497, 501 (1980). 18 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 68.7, at 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>. &amp; n.10. Compare <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 659, 661 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We think the plaintiffs made a sufficient showing to raise a jury question as to the existence of such special circumstances in the present case. As background, we assume that the insurance needs of a company engaged in the construction business are complex. A jury could have inferred, we think, that, as a broker soliciting such a company\u2019s insurance business, Dobax was holding itself out as reasonably knowledgeable on the subject and efficient in securing necessary coverage. See <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass, at 662; 3 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 25.37, at 338 &amp; n.3, 339 (Rhodes rev. 2d ed. 1984). Further, there was evidence of the relevant circumstances, which a jury might believe, that for several years CPI dealt exclusively with Dobax to meet its extensive insurance needs and that often policies were renewed by Dobax automatically without consultation with CPI. The mid-March conversation must be considered in light of that background. Dobax contends that Gamache\u2019s failure, when informed of the March 31 expiration date, expressly to request that the builder\u2019s risk policy be renewed eliminated any obligation on its part to renew the policy. The plaintiffs contend, on the other hand, that, having informed Dobax that the project would not be completed by the expiration date, and not having been informed by Dobax that it would not renew the policy, they were reasonable in relying on Dobax to renew the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In our view, assuming the truthfulness of Gamache\u2019s affidavit, a jury could find that the plaintiffs\u2019 analysis of the effect of the conversation makes more sense. Having had builder\u2019s risk coverage all along during the project, it is unlikely that the plaintiffs would have elected to take the risk of loss by fire for the short period remaining for completion of the project. This is particularly so given the fact, known to Dobax, that CPI was bound by its contract with the Plymouth Housing Authority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to carry the insurance. Conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the information to Dobax that the project would not be complete by the expiration date of the policy could reasonably be construed in the circumstances as tantamount to a request to Dobax to renew the policy. Thus, in our view, a reasonable fact finder could conclude, in the special circumstances set forth in the Gamache affidavit, both that Dobax was negligent in failing to renew the policy and that CPI was reasonable in relying on Dobax to renew it. A triable issue as to liability, therefore, was shown. CPI may have been contributorily negligent, as Dobax contends, but, if so, the degree of such negligence would also be a question for the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We need not discuss damages at length. There is enough in the materials before the motion judge to justify a trial at least on the claim for the final $100,000 payment due CPI from the Plymouth Housing Authority, less any amount due subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We see nothing in the materials, however, to justify recovery under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, which make unlawful \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of . . . trade or commerce\u201d between two businesses. Although, in certain situations, liability under G. L. c. 93A may be based on negligence, see <em>MacGillivary </em>v. <em>W. Dana Bartlett Ins. Agency of Lexington, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 58-61 (1982); compare <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 193 (1990) (liability may be based on negligent breach of an implied warranty), \u201cnot every negligent act is unfair or deceptive and thus unlawful under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Bankers Life Co., </em>389 Mass. 345, 349 (1983). <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Here there is no claim of breach of any promise or warranty, or of deception. It is undisputed that Dobax orally informed the plaintiffs that the builder\u2019s risk policy was about to expire. To determine whether there was unfairness, \u201cwe must evaluate the equities between the parties,\u201d and a claimant\u2019s own conduct may be relevant to that evaluation. <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Banker\u2019s Life Co., </em>389 Mass, at 349. It is undisputed that, when told of the expiration date of the policy, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>tiffs did not expressly request that it be renewed, and they let months go by without inquiring about the premium bill. Nor is there any indication that Dobax sought any unfair advantage for itself by not renewing the policy. Thus, as to the G. L. c. 93A claim, we conclude that there has been no showing of a dispute as to any material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment for the defendant on the c. 93A claim, but we vacate the judgment for the defendant based upon the common law counts and order the case to stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\">The testimony as to the conversation was as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">Q. \u201cDid you talk to Warren Baxter at that meeting about the builder\u2019s risk policy for the Plymouth Housing Project?\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">A. \u201cThat was one of many, correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Q. \u201cYou told him that the project was substantially complete at that time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">A. \u201cI told Mr. Baxter on that particular policy that I had four to five weeks left on the project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Q. \u201cAnd he told you that it was coming up for renewal at the end of the month?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">A. \u201cHe told me it was coming up for renewal, correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">Q. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to say that you asked him not to renew the policy?\u201d A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">Q. \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">A. \u201cI told him I had four or five weeks left on the project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-13\">Q. \u201cWhat did you say about the renewal of the project policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-14\">A. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-15\">Q. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-16\">A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-17\">Q. \u201cDid he ever talk to you about renewing the policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-18\">A. \u201cNo. That was it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-19\">Q. \u201cDid he ever talk to you about not renewing the policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-20\">A. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-21\">Q. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say either way?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-22\">A. \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-23\">Q. \u201cYou also did not ask him to renew the policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-24\">A. \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Dobax also knew that the Gamaches were bound as indemnitors under the surety bond to carry such insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
