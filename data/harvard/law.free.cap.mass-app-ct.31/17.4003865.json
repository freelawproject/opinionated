G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The defendant alleges error in (1) the admission of statements made by the defendant during the performance of field sobriety tests, (2) the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument, (3) police testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct during his apprehension, and (4) an officer\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s prior arrest record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We recount the pertinent testimony as-it developed at trial. Officer Arthur Tainsey of the Fall River police department testified that in the early morning hours of October 11, 1987, he and several other officers were in their cruisers at a parking lot just across the street from a nightclub in the downtown area. They observed from about 120 feet away a small, dark, \u201cDatsun 280Z-type\u201d vehicle pass by at a high rate of speed. Officer Tainsey and Sergeant Morrisette, traveling in separate cruisers, followed. They saw the vehicle stop at a red light. When the light turned green, the driver \u201cspun his wheels\u201d before making a right turn. The officers activated their blue lights, and the automobile pulled over to the side of the road. According to Officer Tainsey\u2019s testimony, there were three people in the car, the defendant, who was driving, and two passengers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *SWhen the officers approached the defendant to ask him for his license and registration, they detected the odor of alcohol. They asked him to step outside. On the way to the rear of the vehicle, the defendant was unsteady on his feet. His speech was \u201crunning together and it wasn\u2019t very coherent.\u201d When Officer Tainsey asked the defendant whether he had consumed any alcohol, he responded, *\u2018No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The officers brought the defendant over to the sidewalk and asked him to perform a number of field sobriety tests. First, Officer Tainsey asked him to walk a straight line, heel to toe, for a distance of ten to twelve feet. The defendant was unable to stay on the line, and staggered off to the side. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Tainsey next requested that the defendant recite the alphabet. He made it as far as the letter \u201cP,\u201d stopped, and could not continue. When the defendant was unable to perform the final test, a balancing and counting exercise, Officer Tainsey formed the opinion that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Officer Tainsey described the defendant\u2019s demeanor in the booking room at the police station as \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d He was \u201cswinging his arms\u201d and had to be restrained a couple of times. The booking officer, William Almeda, confirmed that the defendant was unsteady on his feet and had to be assisted to maintain his balance. He also detected a \u201cvery strong odor of liquor emanating from [the defendant\u2019s] breath.\u201d When the officer asked him routine booking questions, the defendant \u201cstarted to scream and yell\u201d and refused to answer. His speech was slurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The defendant called three witnesses who had been with him for very brief periods earlier in the evening and who had not observed the defendant drink anything or did not recall any odor of alcohol. Steve Arruda, a passenger in the defendant\u2019s car, testified that the defendant appeared clear-headed during the ten or fifteen minutes he was in the car with the defendant before they were pulled over and that the defendant had had nothing to drink during this time. He acknowledged that the defendant failed to complete the last two field sobriety tests but stated that the defendant performed the first test satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">1. <em>The Miranda issue. </em>In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 461 (1966), the Supreme Court formulated a series of prophylactic rules designed to \u201csecure the privilege against self-incrimination\u201d from overreaching and coercion during custodial interrogation. Custodial interrogation has been defined as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984), quoting from <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 444. The defendant contends that because his recitation of the alphabet and his number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>counting during the field sobriety tests were incriminatory and resulted from custodial interrogation, the police were required to administer Miranda warnings before initiating their probe. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Under both Federal and State constitutional analysis, persons temporarily detained pursuant to routine traffic stops are not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440 (1984). <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Bruder, </em>488 U.S. 9, 11 (1988). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNelley, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 985, 986 (1990). The <em>Berkemer </em>case, <em>supra, </em>sets out the logic behind the rule: the detention of a motorist pursuant to a routine traffic stop is presumptively temporary, as well as public. <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. at 435-442.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNelley, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The circumstances in this case substantially parallel those of the roadside questioning in <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra </em>at 435-442. The stop on the road was of brief duration,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see <em>id. </em>at 441; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 605-606 (1982), and it took place in the public view. <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra </em>at 442. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNelley, supra </em>at 986, 987 (where the inquiry took place at 3:10 a.m. on a public street, no Miranda warnings were required). There were no other significant factors to suggest a coercive environment. Indeed, the defendant had two passengers (or at least one; see note 3, <em>supra), </em>presumably sympathetic witnesses. The fact that the defendant was not free to leave (at least until the performance of the field sobriety tests) did not render the interrogation custodial. <em>Id. </em>at 986. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, </em>377 Mass. 339, 343 (1979). Because the defendant\u2019s freedom of action was not curtailed</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>to the degree associated with formal arrest, <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. at 440,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude that the encounter was not custodial. The defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to his performance of the field sobriety tests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In this case, we need not resolve the propriety of the officer\u2019s requiring the defendant to recite the alphabet, count numbers, and respond to questions regarding alcohol consumption because we have determined that the defendant was not subjected to a custodial interrogation. However, we do not discount the possibility that in future cases circumstances may arise which trigger the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Bruder, </em>488 U.S. at 11 n.3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">2. <em>Comments on the defendant\u2019s silence. </em>The defendant contends that certain statements contained in the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument and in the testimony of Officers Tainsey and Almeda represented prohibited comment on the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent and that the cumulative effect of the errors requires reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>a. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s opening. </em>Included in the prosecutor\u2019s opening was the following: \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear testimony from one other police officer who was present in the [booking] room .... He\u2019s going to describe the defendant\u2019s demeanor. . . . He\u2019s going to tell you exactly what he did in that booking room and describe his conduct, how he resisted the officers, wouldn\u2019t cooperate one bit in the booking process.\u201d At the conclusion of the argument, defense counsel moved for a mistrial or, alternatively, a curative instruction. He maintained that because the defendant was in custody at the booking room, had received the Miranda warnings, and was under no obligation to say . anything, the prosecutor should not have alluded to the defendant\u2019s lack of \u201ccooperation.\u201d We agree with the judge that the comment was \u201cimproper,\u201d but \u201cnot fatal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As a general rule, counsel is \u201cfree to state in his opening anything that he expects to be able to prove by evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>381 Mass. 13, 15 (1980). The Commonwealth presented evidence of obstreperous behavior by the defendant during his booking such that he had to be restrained. He was described as \u201cwild,\u201d \u201cvery aggressive,\u201d and as \u201cswinging his arms.\u201d In these circumstances, the jury would not have interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s remark that the defendant \u201cwouldn\u2019t cooperate one bit in the booking process\u201d as suggesting that the defendant refused to answer questions during the booking; rather, it was much more likely understood by them as a comment on the defendant\u2019s general demeanor. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 223-224 (1983) (remark was \u201ca vague and fleeting comment, not likely to influence, or even to seize the attention of the jury\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 344-346, <em>S.C., </em>401 Mass. 302 (1987). In these circumstances, the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and his subsequent request for a curative instruction. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crichlow, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902-903 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">b. <em>Testimony of police witnesses. </em>In his testimony on direct examination, Officer Almeda described the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>behavior as \u201cvery, very wild at times\u201d and stated that when he made inquiries of the defendant, \u201c[the defendant] started' to scream and yell [at him] and he refused to answer . . . any questions.\u201d When defense counsel moved to strike, the judge responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll strike the refusal to answer any questions. A defendant in a police situation such as this has certain rights that he need not answer questions. I\u2019m only going to strike, however, the fact that he refused to answer certain questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Officer Tainsey testified that the defendant, upon being asked for arrest sheet information at the booking room, \u201cwasn\u2019t very cooperative.\u201d The judge struck this testimony, stating that it was for the jury to decide. Shortly thereafter, the officer remarked that the police \u201chad to take [the defendant\u2019s] information from the prior arrest card because he wouldn\u2019t give [them] the information.\u201d Defense counsel promptly moved to strike, and the judge delivered the contemporaneous instruction which appears in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Because of their direct reference to the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer questions, the officers\u2019 statements were \u201creasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on [the silence of the defendant]\u201d and were, as such, improper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571 (1976), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69 (1954). Officer Tainsey\u2019s reference to the prior arrest record was particularly unfortunate because evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record is not generally admissible in a trial where the defendant does not take the stand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>400 Mass. 612, 620 (1987). However, we disagree with the defendant that the judge\u2019s instruction was inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>quote to cure the prejudice to the defendant. The judge\u2019s instruction on the remark by Officer Tainsey was forceful, sufficiently so in our opinion to dissipate any prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass, at 224. \u201cJurors are expected to follow instructions to disregard matters withdrawn from their consideration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 228 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 668 (1982). Finally, the officers\u2019 passing comments were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt due to the strength of the evidence as to the defendant\u2019s intoxication. The jury had learned of the defendant\u2019s failure to perform three sobriety tests and were warranted in finding that his ability to drive had been impaired. They had heard testimony concerning his belligerent behavior at the police station and the incoherence of his speech. The predominant impression left with the jury was that the defendant was acting out in an acutely physical manner and not that he refused to answer booking questions. The defendant was not denied a fair trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>369 Mass. 332, 340-341 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>400 Mass, at 620-621.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">3. <em>Cumulative prejudice. </em>None of the asserted errors, taken individually, warrants reversal, nor do the claimed errors, taken cumulatively, require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\">The judge sentenced the defendant to a term of two years in a house of correction, ordered fifteen months to be served, and suspended the balance with probation for five years.

In those circumstances, the motorist will be entitled to the \u201cfull panoply of protections prescribed by <em>Miranda.\u201d Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Officer Tainsey testified on cross-examination that the stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle took place at about 1:15 a.m. Officer Almeda testified that the defendant was brought into the police station for booking at 1:30 A.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The court in <em>Berkemer </em>(at 439) observed that \u201cthe usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called <em>\u2018Terry </em>stop,\u2019 see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), than to a formal arrest.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 437-439.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We do not address any contention based on art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The defendant did not raise such a claim at trial, nor did he mention art. 12 in his brief in support of his motion for a new trial. Because the defendant failed to argue the State claim separately from the Federal claim, we need not reach it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 98-99 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Roadside sobriety tests merely requiring a defendant to exhibit his physical coordination, or lack thereof, are not testimonial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>386 Mass. 772, 779 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 339, 340-341 (1988). However, \u201c[w]henever a suspect is asked for a response requiring him to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief, the suspect confronts the \u2018trilemma\u2019 of truth, falsity, or silence and hence the response (whether based on truth or falsity) contains a' testimonial component.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 552, 597 (1990). Future challenges, then, should focus on the nature of the alleged custodial circumstances, and, if raised, on whether police field inquiries impermissibly reveal the defendant\u2019s thought processes. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 592-600 (where police compelled the defendant to calculate the date of his sixth birthday, his inability to do so was testimonial in nature).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a reference by the officer to a prior arrest. That is totally improper for you to consider any background of this gentleman, for whatever reason, for whatever the arrest might have been. We don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know. You are to decide this case on the evidence that is permissibly entered in this case and only what you hear here today. You cannot judge anybody on their past actions or what you might think their future actions might be. You are solemnly bound to decide this case on the evidence that I allow to go before you. And I am instructing you now that any reference to a prior arrest is improper for you to consider at all. I want you to understand that now.
