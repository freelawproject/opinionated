Coyle, an employee of the city of Waltham (city), was injured when he and several fellow employees attempted to repair a broken overhead garage door in the city\u2019s maintenance garage. Coyle, together with his wife and children, brought suit against Cliff Compton, Inc. (Cliff), the manufacturer of the door, and the city. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Cliff, derived from allegations of negligence and breach of warranty, were for Coyle\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>injuries and for the lost consortium and parental companionship of Coyle\u2019s wife and children. The claims against the city by Coyle\u2019s wife and children were limited to the loss of consortium and parental companionship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In response to the complaint, Cliff filed a cross-claim against the city seeking contribution from it as a joint tortfeasor under G. L. c. 23IB in the event Cliff was found liable on the consortium claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The city responded by filing a cross claim against Cliff, alleging negligence and breach of warranty, and seeking reimbursement from Cliff for all workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid Coyle under G. L. c. 152, and indemnity on the consortium claims. Immediately before the trial began, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal of their claims against the city \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The jury, replying to special questions, found that Cliff was not negligent and not in breach of any warranty. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied, and the plaintiffs claimed an appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal argument is that Cliff\u2019s opening statement to the jury was prejudicial error requiring a new trial. Cliff\u2019s counsel told the jury that he was going to tell them his understanding of \u201csome\u201d of the law in Massachusetts, \u201c[a]nd that is, in Massachusetts a person such as Mr. Coyle is unable to sue his employer or his fellow employees in cases such as this. They are immune from suit. Mr. Coyle . . . has chosen to sue the only party that is now susceptible of suit in this case, which is Cliff Compton. So bear that in mind when you listen to the parties and to the testimony.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected at the conclusion of the opening, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 458 (1978) (argument of opposing counsel need not be interrupted), and the judge instructed the jury that statements of counsel were not evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">There is strength to the argument that counsel\u2019s remarks could be understood by the jury to mean that Coyle had available the relief provided by the workers\u2019 compensation law of Massachusetts. If they were so understood, the jury might also conclude that a verdict favorable to the plaintiffs would be a second recovery by Coyle for the same injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At stake in counsel\u2019s remarks, then, was possible prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Reference to a collateral source of recovery such as workers\u2019 compensation \u2014 its existence or nonexistence \u2014 in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>action for negligence is \u201can immaterial proposition freighted with innuendo. . . .\u201d <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Gontarz, </em>364 Mass. 800, 810 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was for this reason that the court in <em>Gold-stein </em>instructed the bar and the bench that when \u201cit appears that the question of the mention of coverage will arise in a serious way, counsel where feasible should consult beforehand with the judge as to how the matter should be handled. . . . We welcome careful, cooperative efforts by counsel and trial judges. . . .\u201d <em>Goldstein supra </em>at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Coyle\u2019s counsel, obedient to the instructions of the court in <em>Goldstein, </em>saw the problem in advance and brought it to the attention of the judge by a motion in limine which sought to prevent any reference to Coyle\u2019s compensation benefits. The judge did not act \u2014 as he should have \u2014 on the motion, but the' plaintiffs did not object, and the case proceeded to trial. Further, the curative instructions given by the judge following the plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the opening remarks \u2014 that statements of counsel are not evidence \u2014 hardly met <em>Gold-stein's </em>requirement that there be an \u201cexplanation and clarification\u201d of the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Id. </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Difficulties on this branch of the case increased as the trial progressed. At the charge conference Cliff\u2019s counsel sought the judge\u2019s approval of his opening comment to the jury. He asked the judge, \u201c[I]s the court going to instruct the jury with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s inability under Chapter 152 to sue the city of Waltham, or are we going to just let that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>dangle?\u201d The judge replied, \u201cI think I\u2019m inclined to just let that dangle. If I say anything about it, I\u2019m going to have to go on and say that he\u2019ll have to return to the city whatever they\u2019ve paid him, but there\u2019s no evidence of what they'paid him. I\u2019d prefer to just stay away from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">At this point plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said that the problem under discussion was caused by counsel\u2019s opening statement, to which the plaintiffs had objected. Cliff\u2019s counsel was unrepentant: \u201cI brought it [i.e., the city\u2019s immunity] up, of course I did, of course I did.\u201d The judge then made the comment, \u201cYes, yes, I regret that you did that, frankly, but what\u2019s done is done.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge, in his instructions, let the matter \u201cdangle.\u201d There was no objection by the plaintiffs, and the case went to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The jury, not surprisingly, returned with the following questions: \u201cWhat is the relationship of the city of Waltham to this case? . . . What we need to know is who the defendants are. Are Cliff Compton and city of Waltham codefendants?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel urged the judge 'to respond by describing the relationship of the city to the case. The judge said, \u201cWell, they don\u2019t need to know that. They don\u2019t really need to know \u2014 I think it\u2019s beyond that. I told you, I think they\u2019re really concerned about workmen\u2019s comp.\u201d Thereupon the judge decided he would respond by saying \u201cThe city is not a codefendant, it is a third-party defendant.\u201d There was no objection by the plaintiffs. Later that day the jury, in response to special questions, responded that the defendant was not negligent and had committed no breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">There is little doubt that, in failing to act on the motion in limine, the judge did not abide by <em>Goldstein. </em>Had he done so, Cliff\u2019s opening remarks doubtless would not have been made, and the ensuing problems that dogged the trial would not have arisen. Nevertheless, assuming the judge\u2019s failure was error, a new trial may not be ordered if the error \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 829 (1974). See also G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132. Further, a decision denying a motion for a new trial will not be reversed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Welsh Mfg. Co., </em>382 Mass. 340, 343 (1981). <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 660, 664-665 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Here the questionable remarks occurred only in counsel\u2019s opening statement to the jury and were followed by a customary, if not entirely satisfactory, curative instruction. There was no further reference to the subject either in the examination of witnesses or in counsel\u2019s summation. Contrast <em>Goldstein, </em>364 Mass, at 812 (\u201cNot only was the point made at the opening; it was rubbed in by testimony of the plaintiff himself, with the judge lending his approval by overruling a specific objection to it\u201d). Moreover the plaintiffs\u2019 case was thin \u2014 this was a seven year old overhead garage door in obvious need of repair \u2014 and the jury squarely answered the specific questions concerning the defendant\u2019s culpability in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The likelihood of material prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s cause in these circumstances was remote. The judge, as noted above, was not unmindful of the possible danger, but in considering the matter he concluded that the \u201cevidence [was] not sufficient to show extraneous material tainted the verdict.\u201d The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. See <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 664 (\u201cOur deference to the trial judge\u2019s role on these motions recognizes the historical antecedents of the power, as well as the principle that its wise exercise is not in derogation of the right of a trial by jury but is one of the historical safeguards of the right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Finally the plaintiffs argue that the exclusion of opinion testimony concerning standards of installation of overhead doors in 1977 asked of one Gary Scalese, a person in the business of installing and repairing overhead garage doors, was reversible error. The judge ruled that the jury had no need of the information. There was no error. \u201cWhere a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ter may easily be comprehended by jurors the testimony of an expert has no place.\u201d <em>Turcotte </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>332 Mass. 160, 165 (1955). In any event the trial judge has wide discretion in such matters. <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>341 Mass. 252, 261 (1960). Further, on cross-examination by the city of Waltham, Scalese testified that he was not aware of any standards for safe installation in 1977.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Claims against an employer for loss of consortium and parental companionship became largely unavailable after December 10, 1985, when St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 35, amending G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, became effective. See St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 67. Coyle\u2019s date of injury was May 11, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Cliff was not entitled to any contribution or indemnity from the city in respect of Coyle\u2019s claims arising out of his injuries. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 526-527 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">It is necessary to comment on the faulty posture of this case as it proceeded to trial. First, the city was not entitled to assert a cross-claim against Cliff for reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to Coyle under G. L. c. 152. That claim was, by statute, in the hands of Coyle, who had already filed suit for the benefit of the city, to the extent of benefits paid by it to Coyle, and for the benefit of Coyle as to the excess, if any. Section 15 of c. 152 (1988 ed.) provides that <em>\u201cfe]ither </em>the employee <em>or </em>insurer [i.e., the city] may proceed <em>to </em>enforce the liability\u201d of a third party (emphasis added). While this provision may well stimulate an undesirable \u201crace to the courthouse,\u201d in order to control the litigation see Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 669 (2d ed. 1981), it is nonetheless the law, and in this case, Coyle had won that race.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Second, Cliff was not entitled to seek contribution from the city on the consortium claims once the plaintiffs had dismissed their consortium claims against the city with prejudice. G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 4(6). Assuming this stipulation to have been in good faith \u2014 as we must, given the circumstance of its having been filed with the approval of the trial judge \u2022\u2014 the effect of that stipulation was to deprive Cliff of any right of contribution. <em>Ibid. Grace </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1081 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Thus the city should have been, but was not, dismissed as a party to the proceedings prior to trial (but preserving its rights to be heard in the event of a proposed settlement \u2014 see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15), thereby disposing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>the cross claims between the city and Cliff. The end result was that Cliff prosecuted its claims for contribution against the city and defended the city\u2019s claim against it \u2014 thereby contributing substantially to the jury\u2019s confusion. See note 8, <em>infra, </em>and related text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">The innuendo of possible double recovery, if believed, would have been false; Coyle would be entitled to keep only the excess of any recovery, after deducting the priority payment to the city to reimburse it for all benefits it had paid to Coyle. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1988 ed.) (\u201cThe sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the insurer, unless such sum is greater than that paid by it to the employee, in which event the excess shall be retained by or paid to the employee\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">On this point \u2014 the so-called collateral source rule \u2014 the law of Massachusetts is especially stern. In <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Gontarz, </em>364 Mass. 800 (1974), the court held, after a detailed discussion of the subject at 807-814, that the nonreceipt of workers\u2019 compensation, interjected by the plaintiff in a negligence action, is prejudicial to the defendant requiring a new trial unless \u201cin some way palliated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. The palliative is a \u201cstrong, even-handed explanation and clarification of the workmen\u2019s compensation problem . . . from the judge,\u201d <em>Goldstein supra </em>at 811. For a case involving prejudice to the plaintiff, see <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 665 (1980). (\u201cTh[e] insinuation of the existence of a possible collateral source of recovery [absent prior approval by the judge] . . . is squarely condemned by our cases [citations omitted].\u201d) For an important exception to the collateral source rule see <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 16-20 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury did indeed stay away from the city\u2019s immunity, other than to comment on the sp\u00e9cial questions to the jury which inquired whether employees of the city were negligent, and, if so, whether their negligence was the cause of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The appeal of Waltham need not be considered for the reasons stated in note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
