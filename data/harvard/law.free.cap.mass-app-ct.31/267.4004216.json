L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B) and one count of simple assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A). The judge found the defendant guilty on one of the counts of indecent assault and battery. The other he dismissed as duplicative, and he dismissed the count of simple assault and battery as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The defendant appealed his conviction to the District Court jury-of-six session. There the somewhat uncertain evidence, taken most favorably to the Commonwealth, tended to show that the defendant, a bus driver, during a twenty-minute period when he was driving the victim, a five year old handicapped child, from summer school, to home, slapped the child across the face several times and touched his penis. The judge, with the defendant\u2019s consent, instructed the jury that they could return a verdict of guilty either of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen or, alternatively, of simple assault and battery, as a lesser included offense. The jury did the latter, and the defendant appeals his conviction of simple assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We held, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eaton, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 113, 118 (1974), that simple assault and battery was a lesser offense included within the greater, statutory offense defined in \u00a7 13B. The element of lack of consent was considered specifically in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480 (1983), which held (at 484-488) that such nonconsent <em>was </em>one of the elements of indecent assault and battery on a child. It implicitly rejected a contention that such batteries fall, as matter of law, within the class of physically harmful batteries which are unlawful regardless of consent. <em>Id. </em>at 481-484. (Batteries of that type are \u201c[a]ny touching [s] \u2018with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 482, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 620 [1948].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">By St. 1986, c. 187, the Legislature amended \u00a7 13B to exclude lack of consent as an element of the crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It follows that a complaint framed, like this one, in the language of \u00a7 13B after the effective date of the 1986 amendment does not allege either lack of consent or a physically harmful touching. It further follows that a simple assault and battery (\u00a7 13A), which requires proof of an actually or potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>physically harmful touching or of an unconsented touching <em>(Burke, </em>390 Mass, at 483-484), is not a lesser included offense within the statutory offense of indecent assault and battery of a child after the 1986 redefinition.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The defendant\u2019s conviction of an offense not alleged in the complaint cannot stand. The point is probably jurisdictional, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 14 (1986); if not, it must be treated as a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 379, 382 (1981)(a case indistinguishable in principle from the present case). In either event, the defendant\u2019s consent to the lesser included offense instruction in the trial court is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The jury having declined to find the defendant guilty of indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen, we must reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and direct that judgment enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The amendment added to \u00a7 13B the following paragraph: \u201cIn a prosecution under this section, a child under the age of fourteen years shall be deemed incapable of consenting to any conduct of the defendant for which said defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
