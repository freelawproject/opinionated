L. c. 271, \u00a7 17. The conviction on the gaming indictment was alleged and proved to be Brisson\u2019s second infraction within a five-year period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>On appeal, Brisson challenges both the denial of his motion to suppress evidence and the constitutionality of the statutory scheme under which he was sentenced. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">1. <em>The motion to suppress. </em>Before trial, Brisson moved to suppress all items seized during a search of his home pursuant to a warrant. The motion hearing centered on one issue: whether the search of Brisson\u2019s house was unlawful because the officers failed to \u201cknock and announce\u201d themselves before entering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsidiary findings of fact made by a motion judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, will be accepted, and we will not interject our judgment absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moon, 380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980), and cases cited. The evidence before the hearing judge consisted of testimony from each of those present at Brisson\u2019s home on the night in question. The facts culled from their testimony and the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">At about 6:30 p.m. on December 21, 1987, State Troopers Ronald A. Ford and Heather Crowley, undercover agents in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>vestigating gaming and narcotics activities, met outside Brisson\u2019s single family residence in Leominster. FBI Special Agent John E. Kszystyniak, Jr., assisted. Standing on the rear porch, Ford knocked several times on the glass storm door. Brisson, his sister, his wife, her son, a social guest, and the family dog were all inside the house. Having received no response to his knock, Ford glanced into the house and saw no one. He announced \u201cin a very loud voice, . . . \u2018State police, I have a search warrant, open the door.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">At this point, we necessarily digress from the officers\u2019 undertaking to the simultaneous activity of FBI Special Agent Arthur Ryall. Suspicious that the Brisson gaming operation extended to a second suspect residing in the town of South-bridge, Ryall was listening in on court-ordered wiretaps at both locations. On the day in question, the officers orchestrated the execution of the search warrants at both sites in such a way so as to intercept Brisson as he was transmitting \u201csomething of value,\u201d see G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, to the South-bridge suspect. As Ford and the other officers were entering the BrissOn residence, Ryall overheard Brisson making an outgoing call, followed by a facsimile transmission. At the motion hearing, Ryall stated that \u201cthe first indication I had that Trooper Ford or somebody was inside, was the words \u2018State police.\u2019 \u201d Immediately before the announcement, Ryall heard a dog bark increasingly louder.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We note the barking because none of the occupants, including Brisson, recalled so much as a whimper from the dog. The gist of their testimony was that the officers burst into the house without warning and seized the facsimile machine, facsimile paper sheets, and $3,350 in cash. The motion judge resolved the \u201ccurious incident of the dog\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in finding that the background noise in the house \u2014 which also included a whirring facsimile machine and two running televisions \u2014 may have drowned out the hue and cry of the police. The judge concluded that the officers properly knocked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>announced their presence and purpose before executing the warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Brisson suggests that, once he has provided credible testimony that the search warrant was not executed properly, the burden shifts to the Commonwealth to convince the judge that the police knocked and announced or that exigent circumstances spared them the requirement. To buttress this novel position, Brisson attempts an analogy to cases which hold that the Commonwealth has a similar burden of proof in justifying a warrantless entry into a home, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sumerlin, </em>393 Mass. 127, 128-129 n.l (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1193 (1985), a consent search, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 680-681 (1981), or the voluntariness of a confession after a preliminary showing of coercion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 151-152, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). In these cases, the Commonwealth shoulders the burden on the narrow ground that warrantless searches and involuntary confessions are presumptively infirm and, thus, unconstitutional. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 57 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>375 Mass. 284, 288 (1978). The \u201cknock and announce\u201d standard, on the other hand, is not constitutionally required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>408 Mass. 43, 45 (1990). As such, we see no reason in this case to stray from the general rule that, in disputing the validity of a search pursuant to a warrant, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the incriminating evidence was illegally obtained. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass, at 56. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fudge, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 382, 385 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Finally, even if we were to assume that the Commonwealth was charged with the burden of proof, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the judge\u2019s conclusions would have been different. The resolution of the conflicting testimony was for the motion judge to determine, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>402 Mass. 775, 780 (1988), and we choose not to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">2. <em>The constitutionality of G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10. </em>Brisson was convicted of bookmaking under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17. As proved by the Commonwealth and stipulated to by Brisson, this was his second felony conviction under \u00a7 17 within five years. As a result, he fell under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10, the provision for second or subsequent offenders, which requires that upon a second offense the defendant receive both a prison term and a fine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial judge sentenced Brisson under \u00a7 10 to three months in a house of correction and imposed a fine of $1,000. Directing our attention to a number of purported \u201cinconsistencies\u201d between the sentencing provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>G. L, c. 271, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 17, Brisson contends that \u00a7 10 is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">First, Brisson argues that, because \u00a7 17 provides for either a fine <em>or </em>a prison term, the penalties under \u00a7 10 are inconsistent in that they mandate both a fine <em>and </em>imprisonment. The two sections are not contradictory; rather, \u00a7 10 is an entirely separate provision which only applies to enhance penalties for repeat offenders. The Legislature may make classifications which result in disparate treatment where there is a legitimate objective to punish certain crimes or to enhance punishment for second offenses. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 912 (1976) (carrying a firearm); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>389 Mass. 316, 323-324 (1983) (driving under the influence). Here, there is no fatal ambiguity in the sentencing scheme, only a harsher result for the second-time offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Brisson\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567 (1982), does not serve his argument. The <em>Gagnon </em>court struck down as void for vagueness the penalty clause of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(a), finding the statute to be internally inconsistent. The measure for gouging the constitutionality of a sentencing scheme, the court said, is whether the defendant is \u201crequired at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, quoting from <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). Here, the fact that the mandatory prison term under \u00a7 10 may not exceed one year, while under \u00a7 17 the judge may sentence the first-time offender to a maximum term of three years in the State prison, does not change our result. The statutory scheme under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 17, clearly provides notice as to the potential penalties for violation of each section. Contrast <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 573.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\">The judge sentenced Brisson in accordance with G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1967, c. 189, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever, within five years after being convicted of any offence mentioned in section . . . seventeen . . . commits the like offence, or any other of the offences therein mentioned, <em>shall, in addition </em>to the fine therein provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>be punished by imprisonment for <em>not less than three months nor more than one year, </em>and the sentence imposing . . . such imprisonment shall not be suspended\u201d (emphasis added). The applicable provision of G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, as amended through St. 1968, c. 116, is as follows: \u201cWhoever keeps a building or room, or any part thereof, or occupies, or is found in, any place, way, public or private, park or parkway, or any open space, public or private, or any portion thereof, with apparatus, books or any device, for registering bets, or buying or selling pools, upon the result of a trial or contest of skill, speed or endurance of man, beast, bird or machine, or upon the result of a game . . .; or, being the owner, lessee or occupant of a building or room, or part thereof, or private grounds, knowingly permits the same to be used or occupied for any such purpose, or therein keeps, exhibits, uses or employs, or knowingly permits to be therein kept, exhibited, used or employed, any device or apparatus for registering such bets, or for buying or selling such pools,. . . shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years, or in jail or the house of correction for not more than two and one half years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The motion judge was the same judge who convicted Brisson at the jury-waived trial. The warrant did not contain a \u201cno knock\u201d provision, as is generally required for an unannounced entry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, </em>387 Mass. 413, 417 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">See Doyle, Silver Blaze, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, as compiled in the Complete Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, at 397 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The record shows that there were many inconsistencies in the testimony at the motion hearing, and the accuracy of all the witnesses\u2019 recollections concerning the police entry was dubious. Brisson\u2019s sister\u2019s physical limitations became a factor as she was closest to the storm door and could not clearly remember the night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Other jurisdictions have placed the burden of proof squarely on the defendant in similar circumstances. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vigo, </em>413 F.2d 691, 693 (5th Cir. 1969) (\u201cThe warrant stands cloaked with a presumption of validity .... The appellant had the burden of proof in challenging the validity of its execution or service\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>635 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>436, 441 (5th Cir. 1981) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carangelo, </em>151 N.J. Super. 138, 151 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>98 Wis. 2d 367, 376 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In 1957, a special commission of the Legislature filed a report of its recommendations for legislation concerning organized gambling activities. See Report of the Special Commission Revived and Continued for the Purpose of Investigating Organized Crime and Other Related Matters, Senate No. 700 (1957). The commission concluded that, \u201cwhatever the reasons may be, mandatory jail sentences are needed if the anti-lottery laws are to effect the purpose for which they were passed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179. Acting on this recommendation, the Legislature enacted St. 1957, c. 390, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10, adding a three-month mandatory house of correction sentence for second offenders. See note 1 <em>supra. </em>Since all of the specific gaming offenses enumerated under the cognate statute, G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, carried only a house of correction penalty, the amendment was consistent with the legislative scheme then in place. Later, in 1968, the Legislature increased the penalties for first offenders under \u00a7 17, by enhancing the penalty to punishment \u201cin the state prison for not more than three years, or in jail or the house of correction for not more than two and one-half years.\u201d See St. 1968, c. 116. Nothing in that amendment precludes a judge from suspending the sentence without regard to whether a State prison sentence is imposed. As there was no corresponding amendment to \u00a7 10, it is conceivable that a first offender could receive a more severe State prison sentence in the event a judge elected not to suspend its execution in whole or in part under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Brisson also alleges inconsistency between G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10, and G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1, the statute which affords the trial judge discretion to suspend a sentence when the defendant is given either a prison term or a fine. General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 1A, provides for suspension where the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tence comprehends imprisonment <em>and </em>a fine; however, the section is clear that the judge has no discretion to suspend the sentence where the conviction is a second felony offense. See also G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 11. Because Brisson was a second-time offender, the judge was required under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 10, to sentence him to both imprisonment and a fine. As such, Brisson fell under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1A, and not G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1. Pursuant to G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1A, the judge could not have suspended the sentence, nor would the defendant have been entitled to the benefits of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
