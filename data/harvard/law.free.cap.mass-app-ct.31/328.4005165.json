He claims that the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to establish probable cause for the search and also claims that he was entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing <em>(Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 [1978]) because of misstatements contained in the affidavit. While the question whether the affidavit in sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>port of the warrant established probable cause under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution is close, we conclude that the allegations were sufficient. We also conclude that the alleged misstatements did not entitle the defendant to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We state the facts as contained in the affidavit, dated March 12, 1987, which was prepared by Officer Bruce Malenfant of the Massachusetts State police. Included was information gathered by two other law enforcement officers who had spoken to a confidential informant, Mrs. Doe. Mrs. Doe had not previously given information to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">On or about February 12, 1987, Malenfant. learned from Officer Markowicz of the East Bridgewater police department that Mrs. Doe had said that a Richard Harris of East Bridgewater was making weekly runs from East Bridgewater to Middleborough to pick up cocaine. Harris was using a gray Buick Skyhawk automobile and a yellow Ford pickup truck for these trips. Subsequent investigation showed that both of these cars were registered to members of Harris\u2019s family and at the same address in East Bridgewater. Mrs. Doe also informed Officer Markowicz that, in the past several weeks, she had been at the Middleborough residence of a man whose first name was Lee and that she had observed cocaine distributed from that residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Sergeant Bruce Gordon of the Plymouth County \u201cCPAC Narcotic Unit\u201d also spoke with Mrs. Doe. On February 12, she showed Gordon the residence where she, several weeks earlier, had seen cocaine being distributed. It was located at Two Thomas Street in Middleborough and was where, the police subsequently ascertained, the defendant Lee Gates lived with his wife. Mrs. Doe told Gordon that the operator of a black Fiero automobile was also \u201cheavily involved\u201d in the distribution of cocaine at the Thomas Street address. Gordon, while at Two Thomas' Street on February 12, observed a black Fiero parked in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Checks with the Registry of Motor Vehicles and other sources revealed that the black Fiero was registered to Harvey Flashman, that Flashman had been arrested for posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>sion of Class B and Class D substances, and that Harris had been arrested for narcotics violations. Lee Gates had a long criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Police investigation and surveillance of Gates\u2019s residence revealed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">February 13, 1987: Malenfant saw Roger Parent leave the residence. Parent was known to Malenfant, as he had executed a search warrant two and a half years before at Parent\u2019s house. There, he had found marihuana plants, cocaine, assorted drug paraphernalia, and slips of paper on which the name \u201cLee\u201d appeared next to notations which, in Malenfant\u2019s experience, were consistent with narcotics transactions. In the past three years, Malenfant had made \u201crandom checks\u201d of Parent\u2019s address, and his observations indicated that Parent and Gates were well known to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">February 20, 1987: Malenfant saw the grey Buick Skyhawk, one of the cars used by Harris, in Gates\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">February 23, 1987: Malenfant saw the black Fiero in Gates\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">February 24, \u00cd987: Malenfant saw the Fiero in the driveway and also saw Gates and Harvey Flashman leave \u2014 Flashman in the Fiero, and Gates in a van, later shown to be registered to Gates. Frequent telephone calls over the next eight days by Malenfant to Gates\u2019s number were not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">March 3 and March 4, 1987: Malenfant saw the black Fiero at Gates\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">March 4, 1987: Malenfant saw Harris\u2019s yellow pickup truck (one of the vehicles Mrs. Doe had said was used to transport cocaine) in Parent\u2019s driveway. Over a period of one hour and forty minutes, he saw three different cars park at Parent\u2019s residence and someone from each car go into the house. Each was there for five to ten minutes. Only one automobile registration number was obtained, and that belonged to a person who had been arrested in June, 1985, for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. A man, whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Malenfant later recognized as Richard E. Harris, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> left Parent\u2019s driveway in the yellow pickup truck. Malenfant followed the truck to Ski\u2019s Auto Body Shop in East Bridgewater. Twice, the truck pulled over to the side of the road to let other vehicles pass. Based on Malenfant\u2019s experience, this action is consistent with that of a driver seeking to avoid being followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">March 10, 1987: Another Middleborough police officer (Storms) observed Gates\u2019s van, which had not been seen for nearly two weeks, parked in his yard. He also saw Parent\u2019s truck, with Parent driving, and Flashman\u2019s Fiero leaving Gates\u2019s residence. At Parent\u2019s residence, Storms saw a passenger from a small Chevette stop, go inside, and leave within three minutes. He thought the passenger was Flashman.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Telephone records between October, 1986 and January, 1987 show numerous calls were made from Ski\u2019s Auto Body Shop to Gates\u2019s home. Richard Harris is employed at Ski\u2019s Auto Body Shop, and his employer is Richard Koslowsky, a person convicted of possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">March 11, 1987: Malenfant saw Harris\u2019s Buick Skyhawk and Flashman\u2019s black Fiero at Gates\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Within seventy-two hours of March 12, the date of the affidavit, Mrs. Doe and Officer Markowicz told Malenfant that Richard Harris offered to sell cocaine to Mrs. Doe and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">On March 11, 1987: Storms received information, from a source wishing to remain anonymous, that from Thanksgiving of 1986 until the present, there was much traffic late at night going to and from Parent\u2019s house and some of the vehicles stopped only for short periods of time. Storms also provided Malenfant with a tape recording of an anonymous tip to the Middleborough police stating that Parent was dealing in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>For purposes of art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, probable cause is determined under the principles set forth in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374 (1985). \u201c[T]o establish probable cause, an affidavit based on information from an unnamed informant must provide the magistrate with facts showing some of the underlying circumstances leading to the informant\u2019s knowledge, as well as his reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reddington, </em>395 Mass. 315, 322 (1985). If the informant\u2019s tip fails to satisfy the basis of knowledge or the veracity of the informant test, other \u201cindependent police corroboration can make up for deficiencies in either or both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test,\u201d but \u201ceach element of the test must be separately considered and satisfied or supplemented in some way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass, at 375-376.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The basis of knowledge test is satisfied by Mrs. Doe\u2019s statements .that she saw cocaine being distributed at Gates\u2019s residence and that Harris had recently offered to sell her cocaine. Although Mrs. Doe\u2019s original observation, without more, might be viewed as a single out of date instance of illegal conduct which would not give rise to probable cause to believe that similar conduct is continuing, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reddington </em>395 Mass, at 323, the supplementation of that evidence by the recent offer by Harris, coupled with the police corroboration of Harris\u2019s connection to the Gates residence, satisfies the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of the test. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>405 Mass. 316, 321 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The affidavit also satisfies the \u201cveracity\u201d prong. There is here no indication that Mrs. Doe had previously supplied the police with information. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, supra </em>at 321-322, however, the affidavit shows independent police corroboration of detailed information provided by the \u2022informant, including her claim that she had seen cocaine distributed from Gates\u2019s house. The corroboration went beyond such readily available information as the location of Gates\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>residence and that Harris was driving a Buick Skyhawk and a yellow Ford pickup truck. In addition to that corroboration, the police showed repeated connections between Gates or his residence and two persons (Harris and Flashman) who had been arrested for narcotics violations and a third person (Parent) in whose residence the police had, pursuant to a warrant, found drugs and notations linking drug transactions to Gates, or at least to \u201cLee.\u201d One or the other of Harris\u2019s cars was seen at the Gates residence on February 20 and again on March 11. Numerous telephone calls from Harris\u2019s place of employment in East Bridgewater were made to the Gates residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Moreover, there was evidence that the group probably obtained drugs on March 3 and 4 and again on March 10 and 11. On March 3 and March 4, the black Fiero belonging to Flashman was seen at the Gates residence. On March 4, Harris was at the Parent residence at a time when narcotics transactions probably were taking place, and Harris drove from there to East Bridgewater in such a manner as to elude surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On March 10, Gates\u2019s van, Parent\u2019s truck, and Flashman\u2019s Fiero were at the Gates residence. Harris\u2019s vehicle.and the black Fiero were again at Gates\u2019s residence on March 11. At about this time Mrs. Doe and others were offered drugs by Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Although much of the corroboration of Mrs. Doe\u2019s tips was based on Gates\u2019s association with known or suspected drug dealers, Parent, Harris, and Flashman, this was also true in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>405 Mass, at 322, \u00e1 case quite similar to the one at bar and which upheld a finding of probable cause. See also Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 215 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1991). Even more significant is the evidence that suggests that on March 3-4 and March 10-11 drugs were available to the group. This evidence, when coupled with the independent, albeit distant, linkage of Gates (\u201cLee\u201d) to Parent\u2019s narcotics transactions, sufficiently supplements the details given by Mrs. Doe to demonstrate her veracity. We do not consider the two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>anonymous tips obtained by Officer Storms as adding anything of substance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reddington, </em>395 Mass, at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The defendant also claims error in the motion judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress without holding an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978). He contends that he made a substantial preliminary showing that Malenfant\u2019s affidavit contained false and misleading statements. Accompanying the defendant\u2019s motion was an affidavit of counsel setting forth the following alleged falsehoods:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">1) Flashman\u2019s Fiero was registered at Eight Egypt Avenue, Scituate at the time Malenfant alleges that he made checks with the Registry. Malenfant\u2019s affidavit has the Fiero registered to Flashman at \u201cP.O. Box 2485, Ocean Bluff <em>[sic], </em>MA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">2) Malenfant stated that \u201caccording to the Massachusetts Board of Probation,\u201d Harvey Flashman was arrested for possession of Class B and Class D drugs. Counsel\u2019s affidavit states that Malenfant, \u201cI suggest, deliberately,\u201d omits that the charges were dismissed and the records sealed. Therefore, if Malenfant had, in fact, made a check, he would not have discovered any record of the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">3) Counsel also disputes that Gates has a \u201clong criminal record.\u201d Counsel a'sserts that Gates was convicted in 1963, 1964, and 1965 of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, of operating after suspension, and of malicious injury to personal property. He also had four subsequent convictions for operating after suspension and a larceny conviction. He had no convictions after 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">4) Counsel alleges that while Malenfant stated that Koslowsky was convicted of possession of 264 grams of cocaine, he was convicted only of simple possession and given a one-year suspended sentence and two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">As our discussion upholding the affidavit indicates, none of the allegedly false statements was necessary to the finding of probable cause. For this reason, even if the falsity of the statements were established, and even if the statements could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>be shown to have been made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard of the truth (and not as the result of carelessness), as required by <em>Franks, </em>the defendant would not be entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amral, </em>407 Mass. 511, 519 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, ante </em>168, 173, 177 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> Although Malenfant at one point refers to Richard E. Harris, Jr., and at other times to Richard Harris, it appears that they are the same person. Richard Harris\u2019s birth date is given as 3/28/63. A twenty-four year old is unlikely to have a son who can drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">He is also not entitled to an <em>Amral </em>hearing as the affidavit does not assert \u201cfacts which cast a reasonable doubt on the veracity of <em>material representations </em>made by the affiant <em>concerning a confidential informant\u201d </em>(emphases supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 522. The alleged falsehoods did not concern Mrs. Doe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The defendant does not argue that he is entitled under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to a hearing even if the allegedly false statements were not necessary to establish probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, supra </em>at 170 n.3 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
