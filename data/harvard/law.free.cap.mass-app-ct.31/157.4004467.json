Welch brought this action against thirteen manufacturers of asbestos materials, among them the defendants Keene Corporation (Keene) and Owens-Illinais, Inc. (Owens), seeking damages for an injury resulting from his exposure to asbestos products between 1954 and 1976. On March 21, 1989, the case was submitted to a jury on special questions, several of which are germane to this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of $878,566.55 for Welch against six of the defendants who then remained in the case, and found in favor of the defendant Fibreboard Corporation. Only Keene and Owens are presently before us on appeal (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>The defendants\u2019 first claim error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant their motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that Welch\u2019s injury was caused by exposure to their asbestos products. They also challenge the judge\u2019s admission of certain evidence and his instructions to the jury on damages. Keene further argues that Welch did not establish the corporation\u2019s failure to warn him of the inherent dangers of asbestos. Finding no merit to any of these contentions, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">1. <em>Denial of defendants\u2019 motions. </em>We turn first to the defendants\u2019 claim that it was error for the trial judge to deny their motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. In reviewing the denial of a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the question before us is the same: that is, whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 656 (1989), quoting from <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). The court may not substitute its judgment of facts for that of the jury. <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>v. <em>Besse, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 727, 728 (1979). With these standards in mind, we set forth pertinent facts as the jury could have found.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Welch began work as an asbestos insulator for Local 6 of the Asbestos Workers Union of America in 1954. During a four and one-half year apprenticeship, he assisted insulators by carrying, applying, and mixing asbestos materials. Throughout his subsequent career as an insulator, he moulded thermal asbestos insulation to pipes, ducts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>boiler room equipment at a variety of installations. Welch worked at \u201chundreds\u201d of work sites, many of which involved the presence of Keene\u2019s and Owens\u2019 products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result of his exposure to asbestos dust, Welch developed asbestosis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After working for twenty-two years, he stopped in 1976, at the age of forty-three, because of his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">During the time of Welch\u2019s employment at four specific sites, including three in Massachusetts, Owens manufactured and supplied the insulating material \u201cKaylo.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Owens\u2019 Kaylo was used at a job site in Natick during 1955 and 1956, a time when the jury could infer that Welsh was also at that job site in his capacity as a pipe insulator. There was also evidence of Welch\u2019s working with Kaylo at three other specific sites. In short, the evidence showed that Welch used Owens\u2019 Kaylo many times throughout his career and as early as 1955; that is, more than three years before Owens ceased making and distributing the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Welch used Keene\u2019s or its predecessor firm, Baldwin Hill\u2019s, asbestos-containing cement at three specific installations over his career. He applied Baldwin Hill\u2019s High Temp cement to pipes at two specific sites, a radar station in 1955, and again in 1963 to 1964 at a hospital. In addition, Welch used Keene\u2019s \u201c85% Magnesium Cement\u201d for a period of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>months in 1967 and 1968, at a power plant job site. There was also evidence brought in through lay witnesses that the mixing and application of these asbestos products typically caused the.release of a substantial amount of asbestos dust into the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The evidence before the jury as to causation included expert testimony on the origins of asbestosis as well as the cumulative and potentially deadly effect of asbestos dust on human lungs over time. Other expert witnesses testified concerning the knowledge of the asbestos industry about the dangers of the product as early as the 1930\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The defendants\u2019 principal contentions are that, as matter of law, the evidence was insufficient on the identification, exposure, and causal relationship of the defendants\u2019 products to the plaintiffs illness and that the evidence did not establish a failure to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">a. <em>Identification. </em>The defendants claim that they were entitled to a directed verdict, or in the alternative, to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict due to Welch\u2019s failure to identify their specific products as the cause of his injury. Indeed, Welch\u2019s identification of the injurious product is a necessary element of his case. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 623 (1978). <em>Mathers </em>v. <em>Midland-Ross Corp., </em>403 Mass. 688, 691 (1989). It is enough, however, to reach the jury that Welch show that he worked with, or in close proximity to, the defendants\u2019 asbestos products. See, e.g., <em>Roehling </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co. Gold Bond Bldg. Prod., </em>786 F.2d 1225, 1228 (4th Cir. 1986). A plaintiff may also demonstrate exposure to a specific product through testimony of coworkers who can identify him as working with or around these products. <em>Ibid. </em>See also 9 Travers, American Law of Products Liability \u00a7 113.34 (3d ed. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Based on the evidence introduced by Welch, we conclude that he sufficiently identified the products of Owens and Keene. Several portions of the record, including Welch\u2019s own description of his direct application of asbestos products, among them Owens\u2019 Kaylo and Keene\u2019s cements, on \u201chundreds\u201d of sites, support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">b. <em>Causation. </em>Regardless of Welch\u2019s ability to identify their specific asbestos-containing products, the defendants argue that the alleged exposure was not substantial enough to cause his injuries. We point out that Welch is not required to prove that \u201cbut for\u201d the particular product of each manufacturer, he would not have been harmed; rather, he need only show \u201cthat it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 433B(1) comment a (1965). See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>401 Mass. 586, 589 (1988); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>780 F.2d 147, 156 (1st Cir. 1985). With a view of the evidence favorable to the plaintiff, <em>Cocco </em>v. <em>Deluxe Sys., Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 154 (1987), we think that it was reasonable for the jury to infer that Welch\u2019s exposure to the defendants\u2019 products was substantial and that their products caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">There is no factual basis upon which to conclude that Welch\u2019s exposure to the defendants\u2019 products was insignificant or de minimis. Welch established that the conditions of his working environment exceeded the generally accepted safe exposure levels for ultimate users of the products. More important, Welch offered expert testimony that his asbestosis was caused by the cumulative effect of all the dust that he had inhaled over the span of his career. Because each inhalation of asbestos dust can result in additional damage to lung tissue, it is all but impossible to determine which exposure is directly responsible for the disease; nor, we add, is it Welch\u2019s burden to allocate blame. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>363 Mass. 402, 408 (1973); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>401 Mass, at 591. Taking into account the testimony of Welch\u2019s experts, and giving the plaintiff\u2019s case the deference to which it is entitled, we find the evidence sufficient both to reach the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and for the jury to answer affirmatively, as they did, in response to special questions 2, 3, and 4 (note 2, <em>supra). </em>See, e.g., <em>Borel </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp., </em>493 F.2d 1076, 1094 (5th Cir. 1973), cert, denied, 419 U.S. 869 (1974) (where the plaintiff, an insulation worker, had been exposed to the products of several defendants over a number of years, the court held that from this \u201cstrong\u201d circumstantial evidence the jury could find that each defendant was the cause in fact of some injury to him); <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Velsicol Chem. Corp., </em>855 F.2d 1188, 1198-1201 (6th Cir. 1988) (on the basis of expert testimony, the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 injury, numerous studies, and extensive literature, the court concluded that Velsicol\u2019s chemicals and the duration of exposure were \u2018capable\u2019 of causing the types of injuries complained of).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">c. <em>Failure to warn. </em>Generally, a manufacturer\u2019s duty of care includes an obligation, whenever possible, to eliminate known or reasonably knowable conditions of the product, or to provide an adequate warning of the latent dangers arising from the normal and intended use of the product. <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>370 Mass. 69, 75 (1976). <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>394 Mass. 131, 135 (1985). <em>Maldonado </em>v. <em>Thomson Natl. Press Co., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (1983). A manufacturer of a product which lacks the requisite warning is, by virtue of that deficiency, in breach of an implied warranty of merchantability. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. 407, 413 (1984). <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>403 Mass. 70 (1988). However, a manufacturer has a duty to warn only as to those dangers about which the manufacturer actually knew or about which it reasonably should have known. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>799 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Keene argues that Welch produced no evidence of its failure to warn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Keene\u2019s failure to warn, however, was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>issue at trial: rather, the manufacturer focused exclusively on whether the risks to insulators from asbestos products were generally knowable within the entire industry before Dr. I.J. SelikofFs well-publicized report of December, 1965.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Keene\u2019s counsel, in his opening statement, remarked that, before the 1965 study, the risk was \u201csimply not known.\u201d In his closing argument, he elaborated, \u201cThe products couldn\u2019t possibly have been unreasonably dangerous by virtue of a failure to warn because there was nothing to warn about. . . . [T]he whole basis of [Welch\u2019s] claim, of course, drops out of the case once he knows about the risk and once warnings go on. And that happens in around the mid-1960\u2019s, December, 1965.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Srebnick </em>v. <em>Lo-Law Transit Mgmt., Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 51 n.3 (1990) (an attorney\u2019s admission of material fact during argument is binding). Because Keene raised its breach of warranty defense on the theory that it had no duty to warn of an unknowable risk and because it failed to raise Welch\u2019s alleged failure to prove that he was not warned in the motion for a directed verdict, we need not pass on the issue on appeal. <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., </em>376 Mass. 874, 882-883 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">2. <em>Evidentiary rulings. </em>The defendants argue that they were also prejudiced by the admission of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">. First, they challenge the allowance of Dr. Schepers\u2019 (note 6, <em>supra) </em>opinion as to what appropriate warnings might have been affixed to insulating products during the relevant pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>riod.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was no error. Expert testimony on matters within the witness\u2019s expertise is admissible whenever it will aid the jury, even if the expert\u2019s opinion touches on the ultimate issue that the jury must decide. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Bucky Warren, Inc., </em>376 Mass. 280, 294 (1978). <em>Sacco </em>v. <em>Roupenian, </em>409 Mass. 25, 28 (1990). Here, the expert\u2019s testimony as to the substance of appropriate warnings and possible precautions was nothing more than a relevant extension of his \u201cstate of the art\u201d testimony. Where the jury were asked to determine whether the product, unaccompanied by adequate warnings, was. unreasonably dangerous, the feasibility and substance of adequate warnings were facts material to the resolution of the ultimate issue. See <em>Fahey </em>v. <em>Rockwell Graphic Sys., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 658 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendants next question Dr. Schepers\u2019 use of a chart comprised of a redacted version of all the articles on asbestos which had been incorporated in his testimony. The judge allowed the chart as a demonstrative aid to help focus the attention of both the jury and the witness during his lengthy explanation of the literature. Summary charts of voluminous evidence are permissible if they are accurate and fair, although \u201ccare must be taken to insure that summaries accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>rately reflect the contents of the underlying documents and do not function as pedagogical devices that unfairly emphasize part of the proponent\u2019s proof. . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drougas, </em>748 F.2d 8, 25 (1st Cir. 1984). See also Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 1006. Nearly all of the articles and publications listed on the chart were disclosed and available to the defendants prior to trial. The judge carefully instructed the jury that the visual aids were not evidence and that, as they had been permitted to take notes, they were prohibited from copying any information from the chart. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557, 581-582 (1959); 5 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00a7 1006 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Finally, the defendants challenge on relevancy grounds the presentation to the jury of a videotaped experiment showing the visibility of dust concentrations. This demonstration was offered to support Welch\u2019s testimony that he observed at certain of his work sites harmful asbestos particles which exceeded acceptable exposure levels. The videotape was relevant: it established both Welch\u2019s exposure to the defendants\u2019 products when the dust had reached dangerous levels, and went to the attendant duty of the defendants to warn of the potential risks. Evidence of tests or experiments, which do not exactly replicate the conditions giving rise to the alleged injury, are admissible upon a showing of adequate test controls where there is a substantial similarity between experimental conditions and the conditions that gave rise to the litigation. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>380 Mass. 362, 365-366 (1980). <em>Calvanese </em>v. <em>W.W. Babcock Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 731 (1980). The admission of \u201cexperiments or illustrations in the presence of the jury\u201d rests on sound judicial discretion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>362 Mass. 455, 473 (1972), and cases cited. Here, we conclude, the judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">3. <em>The judge\u2019s instructions on damages. </em>Contrary to the defendants\u2019 argument, we find no suggestion in either <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>or <em>Trinity Church in the City of Boston </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>399 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Mass. 43 (1987), that past lost earnings, like future lost earnings, should be discounted to present value. It has long been the rule that an award for loss of future earning capacity must be reduced to \u201cpresent value\u201d in order to allow for the earning power of that money. <em>Id. </em>at 52.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition to the projected future loss of earnings, the jury may also allow compensation for the plaintiffs past loss of earning capacity. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>302 Mass. 145, 146-147 (1939). Since a jury award for past earnings covers the plaintiffs actual loss of use of his wages between the time of his injury and the date of his complaint, it rests oh an entirely different footing. As such, we follow the cases which have specifically limited discounting to future lost earnings. See, e.g., <em>Griffin, supra </em>at 366-367. The judge\u2019s instruction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Upon completion of the defendants\u2019 cases, the judge, after denying the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict, dismissed various counts relating to Welch\u2019s tort based theories of recovery, including negligence and strict liability. He left for the jury the claim for breach of warranty of implied merchantability, using a series of special questions. The jury answered the first question, \u201cDid Mr. Welch contract asbestosis?\u201d in the affirmative. We recite the other questions pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\"><em>\u201cQ.2 </em>Were asbestos-containing products manufactured by the [defendant] companies present at any job site while Mr. Welch was working there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\"><em>\u201cQ.3 </em>Did Mr. Welch, while at those job sites, inhale and retain asbestos fibres from those asbestos-containing products which you have found were present and manufactured by the [defendants] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\"><em>\u201cQ.4 </em>Was Mr. Welch\u2019s inhalation and retention of the asbestos fibres contained in the products manufactured by the [defendants] either the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>cause, or a substantial contributing factor in Mr. Welch\u2019s contracting asbestosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\"><em>\u201cQ.5 </em>Under the state of the art existing at the time of sale, were the asbestos-containing products of the [defendants] unreasonably dangerous to the user due to a failure to warn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\"><em>\u201cQ.6 </em>Was such failure to warn on the part of the [defendants] the sole cause of, or a substantial contributing factor in, Mr. Welch\u2019s contracting asbestosis? ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Owens manufactured and supplied the insulating material \u201cKayla\u201d in block and pipe 'covering forms.

Symptoms associated with asbestosis include shortness of breath, coughing, chest pains and clubbing of fingers. Although the disease is not always fatal, it is progressive and incurable.\u201d Special Project, An Analysis of the Legal, Social, and Political Issues Raised by Asbestos Litigation, 36 Vand. L.

He cited, among other studies, a 1930 article of two English doctors (Merriweather and Price) describing in \u201cgreat detail\u201d asbestosis, the conditions which made asbestos hazardous to inhale, and the measures which should be taken to protect workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Owens chose not to brief the failure to warn issue. We consider only the question argued: viz., whether Welch established Keene\u2019s failure to warn. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). <em>Arenstam </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Tyngsborough, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 314, 316 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Selikoff, Churg, &amp; Hammond, The Occurrence of Asbestosis Among Industrial Insulation Workers, 132 Ann. New York Acad. Sc. 139 (1965). This study was, according to Keene, the first to establish conclusively that insulators were at risk for asbestosis. However, in adopting the view of the evidence most favorable to Welch, the jury could have concluded from extensive expert testimony that by the year of Welch\u2019s entry into the workplace, 1954, the hazards were well known, documented and available to the asbestos manufacturing industry. Welch presented evidence that manufacturers of asbestos products could have known of the danger associated with exposure as early as the 1930\u2019s. It was a question of fact for the jury, whose finding we do not disturb. <em>Cocco </em>v. <em>Deluxe Sys., Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 156-157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The judge refused to allow Welch to put in evidence an actual printed \u201csample\u201d warning, but did permit the expert witness to testify that, based on the knowledge available in 1954, certain types of warnings might have been given to those working in the field. The judge was careful to narrow the scope of the expert\u2019s testimony on this issue, at one point saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to interrupt you. It\u2019s just a matter of words, but rather than say what you think they should have been, it\u2019s really what they could have been, based on what was available.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The defendants further argue that the judge erroneously excluded legitimate attempts on their part to rebut the testimony of Welch\u2019s \u201cstate of the art\u201d expert. However, the question they posed of their expert was: \u201cDoctor, prior to the middle to late 1960\u2019s, was the state of the art, as reflected in the published literature such that a reasonable manufacturer <em>should </em>have known enough to warrant placing a warning. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge struck the question because it touched on reasonable care, an issue properly left for the jury.
