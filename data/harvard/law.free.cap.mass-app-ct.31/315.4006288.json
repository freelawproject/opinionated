Edward F. Ryan (Ryan), chief of the Revere police department, Ryan appealed from the decision to the Civil Service Commission (the commission) under the provisions of G. L. c. .31, \u00a7 2(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended by St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 11. The commission reversed the administrator\u2019s decision. The mayor responded with an action in the Superior Court in the nature of certiorari, see G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, and a judge of the Superior Court reversed the decision of the commission, leaving the decisions of the mayor and the administrator intact. Ryan and the commission have appealed to this court, claiming that the judge was in error and that the decision of the commission should be reinstated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for remand to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>The factual background to this controversy is not in dispute. The case arose out of the theft and illegal use of police civil service examinations by members of the Revere police force.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In 1979, the administrator, having given an examination for the civil service position of police chief of Revere, certified a list of three candidates to the mayor. The first-ranked candidate, whom the mayor appointed chief of police,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> subsequently was indicted and convicted for his involvement in the so-called \u201cexam scam.\u201d The second-ranked candidate was also indicted, and a third candidate, whose name was added to the eligible list when the first of the indictments was handed down and whom the mayor appointed to fill the resulting vacancy in the chiefs position, died unexpectedly. This left the third-ranking Ryan the sole remaining candidate on the certified list. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. The administrator, exercising special authority given him to revive the expired 1979 test, certified a \u201cshort list\u201d to the mayor consisting of a single candidate, Ryan. See St. 1976, c. 534, \u00a7 1-</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On February 8, 1989, the mayor wrote the administrator that he did not intend to appoint Ryan as chief of police, and, acting under the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which permits a provisional appointment if less than three names are on the eligibility list, the mayor requested permission to make a provisional appointment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the vacant position, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>pending a new examination and certification. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 12, which we set out in the margin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires that a provisional appointment of a person not on the eligibility list may be made but only if the appointing authority states \u201csound and sufficient reasons,\u201d satisfactory to the administrator, for not appointing a person who is on the eligibility list. The mayor identified three reasons for his decision not to appoint Ryan: (i) lack of leadership ability, (ii) excessive use of sick time and injury time, and (iii) lack of sensitivity, discretion, and good judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On February 23, the administrator wrote the mayor that more specific information was required before the administrator could determine whether the mayor\u2019s reasons were \u201csound and sufficient\u201d (see note 8, <em>supra). </em>The mayor provided the administrator with more specific information on March 6, including (i) Ryan\u2019s identification with a particular faction in the police department which resulted in \u201cmany in the department . . . holding] him in contempt,\u201d (ii) itemization of Ryan\u2019s sick leave, which the mayor indicated was \u201csubstantial\u201d in recent years and which \u201creflects the general perception that [he] lost interest in the job of a police officer and was \u2018marking time,\u2019 \u201d and (iii) evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Ryan\u2019s placing a wager while in uniform at the Wonderland race track. On March 16 the administrator, without elaboration, accepted reasons numbered two and three as sufficient to support the \u201cnon-selection\u201d of Ryan. He then authorized the mayor to make a provisional appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Proceeding under the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2(6), Ryan appealed to the commission, claiming in substance that the mayor\u2019s decision not to appoint him was politically motivated, arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of \u201cbasic merit principles.\u201d See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In July, a single member of the commission held a hearing; the parties were represented by counsel who examined and cross-examined witnesses, including Ryan and the mayor. Notwithstanding the provisions of the fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2(6), see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the single member made no report of his findings of fact and recommendations to the commission. The commission\u2019s decision was announced on December 4. \u201cBased upon the testimony . . . and the materials offered in evidence [at the hearing before the single member], the [commission conclude[d] that the reasons offered by the . . . [mayor were] insufficient and [were] a pretext for other reasons, viz., personal hostility on the part of the . . . [mayor] toward . . . [Ryan].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ognizing that the commission could not order the appointment of Ryan, see <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Corporation Counsel of Boston, </em>360 Mass. 660, 666 (1971), the commission merely ordered Ryan\u2019s name to the top of the forthcoming eligibility list for chief of police of Revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The judge of the Superior Court, who had the entire administrative record before her, concluded that (i) the commission exceeded its authority under the fifth paragraph of c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>which limits the scope of the commission\u2019s power to a review of whether the administrator\u2019s decision was based on \u201ca preponderance of the evidence in the record,\u201d and (ii) in any event, \u201cthe Commission\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d The judgment entered in the Superior Court, which we vacate, requires a discussion of the nature of the proceedings before the commission in appeals under the fifth paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>see note 3, <em>supra, </em>a subject which has not, to our knowledge, previously been considered.by the Supreme Judicial Court or this court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>As previously noted, the mayor, before being given the authority to bypass the eligibility list, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the administrator with what the mayor claimed were \u201csound and sufficient reasons\u201d for the nonselection of Ryan. The administrator accepted the proffered reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Upon the ensuing appeal of Ryan, the commission was required to determine, after a hearing either before the commission or before less than a majority of its members, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>fourth par., \u201cwhether the . . . [mayor] had sustained . . . [his] burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that there . . . [were sound and sufficient reasons] for the action . . . [he] took.\u201d <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>408 Mass. 292, 297 (1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The preponderance of the evidence test imposed by the fifth paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>required the commission to determine whether, on the basis of the evidence before it, the mayor established that the reasons assigned by him for the nonselection of Ryan were, more probably than not, sound and sufficient. See <em>Fire Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 82 (1986). In the event of a failure of proof by the mayor, the commission has the power to reverse the decision of the administrator and, in this case, did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As noted, the mayor and the commission now come to court under the provisions of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 (a civil action in the nature of certiorari). Certiorari is available to correct errors of law in administrative proceedings where, as here, judicial review is otherwise unavailable. \u201cThe nature or scope of the review accommodates to the kind of administrative decision involved, and this in turn is conditioned by the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>substantive rule or standard that is being applied.\u201d <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (1985). Where there is a broad grant of discretionary authority to the agency, as is commonly true of local licensing authorities for example, see, e.g., G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A, the standard of review is error of law or abuse of discretion, measured by the arbitrary and capricious test. See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 877-878 (1983). But where, as here, the authority of the administrative agency (here, the commission) is limited by \u201cnarrow and objective criteria,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 878, judicial feview becomes \u201can assessment of the strength of the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s action . . . .\u201d <em>Yerardi\u2019s, supra </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Thus we must inquire whether there is substantial evidence in the record before the commission to support the commission\u2019s decision, see <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>408 Mass, at 297 \u2014 quite aside from the traditional judicial inquiry as to whether it appears from the record that the administrative decision involved a substantial error of law that affects material rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[Substantial evidence is \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), quoting from <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). The test is whether experience would permit \u201cthe reasoning mind\u201d to make the agency decision. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">No doubt the commission\u2019s finding of bad faith \u2014 that is, the personal hostility of the mayor toward Ryan as the motivating factor \u2014 would be sufficient to reverse the decision of the administrator who, perhaps unwittingly,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>statements and representations of the mayor. See <em>Debnam </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>388 Mass. 632, 635 (1983). However, we are unable to review the commission\u2019s decision because the commission\u2019s conclusion of bad faith, and its rejection of the mayor\u2019s reasons, are not explicated by clear reasoning from adequate subsidiary findings of fact, leaving us uncertain as to the basis of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The fundamental difficulty is the failure of the commission and the single member to perform the duties imposed by the <em>fourth </em>paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b). </em>See note 3, <em>supra. </em>That paragraph authorizes the chairman to appoint a member of the commission to hold the required hearing and directs the single member \u201cto report his . . . findings of fact and recommendations to the commission for its action.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The hearing in this case was conducted by a single commissioner, but the record appendix, which purports to be a record of \u201call materials\u201d in the administrative record and which includes the transcript of the hearing before the single member, does not include the required report of findings of fact and recommendations. There is merely the decision of the commission, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>signed by the chairman, with the notation that the three commissioners voted in favor of the decision. Thus, the obstacle is not the absence of evidence which may support the commission\u2019s decision, as the judge ruled and as the mayor now contends, but rather the absence of findings with regard to that evidence which, on various important points, was conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">To illustrate the point: the only possible direct evidence of personal hostility which appears in the record is a conversation between the mayor and Ryan following the mayor\u2019s 1985 reelection. During the political campaign Ryan had worked for those opposing the mayor. The mayor and Ryan both testified to the conversation, but they gave totally different versions of it. According to the mayor, the conversation was entirely benign; Ryan offered his apologies, expressed his desire to be friends, and the mayor said no apology was nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>essary. According to Ryan, the mayor said, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the things you said about me. I didn\u2019t [sic] like you, and I don\u2019t like what you said.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision makes no reference at all to this testimony. It is undisputed that the conversation occurred, but there is no finding as to which of these two versions was accepted by the commission in spite of the fact that the finding could be important. The conversation, though brief by either account, could be seen as bearing directly and significantly upon the attitude of the parties toward each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">So too, the commission\u2019s decision discusses, and rejects as inadequate, \u201cthe 1985 incident at the race track\u201d \u2014 the event cited by the mayor in support of his conclusion that Ryan lacked good judgment. Here the findings are inadequate and the reasoning is not clear. Presumably the commission refers to the official report of Captain Edward Sasso that Ryan, on March 23, 1985, at 11:00 p.m., while in uniform, was seen \u201creading a dog program . . . looking at the tote board [and] then went to a mainline window . . . and made a bet.\u201d The event was not disputed by Ryan; he admitted to betting on that occasion and others as well. Ryan\u2019s response, firmly established by his own testimony and by the testimony of other Revere police officers, was to the effect that most Revere police officers (there was testimony that the number reached ninety-five percent) who worked at Wonderland dog track placed bets while on duty. Ryan testified that he even placed bets for his accuser, Captain Sasso, and a lieutenant on the force testified that he did not know of any officer who had not made a bet while on duty at the track.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There was also evidence that approximately two and one-half years after Ryan was given a three-day suspension for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201c1985 incident\u201d (the suspension was subsequently withdrawn), George D. Hurley, then acting chief of police of Revere, wrote a memorandum to \u201call men that work the dog track detail\u201d that \u201cyou are being paid to perform the duties of a police officer, not a patron of the dog track. If you must bet on races, at least get someone in civilian clothes to make the wager for you . . . just use a little common sense.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On the basis of the evidence just summarized, the commission concluded that \u201cthe practice of wagering by officers working paid details at the track, offensive as it may be, was so all-pervasive throughout the ranks and so clearly tolerated by the then-Chief, that it may not properly be relied upon as justification for the [appointing [authority's action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The commission\u2019s rejection of the events at the dog track lacks a reasoned foundation. The commission appears to regard the practice of wagering by officers working paid details as plainly \u201coffensive,\u201d yet the commission attaches no importance to Ryan\u2019s participation in that practice. Why this should be so is left entirely unexplained. It is not at all clear that the mayor\u2019s judgment of the event should be rejected merely because most of the Revere police force regularly did what Ryan was charged with doing. According to the Hurley memorandum, for example, what Ryan (and most of the other officers) did could be seen as evidence of bad judgment \u2014 no \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Police officers, as we have said on another occasion, \u201cmust . . . behave in a manner that brings honor and respect for . . . law enforcement personnel. . . . [Tjhey implicitly agree that they will not engage in conduct which calls into question their ability and fitness to perform their official responsibilities.\u201d <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 364, 371 (1986).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201c[T]he public has an interest in having a police force comprised of competent and able individuals.\u201d <em>Mulgrew </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>410 Mass. 631, 635 (1991). In short, the commission must consider and deal with the issue of Ryan\u2019s conduct in light of the public interest in a qualified chief of police for Revere, and it must do so consistently with \u201cbasic merit principles,\u201d as provided in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, which gives assurance to all civil service employees that they are \u201cprotected from arbitrary and capricious actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The administrative process set out in c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>as we have described it here, is parallel to that provided in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), as inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, which requires \u201ca statement of reasons for the decision [of the agency], including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that context the Supreme Judicial Court has said that an agency has the \u201cduty to make subsidiary findings of fact on all issues relevant and material to the ultimate issue to be decided . . . [and] to set forth the manner in which it reasoned from the subsidiary facts so found to the ultimate decision reached.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>361 Mass. 352, 355 (1972). See also <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 535-536 (1984) (\u201cWhile we can conduct a meaningful review of \u2018a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned,\u2019 we will not \u2018supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given,\u2019 \u201d quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ing from <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-286 [1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">This court has held, in a similar case involving the complaint of a police officer against the commission^ that, while the commission is not subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act, \u201cit is still required to articulate the facts on which its decision is based.\u201d <em>Faria </em>v. <em>Third Bristol Div. of the Dist.

While the discipline imposed as a result of the 1985 incident at the race track, and the underlying conduct involved, might, in a different time and place, be a sufficient reason for non-selection, it is clear from the testimony at the [cpmmission hearing, as well as from Exhibit #4 [the Elurley memorandum described <em>infra], </em>that the practice of wagering by officers working paid details at the track, offensive as it may be, was so all-pervasive throughout the ranks and so clearly tolerated by the then-Chief, that it may not properly be relied upon as a justification for the [appointing [apthority\u2019s action. Similarly, the [appellant\u2019s record of sick and injured time was not materially different from that of the individual selected for provisional appointment, so this reason also is insufficient. Finally, the reference to lack of leadership is nebulous and fails to reflect the fact that the [appellant was carrying out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>his duties in a climate of punitive work assignments such that he could hardly have been expected to show what might conventionally be termed leadership qualities.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The fifth paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>(see note 3, <em>supra), </em>is not without its interpretive difficulties. Taken literally, the fifth paragraph makes no sense. That paragraph provides that a decision of the administrator shall not be reversed, \u201cexcept upon a finding that such decision was not based upon a preponderance of evidence in the record.\u201d The only \u201cevidence in the record\u201d is that developed before the commission, and thus the commission cannot inquire whether the decision of the administrator was \u201cbased upon a preponderance of evidence in the record\u201d later developed before the commission. We must reject a construction which makes nonsense of a legislative enactment, <em>vanDresser </em>v. <em>Firlings, </em>305 Mass. 51, 53 (1940) (\u201creason and common sense are not to be abandoned in the interpretive process\u201d), choosing instead a construction which comports with the evident purpose of the Legislature as expressed in \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>namely, that the commission must find, on the basis of the evidence before it, whether the appointing authority has sustained its burden of proving the validity of its decision by a preponderance of evidence in the record. If the appointing authority fails to sustain that burden, the commission may reverse the decision of the administrator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Gloucester </em>involves G.
