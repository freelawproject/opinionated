On appeal, he argues that (1) the court erroneously admitted evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>his prior sexual activity with the victim, and (2) the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to call a witness and made other improper statements during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The Commonwealth produced evidence of the following. The defendant, the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend, had been a daily visitor to the victim\u2019s home since she was six or seven years old. He was charged with a single act of sexual abuse, which occurred in November, 1986, when the victim was seventeen years old. At that time, he entered the victim\u2019s bedroom while she was sleeping and fondled her pubic area. She told him that she was tired and wanted to go to sleep. He continued for several minutes before stopping. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was based on the victim\u2019s testimony and the testimony of four fresh complaint witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The defendant did not call any witnesses. He relied on cross-examination to show that the victim had a poor relationship with her mother and to argue that for this reason she had fabricated the accusations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">1. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the victim was permitted to testify that the defendant had sexually abused her in the past. She testified in detail about two specific instances, one occurring in the defendant\u2019s car when she was sixteen years old and the other occurring in her home approximately four months before the incident at issue. She further testified that the defendant had been sexually abusing her since she was nine years old and that he had \u201calways\u201d told her not to tell anyone about it or they would both get into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indict-ably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986), and cases cited. Among the purposes for which the evidence may be introduced are to show a pattern of conduct, intent, and the relationship between a defendant and a victim. <em>Id. </em>at 224-225. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 417-418 (1990). Evidence of other acts of illicit sexual activity be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tween the same parties, \u201cif not too remote in time, is competent to prove an inclination to commit the [acts] charged in the indictment. . . and is relevant to show the probable existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 470 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>242 Mass. 582, 585 (1922). The Supreme Judicial Court has \u201cheld that testimony concerning other sexual contacts between the parties is admissible to \u2018render it not improbable that the act might have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 470, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piccerillo, </em>256 Mass. 487, 489 (1926). In this case, the evidence of prior sexual acts was highly probative. It demonstrated the defendant\u2019s long-standing desire for sexual contact with the victim and his long-term pattern of indulging that desire. It was thus relevant to show the defendant\u2019s \u201cinclination\u201d to commit the act charged and his \u201cpassion\u201d for the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The defendant argues that the undue prejudice of the testimony concerning acts that occurred when the victim was nine years old outweighed its probative value, especially because these events were too remote in time. \u201cThere is no bright-line test for determining temporal remoteness of evidence of prior misconduct. Where the prior misconduct is merely one instance in a continuing course of related events, the allowable time period is greater. Where the logical relationship between the charged and uncharged offenses is more attenuated, a time span of fifteen minutes may be too much.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, supra </em>at 228 n.13, and cases cited (citations omitted). In <em>Helfant, </em>testimony concerning sexual acts between the defendant and other victims which occurred three years apart was held admissible to show the defendant\u2019s plan, scheme, or state of mind because the conduct was nearly identical to the offense charged. <em>Id. </em>at 224-229. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 714-715 (1959) (evidence that the defendant and victim had sexual relations six months after the date of the statutory rape charged was admissible as a \u201clater event[] of a like nature\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yelle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 465, 468-471 (1985). Here, the victim testified to similar acts of abuse perpetrated by the defendant \u201cat least three times a month\u201d from the time she was nine years old until she reached the age of seventeen. Because the testimony concerned abuse which occurred continually up to the time of the incident which was the subject of the present complaint, the evidence had a strong logical connection to the crime charged. Further, it put the single instance of abuse charged into a comprehensible context by providing the jury with \u201ca view of the entire relationship between the defendant and . . . the . . . victim[ ].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 78-80 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mora, </em>402 Mass. 262, 267-268 (1988). Finally, the judge carefully instructed the jury that the evidence of prior acts could be used solely to show \u201cknowledge, intent, motive, or method, material to the proof of the crime charged,\u201d and not as proof that the defendant committed the crime charged, that he had \u201ca criminal personality or bad character,\u201d or that, \u201cif the defendant committed the other acts, he must also have committed this particular act.\u201d \u201cQuestions of relevancy and prejudicial effect are entrusted to the trial judge\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 24 (1990). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">2. During closing argument, the prosecutor commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to call the victim\u2019s mother as a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant objected, and the judge immediately ordered the comment struck. After closing arguments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>completed, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The remark was improper. \u201c[T]he rule of law relevant here runs thus. Where a party has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case, the party would naturally offer that person as a witness. If, then, without explanation, he does not do so, the jury may, if they think reasonable in the circumstances, infer that that person, had he been called, would have given testimony unfavorable to the party.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Resendes, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 432 (1991). \u201c[Bjefore any comment is made, the trial judge must rule, as matter of law, that there is a sufficient foundation for such inference in the record. Therefore, if counsel plans to argue to the jury that an inference may be drawn against the opposing party for failure to call a witness, the proper practice is first to obtain the permission of the trial judge to do so. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 658 (1989) (citations omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, supra </em>at 135; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 467 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The prosecutor did not lay an adequate foundation, nor did she obtain permission from the judge, for her reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to call the the victim\u2019s mother as a witness. In fact, the record gives no indication that her testimony would have been other than cumulative of the testimony presented, which showed that she and her daughter did not get along well. The victim, along with other prosecution witnesses, testified that she and her mother had a tense relationship, and that they argued about curfews, the victim\u2019s association with girlfriends and boys, and chores. The victim testified that she moved to her father\u2019s home for several months in early 1986 because she had a fight with her mother. She again left home after the incident charged because, having informed her mother about the abuse, she felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that her mother treated her harshly, and she was unsatisfied by her mother\u2019s offer merely to put a lock on the victim\u2019s bedroom door. A prosecution witness testified that the victim had told her that her mother had tried to place her with the Department of Social Services. Nothing in the record indicates that the victim\u2019s mother would have provided additional significant evidence. Thus, there was no basis for the jury\u2019s drawing a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to call her as a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, supra </em>at 134; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fulgham, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 422, 426-427 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In the circumstances, however, the prosecutor\u2019s improper comment could not have harmed the defendant. It implied only that the victim\u2019s mother might have testified that the victim was not the discipline problem the defendant had attempted to portray: \u201cIf that young woman was nearly as bad at dating boys, and terrible discipline problems, and all that stuff, why didn\u2019t they call her.\u201d See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Had the jury been influenced by the remark, it would not have undermined the defendant\u2019s strategy. The defendant relied on evidence of the tense relationship between the victim and her mother to argue that the victim had fabricated her accusations. Whether she was actually a discipline problem was irrelevant to the success of that strategy. Furthermore, the judge immediately had the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the absent witness struck. He carefully instructed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence, that the defendant is presumed innocent, that he need not testify or call witnesses, and that the burden of proof never shifts from the Commonwealth. \u201cThe jury are presumed to follow the judge\u2019s instruction[s].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 588 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">For the first time on appeal,-the defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the victim\u2019s mother was \u201cstaring her daughter down\u201d and that she was nearly sitting in the defendant\u2019s lap, attempting to convey her belief in his innocence, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>was based on facts not in evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and was an improper attempt to play on the jury\u2019s prejudices. The remark was improper. The victim\u2019s mother was merely an onlooker at the trial, and the reference to her demeanor was a comment on facts not in evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987). However, the remark did not attack the \u201cheart\u201d of the defendant\u2019s case. See <em>id. </em>at 518. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470-471 (1978). In fact, it implied that the victim\u2019s mother supported the defendant\u2019s innocence, rather than the victim\u2019s testimony. Moreover, the judge forcefully instructed the jury that their decision must be based on a fair and impartial consideration of the facts in evidence, that they were not to be swayed by sympathy or prejudice, and that closing arguments and statements of counsel were not evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozek, supra </em>at 518. The improper remark created no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 416 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Finally, the defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s reference, in closing argument, to the victim\u2019s difficulty in testifying about sexual abuse, and the consequent likelihood that her testimony was not a fabrication. The remark was made in the context of a lengthy argument concerning the credibility of the victim and was based on facts in evidence. The prosecutor referred to the victim\u2019s statement that it had been difficult for her to discuss the subject with a male police officer, adverted to her demeanor as she gave that testimony, and asked the jury to infer that she had no motivation to lie. \u201cIt is not improper to make a factually based argument that, due to the demeanor, disclosed circumstances, and appearance of a witness, a particular witness should be believed or disbelieved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 521. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536 (1991). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The prosecutor stated: \u201cIf that young woman [the victim] was nearly as bad at dating boys, and terrible discipline problems, and all that stuff, why didn\u2019t they call her [the mother]. She\u2019s sitting there through this whole trial and every word, staring her daughter down. Sitting in his [the defendant\u2019s] lap, practically, throughout this trial, hoping that you would (inaudible) a message that if she believes him, and she\u2019s sitting with him, then you (inaudible).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In her opening statement, the prosecutor noted that the victim\u2019s mother was present in the courtroom. During direct examination of the victim, the prosecutor again established that the victim\u2019s mother was present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
