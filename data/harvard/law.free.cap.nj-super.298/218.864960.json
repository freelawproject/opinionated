Plaintiff sued defendants Alon Ifrah and David Ifrah for property damage sustained as a result of Alon\u2019s negligent operation of a vehicle on February 21,1989. David, Alon\u2019s father, had purchased the vehicle for Alon\u2019s sole use as a mode of transportation to and from school. Plaintiff sought to impose liability on David as owner of the vehicle on the theory that Alon was acting as David\u2019s agent when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">The motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff against David, concluding that David is liable for plaintiffs damages because he failed to rebut the presumption of agency, <em>see Harvey v. Craw, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 264 A.2d 448 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>479, 267 A.2d 61 (1970). On a motion for reconsideration, David argued that he had successfully rebutted the presumption by presenting evidence that Alon was not on an errand for him and that Alon had total control of the car. The motion judge rejected the argument, reasoning that \u201cit is the ... parents\u2019 ... responsibility to be sure that [Alon] has a way to get to school,\u201d and concluded that this duty created a liability on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>of Alon\u2019s father for his son\u2019s negligence. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Principles of agency have long been settled in our jurisprudence. An agency relationship is created when one family member performs an act for another. <em>Missell v. Hayes, </em>86 <em>N.J.L. </em>348, 350, 91 A. 322 (E. &amp; A.1914); <em>Doran v. Thomsen, </em>76 <em>N.J.L. </em>754, 757, 71 A. 296 (E. &amp; A.1908). When one is on his own business, convenience or pleasure, he is acting solely for himself and not for any \u201cfamily purpose.\u201d <em>Paul v. Flannery, </em>128 <em>N.J.L. </em>438, 442, 26 A.2d 553 (E. &amp; A.1942); <em>Wirth v. Gabry, </em>120 <em>N.J.L. </em>432, 433, 200 A. 556 (Sup.Ct.1938) (citing <em>Doran, supra), aff'd, </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>95, 4 A.2d 281 (E. &amp; A.1939). Here, David\u2019s blameless furnishing of the means of transportation for his son to attend school does not support the conclusion that Alon was acting for a \u201cfamily purpose\u201d so as to' justify holding David vicariously liable for his son\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle. This court\u2019s recent observations in <em>Haggerty v. Cedeno, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 611-12, 653 A.2d 1166 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>98, 660 A.2d 1197 (1995), support this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">New Jersey\u2019s common law rule regarding owner liability [in the context of automobile-related injuries] is not designed to protect the injured party, in this case a New Jersey resident, or to protect the driver. It is designed to shield an owner from liability in cases in which the owner has not been negligent and in which the culpable driver is not related to the owner in a way that will justify the imposition of vicarious liability under traditional principles of the law of agency or master servant. That shield is consistent with the principle that tort liability in the context of automobile-related personal injuries is based on fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Because no agency relationship exists under the facts of this case, we are constrained to reverse the summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
