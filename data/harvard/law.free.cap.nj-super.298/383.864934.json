The trial court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to compensation for a total loss on a replacement cost basis. Having determined that the cost of replacing the structure exceeded the $525,000 policy limit, the trial court, <em>inter alia, </em>entered an order for judgment in that amount, while denying plaintiffs application for pre-judgment interest. Both parties appeal, respectively, from these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The loss occurred on September 24, 1993, from a roof collapse as the result of a fire. The structure was a non-conforming use. In April 1994, after determining that the building had been damaged to an extent greater than fifty percent of its assessed valuation, New Brunswick\u2019s Administrative Officer invoked subsection 22-15.1(b)4 of the City\u2019s zoning ordinance which provided that \u201cany non-conforming structure destroyed to an extent greater than fifty percent of its assessed valuation shall not be reconstructed.\u201d Accordingly, he denied plaintiff permission to reconstruct and ordered that the remainder of the structure be demolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It is clear from the terms of the insurance policy at issue that the carrier has undertaken, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201c[p]ay the value of lost or damaged property!,]\u201d but is not responsible to \u201cpay on a replacement cost basis for any loss or damage: (1) Until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced; and (2) Unless the repairs or replacement are made as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or damage.\u201d Consequently, because the structure was razed rather than replaced either <em>in situ </em>or by other property, the trial court was in error to base its determination on replacement cost. <em>See Ruter v. Northwestern Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>72 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 472, 178 A.2d 640 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>229, 181 A.2d 12 (1962); <em>cf. Elberon Bathing Co. v.

Koenders, Annotation, <em>Construction and Effect of Property Insurance Provision Permitting Recovery of Replacement Cost of Property, </em>1 A.L.R.5th 817, 848-54 (1992 &amp; Supp.1996); Dag E. Ytreberg, Annotation, <em>Construction and Effect of Provision of Property Insurance Policy Permitting Recovery of Replacement Cost of Property, In Excess of Actual Cash Value, </em>66 A.L.R.3d 885, 887-92 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The remaining substantive question is whether defendant is liable for the actual cash value of only the damaged portion of the premises or whether, by reason of the application of the municipal ordinance, plaintiff is entitled to recover for a \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d of the entire building. We have been given no reason to depart from the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that governs such situations, as applied in <em>Feinbloom v. Camden Fire Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. 541, 149 </em>A.2d 616 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 30 N.J. 154, 152 </em>A.2d 172 (1959), widely considered to be a leading case in the field:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">[I]f \u201cby reason of public regulations rebuilding is prohibited the loss is total, although some portion of the building remains which might otherwise have been available in rebuilding.\u201d 45 <em>C.J.S.

Evins, Annotation, <em>Insurer\u2019s Liability as Affected by Refusal of Public Authorities to Permit Reconstruction or Repair After Fire, </em>90 A.L.R.2d 790 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">To the extent standard fire insurance policy language in this regard was modified subsequent to our decision in <em>Feinbloom, </em>as defendant stresses, no contrary result is indicated. The stated exclusion in the policy at issue is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>1.

Cases involving only a partial loss \u2014 with the amount of the cost of repair increased by reason of the requirements of law, ordinance or regulation \u2014 embody different considerations leading to different results. <em>See, e.g., Regency Baptist Temple v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>352 So.2d 1242, 1243-44 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977); <em>Cohen Furniture Co. v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>214 <em>Ill.

They should not be subjected to technical encumbrances or to hidden pitfalls and their policies should be construed liberally in their favor to the end that coverage is afforded \u201cto the full extent that any fair interpretation will allow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\"><em>[Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961) (quoting <em>Danek v.

Wherever possible the phraseology must be liberally construed in favor of the insured; if doubtful, \u25a0 uncertain, or ambiguous, or reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, the construction conferring coverage is to be adopted. And exclusionary clauses of doubtful import are strictly construed against the insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\"><em>[Hunt v. Hospital Serv. Plan, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>98, 102-03,162 A.2d 561 (1960).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>See also Ruter, supra, </em>72 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 471, 178 A.2d 640; <em>cf. Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The exclusion with which we are confronted applies generally to losses resulting from governmental orders to destroy, as where a structure has become unsafe by reason of deterioration or other non-eatastrophic causes. If, in the face of the general rule, defendant had sought to exclude responsibility for enhanced losses occasioned by a governmental requirement to raze the balance of property substantially destroyed by a catastrophic occurrence, it could have stated the exclusion with far greater clarity than it did in the policy at issue. We hold, therefore, in accordance with the general rule, that plaintiff was entitled to be compensated for a total loss of the property so destroyed. We remand for a determination of the actual cash value of the property as of the time of the fire, when the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We hold also that defendant is responsible for payment of interest on plaintiffs claim in accordance with the payment schedule provided in the policy, <em>i.e., </em>from thirty days after plaintiff submitted her sworn proof of loss. Defendant has made no payment to plaintiff on account of the loss, not even an amount representing what defendant concedes was due and owing on the claim. The general rule in New Jersey is that, in the absence of special circumstances militating against such an award, prejudgment interest is payable for an insurer\u2019s failure to pay a claim for an insured fire loss. <em>Polito v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>689 F.2d 457, 461-62 (3rd Cir.1982). <em>See also </em>Kristine Cordier Karnezis, Annotation, <em>Insured\u2019s Right to Recover from Insurer Prejudgment Interest on Amount of Fire Loss, </em>5 A.L.R. 4th 126 (1981 &amp; Supp.1996). Our contrary holding in <em>Feinbloom </em>was based in large part upon the novelty of the question presented, 54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 149 A.2d 616, no longer a factor since that case was decided. To hold now that plaintiff was not entitled to prejudgment interest would be to reward an insurer for refusing to discharge its clearly established contractual responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Whether plaintiff\u2019s contract claim is seen as liquidated or unliquidated, a factor of significance in <em>Feinbloom, see ibid,., </em>is of no consequence under currently prevailing principles. Where the equities are in the injured party\u2019s favor, prejudgment interest can be awarded irrespective of whether the claim is liquidated or unliquidated. <em>Swatek, Inc. v.
