We conclude that the statute involves commercial speech which does not trigger the strict scrutiny standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute passes constitutional muster, and hence we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">N.J.S.A. 2C:34-7 was enacted by <em>L. </em>1995, c. 230, effective September 15, 1995. The sign provisions of the statute are just one subdivision of buffering and site provisions contained in a comprehensive legislative package aimed at sexually oriented businesses. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">Sexually oriented businesses; restrictions on location and display of signs; perimeter buffer requirements</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">a. Except as provided in a municipal zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to N.J.S. 2C:34~2, no person shall operate a sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of any existing sexually oriented business, or any church, synagogue, temple or other place of public worship, or any elementary or secondary school or any school bus stop, or any municipal or county playground or place of public resort and recreation, or within 1,000 feet of any area zoned for residential use. This subsection shall not apply to a sexually oriented business already lawfully operating on the effective date of this act where another sexually oriented business, an elementary or secondary school or school bus stop, or any municipal or county playground or place of public resort and recreation is subsequently established within 1,000 feet, or a residential district or residential lot is subsequently established within 1,000 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">b. Every sexually oriented business shall be surrounded by a perimeter buffer of at least 50 feet in width with plantings, fence, or other physical divider along the outside of the perimeter sufficient to impede the view of the interior of the premises in which the business is located. The municipality may, by ordinance, require the perimeter buffer to meet additional requirements or standards. This subsection shall not apply to a sexually oriented business already lawfully operating on the effective date of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>c. No sexually oriented business shall display more than two exterior signs, consisting of one identification sign and one sign giving notice that the premises are off limits to minors. The identification sign shall be no more than 40 square feet in size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">d. A person who violates this section is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7(c),(d)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The sponsors\u2019 statement to Assembly Bill No. 252 (A-252) indicates that one purpose of the sign restrictions is to further the government\u2019s interest in reducing motor vehicle accidents by eliminating distractions caused by numerous signs. Facially, the statute also reflects a concern for the welfare of minors. This concern is also clear from the legislative history accompanying the package of bills<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enacted to regulate sexually oriented businesses, and the specific reference in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7(c) requiring one sign to indicate that the establishment is \u201coff limits to minors.\u201d Both aims are appropriate under the State\u2019s police power and general welfare responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Our inquiry is limited when reviewing legislative motive. <em>See Michael M. v.

Subsection (c) of the statute was enacted in conjunction with a wide variety of regulations aimed at ameliorating the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. These regulations prohibit the use of private booths, restrict the location of sexually oriented businesses within a community and prescribe buffering standards. As we interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7(c), its predominant purpose is to strike a balance between the right of sexually oriented businesses to reasonably announce their presence to potential patrons and the legislative perception that sexually oriented signage on a large scale creates distractions which interfere with traffic safety. Subsection (c) also reinforces the statutory prohibition against minor children frequenting these businesses. Moreover, as we note <em>infra, </em>this section was part of a legislative package aimed at other police power concerns. We can find nothing in the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>history to suggest that the Legislature intended to curb political or noncommercial speech, and as we read the statute it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">While the Legislature may single out sexually oriented businesses as a basis for regulating commercial speech, this form of speech is protected under the First Amendment if it is not misleading and pertains to lawful activity. <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of New York, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>557, 561, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2343, 2348-2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341, 348 (1980); <em>Matter of Anis, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>448, 456, 599 A.2d 1265, <em>cert. denied, sub nom.

Even protected commercial speech may be regulated if the regulation \u201cdirectly advance[s] a substantial government interest\u201d and is \u201cappropriately tailored to that purpose.\u201d <em>Matter of Anis, supra </em>(126 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 599 A.2d 1265) (citing <em>Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>91, 100, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2281, 2287, 110 L.Ed.2d 83, 94 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The regulation of signs and billboards has long been recognized as serving the government\u2019s substantial interest in traffic safety. <em>See Metromedia Inc. v. San Diego, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>490, 509, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2882, 2893, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>800, 816 (1981); <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc. v.

In fact, sign restrictions directed specifically at sexually oriented businesses have been upheld in the interest of preserving neighborhoods and protecting minors. <em>See SDJ, Inc. v. City of Houston, supra </em>(837 F.2d at 1280); <em>Borrago v. City of Louisville, supra </em>(456 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 33). Such businesses have been found to have deleterious effects on minors by promoting juvenile delinquency, contributing to an overall increase in crime, leading to the general deterioration of neighborhoods, and lowering property values. <em>See SDJ, Inc. v. City of Houston, supra </em>(837 F.2d at 1280); <em>Borrago v. City of Louisville, supra </em>(456 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The Legislature was presumably responding to these concerns in enacting the package of bills that included what became <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7. <em>See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>41, 51, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>925, 931, 89 L.Ed.2d 29, 40 (1986). On the legislative record, objective lawmakers could reasonably conclude that sexually oriented businesses are associated with higher crime rates and cause a deterioration in the quality of neighborhood life. By isolating these businesses through dispersal, perimeter buffers, and signage restrictions included in <em>L. </em>1995, c. 230, they addressed these legitimate concerns while still allowing these businesses to advertise and operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">A statute regulating commercial speech cannot be substantially broader than necessary. <em>Matter of Anis, supra </em>(126 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 599 A.2d 1265) (citing <em>Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois, supra </em>(496 <em>U.S. </em>at 100, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2287, 110 L.Ed.2d at 94). But in addressing substantial needs, the government must be afforded \u201ca reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems.\u201d <em>City of Pasco v. Rhine, </em>51 <em>Wash.App. </em>354, 753 <em>P. </em>2d 993, 997 (1988)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (quoting <em>Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra </em>(475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at 52, <em>106 S.Ct. </em>at 931, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 41) (quoting <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., supra </em>(427 <em>U.S. </em>at 71, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2452, 49 L.Ed.2d at 327))). There must be a <em>\u201crational relationship </em>between limiting advertising ... and the substantial interest [the government] has in mitigating the secondary impacts----\u201d <em>City of Pasco v. Rhine, supra </em>(753 P.2d at 997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7(c) is not substantially broader than necessary. The two sign limitation is justified given the undesirable secondary effects that such signs attract, <em>e.g., </em>higher incidents of crime, child delinquency. <em>See Borrago, supra </em>(456 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 33); <em>Dover News, Inc. v. City of Dover, </em>117 <em>N.H. </em>1066, 381 A.2d 752, 755-56 (1977). Indeed, the statute has \u201cstopped short of fully accomplishing its ends. It has not prohibited all [signs]----\u201d <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, supra </em>(453 <em>U.S. </em>at 508, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2898, 69 L.Ed.2d at 815). <em>Compare SDJ, Inc. v. City of Houston, supra </em>(837 F.2d 1268); <em>with Basiardanes v. City of Galveston, </em>682 <em>F. 2d </em>1203 (5th Cir.1982) (total ban on outside advertising impermissible). Not only does the statute allow two signs to be posted but it in no way proscribes other modes of advertisement. Additionally, the statute does not inhibit in any way the material that may be displayed within the store nor does it place any significant limitation on what may be advertised upon the business\u2019s two signs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The Law Division also held the statute void for vagueness. The State took the position in the trial court that an \u201cidentification sign\u201d as designated in the statute pertained to \u201cname only\u201d signs. The judge found that \u201cidentification\u201d could mean more than name only, and therefore was impermissibly vague. On appeal the State concedes that the word \u201cidentification\u201d connotes more than the name of the establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The vagueness doctrine is premised on the notion that the law must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>104, 108, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2294, 2298, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>222, 227 (1972). A common sense approach is required in reading the legislative enactment, <em>SDJ, Inc. v. City of Houston, supra </em>(837 F.2d at 1278), in terms of the persons who may be subject to it, <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 118-120, 462 A.2d 573 (1983), and read it in context with its intended purpose. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985). It is our duty to endeavor to interpret a statute so that it may comply with constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As we interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7(c), an identification sign may communicate not only the name of the establishment, but also the street number, telephone number, operating hours and general nature of the establishment in order to identify the business. Such a requirement is not vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> Apparently, plaintiffs' signs advertise the type of products sold, operating hours and location of entrances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\"> As this statute applies only to commercial speech, it need only be given an intermediate level of scrutiny. <em>Florida Bar v.
