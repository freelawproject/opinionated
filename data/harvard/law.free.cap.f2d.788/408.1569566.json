The CFTC declined to reconsider its summary affirmance of an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cAU\u201d) dismissal of this matter. We deny Chapman\u2019s petition for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Chapman, as a trustee of the Mars Three Trust, opened an account with the International Trading Group (\u201cITG\u201d) in December 1981. ITG is a firm registered with the CFTC as a commodity broker. Chapman also executed a power of attorney authorizing Ira Skazal, an ITG associate, to trade without Chapman\u2019s authority when a trading decision was required and when Chapman was unavailable for instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">ITG subsequently purchased for Chapman seven gold put options by Mocatta Metals Corporation (\u201cMocatta\u201d), of which three were sold at a profit and four expired, thus causing Chapman to lose the premiums on the expired options. Chapman responded to this loss by filing a reparations complaint against ITG with the CFTC on August 23, 1983, alleging deception and breach of contract. In its answer, ITG denied these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">An AU was assigned to this matter on May 1, 1984, and he set a discovery schedule on May 13. By a notice dated May 31, 1984, the AU set an evidentiary hearing for September 18,1984, in Chicago, Illinois. Both parties were also ordered to advise the CFTC Proceedings Clerk in writing before August 31, 1984, as to whether or not they intended to participate in this hearing. A failure to comply with this directive was deemed to constitute a waiver of oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">ITG then began the discovery process by sending both interrogatories and document requests to Chapman, who on June 11, 1984, filed a letter objecting to these requests as both burdensome and irrelevant. He further claimed that ITG had possession of all responsive documents. Chapman also wrote that he believed a hearing was unnecessary, but if one was required, that the Chicago site be changed to either New York or Boston. The AU responded by asking Chapman to \u201cmake a good faith effort to comply with [ITG\u2019s] ... discovery requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">When Chapman failed to provide ITG\u2019s requested materials, ITG moved for an order compelling discovery. Oh July 10, 1984, the AU ordered Chapman to provide all responsive information by August 13, 1984, cautioning that a \u201c[f]ailure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>may result in sanctions, including dismissal.\u201d In addition, the AU set the hearing for October 24, 1984, in New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">On July 31, 1984, Chapman moved for reconsideration of the July 10th order compelling discovery. He claimed that he did not receive this order until July 30, 1984, at his New England address, and that it was thus impossible for him to respond by August 13, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">ITG moved for sanctions on August 27, 1984, against Chapman for his failure to produce discovery, and Chapman did not file any opposition to ITG\u2019s motion. On October 11, 1984, the AU granted ITG\u2019s motion and dismissed Chapman\u2019s case. The CFTC summarily affirmed the AU\u2019s decision on May 30, 1985, concluding that Chapman\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order and his refusal to confirm his appearance at the hearing justified dismissal. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.35 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Chapman responded by filing a document entitled \u201cNon-Acceptance of Order of Summary Affirmance Received 6-22-85,\u201d and the CFTC, treating this as a motion for reconsideration, denied the motion on August 29, 1985. On September 4, 1985, Chapman petitioned this court to review the CFTC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">On appeal, Chapman contends that he was denied both \u201creliable and adequate communications\u201d as well as \u201cequal due process.\u201d He concedes that his argument lacks \u201ca well-known basis in precedent,\u201d and he struggles to'present a legally cognizable claim. The CFTC, on the other hand, focuses on whether it abused its discretion by refusing to reconsider its order summarily affirming the AU\u2019s dismissal of Chapman\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Our role in reviewing CFTC reparation orders is extremely narrow, <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 888, 892-93 (7th Cir.1983), as \u201cthe findings of the Commission, as to the facts, if supported by the weight of the evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d 7 U.8.C. \u00a7 9. The function of this court is something other than that of mechanically reweighing the evidence to ascertain in which direction it \u201cpreponderates\u201d; it is rather to review the record with the purpose of determining whether the finder of fact \u2014 here the AU \u2014 was justified. <em>Silverman v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>549 F.2d 28, 30 (7th Cir.1977). In addition, this court has consistently deferred to an administrative agency\u2019s discretion regarding procedural rulings such as discovery sanctions. <em>See Simmons, </em>698 F.2d at 892 (citing <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Counsel, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 543, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1211, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The CFTC promulgates regulations which prescribe possible sanctions for a party\u2019s failure to comply with discovery rulings, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.66, even though \u201cthere is no basic constitutional right to pretrial discovery\u201d in CFTC proceedings. <em>Silverman, </em>549 F.2d at 33 (quoting <em>Starr v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>226 F.2d 721, 722 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 993, 76 S.Ct. 542, 100 L.Ed. 859 (1956)). If a party fails to comply with a notice relating to discovery, the AU may decide against that party. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.-66. Here, Chapman failed to produce responsive documents in violation of the AU\u2019s order of July 10, 1984. Thus, the October 11, 1984, dismissal was an extreme, yet appropriate sanction for Chapman\u2019s failure to file timely and complete responses to interrogatories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Loctite </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Corp. v. Fel-Pro, </em>667 F.2d 577, 583 (7th Cir.1981) (citing <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, </em>427 U.S. 639, 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976)). <em>See also Tamari v. Bache &amp; Co. (Lebanon) S.A.L., </em>729 F.2d 469 (7th Cir.1984) (discussing sanctions for violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)). As this agency sanction was within statutory limits, it can be upset only if it reflects an abuse of discretion. <em>American Power &amp; Light Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, </em>329 U.S. 90, 112-13, 67 S.Ct. 133, 145-46, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946); <em>Butz v. Glover Livestock Commission Co., </em>411 U.S. 182, 185\u2014 86, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 1457-58, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973); <em>Locascio v. Teletype Corp., </em>694 F.2d 497, 499 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 1876, 76 L.Ed.2d 808 (1983); <em>Haltmier v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>554 F.2d 556, 563 (2d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Chapman\u2019s final contention is that the ALJ\u2019s order evidences bias against him. This allegation of partiality, if proven, would indicate an abuse of discretion. Chapman\u2019s contention, however, lacks even the remotest support in the record. We presume that CFTC officials and ALJs dispassionately perform their responsibilities. <em>Myron v. Chicoine, </em>678 F.2d 727, 733 (7th Cir.1982) (citing <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941)). Chapman fails to rebut this presumption, for he does not allege facts that would reveal the AU\u2019s bias or prejudice. Such partiality \u201cmust stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\u201d <em>Ma v. Community Bank, </em>686 F.2d 459, 472 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 962, 103 S.Ct. 287, 74 L.Ed.2d 273 (1982) (quoting <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966)). <em>See also Mitchell v. Premex, Inc., </em>2 Comm. FutL.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 22,556 (CFTC March 29, 1975) (claim of ALJ\u2019s bias was legally insufficient). Nowhere does Chapman suggest that the ALJ\u2019s bias stems from an extrajudicial source. Nor does Chapman demonstrate that the ALJ\u2019s opinions on the merits of the case were based on information other than that he learned from participation in the case. Merely reciting that the \u201cAD continued non-recognition of Petitioner/Complainant\u2019s reciprocal rights to discovery\u201d without more fails to constitute disqualifying judicial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Chapman\u2019s dismissal was the product of his own creation: his neglect of the AD\u2019s orders and his flagrant nonparticipation in the discovery process provided a justifiable basis for the AD\u2019s sanctions. Accordingly, we deny Chapman\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">. The CFTC ordinarily defers to the ALJ\u2019s choice of discovery sanctions. <em>See Fink v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>2 Comm.Fut.L.Rep. (CCH) if 22,-745 (CFTC Sept. 16, 1985). Since the CFTC frequently looks to federal courts for guidance in dealing with neglect in discovery matters, <em>Joubert v. Chartered Systems Corp. of New York, </em>2 Comm.Fut.L.Rep. (CCH) 1f 22,481 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1985), the respondents ask us to apply essentially the same standards for Section 12.66 as we do with Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b). This seems to be an apt analogy, and as Chapman has exhibited a disregard for the judicial process by failing to participate in discovery, we shall uphold the dismissal. <em>See United States v. An Undetermined Quantity of an Article of Drug Labeled </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>as Benylin Cough Syrup, </em>583 F.2d 942, 947 (7th Cir.1978). We expect parties at least to inquire as to the status of their case, <em>Berm Sager Chemicals International v. E. Targosz &amp; Co., </em>560 F.2d 805, 809-11 (7th Cir.1977), and Chapman\u2019s lack of diligence justified the ALJ\u2019s action. <em>See Lo-cascio, </em>694 F.2d at 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
