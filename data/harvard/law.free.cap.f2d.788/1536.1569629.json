The application states that no reasonably prudent party would have appealed as Magna-Graphics did, the most recent appeal again being meant. Our understanding as to our duty in the infrequent case of an application under section 285, to us instead of to the trial court, is stated in <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Company v. Crystal Chemical Company, </em>736 F.2d 688, 222 USPQ 97 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 172, 83 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-7\">We believe it is not unjust for Paper Converting to continue to bear its own counsel fees inasmuch as its treble damages award is by definition largely in excess of the actual injury and should also cover counsel fees in whole or in major part. However that may be, the dissent filed in this panel tends to refute the idea that Magna-Graphics was so unreasonable as to render this appeal exceptional. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. Therefore, the application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
