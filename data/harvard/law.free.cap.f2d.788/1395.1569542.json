Pruett cites as error the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his pretrial motion for a continuance due to the unforeseen absence of a subpoenaed material witness, Doug Nix. Pruett\u2019s counsel requested the continuance on the day of trial, explaining in chambers that Nix would not be appearing at trial because his father had died and Nix was travelling to another state to attend the funeral. The motion was denied for the reason that Nix\u2019s testimony was determined by the court to be cumulative. After oral argument on appeal, we remanded the case to the district court for a hearing to determine the materiality of Nix\u2019s intended testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-14\">Pursuant to our remand, the district court conducted a hearing on February 11, 1986 and issued an order certifying to this court its findings made based upon those proceedings. The district court described Nix\u2019s testimony, reaffirmed its earlier conclusion that Nix\u2019s testimony was cumulative to the evidence presented to the jury at trial, and found that Pruett was not unfairly prejudiced by the continuance\u2019s denial. After review of the entire record, including the district court\u2019s findings from the hearing on remand, we now conclude that it was prejudicial error to deny Pruett\u2019s motion for a continuance. We reverse and remand to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-15\">There is little question that a district court has wide discretion in ruling on motions for continuances, and a court\u2019s exercise of that discretion will rarely be overturned. <em>See United States v. Little, </em>567 F.2d 346, 348 (8th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 1608, 56 L.Ed.2d 60 (1978) (citations omitted). This court has previously listed five factors which a trial court should balance in ruling on a motion for a continuance, including the nature of the case, the diligence of the party requesting the continuance, the opposing party\u2019s conduct, the effect of the delay on both parties, and the asserted need for the continuance. <em>United States v. Bernhardt, </em>642 F.2d 251, 252 (8th Cir.1981) (per curiam), citing <em>Little, </em>567 F.2d at 348-49. Though no single factor is dispositive in determining whether a continuance is warranted, it is our view that the district court did not properly balance these factors in the context of the record that was before it when its ruling was made, <em>see United States v. Olson, </em>697 F.2d 273, 275 (8th Cir.1983), appeal after remand, 730 F.2d 544 (8th Cir.1984), and that it was an abuse of discretion to deny Pruett\u2019s continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>The record shows that Pruett\u2019s asserted need for the continuance was based on the death of Nix\u2019s father immediately before the trial and the materiality of Nix\u2019s testimony to Pruett\u2019s defense. Sudden exigencies and unforeseen circumstances are facts that militate in favor of a continuance. <em>Little, </em>567 F.2d at 349. Not only do we believe that the death immediately before trial of the parent of one of the defendant\u2019s two material witnesses scheduled to testify is a sudden exigency or unforeseen circumstance, but this court has previously recognized that a personal tragedy may be grounds to grant a motion for a continuance. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Wyrick, </em>653 F.2d 1234, 1241 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1149, 102 S.Ct. 1013, 71 L.Ed.2d 302 (1982) (defense witness should have been available to testify in murder trial on less than a day\u2019s notice, barring a personal tragedy). While not dispositive in determining whether a continuance should be granted, we do not believe that this factor is one to be lightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-5\">The factor which weighed most heavily in the district court\u2019s determination that denial of a continuance was appropriate was whether Nix\u2019s testimony was material to Pruett\u2019s defense. The record reveals that the success' of the government\u2019s case against Pruett relied in part on drawing an inference from the presence of a gun on a table in Pruett\u2019s apartment to indicate Pruett\u2019s dominion and control over that gun sufficient to constitute constructive possession of the weapon. <em>See </em>1 E. Devitt &amp; C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 16.07 (3d ed. 1977); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>506 F.2d 640, 642-43 n. 4 (8th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 978, 95 S.Ct. 1404, 43 L.Ed.2d 659 (1975) (elements of constructive possession). Pruett\u2019s defense was based on the testimony of two witnesses, Gene Veasey and Nix, who had been at Pruett\u2019s apartment the day before the discovery of the gun in Pruett\u2019s home. Veasey testified at trial that he owned the gun and that he brought the gun to Pruett\u2019s home the day before the gun\u2019s discovery pursuant to an earlier discussion between Veasey and Nix, in which Nix had indicated he was considering obtaining a weapon for his wife\u2019s use. Nix\u2019s intended testimony, as the district court\u2019s order indicates, was substantially similar to Veasey\u2019s account. Pruett\u2019s attorney argued to the district court that Nix\u2019s testimony was material because it would corroborate Veasey\u2019s version of the facts and enhance the credibility of Pruett\u2019s defense against the government\u2019s case of constructive possession. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-7\">While it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the effect an absent witness\u2019s testimony would have had on the jury\u2019s deliberations, we note that we are presented here not with the absence of an additional witness when several others have given substantially similar testimony, but with the absence of the only other party to the transaction who could corroborate Veasey\u2019s testimony and exculpate Pruett. It is axiomatic that the art of persuasion often turns on the skill of corroboration. Contrary to the district court\u2019s evaluation of Nix\u2019s intended testimony as cumulative or as mere surplusage to the evidence already presented at trial, we believe that the fact that Nix\u2019s testimony tracked Veasey\u2019s does not defeat but rather reinforces a finding of materiality. We believe that Nix\u2019s testimony was crucial to Pruett\u2019s defense, and that it was error for the district court to find that it was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-8\">In addition, although there is no allegation that the government\u2019s conduct was improper, we also note that there has been no showing by the government that a continuance would have adversely affected the government\u2019s prosecution of this case. And although the facts of this case may not appear especially complex, we find that the burden the defendant must shoulder here to rebut the government\u2019s constructive possession case when one of two crucial witnesses is unavailable militates in favor of granting an extension of time for trial. Moreover, Pruett\u2019s counsel timely informed the court of Nix\u2019s absence as soon as he learned of it. We do not believe that under these circumstances a lack of due diligence was demonstrated when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>Pruett\u2019s counsel did not request the trial court to enforce the subpoena and intercept the witness on the way to his father\u2019s funeral, as counsel for the government contends. This is not a case where the district court had already granted one or more continuances at the defendant\u2019s request, <em>see, e.g., Bernhardt, </em>642 F.2d at 252, nor was the motion grounded in defense counsel\u2019s own failure to subpoena a potential witness, <em>see, e.g., United States v. DeCo-teau, </em>648 F.2d 1191, 1192 (8th Cir.1981) (per curiam). Rather, Pruett\u2019s counsel consistently indicated to the court that Nix\u2019s testimony was necessary to corroborate Veasey\u2019s account of the facts, a representation that was borne out by Nix\u2019s testimony at the remand hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-4\">In light of the factors described herein, we find it was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion to deny defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance. The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the district court for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1490-11\">. The Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1492-9\">. Pruett also argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of two police officers regarding fingerprint testing and analysis. Because we remand for a new trial on other grounds, we do not address this second alleged error here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1492-5\">ROSS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"a5c-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-6\">I respectfully dissent. In my view the majority has ignored the clear import of the record and, in a decision that pays lip service to our prescribed standard of review, substituted its judgment for that of the district court. I take this position for the following two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-7\">First, in my opinion, the majority has reversed the district court\u2019s decision based on an assumption not supported by the record. The majority writes: \u201c[t]he record reveals that the success of the government\u2019s case against Pruett relied in part on drawing an inference from the presence of a gun on a table in Pruett\u2019s apartment to indicate Pruett\u2019s dominion and control over that gun sufficient to. constitute constructive possession of the weapon.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at. 1397. I read the record quite differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-8\">The government\u2019s case consisted of the testimony of three witnesses; the two arresting officers and a third officer who testified, without any cross-examination, that the gun in question was operational. Both of the arresting officers testified that Pruett made a statement after he was arrested and after he had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Each officer testified separately that Pruett said he had the gun \u201cbecause some people were after him.\u201d Tr. 12; 21; 30. Upon cross-examination, Pruett\u2019s attorney attempted to impeach the officers\u2019 testimony on this point, but met with little apparent success. Both officers stated that they had no doubt that Pruett made the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-13\">It seems clear to me that the success of the government\u2019s case resulted from the evidence of Pruett\u2019s own statement, as testified to by both arresting officers. Pruett\u2019s statement was the linchpin of the government\u2019s case and the credibility of the officers\u2019 testimony was the focus of the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. This was not a conviction based only on an inference drawn from finding the gun on a table in Pruett\u2019s apartment as suggested by the majority. This was a case built on the testimony of two police officers who swore under oath that Pruett said he had the gun because some people were after him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-14\">Second, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s re-balancing of the <em>Little </em>factors or its conclusion that the district court\u2019s denial of Pruett\u2019s motion constituted an abuse of discretion. In <em>Little </em>this court advised that \u201c[t]he evaluation and balancing of these factors, as well as other additional factors that may arise, rest with the district judge, and he must be afforded a substantial amount of discretion in his decisionmaking in this area of the law.\u201d 567 F.2d at 349. Given this standard of review, I have no trouble concluding that the district court should be affirmed, based upon my review of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-15\">At the time the motion was made the district court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>Let\u2019s let the record show that the Court has met informally with Counsel in chambers on a pre-trial conference and the Defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that he would apply for a continuance for the reason that one of the witnesses subpoenaed by the Defendant has indicated by telephone call this morning to Counsel for the Defendant that his father has just died and that it is necessary that he go to the State of Kentucky for the funeral. The witness was under subpoena, as we understand it, and even though he has had this problem, he is not appearing in Court and is simply telling Counsel that he\u2019s not coming. Counsel is unsure at this stage, as the Court understands it, as to when the witness will return to the State of Missouri or whether he\u2019s actually gone at this time. We\u2019ve done some preliminary consideration as to what the testimony of that witness would be and it appears that it might be somewhat cumulative and that possibily [sic] some of that testimony would be corroborated in other ways, in any event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-5\">The Court feels, as a result of this conversation, that the witness is not an indispensable witness to the Defendant and that his testimony in all probability will be covered by that of other witnesses, and for this reason the motion for the continuance will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1493-6\">Tr. 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-7\">A fair reading of this ruling reflects that the primary basis for the district court\u2019s pre-trial decision was its understanding that Nix\u2019s testimony would be cumulative. There can be no doubt that this appraisal was correct. The district court\u2019s assessment that it would be cumulative is borne out by a review of Veasey\u2019s trial testimony and Nix\u2019s subsequent testimony at the remand hearing. It is not necessary to repeat their accounts, for even the majority agrees that Nix\u2019s intended testimony \u201cwas substantially similar to Veasey\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-9\">However, the majority proceeds to deem the district court\u2019s assessment of Nix\u2019s testimony to be prejudicial error; a conclusion I cannot adopt. The majority errs, in my view, by interjecting its own view that this admittedly cumulative testimony was so crucial, and its absence so prejudicial that the denial of the continuance warrants a reversal of Pruett\u2019s conviction and a whole new trial. I would be inclined to agree with the majority had Veasey not testified and had the jury not heard the testimony of the two arresting officers regarding Pruett\u2019s own statement. But, as I read the record, the jury was presented with the substance of Pruett\u2019s defense by way of Veasey\u2019s testimony, but chose, instead, to believe the arresting officers\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-10\">For these reasons, I cannot join in a reversal and I would affirm Pruett\u2019s conviction in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
