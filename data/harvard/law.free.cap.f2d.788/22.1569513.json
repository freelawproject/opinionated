The petitioner, Reckitt &amp; Colman, Ltd., complains that the DEA Administrator\u2019s designation of bupre-norphine as a narcotic rests on an improper determination that buprenorphine is a derivative of the opiate drug thebaine. Because we conclude that the Administrator\u2019s definition of the statutory term \u201cderivative\u201d represents a permissible construction of the Act, and that substantial record evidence supports the Administrator\u2019s conclusion that buprenorphine falls within this definition, we affirm the Administrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-22\">The Controlled Substances Act is a comprehensive regulatory measure that divides the universe of hazardous drugs into different schedules subject to varying degrees of control. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (1982). The Act also designates certain substances as \u201cnarcotic drugs.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 802(16). In general, the severity of restrictions imposed on the marketing of controlled drugs depends more on what schedule a drug is placed in than on whether it is designated a narcotic. Classification as a narcotic, however, does circumscribe the manner and extent of a drug\u2019s importation and exportation, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 952-53, and its use in drug detoxification programs, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 823(g). Moreover, criminal penalties for violations of the Act are harsher if a narcotic sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>stance is involved. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1). And, in practical terms, the DEA\u2019s classification of a drug as a narcotic may be expected to impair a drug manufacturer\u2019s marketing freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Under the Act, any \u201cderivative\u201d of opium or an opiate is classified as a narcotic drug.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Buprenorphine is a relatively new drug, produced from the opium constituent thebaine, that has been developed for medical use as a pain reliever. Although bupre-norphine is marketed in many foreign countries, Reckitt &amp; Colman has attempted to introduce it into the United States only recently. In May 1982, the Department of Health and Human Services notified the DEA Administrator that a new drug application for buprenorphine had been approved. HHS recommended that the DEA Administrator modify buprenorphine\u2019s status as a Schedule II controlled substance under the Act to the less restricted status of Schedule V. HHS also recommended, however, that buprenorphine continue to be classified as a narcotic drug on the ground that it is a thebaine derivative.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In September 1982, the Administrator issued a notice of proposed rulemaking indicating that buprenorphine would be transferred to Schedule Y but would retain its classification as a narcotic. 47 Fed.Reg. 41,401 (1982). Reckitt &amp; Colman objected, urging that buprenorphine should be entirely decontrolled and that it should not be designated a narcotic. The matter was set for an on-the-record hearing before an administrative law judge. In October 1984, the AU issued an opinion essentially agreeing with Reckitt &amp; Colman\u2019s position. The DEA Administrator, however, rejected the ALJ\u2019s conclusions and issued a final order placing buprenorphine in Schedule V and retaining its designation as a narcotic. 50 Fed.Reg. 8104 (1985). Although Reckitt &amp; Colman has abandoned its objection to the placement of buprenorphine in Schedule V, it challenges that part of the Administrator\u2019s order maintaining buprenor-phine\u2019s narcotic classification. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">Reckitt &amp; Colman contends that in maintaining buprenorphine\u2019s narcotic classification, the DEA Administrator adopted an unprecedented and improper definition of the statutory term \u201cderivative.\u201d To be sure, this is a fairly unusual case. In the course of the administrative proceedings, it became apparent that the derivative status of a substance is a more complicated and uncertain matter than previously thought by the agency. Buprenorphine had heretofore been considered a derivative of the-baine simply because it is prepared from thebaine. Under modern technological methods, however, it is possible to prepare aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and, apparently, even water from thebaine. Thus, a more refined (and restrictive) definition of \u201cderivative\u201d was obviously needed. But neither the Act nor its legislative history purport to define what a derivative is. Under these circumstances, the Administrator indicated that the agency would regard as a derivative of a drug any substance (1) prepared from that drug, (2) which chemically resembles that drug, and (3) which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>has some of the adverse effects of that drug. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. 8104, 8107 (1985). The Administrator then concluded, \u201cBupre-norphine possesses sufficient opiate-like actions and does so resemble the structure of its parent, thebaine, that it must be considered to be a derivative thereof____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Reckitt &amp; Colman argues that the Administrator\u2019s construction of the Act is flawed because it defines the term \u201cderivative\u201d too broadly. In the petitioner\u2019s view, a substance may rightly be regarded as a derivative of another only if it can be produced from it in only one or two chemical operations. (Buprenorphine is produced from thebaine in six or seven steps). The Administrator rejected this narrow \u201ctwo-step\u201d definition. He felt that \u201c[t]o attribute great significance to the actual number of chemical steps is misleading\u201d\u2014 that what is important, rather, is the overall chemical similarity of the product to its parent. <em>Id. </em>We conclude that this aspect of the Administrator\u2019s definition is \u201csufficiently reasonable\u201d to warrant judicial deference. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., </em>454 U.S. 27, 39, 102 S.Ct. 38, 46, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981). Although the Administrator was not necessarily required to follow a strictly scientific definition, <em>cf. United States v. An Article of Drug ... Bacto-Unidisk...., </em>394 U.S. 784, 792, 798, 89 S.Ct. 1410, 1418, 22 L.Ed.2d 726 (1969),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the definition he adopted is nevertheless consistent with that employed by chemists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Reckitt &amp; Colman also argues that the Administrator erred in considering a substance\u2019s pharmacological effects as an aspect of the definition of \u201cderivative.\u201d Reckitt &amp; Colman maintains that whether one substance is a derivative of another is solely a question of the two substance\u2019s chemical relationship. Under the Act, substances with addictive potential comparable to morphine are classified as \u201copiates,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(17) (1982), and hence narcotics, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 802(16)(A). Thus, the petitioner contends, the statute\u2019s reference to \u201copiates\u201d exhausts the range of situations in which a substance\u2019s pharmacological attributes bear on whether it is a narcotic. We find this argument uncompelling. Nothing in the Act dictates that the Administrator must blind himself to the abusive consequences associated with a drug short of effects comparable to morphine. Given the Act\u2019s overarching purpose of controlling the distribution of harmful drugs, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 801, we think it quite reasonable that the Administrator sought to confirm the theoretical chemical similarity of buprenorphine to thebaine by examining its real-world effects. As the Administrator noted, \u201cIt is quite clear that addicts recognize buprenor-phine as a narcotic and utilize it as a heroin substitute. They clearly understand that buprenorphine is not aspirin or [Tylenol].\u201d 50 Fed.Reg. 8104, 8107 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">In short, the Administrator has drawn upon his expertise to fashion an interpretation of an undefined and potentially ambiguous statutory term. Because that interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the Act\u2019s purposes, we are obliged to defer to it. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>454 U.S. at 37; <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1072, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 380-82, 385-86, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801-02, 1804, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Reckitt &amp; Colman also argues that the Administrator\u2019s conclusion that buprenorphine falls within this definition is not supported by substantial evidence. Reckitt &amp; Colman does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence introduced regarding buprenorphine\u2019s pharmacological attributes;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Administrator had before him extensive evidence about abuse associated with buprenorphine in West Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. 8104,. 8106 (1985). Instead, Reckitt &amp; Colman focuses its attack on the Administrator\u2019s conclusion that buprenorphine is chemically similar to thebaine. According to the petitioner, the only evidence supporting this finding was the testimony of one witness, Dr. Zelesko, who is employed by intervenor McNeil Pharmaceutical.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The petitioner argues that the AU found this witness\u2019 testimony not credible and that this determination strips the testimony of its probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We note that it is not entirely clear on the record before us that the Administrator treated the chemical similarity issue as one of disputed fact. The parties\u2019 dispute centered on whether the \u201cring structure\u201d of buprenorphine is substantially similar to that of thebaine. All of the experts who testified (including the petitioner\u2019s) agreed that thebaine\u2019s \u201cskeleton\u201d is contained within that of buprenorphine but that an additional side chain of atoms is attached to this skeleton in buprenorphine. They differed over whether the addition of this side chain represented a material change in overall ring structure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Administrator concluded, without elaboration, that the presence of thebaine\u2019s skeleton in buprenorphine\u2019s structure was sufficient to establish the requisite chemical similarity. <em>See id. </em>at 8105. Thus, it may be that the Administrator simply adopted, as part of the governing legal standard, a broader definition of chemical similarity than that advanced by the petitioner. Given the Act\u2019s implicit delegation of authority to the Administrator to fashion such a definition, as well as the expertise that the Administrator presumably brings to bear on the issue, we cannot conclude that the definition adopted was so unreasonable as to be unworthy of judicial deference. <em>See supra </em>Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Even if the question of chemical similarity were treated as a disputed factual issue, we would conclude that substantial evidence supports the Administrator\u2019s resolution of that issue. The Administrator could have accepted Dr. Zelesko\u2019s testimony even though the AU did not. The agency, and not the AU, is the ultimate factfinder. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(b) (1982) (\u201cOn appeal from or review of the initial decision, the agency has all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision____\u201d); <em>Local 310, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. NLRB, </em>587 F.2d 1176, 1180-81 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 853 (D.C.Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). While it is true that reviewing courts must take the AU\u2019s findings into account as part of the record, <em>see Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 496-97, 71 S.Ct. 456, 468-69, 95 L.Ed. 2456 (1951), the significance to be ascribed to them \u201cdepends largely on the importance of credibility in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 469. The dispute in this case centered not on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of historical facts, or other issues for which demeanor evidence would be highly probative, but rather on matters of scientific judgment and expertise. The AU conceded that Dr. Zelesko was \u201ca highly qualified and experienced chemist\u201d but simply found the petitioner\u2019s experts more persuasive. On such matters the Administrator remains free to disagree. We conclude that the Administrator\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Am\">Accordingly, the petition for review is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. The Act defines a \"narcotic drug\" as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">any of the following, whether produced directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of vegetable origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">(A) Opium, coca leaves, and opiates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">(B) A compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation of opium, coca leaves, or opiates____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(16) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">An opiate, in turn, is \"any drug or other substance having an addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability similar to morphine or being capable of conversion into a drug having such addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802(17).</p>\n<p id=\"ag-dedup-0\">It is not disputed that thebaine is an \"opiate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-18\">. Intervenor McNeil Pharmaceutical asserts that only actions scheduling or rescheduling drugs are made appealable to this court by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 and thus the Administrator's action with respect to buprenorphine\u2019s narcotic designation is not appealable. We reject this contention. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 refers to \"[a]ll final determinations, findings, and conclusions of the Attorney General under this subchapter\u201d; nothing in that provision remotely suggests that it is limited to scheduling actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">. Reckitt &amp; Colman contends that because criminal liability may turn on whether a substance is a \"derivative\u201d of another, Congress must have intended that the Administrator adopt a narrow and precise definition. This argument is misconceived. Congress has expressly restricted criminal liability to knowing or intentional violations of the Act, <em>see, e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (1982), and so has obviated any potential due process problems implicated by a vague definition of statutory terms such as \"derivative.\u201d The degree of precision required in formulating such definitions, then, depends upon what means of enforcing the Act the Administrator chooses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">. The Administrator relied upon <em>Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia </em>(5th ed. 1976), which defines a \u201cderivative\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">A term used in organic chemistry to express the relation between certain known or hypothetical substances and the compound formed from them by simple chemical processes in which the nucleus or skeleton of the parent substance exists. Usually the term applies to those compounds where the resulting compound is formed in one step, <em>although a chain of steps may be involved in some cases depending essentially upon how easy it is to identify the \u201cderivative\" within the parent substance</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">50 Fed.Reg. 8104, 8105 (1985) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. Reckitt &amp; Colman does argue that no evidence was introduced supporting the Administrator\u2019s decision to include pharmacological effects within the definition of \u201cderivative.\" But the substantial evidence test only applies to \u201d[f]ind-ings of fact.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 (1982). No record evidence is necessary to support the Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b120-14\">. The Administrator\u2019s order, however, discloses that he also relied upon the statement by bupre-norphine\u2019s developer that it is a thebaine derivative. 50 Fed.Reg. 8104, 8105 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b120-15\">. Dr. Zelesko commented: \"I don\u2019t think it is a major change____ The dog is still there, the tail is longer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b121-16\">. The intervenor\u2019s brief contends, and the Department of Justice agreed at oral argument, that the Administrator\u2019s conclusion that bupre-norphine is a thebaine derivative can be upheld on an alternative ground. According to these parties, HHS\u2019s initial communication to DEA stated that buprenorphine is a thebaine derivative, and the Act makes HHS\u2019s recommendations as to \u201cscientific and medical matters\u201d binding on the DEA. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(b) (1982). If that were so, it is difficult to see what purpose the agency's on-the-record hearing served in this case. Certainly the Administrator did not appear to regard his independent findings on \u201cscientific and medical matters\u201d as superfluous. While we entertain doubts about the soundness of the Justice Department\u2019s interpretation of the Act \u2014 Section 811(b) could be read to indicate only that the DEA must follow HHS\u2019s recommendations on the specified matters in deciding whether to <em>initiate </em>scheduling actions \u2014 our disposition of this case renders it unnecessary for us to decide the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
