The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit subsequently certified the following question to this court: \u201cIs a no-fault insurer which has paid personal injury benefits to its insured injured in a 1981 motor vehicle accident, entitled, under Georgia law, to a right of action by subrogation against the tort-feasor\u2019s liability insurer before its [insured] is fully compensated for uncompensated economic and non-economic losses?\u201d We respond in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-18\">A truck driven by Carter, which weighed over 6500 pounds, ran into a stationary car occupied by Smith, causing Smith personal injuries and medical expenses, he alleges, in excess of $100,000. Employers\u2019 paid Smith $50,000 pursuant to his no-fault policy. Carter owned a policy with appellee Canal Insurance Co. for $50,000 coverage. When Smith and his insurer both claimed the right to recover from Carter's policy, Canal filed an interpleader action to determine its rights and liabilities relative to Smith and Employers\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-19\">The District Court, citing <em>McGlohon v. Ogden, </em>251 Ga. 625, 308 S.E.2d 541 (1983), ruled that Employers\u2019 could recover the amount it had paid Smith from the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance company before Smith was entitled to recover for any of his damages from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals read <em>McGlohon, </em>supra, as simply preventing a plaintiff from receiving a double recovery in a situation where the plaintiff\u2019s insurer is entitled to subrogation. We agree with the Eleventh Circuit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus reach the following question of the proper application of OCGA \u00a7 33-34-3(d)(l): Where Smith\u2019s insurer has paid him to the limits of his policy, and he is still not fully compensated for his injuries, does he get the first shot at the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance to compensate him fully, or does his insurer receive the first shot at the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance to compensate it for the money that it paid to Smith under his policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-20\">As the appellee notes, the legislature has set out separate procedural and substantive rules for dealing with financially re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>sponsible and financially irresponsible tort-feasors. Financially responsible means insured or self-insured. OCGA \u00a7 40-9-2. Since this case involves a financially responsible tort-feasor, we look to the portion of OCGA \u00a7 33-34-3(d)(l) which governs actions involving that type of tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">The original forerunner of present OCGA \u00a7 33-34-3(d)(l) appeared as Section 5(d) of the Reparations Act, Ga.L.1974, p. 119. While this statute provided for subrogation, it did not establish priorities between insureds and insurers in situations such as the one found in this case. In 1976, the legislature amended Section 5(d) to clearly place an injured insured before his insurance company as far as claims to the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance were concerned, where the injured party had not been fully compensated by his own insurance policy. After this amendment this court ruled in <em>Blaylock v. Georgia Mut. Ins. Co., </em>239 Ga. 462, 238 S.E.2d 105 (1977) that the original Section 5(d) established a priority identical to that set out by the legislature in the 1976 amendment. In 1978, the legislature again altered Section 5(d), and the wording, for the purposes of financially responsible tort-feasors, reverted back almost identically to the wording found in the original Section 5(d). OCGA \u00a7 33-34-3(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">The legislature is charged with the knowledge of our interpretations of statutes. <em>Berman v. Berman, </em>253 Ga. 298, 299, 319 S.E.2d 846 (1984). In this instance, thus, the legislature is charged with the knowledge of our interpretation of the language of the original Section 5(d) in <em>Blaylock, </em>supra. In readopting the language that we construed in <em>Blaylock, </em>supra, the legislature adopted our construction, as well, since there were no other relevant, material changes made in the language of OCGA \u00a7 33 \u2014 34\u20143(d)(1). Smith, accordingly, is entitled to priority in access to the funds provided by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-6\">\n<em>Certified Question Answered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-7\">All the Justices concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1617-16\">. The Court of Appeals stated, \"[W]here \u2018plaintiffs no-fault insurer is entitled to subrogation, the plaintiffs recovery from the tort-feasor must not include damages <em>for which the plaintiff has been compensated </em>by his or her no-fault insurer.\u2018 <em>McGlohon, </em>308 S.E.2d at 543, (emphasis supplied). This case is different because the [insured] seeks damages for as yet uncompensated loss.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
