(\u201cNFO\u201d) and Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc. (\u201cCumberland\u201d) appeal from a final order of the district court, which dismissed as moot their appeals from an order of the bankruptcy court. This court has jurisdiction over their appeals by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) and 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">On August 10, 1984, Abbotts Dairies of Pennsylvania, Inc., Pennbrook Foods Company, Inc., The Pennbrook Corporation, Ab-botts Realty Inc., and Abbotts Holding Company, Inc. (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cAbbotts\u201d), filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1174. On the same day, Abbotts filed motions for approval of two agreements it had entered into with ADC, Inc. (\u201cADC\u201d): an \u201cInterim Agreement Concerning Sale of Inventory and Lease of Certain Assets\u201d (the \u201cInterim Agreement\u201d); and an \u201cAsset Purchase and Lease Agreement\u201d (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-23\">The bankruptcy court held an emergency hearing that afternoon to consider Abbotts\u2019 motion for approval of the Interim Agreement, whereby ADC would effectively take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>over Abbotts\u2019 business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notice of the hearing had been given only to the Philadelphia National Bank (\u201cPNB\u201d) and Fair-mont Pennsylvania Holdings, Inc. (\u201cFair-mont\u201d), Abbotts\u2019 two secured creditors, both of whom were represented at the hearing. Also present, almost by chance, was an attorney representing three of Ab-botts\u2019 unsecured creditors, and Cream-O-Land Dairies, a prospective purchaser of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In support of its motion, Abbotts\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard H. Gwinn, testified that PNB notified Ab-botts in February of 1984 that it had defaulted on its loans, and that if Abbotts did not obtain financing from another lender, PNB would reduce Abbotts\u2019 line of credit at a rate of $100,000 per week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also stated that unless the bankruptcy court approved the Interim Agreement, the company would have to cease operations when its current inventory was exhausted on August 11 (the next day), because it had no excess working capital with which to purchase any more milk. Finally, Mr. Gwinn opined that if Abbotts ceased operations, its trademarks and customer list would lose substantially all of their value, resulting in a loss of $3 to $4 million to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On cross-examination by counsel representing one secured creditor, a prospective bidder, and three unsecured creditors, Mr. Gwinn testified that he had reached an informal agreement to act as a consultant to ADC during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, at his current salary of $150,000 per year \u2014 provided that the bankruptcy court approved the Interim Agreement. He also testified that he had been offered a senior executive position with ADC for five years, once again at his current salary, and that he hoped that ADC would relieve him from personal liability on several of Abbotts\u2019 obligations \u2014 provided, once again, that the bankruptcy court approved ADC\u2019s purchase of Abbotts\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the Interim Agreement. This order was supplemented by an order entered on August 17, 1984, which required ADC and its employees to hold themselves out as Abbotts\u2019 representative; to maintain, where possible and economically feasible, Abbotts\u2019 existing distribution system; to continue to distribute products under the Abbotts\u2019 trademarks and not act affirmatively to switch its customers to products sold under other trademarks; and to act reasonably so as not to prejudice the rights of Abbotts\u2019 creditors or diminish the value of its trademarks. These provisions represented concessions that Fairmont had extracted from Abbotts and ADC during the course of the hearing, which Fairmont hoped would preserve Abbotts\u2019 value as a going concern until the bankruptcy court could consider the Purchase Agreement and any other competing bids for Abbotts\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Notice of the motion for approval of the Purchase Agreement was then sent to all interested parties. The notice summarized the Purchase Agreement, and set a deadline for objections to it, as well as for \u201chigher or better\u201d bids for Abbotts\u2019 assets. The notice did not, however, reveal that Mr. Gwinn was presently employed by ADC as a \u201cconsultant,\u201d nor did it indicate that he had been offered a permanent position with ADC, conditioned upon closing pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Likewise, the notice did not indicate that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>emergency hearing had been held on August 10, nor did it summarize the terms of the Interim Agreement that had been approved at that hearing; rather, the notice simply stated that \u201c[ADC] previously purchased the inventories and has been in possession of certain operating equipment and facilities of [Abbotts] and have continued certain operations of Abbotts ... under an Interim Agreement pending approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the [Purchase] Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Three parties filed objections to the sale, only one of which \u2014 that filed by Fair-mont \u2014 is at all pertinent to the present appeals. Fairmont asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sale of Abbotts\u2019 assets should not be approved until a disclosure statement had been approved by the court and a plan of reorganization confirmed by Abbotts\u2019 creditors, because of a number of factors (including the Interim Agreement) that might chill the bidding for Abbotts\u2019 assets. Fairmont also objected to the lack of any appraisals of Abbott\u2019s assets, and argued that the \u201cvalue\u201d to be paid by ADC was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Three parties submitted bids: ADC, Cumberland, and Atlantic Processing, Inc. (\u201cAPI\u201d). ADC\u2019s bid (the Purchase Agreement) contemplated, <em>inter alia, </em>the purchase of Abbotts\u2019 trademarks and customer list for a guaranteed minimum payment of $1 million. API sought to purchase Ab-botts\u2019 trademark only for a cash payment of $1,250,000. Finally, Cumberland submitted two alternative bids. The first contemplated a guaranteed minimum payment for Abbotts\u2019 trademarks and customer list of $1,100,000; the second a guaranteed minimum payment of $1,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Cumberland\u2019s bids, however, were subject to certain conditions. For example, both required the bankruptcy court to rescind Section 7.2(d) of the Interim Agreement, which it had expressly approved in a prior order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, both bids delayed the closing for approximately ten days, during which time ADC would still be required to operate Abbotts. Finally, the second bid required the court to restrain ADC from competing with Cumberland for any of Abbotts\u2019 customers for 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The bankruptcy court held a hearing on the Purchase Agreement on September 12. At its conclusion, the bankruptcy court refused to impose the conditions Cumberland sought,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> after which Cumberland and API withdrew their bids. Fairmont then sought to support its objections to the Purchase Agreement through the testimony of approximately ten witnesses who were present at the hearing. The bankruptcy court refused to hear this evidence; instead, it brought the auction to a close, and signed an order confirming the sale to ADC. In the order, the court found that \u201cit appear[s] that the prices for the sale of the assets ... are fair and reasonable, that the sale and lease are in the best interest of the estate[ ] of [Abbotts] and [its] creditors, [and] that the assets will substantially diminish in value if not immediately sold.\u201d <em>In re Abbotts Dairies, et al., </em>No. 84-02623G, slip op. at 1 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. Sept. 12, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Fairmont, Cumberland, and NFO filed timely notices of appeal to the district court; Fairmont alone, however, sought a stay pending appeal. When the bankruptcy court initially enjoined the sale pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>determination of Fairmont\u2019s motion for a stay, Fairmont, Abbotts, and ADC met and entered into a stipulation under which Fair-mont withdrew its appeal and motion for a stay. The bankruptcy court then vacated its order enjoining the sale. With no stay in effect, ADC and Abbotts closed the sale pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement; notice thereof was filed on September 14, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">After it had closed the sale to ADC, Abbotts filed a motion to dismiss the Cumberland and NFO appeals as moot pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m). The district court, by order dated July 30, 1985, granted the motion. After reviewing the record in the bankruptcy court, the district court concluded that \u201c[ajppellants have not shown a lack of good faith on the part of ADC so as to justify their failure to seek a stay, and so the appeal is dismissed.\u201d <em>In re Abbotts Dairies, et al, </em>Civil Action No. 84-5118, slip op. at 2 n. 1 (E.D.Pa. July 30, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Code provides that \u201c[t]he trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business, property of the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b)(1). It also provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\">[t]he reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under subsection (b) ... of a sale or lease of property does <em>not </em>affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property <em>in good faith, </em>whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, <em>unless such ... sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 363(m) (emphasis added). The latter provision reflects the salutary \u201c \u2018policy of not only affording finality to the judgment of the bankruptcy court, but particularly to give finality to those orders and judgments upon which third parties rely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoese Corp. v. Vetter Corp. (In re Vetter Corp.), </em>724 F.2d 52, 55 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting 14 Collier on Bankruptcy 11-62.03 at 11-62-11 (14th ed. 1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In the present case, neither NFO nor Cumberland sought to stay the bankruptcy court\u2019s September 12 order. They assert that a stay was not necessary, however, because the present record will not, as a matter of law, support a finding that ADC purchased \u201cin good faith\u201d; alternatively, they argue that we should remand the matter to permit them to develop a record on the controlling good faith issues. Because the question of whether ADC was a good faith purchaser requires the determination of an ultimate fact, <em>Greylock Glen Corp. v. Community Sav. Bank, </em>656 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1981), our standard of review is mixed; we exercise plenary review of the legal standard applied by the district and bankruptcy courts, but review the latter court\u2019s findings of fact on a clearly erroneous standard, <em>Universal Minerals v. C.A. Hughes &amp; Co., </em>669 F.2d 98, 103 (3d Cir.1981); Fed.R.Bankr.P. 8013.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Unfortunately, neither the Bankruptcy Code nor the Bankruptcy Rules attempts to define \u201cgood faith.\u201d Courts applying section 363(m) (and its predecessor, Fed.R. Bankr.P. 805) have, therefore, turned to traditional equitable principles, holding that the phrase encompasses one who purchases in \u201cgood faith\u201d and for \u201cvalue.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Bel Air Assocs., </em>706 F.2d 301, 305 (10th Cir.1983); <em>In re Rock Indus. Mach. Corp., </em>572 F.2d 1195, 1197 (7th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">\u201cThe requirement that a purchaser act in good faith ... speaks to the integrity of his conduct in the course of the sale proceedings. Typically, the misconduct that would destroy a purchaser\u2019s good faith status at a judicial sale involves fraud, collusion between the purchaser and other bidders or the trustee, or an attempt to take grossly unfair advantage of other bidders.\u201d <em>In re Rock Indus. Mach. Corp., </em>572 F.2d at 1198; <em>see also Taylor v. Lake (In re Cada Invs.), </em>664 F.2d 1158, 1162 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cCourts have generally appeared willing to set aside confirmed sales that were \u2018tinged with fraud, error or similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>defects which would in equity affect the validity of any private transaction.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In the present case, the bankruptcy court did <em>not </em>make an explicit finding of \u201cgood faith\u201d as to ADC\u2019s behavior in the course of the sale proceedings. ADC and Abbotts argue, however, that the court implicitly made such a finding, in that \u201cit simply would not have approved the sale to ADC if it had thought otherwise.\u201d Alternatively, they seek to rely upon the district court\u2019s conclusion that NFO and Cumberland \u201chave not shown a lack of good faith on the part of ADC so as to justify their failure to seek a stay.\u201d <em>In re Abbotts Dairies, et al., </em>No 84-5118, slip op. at 2 n. 1. Under the circumstances, we find both of these arguments unpersuasive..</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">First, we reject the claim that the bankruptcy court made an \u201cimplicit\u201d finding of good faith. The factual findings upon which ADC and Abbotts base this assertion go only to the need to act immediately so as to avoid any diminution in the value of Abbotts\u2019 trademarks and other assets. NFO\u2019s and Cumberland\u2019s assertion of collusion, on the other hand, concerns, <em>inter alia, </em>the claim that the \u201cemergency\u201d justifying the immediate sale of Abbotts was itself contrived or orchestrated by ADC and Abbotts. For example, they claim that \u2014 in exchange for a lucrative employment agreement for Mr. Gwinn, Abbotts\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\u2014 Abbotts permitted ADC to manipulate the timing of Abbotts\u2019 bankruptcy so that the bankruptcy court had no choice but to approve the Interim Agreement on August 10, the terms of which were designed to preclude any truly competitive bidding for the assets on September 12. Surely, if NFO and Cumberland substantiated these claims, it would, as a matter of law, constitute \u201ccollusion between the purchaser and ... trustee [or in this case, the debtor-in-possession], or an attempt to take grossly unfair advantage of other bidders,\u201d sufficient to destroy ADC\u2019s \u201cgood faith status.\u201d <em>In re Rock Indus. Mach. Corp., </em>572 F.2d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">We also reject the attempt to rely upon the district court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, which was apparently premised upon the assumption that \u201c[n]o objections to the sale on the basis of fraud, collusion or insufficient value were raised at the [September 12] hearing.\u201d <em>In re Abbotts Dairies, et al., </em>No. 84-5118, slip op. at 2 n. 1. That assumption is not, however, borne out by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">For example, prior to the September 12 hearing, Fairmont filed a number of written objections to the proposed sale that were relevant to the issue of ADC\u2019s \u201cgood faith.\u201d These included, <em>inter alia, </em>claims that certain terms of the Interim Agreement had \u201cchilled\u201d the bidding for Abbotts and that insufficient value was being paid by ADC. Similarly, during his argument before the bankruptcy court, Cumberland\u2019s counsel questioned the assertion by Ab-botts\u2019 counsel that an \u201cemergency\u201d existed that required the sale of Abbotts prior to the approval of a disclosure statement and confirmation of a plan of reorganization; he also argued that the Interim Agreement gave an undue advantage to ADC vis-a-vis other prospective bidders, which significantly depreciated the overall value of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Finally, there is no indication in the district court\u2019s opinion that it reviewed the record of the August 10 \u201cemergency\u201d hearing in the bankruptcy court; we believe, however, that the court should have done so before it dismissed the appeals from the bankruptcy court. That hearing, and the circumstances surrounding approval of the Interim Agreement, was an integral part of the \u201csale\u201d of Abbotts; as such, it must be considered in conjunction with the actual sale of the company at the September 12 hearing. The record from that hearing, moreover, indicates that counsel for a prospective bidder and three unsecured creditors filed a number of written objections going to ADC\u2019s \u201cgood faith.\u201d They included, for example, the claim that the Interim Agreement so greatly diminished Abbotts\u2019 value as to \u201ccreate a situation where all competitive bidding for [Abbotts\u2019] business would be eliminated, leaving [ADC] to purchase [Abbotts] at an inadequate price, to the detriment of all interested parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Under these circumstances, then, the district court erred when it dismissed the present appeals as moot. Considering ADC\u2019s lucrative offer of employment to Mr. Gwinn, the timing of Abbotts\u2019 petitions in bankruptcy, and its motion for approval of the Interim Agreement, the situation was ripe for collusion and interested dealing between ADC and Abbotts. <em>Cf. Wolverton v. Shell Oil Co., </em>442 F.2d 666, 669-70 (9th Cir.1971) (affirming district court order setting aside private sale of an antitrust cause of action by the trustee to the bankrupt, because \u201ca sale to the bankrupt, especially when it is of an asset such as a cause of action of unknown but potentially great value, as here, offers opportunities for skulduggery that make it suspect\u201d). Thus, the district court should have remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court for a finding as to whether ADC purchased Abbotts\u2019 assets \u201cin good faith,\u201d or whether ADC and Abbotts (through Mr. Gwinn) colluded in an attempt to take unfair advantage of prospective bidders like Cumberland; it should not have taken it upon itself to determine this question in the first instance. <em>See, e.g., In re Bleaufontaine, Inc., </em>634 F.2d 1383, 1386 (5th Cir.1981) (district court remanded appeals from an order approving the sale of the debtor\u2019s assets to bankruptcy court with directions to determine the good faith status of the purchaser).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Traditionally, courts have held that \u201c[f]air and valuable consideration is given in a bankruptcy sale when the purchaser pays 75% of the appraised value of the assets.\u201d <em>In re Rock Indus. Mach. Corp., </em>572 F.2d at 1197 n. 1. In the present case, no appraisal of Abbotts\u2019 assets was conducted or introduced in the bankruptcy court. ADC argues, however, that a public \u201cauction,\u201d as opposed to appraisals and other evidence, is the best possible determinant of the value of Abbotts\u2019 assets; alternatively, ADC and Abbotts argue that we are bound by the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the prices paid for Abbotts\u2019 assets \u201care fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Generally speaking, an auction may be sufficient to establish that one has paid \u201cvalue\u201d for the assets of a bankrupt. In the present case, on the other hand, we reject the assertion that the \u201cauction\u201d conducted for Abbotts\u2019 assets necessarily establishes that ADC paid \u201cvalue.\u201d If Abbotts and ADC colluded with respect to the timing of Abbotts\u2019 petitions for bankruptcy and its motion to approve the Interim Agreement in an attempt to chill the bidding for the assets involved, it would follow that no \u201cauction\u201d took place in the bankruptcy court; thus, the \u201cbidding\u201d could not, by definition, serve as the final arbiter of the \u201cvalue\u201d of Abbotts\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Similarly, in the absence of a finding of \u201cgood faith\u201d behavior by ADC, we find Abbotts\u2019 and ADC\u2019s reliance upon the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the prices paid \u201care fair and reasonable\u201d equally unavailing. Neither party introduced any evidence going to value, and the bankruptcy court refused to entertain the only proffer of such evidence \u2014 that is, Fairmont\u2019s proffer of evidence in support of its objection to the value to be paid by ADC. Instead, the bankruptcy court, like ADC, apparently believed that the \u201cauction\u201d it conducted adequately and conclusively established that value was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Accordingly, if the bankruptcy court finds, on remand, that ADC did <em>not </em>purchase Abbotts\u2019 assets \u201cin good faith,\u201d it will have to determine whether ADC indeed paid \u201cvalue\u201d for Abbotts. On the other hand, if it finds that ADC <em>did </em>act \u201cin good faith,\u201d then its finding that the prices paid \u201care fair and reasonable\u201d is not clearly erroneous, and is sufficient to establish that ADC paid \u201cvalue\u201d for Abbotts\u2019 assets. <em>See Willemain v. Kivitz, </em>764 F.2d 1019, 1023 (4th Cir.1985) (\u201c[T]he bankruptcy court\u2019s express finding that the $100,000 price was \u2018not unreasonable,\u2019 a finding that is not clearly erroneous, demonstrates that Hampshire indeed gave value for the interest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">In short, we hold that when a bankruptcy court authorizes a sale of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>pursuant to section 363(b)(1), it is required to make a finding with respect to the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the purchaser. Alternatively, such a finding might, in certain very limited circumstances, be made by the district court. <em>See, e.g., Greylock Glen Corp. v. Community Sav. Bank, </em>656 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1981) (district court \u201cdecided the issue of ultimate fact \u2014 the bank\u2019s good faith \u2014 on the basis of underlying facts that are not in dispute); <em>In re Combined Metals Reduction Co., </em>557 F.2d 179, 185 (9th Cir.1977) (district court did not refer the matter to the bankruptcy court, electing instead to retain control of the Chapter X proceeding itself).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We think that such a requirement represents a proper exercise of our supervisory authority over both the district and bankruptcy courts. First, the bankruptcy court, given its greater familiarity with the parties and proceedings, represents the forum best able to make such a determination in the first instance. Second, it encourages finality of the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgments under section 363(b)(1), because it places prospective appellants on notice of the need to obtain a stay pending appeal, or face dismissal for mootness pursuant to section 363(m), should the district court affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of good faith. Finally, such a procedure ensures that section 363(b)(1) will not be employed to circumvent the creditor protections of Chapter 11, and, as such, it mirrors the requirement of section 1129 that the bankruptcy court independently scrutinize the debtor\u2019s reorganization plan and make a finding that it \u201chas been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Relying upon <em>In re Combined Metals Reduction Co., </em>557 F.2d at 179, and <em>In re Royal Properties, </em>621 F.2d 984 (9th Cir.1980), ADC and Abbotts assert that even if the present appeals are not moot by virtue of section 363(m), they are moot under Article III, because the relief sought by NFO and Cumberland \u2014 that is, the undoing of the sale \u2014 can no longer be effectively granted by this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of this contention, they argue that \u201c[mjillions of dollars have been paid by ADC, hundreds of former employees of Abbotts are now employees of ADC, with attendant vesting of rights under labor union contracts, various distribution routes and customer relationships have been established, capital assets have been acquired and used, and innumerable other irreversible measures have been taken in justifiable reliance on the finality of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order approving the Purchase Agreement.\u201d NFO argues, on the other hand, that approval of this line of argument would effectively read the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement of section 363(m) out of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The short answer to this claim is that neither ADC nor Abbotts has \u201cborne [the] burden of showing that the outcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of this appeal could not affect the legal interests of the parties.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Madeline Marie Nursing Homes #1 and #2, </em>694 F.2d 449, 463 (6th Cir.1982); <em>see also In re King Resources Co., </em>651 F.2d 1326, 1332 (10th Cir.1980) (\u201cBefore refusing to consider these appeals on the merits because of consummation which has occurred, some hearing and development of a record would be required____\u201d). They did not introduce any evidence in either the district or bankruptcy court to substantiate the claim that the property purchased from Abbotts has been irreversibly commingled with that of ADC. We believe, therefore, that this question is more properly decided on remand. <em>Cf. e.g., In re AOV Indus., </em>43 B.R. 468, 475-76 (D.D.C.1984) (considering, on remand from Court of Appeals, whether the transferees under the plan are good faith transferees, and whether the plan has been so far consummated that the court can no longer grant effective relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">With respect to NFO, however, we are generally confident that the present appeal is <em>not </em>moot. Unlike Cumberland, NFO can be made whole <em>without </em>undoing the sale. We need not belabor the fact that a bankruptcy court is, after all, a court of equity, <em>In re Beck Indus., </em>605 F.2d 624, 634 (2d Cir.1979) (Friendly, J.), which \u201c[i]n the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction ... has the power to sift the circumstances surrounding any claim to see that injustice or unfairness is not done in administration of the bankrupt estate,\u201d <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 307-08, 60 S.Ct. 238, 245-46, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939). As a result, a bankruptcy court has broad remedial powers with which to fashion relief for parties such as NFO. <em>See In re Beck Indus., </em>605 F.2d at 637. For example, in the present case a profitable analogy might be made to section 363(n) of the Code, which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trustee may recover from a party engaged in collusive bidding any excess of value over the purchase price plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and, where appropriate, punitive damages. Similarly, the court might consider whether Abbotts, as a debtor-in-possession, violated its fiduciary duties to its creditors, thus subjecting it or its principals to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">To conclude, the bankruptcy court should, upon remand of this matter from the district court, determine whether there was any impermissible collusion between ADC and Abbotts that would negate ADC\u2019s status as a purchaser \u201cin good faith.\u201d If it finds such collusion, it should then determine whether ADC paid \u201cvalue\u201d for the assets purchased. If the court determines that ADC did not pay \u201cvalue,\u201d it will then have to determine whether it has the power to undo the sale to ADC; implicit in this determination is the question whether, with respect to Cumberland, the sale has become moot under Article III. Finally, if the court determines that it has the power to undo the sale, it should, in an exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, determine whether to exercise that power, or whether another remedy should be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment will be reversed, and the matter remanded to the district court with instructions to remand it to the bankruptcy court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. Under the terms of the Interim Agreement, ADC agreed to purchase Abbotts\u2019 existing inventory at cost; to lease its trademarks; to maintain deliveries to current customers; to employ approximately 250 of Abbotts\u2019 300 employees; and to collect, for a commission, approximately $6 million in outstanding accounts receivable. ADC did not, however, assume any of Abbotts\u2019 financial obligations with respect to its various facilities, and it also expressly retained the right to compete with Abbotts for customers and to continue to serve Abbotts\u2019 customers under a different label if the Purchase Agreement was not ultimately approved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-14\">. Abbotts apparently had a line of credit at PNB equal to 65% of its qualified accounts receivable; at the time of the August 10 hearing, its outstanding loan balance totalled approximately $3.3 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">. The bankruptcy court\u2019s August 10 order provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Interim Agreement, if the Interim Agreement is terminated other than by Closing as provided for in the [Purchase Agreement], then ADC, Inc. shall immediately notify all current customers ... that it will no longer be able to supply them with product under [Abbotts'] Trademarks; <em>but ADC, Inc. may, if it so desires, notify [them] that it will be able to serve them with product under another name.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\"><em>In re Abbotts Dairies, et al., </em>No 84-02623, slip op. at 2-3 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. Aug. 10, 1984) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">. With respect to Cumberland\u2019s request to extend the time for closing the sale by ten days, the court stated that \"with the losses that are being sustained by the present conductor of the Debtor\u2019s business [that] is unreasonable\u201d\u2014 based, apparently, on the unsworn and unsubstantiated assertion of counsel that ADC was \"losing money at the rate of $10,000.00 per day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\">. Admittedly, the definition of \"good faith\u201d in the two situations differs somewhat. <em>Compare supra </em>typescript at 9-15 (definition of good faith for purposes of \u00a7 363(b)(1) and 363(m)), <em>with e.g., In re Madison Hotel Assocs., </em>749 F.2d 410, 425 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201c[F]or purposes of determining good faith under section 1129(a)(3) ... the important point of inquiry is the plan itself and whether such a plan will fairly achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d). The purpose of requiring such a finding in each situation, however, is quite similar: it prevents a debtor-in-possession or trustee from effectively abrogating the creditor protections of Chapter 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">. Generally speaking, an appeal must be dismissed as moot when an event occurs that prevents the appellate court from granting any effective relief, even if the dispute is decided in favor of the appellant. <em>In re Combined Metals Reduction Co., </em>557 F.2d at 187; <em>Brill </em>v. <em>General Indus. Enters., </em>234 F.2d 465, 469 (3d Cir.1956); <em>see also Mills </em>v. <em>Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 16 S.Ct. 132, 40 L.Ed. 293 (1895) (holding that it is the duty of each federal court to \u201cdecide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before [it]\u201d). This follows from the fact that the federal courts, as courts of limited jurisdiction, are limited to deciding only actual \"cases or controversies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
