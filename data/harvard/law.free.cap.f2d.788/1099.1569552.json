Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 43.02 (Vernon 1974), which prohibits prostitution, declared unconstitutional and to prevent the Houston police from \u201centrapping\u201d men into soliciting prostitution by having female officers pose as <em>demimondaines. </em>George also filed motions seeking injunctive relief against both Texas and the Houston police vice squad and seeking certification of a class action. Fed. R.Civ.P. 23. Finding the action frivolous, the district court dismissed the complaint and awarded each defendant $250 in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-16\">George\u2019s claim for injunctive relief against the State of Texas was appropriately dismissed since it is barred by the eleventh amendment. <em>Cory v. White, 457 </em>U.S. 85, 102 S.Ct. 2325, 75 L.Ed.2d 694 (1982). His claim that the criminalization of prostitution violates the eighth amendment fails to state a valid claim. The eighth amendment applies only to conditions of confinement; it has no application in determining the validity of substantive criminal statutes. We also note that George\u2019s claim that Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 43.02 constitutes cruelty to animals <em>(i.e. </em>humans) has no constitutional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-17\">Dismissal of George\u2019s claims against both the State of Texas and Houston was also proper because George lacks standing to pursue his claims either as a class representative or as an individual. The complaint fails to allege that George has ever been prosecuted for soliciting either a prostitute or an undercover police officer in a sting operation. George concedes such. George\u2019s argument that the enforcement of \u00a7 43.02 of the Texas Penal Code has forced him into either abstaining from sex or becoming a criminal in order to have sex is not enough to demonstrate a valid injury suffered by George as a result of the enforcement of the laws of Texas by the Houston police. <em>See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 </em>U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-18\">The claims presented by George on appeal are devoid of arguable merit. The appeal is patently frivolous. Appellees\u2019 motions for sanctions pursuant to Fed.R. App.P. 38 are granted. We award appellees double costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Although the City of Houston has offered documentation of its request for attorneys\u2019 fees, the State of Texas has not done so. Believing that \u201can award [under Fed.R. App.P. 38] \u2018should be based upon some showing in the record as to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>such damages,\u2019 \u201d <em>Capps v. Eggers, </em>782 F.2d 1341, 1343 (5th Cir.1986), <em>(quoting Knoblauch v. C.I.R., </em>749 F.2d 200, 202-03 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed.2d 78 (1985)), we remand to the district court for determination of the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded to appellees for work directly related to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
