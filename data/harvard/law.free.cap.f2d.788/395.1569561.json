Charles W. Joiner, United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b490-6\">KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In this wrongful death action invoking the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2671 <em>et seq., </em>(the \u201cFTCA\u201d), plaintiff Satterfield, administratrix of her decedent son\u2019s estate, appealed the district court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint against defendant United States pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Plaintiff alleged that the death of her son, Private Charles Arthur Hulstine (\u201cHulstine\u201d), was the direct and proximate result of the Army\u2019s negligence in accepting his enlistment and its negligence in failing to supervise his conduct and activities and the conduct and activities of his associates. Since this is an appellate review of a Rule 12(b) dismissal, the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are required to be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">At age seventeen, Hulstine sought- to enlist in the United States Army. Because Hulstine was a minor, he was required to obtain parental consent which was given in written form by his father. Although the recruiters were aware that his parents were divorced, they did not know that his mother, the plaintiff herein, was his sole legal guardian. Additionally, the recruiters were not aware of Hulstine\u2019s psychological and psychiatric history, nor his juvenile criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Hulstine was enlisted and ordered to Fort Knox, Kentucky for basic training. Personal differences soon developed between Hulstine and Army Privates Bryan Koenig (\u201cKoenig\u201d), Ronald D. Kinman (\u201cKinman\u201d) and Steven J. Adams (\u201cAdams\u201d), each of whom was also assigned to Hulstine\u2019s Company. The animosities between the individuals, which involved threats to and physical assaults on Hul-stine, were brought to the attention of various supervisory personnel including the Company Commander. On May 30, 1980, weekend leave passes were authorized for Koenig, Kinman, Adams, Hulstine and others. Approximately four hours after having departed the base for the weekend, Hulstine was beaten to death by the three above-named off-duty servicemen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint averred that pursuant to Army Regulation A.R. 601-210 Chapter 3, the Army recruiters were negligent in failing to determine Hulstine\u2019s fitness for military service, and the validity of his father\u2019s parental consent to enlist. Plaintiff also asserted that due to the indifference of Hulstine\u2019s superiors at Fort Knox, the Army negligently failed to exercise proper supervision and control over Koenig, Kinman, and Adams in violation of A.R. 600-20, and negligently failed to warn and protect Hulstine from the three servicemen who ultimately killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">The district court determined that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by both the <em>Feres </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an. exception to the FTCA which precludes recovery from the Government for injuries to servicemen which are incident to service, and by the \u201cintentional tort exception\u201d to the FTCA codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), which pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>eludes liability for claims arising from an assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The FTCA provides that the United States shall be liable for \u201cinjury or ... death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government ... under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The Act \u201cwaives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit in sweeping language.\u201d <em>United States v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>340 U.S. 543, 547, 71 S.Ct. 399, 402, 95 L.Ed. 523 (1951). \u201cHowever, this broad waiver of immunity is not without its exceptions.\u201d <em>Woodside v. United States, </em>606 F.2d 134, 138 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 904, 100 S.Ct. 1080, 63 L.Ed.2d 320 (1980). The two exceptions to the FTCA joined in this appeal are the <em>Feres </em>doctrine and the intentional tort exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Feres, </em>the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the government\u2019s tort liability where military personnel seek damages from the United States for service-connected injuries. <em>See Woodside, </em>606 F.2d at 138. The <em>Feres </em>doctrine forecloses military personnel from invoking the FTCA to recover damages for injuries which \u201carise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159. In <em>United States v. Shearer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 3043, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985), the Supreme Court synopsized the primary basis for its decision in <em>Feres </em>by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXI\"><em>Feres </em>seems best explained by the \u201cpeculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the Tort Claims Act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">(Citations omitted). The <em>Shearer </em>Court continued that \u201c[t]he <em>Feres </em>doctrine cannot be reduced to a few bright-line rules; each case must be examined in light of the statute as it has been construed in <em>Feres </em>and subsequent cases.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3043.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Due to the remarkably similar factual scenario presented in <em>Shearer </em>to the case at bar, this court finds it dispositive of the assignments of error charged herein. In <em>Shearer, </em>the plaintiff was the mother and administratrix of Army Private Vernon Shearer (\u201cShearer\u201d). 105 S.Ct. at 3041. While Shearer was off-duty and away from his military base, he was kidnapped and murdered by a Private Andrew Heard (\u201cHeard\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff initiated an action pursuant to the FTCA charging the Army\u2019s negligent control and supervision of the two servicemen as the proximate cause of Shearer\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>She alleged that \u201calthough the Army knew that Heard was dangerous (having been convicted of manslaughter while assigned to an Army base in Germany), it \u2018negligently and carelessly failed to exert a reasonably sufficient control over\u2019 him and \u2018failed to warn other persons that he was at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The Third Circuit in that case ruled that <em>Feres </em>did not bar respondent\u2019s suit because \u201c[gjenerally an off-duty serviceman not on the military base and not engaged in military activity at the time of injury, can recover under FTCA.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3041 (quoting <em>Shearer v. United States, </em>723 F.2d 1102, 1106 (3d Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">The Supreme Court unanimously (8-0) reversed the Third Circuit. In rejecting respondent\u2019s argument that the murder was not incident to Shearer\u2019s military service because it occurred when he was off-duty and away from his assigned military base, the Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">But the situs of the murder is not nearly as important as whether the suit requires the civilian to second-guess military decisions, see <em>Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 666, 673, 97 S.Ct. 2054, 2058, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977), and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline, see <em>Chap-pell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 300, 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2365, 2367, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-15\"><em>Shearer, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3043. In emphasizing that respondent\u2019s complaint struck \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the core of these concerns,\u201d the Court expressly determined that plaintiffs cause of action \u201cgoes directly to the \u2018management\u2019 of the military; it calls into question basic choices about the discipline, supervision, and control of a serviceman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">To permit this type of suit would mean that commanding officers would have to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions; for example, whether to overlook a particular incident or episode, whether to discharge a serviceman, <em>and whether and how to place restraints on a soldier\u2019s offbase conduct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">^ * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[Respondent's attempt to hale Army officials into court to account for their supervision and discipline of Private Heard must' fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 3044 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In the case at bar, plaintiff\u2019s complaint harbored an identical allegation of Army negligence in the control and supervision of servicemen. The decedents in both cases were killed by fellow servicemen while off-duty and away from the base. Cognizant of the precise issue the <em>Feres </em>exception presented in these cases \u2014 whether decedents\u2019 deaths were incident to their military service \u2014 the two cases are indistinguishable. Since the Supreme Court unanimously concluded that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine applied to the facts attendant to <em>Shearer, </em>that case is dispositive and plaintiff\u2019s claim herein must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish the two cases is based on the tenuous assertion that in the instant action the Army violated an internal Army regulation (A.R. 600-20) by negligently failing to warn and protect Hulstine. The distinction is misplaced. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the impropriety of a civilian court involving itself in a military matter, especially where a military regulation is at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">Congress has exercised its plenary constitutional authority over the military, has enacted statutes regulating military life, and has established a comprehensive internal system of justice to regulate military life, taking into account the special patterns that define the military structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\"><em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 301, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2366, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983). The Court admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">[Jjudges are not given the task of running the Army. The responsibility for setting up channels through which ... grievances can be considered and fairly settled rests upon the Congress and upon the President of the United States and his subordinates. ' The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-14\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Orloff v. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 93-94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument serves only to support the conclusion that the control and supervision of servicemen, <em>including </em>\u201cwhether and how to place restraints on a serviceman\u2019s off-base conduct,\u201d <em>Shearer, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3044, \u201cgoes directly to the \u2018management\u2019 of the military ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3043.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Thus, it is patently clear that Hulstine\u2019s death, like Shearer\u2019s, was incident to his military service. Inasmuch as civilian courts are counseled not to \u201cquestion basic choices about discipline, supervision, and control of a serviceman,\u201d <em>Shearer, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3043, plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligent supervision and control was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegation of negligent enlistment is equally without merit. Although several circuits have precluded recovery under the FTCA by determining that a serviceman\u2019s <em>enlistment </em>was incident to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>service,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this court finds it unnecessary to reach that issue in resolving this particular claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the claim is readily disposed of by again focusing the inquiry on whether Hulstine\u2019s <em>death </em>was incident to his military service thereby invoking the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Having already concluded that Hulstine\u2019s death was incident to his military service, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine was properly applied to bar plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligent enlistment as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The intentional tort exception to the FTCA provides that governmental immunity under the Act will not apply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault [or] battery ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim predicated on a negligence theory merely obfuscates the fact that Hulstine\u2019s death was a result of the battery committed on him by Koenig, Kin-man and Adams. The question presented, therefore, is whether plaintiff\u2019s claim, that the Army\u2019s negligent supervision of these servicemen was the proximate cause of Hulstine\u2019s death, falls within the ambit of \u00a7 2680(h). Two other courts have recently answered that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Recalling the scenario in <em>Shearer, supra, </em>plaintiff therein alleged that the Army\u2019s negligent supervision was the proximate cause of her decedent-serviceman\u2019s death. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim and enounced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">No semantical recasting of events can alter the fact that the battery was the immediate cause of Private Shearer\u2019s death and, consequently, the basis of respondent\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">Respondent cannot avoid the reach of \u00a7 2680(h) by framing her complaint in terms of negligent failure to prevent the assault and battery. Section 2680(h) does not merely bar claims <em>for </em>assault or battery; in sweeping language it excludes any claim <em>arising out of </em>assault or battery. We read this provision to cover claims like respondent\u2019s that sound in negligence but stem from a battery committed by a Government employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARy\">105 S.Ct. at 3042 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Although the above passage from the <em>Shearer </em>opinion has equivocal precedential value,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this court finds the reasoning to be compelling. <em>See also Garcia v. United States, </em>776 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1985) (Circuit court in reviewing applicability of \u00a7 2680(h) to a negligent supervision claim against the military \u201ccannot ignore this strong signal from the Supreme Court,\u201d whereupon it adopted and applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Shearer </em>court rationale to bar plaintiffs claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Because plaintiffs complaint set forth an intentional tort claim merely sounding in negligence, such claim falls within the exception embodied in \u00a7 2680(h), and was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs wrongful death action pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under both the <em>Feres </em>doctrine and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Accordingly, the decision of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-11\">.
