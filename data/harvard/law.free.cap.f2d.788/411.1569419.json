The complaint arose from the defendant hospital\u2019s revocation of her physician\u2019s staff privileges. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The appellant, B. Doe, is a physician, licensed to practice in Indiana. She is engaged in general practice in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She was born in Korea and is a citizen of the United States. The appellees are St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, located in Fort Wayne, its corporate owner, its board of directors, its administrator, the President of its Medical Staff and the members of its Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (the \u201cExecutive Committee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">In August 1982 St. Joseph\u2019s granted Doe associate staff privileges. She began to admit and care for patients there. In a letter dated January 26, 1983, the administrator of the hospital notified her that her staff privileges were summarily suspended. The letter stated that the hospital\u2019s administrator and the President of the Medical Staff had reviewed a formal complaint against Doe filed by another physician. The complaint dealt with an incident that involved her entering the room of another doctor\u2019s patient, \u201cand in a loud, abusive manner, castigating [the other physician] in a most demeaning, unethical manner.\u201d The patient was scheduled for serious surgery the next day. The letter continued: \u201cIn view of the fact that I spoke to you personally last week regarding previous incidents of unprofessional behavior within the Hospital, this latest episode is especially incomprehensible.\u201d The plaintiff was permitted to complete the care and treatment of patients currently in the hospital. The letter advised her, however, \u201cto stay completely away from [the patient whose room she had entered] or any member of her family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">Doe requested a meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss her summary suspension. The Executive Committee notified the plaintiff by letter dated February 10, 1983, that it had \u201c[unanimously upheld [her] summary suspension without modification.\u201d The letter further advised her that she would have to complete physical, psychological and psychiatric examinations and successfully complete a \u201ccertified Physician Re-Training Program\u201d before reapplying for privileges in the future. None of these are required by the hospital bylaws, nor are they uniformly required of physicians seeking staff privileges at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">She then sought review of her suspension by the Board of Directors, perhaps as early as March 15, 1983. In May 1983 she was orally advised by counsel for the hospital that the suspension would not be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">Doe filed a complaint on June 21, 1983, alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and state law. She amended her complaint on December 15, 1983, to add claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), and the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300S-6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on August 5, 1983, in which they argued that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment did not apply because St. Joseph\u2019s is a private hospital. The district court did not rule on the motion. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on September 21, 1983. They argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court never addressed this issue. On December 20, 1983, the defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to serve the Amended Complaint on either the defendants or their attorneys. This motion also was never ruled on by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">After a number of settlement conferences and extensive negotiations between the parties, the district court dismissed the action <em>sua </em>sponte.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the issues involved in the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal had been raised by the defendants. The trial court did not notify either side that it was considering these issues, nor did either side file any briefs in the district court addressing these issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The issues on appeal are the sufficiency of the complaint and the propriety of the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, without notice to the parties and without affording them an opportunity to be heard. We must take the allegations in the complaint to be true and view them, along with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Ellsworth v. City of Racine, </em>774 F.2d 182, 184 (7th Cir.1985);\u2019 <em>Powe v. City of Chicago, </em>664 F.2d 639, 642 (7th Cir.1981). A complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff is unable to prove any set of facts that would entitle the plaintiff to relief. <em>Ellsworth, </em>774 F.2d at 184; <em>Benson v. Cady, </em>761 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir.1985). A plaintiff need not set out in detail the facts upon which a claim is based, but must allege sufficient facts to outline the cause of action. <em>Ells-worth, </em>774 F.2d at 184; <em>Benson, </em>761 F.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\"><em>Sua sponte </em>dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted are permitted, so long as a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s action is apparent from the plaintiff\u2019s pleading. <em>See Flora v. Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>685 F.2d 209, 212 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Tamari v. Bache &amp; Co. (Lebanon) S.A.L., </em>565 F.2d 1194, 1198 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 1450, 55 L.Ed.2d 495 (1978); <em>see also Merrill Tenant Council v. United States Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD), </em>638 F.2d 1086, 1094 (7th Cir.1981) (discussing <em>Tamari, </em>but not reaching the issue whether <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal without no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tice or an opportunity to be heard violates due process). The reason for this procedural approach is that the \u201cproper administration of justice requires that a trial judge have substantial control over the proceedings before him.\u201d <em>Flora, </em>685 F.2d at 212.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6r\">A judge acts not as a mere moderator, but as the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law. <em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). The trial judge must meet situations as they arise and to do this must have broad power to cope with the complexities inherent in the adversary process. <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 87, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1334, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Caruth v. Pinkney, </em>683 F.2d 1044 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1214, 103 S.Ct. 1212, 75 L.Ed.2d 451 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\"><em>Sua sponte </em>dismissals without prior notice or an opportunity to be heard on the issues underlying the dismissal, however, \u201cgenerally may be considered hazardous.\u201d <em>Tamari, </em>565 F.2d at 1198. They may be criticized on several grounds. First, they conflict with traditional adversarial concepts of justice to the extent that they make the district court \u201ca proponent rather than an independent entity.\u201d <em>Tingler v. Marshall, </em>716 F.2d 1109, 1111 (6th Cir. 1983); <em>see Franklin v. Oregon, </em>662 F.2d 1337, 1342 (9th Cir. 1981). Second, such dismissals may ultimately waste, rather than economize, judicial resources, by producing appeals and remands that might have been avoided. <em>See Salibra v. Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>730 F.2d 1059, 1062 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 295, 83 L.Ed.2d 230 (1984); <em>Tingler, </em>716 F.2d at 1111; <em>Franklin, </em>662 F.2d at 1342; <em>Lewis v. New York, </em>547 F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1976). Third, <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals may prejudice plaintiffs by depriving them of an opportunity to amend their complaints or to argue against the dismissal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Tingler, </em>716 F.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">At least four circuits do not permit <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals without notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Morrison v. Tomano, </em>755 F.2d 515 (6th Cir.1985); <em>Salibra, </em>730 F.2d 1059; <em>Jefferson Fourteenth Associates v. Wometco de Puerto Rico, Inc., </em>695 F.2d 524 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Franklin v. Oregon, </em>662 F.2d 1337 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Pavilonis v. King, </em>626 F.2d 1075, 1078 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 829, 101 S.Ct. 96, 66 L.Ed.2d 34 (1980); <em>Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, </em>482 F.2d 372 (1st Cir.1973); <em>see also Tyler v. Mmes. Pasqua &amp; Toloso, </em>748 F.2d 283 (5th Cir.1984) (disapproving <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal prior to answer and noting that issue of failure to state a claim must be raised by defendant); <em>Leonhard v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 599, 609 n. 11 (2d Cir.1980) <em>(sua sponte </em>dismissal on statute of limitations grounds permitted when answer pleaded statute of limitations and prayed for judgment dismissing the complaint), cer<em>t. denied, </em>451 U.S. 908, 101 S.Ct. 1975, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">We cannot find a Seventh Circuit case in which a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal without any notice and opportunity to be heard has been upheld. In <em>Flora </em>we held that \u201cbecause both parties had an opportunity to be heard on the legal issue in the case ... the court\u2019s response was not undermined by the fact that it was made <em>sua sponte.\u201d Flora, </em>685 F.2d at 212. In <em>Tamari </em>the district court had issued a preliminary opinion one month before ordering dismissal. <em>Tamari, </em>565 F.2d at 1197. We interpreted the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal \u201c[ajgainst that background.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. Thus even in <em>Tamari </em>the parties had notice and adequate time to present their arguments to the judge or to amend the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">We need not answer the question whether a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal without any notice and opportunity to be heard (in fact if not in form) is ever permissible, because in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the case before us no sufficient basis for the dismissal is apparent from the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The plaintiff alleges that the defendants acted in concert in an attempt to restrain trade and to exclude a competing provider of medical services from the market in violation of the federal antitrust laws. The district court correctly relied upon our decision in <em>Marrese v. Interqual, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 373 (7th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3501, 87 L.Ed.2d 632 (1985), to dismiss this claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In <em>Marrese </em>we held that actions taken within the Indiana medical peer review process that result in the suspension of staff privileges are exempt from federal antitrust law under the state action doctrine. Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Marrese </em>on the grounds that Marrese lost his staff privileges because of the quality of the care he provided to his patients, whereas Doe lost her privileges because of comments she made to another physician. We do not find the case before us to be distinguishable. Although all the facts are not before us at this stage of the proceedings, we think the circumstances of this case fall under the peer review process supervised by Indiana, even though they fall much more toward the fringes of the review process than the facts in <em>Marrese</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">As the district court noted, it was the medical peer review process that resulted in the suspension of plaintiffs staff privileges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, the Indiana medical peer review statute is not limited to the quality of care provided to patients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">The governing board of the hospital shall be the supreme authority in the hospital, responsible for the management, operation, functioning and control of the hospital, and the appointment of the members of the medical staff and the assignment of privileges to members of the medical staff with the advice and recommendations of the medical staff consistent with their individual training, experience and other qualifications. The medical staff of a hospital shall be an organized group which shall be responsible to the governing board ... and shall have the responsibility of reviewing the professional practices in the hospital for the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality, and for the improvement of the care of patients in the hospital. <em>This review shall include, but shall not be limited to, the quality and necessity of the care provided </em>patients____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">Ind.Code \u00a7 16-10-1-6.5 (1982) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>In addition, we have doubts about whether or not plaintiff adequately alleged a nexus with interstate commerce.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Seglin v. Esau, </em>769 F.2d 1274 (7th Cir. 1985), the plaintiff psychiatrist alleged that the suspension of his admitting privileges at defendant hospital violated the Sherman Act. We held that the \u201cplaintiff must allege sufficient facts concerning' the alleged violation and its likely effect on interstate commerce to support an inference that the defendants\u2019 activities infected by illegality either have had or can reasonably be expected to have a not insubstantial effect on commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 (quoting <em>McLain v. Real Estate Board, Inc., </em>444 U.S. 232, 246, 100 S.Ct. 502, 511, 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980)). The plaintiff may not merely allege that some of defendants\u2019 activities affect interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>Further, the plaintiff cannot allege bare legal conclusions without setting forth facts that at least outline a violation of the Sherman Act. <em>Id. </em>at 1279. We held that plaintiffs allegations that \u201cthe defendants provide psychiatric services to patients who travel in interstate commerce to receive such services, purchase equipment in interstate commerce, and receive insurance payments through interstate commerce,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1279-80, were \u201cinsufficient to establish the required nexus with interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280. We noted that if we did not affirm the dismissal \u201cvirtually every physician who is ever temporarily denied hospital privileges for whatever reason could drag the hospital and members of its staff into costly antitrust litigation merely by alleging that the defendant receives payments, goods, or equipment in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Plaintiff in the case before us similarly has not alleged facts sufficient to establish the required nexus. She alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">The actions of the defendants have had a substantial effect on interstate commerce in that the practice of medicine in Fort Wayne involves: a) the purchase of drugs and medical supplies and equipment which travel in interstate commerce, b) the payment of medical bill [sic] through out-of-state private and governmental insurance programs, c) providing medical services to Ohio residents and, d) the general sharing of information and medical training across state lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Amended complaint at 5. The only difference between the allegations in <em>Seglin </em>and the allegations in the case before us is that Doe also alleges the sharing of information and medical training across state lines. We do not think that this additional factor provides a basis for the required nexus. Although it is possible that the plaintiff could amend her pleadings to pass muster under <em>Seglin, </em>we see no indication from the facts that she can do so. Hence we think the antitrust claim fails not only on <em>Marrese </em>grounds, but also on account of an inadequate allegation of effect on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Section 1981 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. This court has held that section 1981 applies only to allegations of discrimination based upon race and that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>claim of discrimination based solely on national origin fails to state a cause of action under section 1981.\u201d <em>Anooya v. Hilton Hotels Corp., </em>733 F.2d 48, 50 (7th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In the pleadings Doe alleged that she is Korean and expressly alleged the defendant had discriminated against her because of her race. The district court concluded that the plaintiff had alleged only national origin discrimination, and therefore dismissed the section 1981 claim on the authority of <em>Anooya. </em>We think this approach is erroneous, that the plaintiff has alleged racial discrimination and therefore her section 1981 claim was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Anooya </em>is plainly distinguishable. In <em>Anooya, </em>the plaintiff claimed that he was \u201cof Iraqi background\u201d and that he was discriminatorily fired because of his national origin. We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his section 1981 claim. It was not reasonably inferable from the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he was \u201cof Iraqi background\u201d that he belonged to a group distinct from the white race as a matter of race or color. <em>See Anooya, </em>733 F.2d at 50 &amp; n. 1, 51 (Cudahy, J., concurring). Unlike the situation of an Iraqi, it may be inferred from Doe\u2019s allegation that she is a Korean that she \u201cbelongs to a group that is distinct from \u2018white citizens\u2019 as a matter of race or color.\u201d <em>Anooya, </em>733 F.2d at 50 (Cudahy, J., concurring) (footnote omitted). As the concurrence noted in <em>Anooya, </em>\u201callegations which raise inferences of some basis in race or color should be acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. It is reasonably inferable from the claim that one is Korean that one is Oriental (or Asian). The Supreme Court has recognized that discrimination against Orientals is racial discrimination. <em>See Tak-ahashi v. Fish &amp; Game Commission, </em>334 U.S. 410, 412, 420, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 1143, 92 L.Ed.2d 1478 (1948); <em>see also Korematsu v. United States, </em>323 U.S. 214, 223, 65 S.Ct. 193, 197, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944) (Japanese plaintiff was \u201cnot excluded from the military area because of hostility to him or his race.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Doe has adequately alleged racial discrimination under section 1981. Even if <em>Anooya </em>were read to require that the plaintiff expressly allege that she is an Oriental, we would still reverse. In that case the district court should have given the plaintiff an opportunity to amend her complaint, rather than dismissing <em>sua sponte. </em>Indeed this circumstance illustrates some of the hazards of <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">The appellant also argues that the district court improperly dismissed her claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The relevant part of Title VI provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Appellant alleged that the defendant hospital receives federal funds under various federal programs, including the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291 <em>et seq., </em>which provides moneys for the construction of medical facilities. The district court held that the protection of Title VI extended only to intended beneficiaries of, applicants for, and participants in a federally funded program. Because there were no allegations in the complaint indicating that physicians were the intended beneficiaries of such programs, the district court dismissed the Title VI claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">This court has held that in order to bring a private action under Title VI \u201cthe plaintiff must be the intended beneficiary of, an applicant for, or a participant in<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>federally funded program.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Simpson v.

She does not, however, tell us why we should construe the regulations (which, of course, directly govern the disbursement of federal funds) to create private causes of action. It is not clear to us why these regulations,. which are complex and ambiguous, necessarily reflect congressional intent with respect to private causes of action. We think that the principle articulated in the cases we have cited continues to apply here; plaintiff must be an intended beneficiary to bring a private action under Title VI. <em>Cf. Kelly v.

Section 80.3(c)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aue-dedup-0\">45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.3(c)(3). Plaintiff contends essentially that discrimination against doctors imports discrimination against their patients (presumably the primary beneficiaries here). In this connection, several courts have stated that a private cause of action lies if the alleged discrimination \u201cnecessarily causes discrimination against the primary beneficiaries of the federal aid.\u201d <em>Trageser, </em>590 F.2d at 89 (footnote omitted); <em>see Simpson, </em>629 F.2d at 1235 n. 16; <em>Mosley, </em>574 F.Supp. at 236; <em>Murphy v.

The district court held that one must be an \u201cemployee\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to state a claim for employment discrimination under Title VII. Because there was no employment relationship between the plaintiff and the hospital, the district court dismissed this claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The appellant does not argue that she was an \u201cemployee\u201d of the hospital. Rather, appellant argues that Title VII does not require an employment relationship between the plaintiff and defendant as a prerequisite to a claim under Title VII. Doe relies on <em>Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973), and <em>Pun-tolillo v. New Hampshire Racing Commission, </em>375 F.Supp. 1089 (D.N.H.1974). We think that plaintiff\u2019s reliance on these cases at least at the pleading stage \u2014 especially <em>Sibley </em>\u2014is appropriate. Because she may have been able to establish that she was intended to be protected by Title VII, the district court should not have dismissed this claim at the pleading stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">First, we note that the language of Title VII is broad. Section 2000e-2(a) does not use the term \u201cemployee\u201d but rather refers to \u201cany individual.\u201d <em>See Sibley, </em>488 F.2d at 1341. There are no indications that \u201cany individual\u201d should be read to mean only an employee of an employer.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Hence, the argument that Doe is not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the hospital, as defined by Title VII, is not dispositive. Further, Title VII prohibits discrimination not only with respect to conditions of employment, but also with respect to <em>\u201cprivileges of employment.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (emphasis supplied). The courts have held that Title VII should be construed \u201cliberally so as to further the goals and purposes of eliminating discrimination in employment.\u201d <em>Unger v. Consolidated Foods Corp., </em>657 F.2d 909, 915 n. 8 (7th Cir.1981), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>456 U.S. 1002, 102 S.Ct. 2288, 73 L.Ed.2d 1297 (1982); <em>see, e.g., Martinez v. Orr, </em>738 F.2d 1107, 1110 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Armbruster v. Quinn, </em>711 F.2d 1332, 1336 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Baker v. Stuart Broadcasting Co., </em>560 F.2d 389, 391 (8th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">In <em>Sibley </em>the plaintiff was a male private duty nurse who worked in a private hospital for patients who required a private nurse. When a patient needed a private nurse the hospital\u2019s nursing office would communicate the request to a registry. Neither the hospital nor the registry was permitted to discriminate on the basis of sex. The registry would match the patient with an available nurse, and the nurse would report to the patient. If the nurse was unacceptable to the patient, for any reason, the patient would still be required to pay the nurse one day\u2019s wages. The plaintiff complained that supervisory nurses at .the defendant hospital had themselves rejected him and prevented him from reporting to the patient when the patient was female.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">The court in <em>Sibley </em>held that the plaintiff had a Title VII claim, despite the absence of an employment relationship between the nurse and the hospital. The court first noted that in Title VII Congress had in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tended to \u201cachieve <em>equality of employment opportunities, </em>\u201d and to \u201cprovide equal access to the job market for both men and women.\u201d <em>Sibley, </em>488 F.2d at 1340-41 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 429, 91 S.Ct. 849, 852, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) and <em>Diaz v.

To permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances peculiarly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer, while it could not do so with respect to employment in its own service, would be to condone the continued use of the very criteria for employment that Congress has prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>Sibley, </em>488 F.2d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In <em>Puntolillo </em>the plaintiff, a driver-trainer of harness horses, sued the New Hampshire Eacing Commission under Title VII for denying him a necessary license to race, and the New Hampshire Trotting and Breeding Association for denying him stall space at the race park. The plaintiff was employed by the horse owners, not by either of the defendants. The court, following <em>Sibley, </em>denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The courts\u2019 reasoning seems to apply to the case before us. Plaintiff alleges that the hospital\u2019s action has interfered with her employment opportunities.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Congress presumably did not intend to allow the hospital to exploit its power to grant and deny staff privileges in order to discriminatorily interfere with Doe\u2019s employment opportunities with her patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Appellees assert that <em>Sibley </em>should be distinguished because there the hospital could entirely foreclose the nurse\u2019s access to patients, while in the case before us St. Joseph\u2019s has no such control over the physician\u2019s access to her patients.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Similarly, the dissent argues that in <em>Sibley </em>the \u201chospital\u2019s control over the employees at issue was, as a practical matter, absolute.\u201d Slip op. at 427. But the hospital in <em>Sibley </em>could only foreclose the nurse\u2019s access to patients in that hospital. The nurse\u2019s employment opportunities outside of that hos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>pital, for example at other private hospitals, apparently remained unimpaired. <em>See Shehadeh v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>595 F.2d 711, 722 (D.C.Cir. 1978). Hence <em>Sibley </em>cannot be distinguished by merely pointing out that Doe may treat her patients in her office or in another hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Similarly, appellees would distinguish <em>Puntolillo </em>because the plaintiff could not race at all without a license. We disagree. A defendant does not have to foreclose all employment opportunities in order to unlawfully interfere with these opportunities.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Further, other circuits have held that an \u201cemployer,\u201d for purposes of a Title VII claim, may be \u201cany party who significantly affects access of any individual to employment opportunities, regardless whether that party may technically be described as an \u2018employer\u2019 of an aggrieved individual as that term has generally been defined at common law.\u201d <em>Spirt v. Teachers Insurance &amp; Annunity Association, </em>691 F.2d 1054, 1063 (2d Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Vanguard Justice Society, Inc. v. Hughes, </em>471 F.Supp. 670, 696 (D.Md.1979)), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>463 U.S. 1223, 103 S.Ct. 3565, 77 L.Ed.2d 1406 (1983); <em>see, e.g., Gomez v.

Ewing, </em>601 F.2d 1110, 1114 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 870, 100 S.Ct. 147, 62 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The dissent relies upon <em>Beverley v. Douglas, </em>591 F.Supp. 1321, 1328 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), for the proposition that, even under the <em>Sibley </em>analysis, Doe cannot invoke Title VII because she does not have an employment relationship with her patients. In <em>Beverley </em>the plaintiff, a physician, was denied voluntary admitting privileges at the defendant hospital. The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all claims, including a Title VII claim. The court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that she could make a Title VII claim under the <em>Sibley </em>analysis. The court reasoned that the hospital must interfere with the physician\u2019s employment relationship. Because the plaintiff in <em>Beverley </em>admitted that her relationship to her patients was not that of employer and employee, but rather was that of an independent contractor, the plaintiff could not bring her Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">We note, however, that at least one district court has denied a motion to dismiss a Title VII claim involving similar allegations. <em>See Pao v. Holy Redeemer Hospital, </em>547 F.Supp. 484 (E.D.Penn.1982). In that case the plaintiff, an opthalmologist of Chinese ancestry, alleged that the defendant had impaired his ability to practice by repeatedly denying him staff privileges,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> even though he had staff privileges at other hospitals.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court held that the case fell within <em>Sibley. See Pao, </em>547 F.Supp. at 494.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">In the present case, it appears that if the allegations contained in the amended complaint are true, the defendants\u2019 discriminatory conduct will have deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the plaintiff of prospective patients desiring the convenience and resources of Holy Redeemer Hospital\u2019s retinal facilities. Thus, Holy Redeemer Hospital had the same capacity as the defendant in <em>Sibley </em>to control the plaintiff\u2019s access to those <em>prospective patients who are his ultimate \u201cemployers. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied). Thus <em>Pao </em>implicitly holds that a physician may have an employment relationship with her patients sufficient to bring a Title VII claim under the <em>Sibley </em>analysis.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Further, it may be difficult to distinguish the employment relationship between a nurse and his patients, which was evidently sufficient to sustain a Title VII claim in <em>Sibley, </em>and the employment relationship between a physician and her patients. As one court has noted, \u201c[a]rguably, a male nurse who works on a day-to-day basis or a driver-trainer who works for a horse owner is an independent contractor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Dutra Trucking Co., </em>410 F.Supp. 513, 518 n. 11 (N.D.Cal.1976), <em>aff'd mem., </em>580 F.2d 1054 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Thus it is far from certain that the doctor-patient relationship would not be protected under a <em>Sibley </em>analysis. There is substantial uncertainty about the type of employment relationship that is protected by such an analysis. Because of this uncertainty, it is premature to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim at the pleading stage. The only case we have found that considers a claim for denial of a physician\u2019s staff privileges under Title VII at the pleading stage is <em>Pao v. Holy Redeemer Hospital, supra, </em>which sustains the claims. Thus, appellant should be allowed to make a showing that defendant has discriminato-rily interfered with her employment opportunities in such a way as would fit clearly into the <em>Sibley </em>analysis. We express no view at this stage on the prospects of making such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The defendants alternatively argue that we should affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the grounds that federal jurisdiction is lacking because the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. The defendants, however, fail to cite any cases in support of this argument that involve claims under section 1981, Title VI or Title VII.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It appears that exhaustion of remedies does not apply to claims under any of the civil rights acts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See Donaldson v.

Further, she argues that an appeal must be requested within ten days following the receipt of the recommendation, and that the letter of February 10, 1983, was not in the form of a recommendation.

We see no reason why the state\u2019s active supervision of the peer review process, discussed thoroughly in <em>Marrese, see </em>748 F.2d at 389-91, would not extend to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Further, it is not clear from the record that the reasons for plaintiffs dismissal are entirely unrelated to the quality of patient care. The letter of suspension referred to \"previous incidents of unprofessional behavior,\u201d which may be related to quality of care. Further, the specific incident complained of occurred in the presence of a patient who was facing serious surgery the next day. Doe\u2019s comments may have upset the patient, and thus adversely affected the quality of care she received. Finally, we note that the Executive Committee required Doe to complete a certified Physician Re-training Program before reapplying for staff privileges. This is not required by the hospital bylaws. One may well infer from this requirement some concern with the quality of Doe's patient care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b510-18\">. Plaintiff also argues that <em>Marrese </em>should be distinguished because in that case the plaintiff alleged that the defendants were acting within the Indiana peer review process, whereas Doe has not made a similar allegation.

Appellees also assert that <em>Sibley </em>should be distinguished because the plaintiff in <em>Sibley </em>was an employee of the hospital. Appellees' Brief at 13. We have been unable to find support in the case for this assertion. Indeed, the court said that \"there seems to be no question that appellant and appellee did not contemplate any immediate or future relationship of direct employment in the sense of the usual indicia of such employment.\" <em>Sibley, </em>488 F.2d at 1342; <em>see Martin v.

Once again, counsel misunderstands <em>Sibley. </em>The hospital did not discriminate in referring patients\u2019 offers of employment to nurses. Rather, the hospital discriminated by not permitting the referred nurse access to the patient. When the hospital denied the plaintiff access it was not acting in its role as \"employment agency.\u201d The court in <em>Sibley </em>held that the hospital was similar to labor unions and employment agencies because it had a \"highly visible nexus with the creation and continuance of direct employment relationships between third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We think that Doe should be allowed to show both on summary judgment and, if appropriate, at trial that St. Joseph\u2019s has such a nexus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">. For example, in <em>Gomez v. Alexian Bros. Hosp., </em>698 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir.1983), the plaintiff was a Hispanic physician who practiced medicine as an employee of the professional corporation AES. Plaintiff alleged a Title VII violation when the contract proposal that AES submitted to the hospital for the operation of the emergency room was rejected, allegedly because many of AES' employees were Hispanic. Under the proposal the plaintiff was to serve as the director of the hospital's emergency room. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants because there was no present or potential employment relationship between plaintiff and defendant; the plaintiff would in any case remain an employee of AES. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \"[t]he fact that plaintiff continues as an employee of AES does not mean the employment relationship between AES and plaintiff has not been interfered with.

In <em>Pao </em>the court placed the word \"employers\u201d within quotation marks, thus indicating that a common law employment relationship is not required between the physician and her patients.

The court assumed that there must be an employment relationship between the physician and the hospital without even discussing <em>Sibley. </em>The <em>Amro </em>court held that under the \"hybrid\u201d test there was no employment relationship between the physician and the hospital and thus the physician could not bring a Title VII action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b519-14\">.

Dr. Doe does not dispute the fact that she did not have an employment relationship with St. Joseph\u2019s for purposes of Title VII. Rather, she contends that the hospital\u2019s action in denying her \u201cstaff privileges\u201d interfered with her employment opportunities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>A discriminatory denial of staff privileges to a physician adversely affects her ability to obtain and maintain employment by patients who need hospitalization.

Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973), and <em>Puntolillo v. New Hampshire Racing Commission, </em>375 F.Supp. 1089 (D.N.H.1974) is appropriate. I agree that those cases provide support for the proposition that Title VII was intended to \u201cachieve <em>equality of employment opportunities,\u201d </em>and to \u201cprovide equal access to the job market for both men and women.\u201d <em>Sibley, </em>488 F.2d at 1340-41 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 429, 91 S.Ct. 849, 852, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) and <em>Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>442 F.2d 385, 386 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 950, 92 S.Ct. 275, 30 L.Ed.2d 267 (1971), respectively). However, I do not believe that those cases provide support for Dr. Doe\u2019s claim. There is a vital distinction between the <em>Sibley </em>and <em>Puntolillo </em>holdings and this case \u2014 the <em>degree </em>of control exercised by the defendant over the plaintiff's access to employment opportunities. In <em>Sibley, </em>the action of the hospital prevented Wilson from making the contact necessary to establish an employment relationship between himself and his \u201cemployers\u201d \u2014 the patients. The hospital\u2019s control over access to the \u201cemployers\u201d at issue was, as a practical matter, absolute. Similarly, in <em>Puntolillo, </em>the action of the Commissioner effectively precluded Punto-lillo from establishing an employment relationship with horse owners \u2014 his potential \u201cemployers.\u201d In both cases, the defendants had total effective control over the plaintiffs\u2019 abilities to contact their actual \u201cemployers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">In this case, however, St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital does not have such total control over Dr. Doe\u2019s ability to obtain patients. It cannot prevent or preclude her from maintaining or establishing relationships with patients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her \u201cstaff privileges\u201d at St. Joseph\u2019s simply afforded her an opportunity to treat her patients in that particular hospital. Dr. Doe is. still free to treat her patients at her office or in any other health facility. In short, since St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital does not control Dr. Doe\u2019s access to patients, its action cannot be characterized as interfering with her employment relationships with her patients.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The specific question of whether Title VII affords protection to physicians who are affiliated with hospitals has been considered by three courts. Those courts reached different results. As the majority notes, one district court concluded that the denial of staff privileges falls within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Sibley </em>rule. <em>See Pao v. Holy Redeemer Hospital, </em>547 F.Supp. 484 (E.D.Pa.1982). The <em>Pao </em>court decided that the hospital had the \u201csame capacity as the defendant in <em>Sibley </em>to control the plaintiff\u2019s access to those prospective patients who are his ultimate \u2018employers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pao, </em>547 F.Supp. at 494. The court, therefore, refused to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. I believe that this decision was incorrect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In my view, a recent case, <em>Beverley v. Douglas, </em>591 F.Supp. 1321, 1328 (S.D.N.Y.1984), presents a rationale far more compatible with congressional intent. In <em>Beverley, </em>the district court considered the question whether the denial of admitting privileges at a hospital presented an employment relationship within the meaning of Title VII. After rejecting the argument that the physician had an employer-employee relationship with the hospital, <em>id. </em>at 1327, it addressed the argument that denial of hospital privileges interferes with the physician\u2019s future employment opportunities with his or her patients. After distinguishing <em>Sibley </em>and <em>Gomez </em>along the lines suggested in the foregoing paragraphs, Judge Weinfeld concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">Even assuming that plaintiff has alleged that the Hospital\u2019s denial of her application for voluntary attending privileges interfered with her relationship to her patients, her relationship to her patients is not one of employment. Indeed, plaintiff admits that \u201cthere is no question that a \u2018physician, in his or her relationship with patients, is the classic independent contractor.\u2019 \u201d In order to invoke Title VII, plaintiff must allege and prove some link between the defendants\u2019 actions and an employment relationship. No such connection is present here \u2014 by plaintiff\u2019s own admission, her relationship to her patients is not that of employer and employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The analysis employed by Judge Wein-feld in <em>Beverley </em>is the correct one. Dr. Doe has not established the connection between herself and the hospital necessary to state a claim under Title VII \u2014 an employment relationship with which there has been interference. Physicians with \u201cstaff privileges\u201d such as Dr. Doe are independent contractors. Moreover, physicians are not considered to have an employment relationship with their patients. Rather, it is a client/professional relationship \u2014 much like that between an attorney and his client. Thus, under any reading of Dr. Doe\u2019s claim, she does not state a cause of action under Title VII, and the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claim should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. Dr. Doe alleged in her complaint that she has applied for \"staff privileges\u201d at other Ft. Wayne hospitals but that she had not as yet been granted those privileges. However, the fact that no other hospital has accorded her privileges does not require St. Joseph\u2019s to keep her on staff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. This analysis applies with equal force to <em>Gomez v. Alexian Bros. Hosp., </em>698 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983). In <em>Gomez, </em>the plaintiff was a Hispanic physician who practiced medicine as a professional corporation under the name American Emergency Services Professional Corporation Medical Group (AES). In 1978, AES submitted a bid to run the defendant\u2019s emergency room. Plaintiff was to act as director of the emergency room, and five of the twelve participating physicians were to be Hispanic. The hospital rejected the bid. The court found that Dr. Gomez stated a cause of action under Title VII because he alleged that the hospital\u2019s refusal, purportedly on racial grounds, \"denied him the opportunity to be employed by AES as director of defendant\u2019s emergency room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"A3F\">The employment opportunity sought by Gomez was to handle emergency patient care on a full-time basis. Patients in need of such emergency care seek it from health care facilities not individual physicians. By refusing the AES bid, the hospital effectively precluded Gomez from any access to emergency medical patients. Again, Dr. Doe has not been so hampered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. A subsequent decision from the same district has substantially undercut the rationale of <em>Pao. </em>In <em>Amro v. St. Luke\u2019s Hosp., </em>39 Fair Empl.Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1574 (E.D.Pa.1986), the court held that \"[e]ven though the defendant hospital may exercise economic control over \u2022 the plaintiffs future to earn income, this is not sufficient to counterbalance all the other factors which tend to classify the doctor as an independent contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1577.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
