The district court found plaintiffs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>be \u201cprevailing parties\u201d under the terms of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 in their \u00a7 1983 action against the Commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that the Commissioner violated the first and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution when he issued a decision interpreting R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7 16-7-30 (1981) to require the School District to pay tuition for a student to attend a religiously affiliated high school and ordering it to take certain steps to comply with that decision. The \u00a7 1983 action was later dismissed as moot when the Rhode Island Supreme Court, on certification from the district court, ruled that the Commissioner had misconstrued Rhode Island law. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees has been stipulated to by the parties, and the only issue on appeal is whether the Commissioner is liable for those fees under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiff School District does not operate a high school. Its policy under R.I. GenXaws \u00a7 16-7-30 (1981)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is to pay the tuition for the District\u2019s students to attend either of two neighboring public high schools, or to pay . up to that amount for students to attend any public high school in Rhode Island. This case arose when a parent sought to have the School District pay tuition for his son to attend a religiously affiliated private academy, and both the Superintendent of Schools and the School Committee denied his request. The parent appealed the denials to the Commissioner, who issued a decision construing the Rhode Island statute to require the School District to provide tuition for students to attend <em>any </em>public, private, or religiously affiliated, high school in Rhode Island, absent a rational motive for limiting the choice of high schools. Finding no rational motive for the School District\u2019s choice of the two neighboring public high schools, the Commissioner ordered the School District to pay the tuition for attendance at the religious academy. On a request for stay, the Commissioner amended his order to require the School District to create a separate bank account and to pay into it the amount of the tuition pending final appeal of the decision. The School District appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Board of Regents for Education pursuant to R.I. Gen.Laws \u00a7 16-39-3 (1981). A decision by the Board of Regents is final unless certio-rari is granted to hear the appeal by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">After filing their administrative appeal, plaintiffs instituted an action in federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief, asking that the Commissioner\u2019s order be rescinded as an unconstitutional establishment of religion under the first and fourteenth amendments. .Plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. The state Board of Regents announced that it would defer action on the appeal until the district court ruled on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">After stipulations of fact and memoran-da of law were submitted, the district court moved <em>sua sponte </em>to certify to the Rhode Island Supreme Court the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">Does R.I.GenXaws \u00a7 16-7-30 require a community not maintaining a high school to fund the education of those resident students who choose to attend religiously-affiliated high schools where the community already provides for free education at certain public high schools outside the community?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Plaintiffs, and defendants briefed and argued the question before the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The court answered the question in the negative, ruling that the School District had acted in accord with the law in choosing certain public schools to which it would pay tuition for its students. <em>Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School District v. Pontarelli, </em>460 A.2d 934 (R.I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>1983).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court then dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as moot. After the plaintiffs filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the district court issued an order ruling they were \u201cprevailing parties\u201d and were entitled to fees. A stipulation as to the amount of the fees was entered into and judgment for plaintiffs was entered. Defendant then took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As we understand defendant\u2019s brief, he challenges the fee order on the following grounds: (1) that the plaintiffs are not the prevailing parties; (2) that, if the plaintiffs are considered to be the prevailing parties, they did not prevail in an action to enforce \u00a7 1983; (3) that the district court had no jurisdiction over the state-law question on which the plaintiffs did prevail; (4) that the eleventh amendment bars attorney\u2019s fees; and (5) that there is either no case or controversy or the case is not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKM\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[ ] ... 1983 ..., the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Our cases have set out two standard tests for determining when a party shall be deemed \u201cprevailing\u201d under \u00a7 1988. In <em>Na-deau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275 (1st Cir. 1978), we held that \u00a7 1988 permitted an award of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs who gained relief from the constitutional violations alleged in their complaint against state prison officials for both that part of their case that resulted in a judgment on the merits and that part of their case that was settled by a favorable consent decree. We stated that there were two alternative tests for determining when a plaintiff shall be deemed \u201cprevailing.\u201d The first we now call the \u201cmerits\u201d test. The second is already known as the \u201ccatalyst\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Under the first <em>Nadeau </em>test, the merits test,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">plaintiffs may be considered \u201cprevailing parties\u201d for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 278-79. The Supreme Court endorsed this test in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). In <em>Lund v. Affleck, </em>587 F.2d 75 (1st Cir.1978), we held that the merits test is met, and attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded, when a party prevails not on any part of the \u00a7 1983 claim but on a pendent, nonconstitutional statutory claim, if the \u00a7 1983 claim was \u201csubstantial and ... the successful pendent claim arose from the same nucleus of facts.\u201d <em>Lund v. Affleck, </em>587 F.2d at 77. We relied on the express language of the House Report accompanying the enactment of \u00a7 1988:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">In some instances ... the [\u00a7 1983] claim ... may involve a constitutional question which the courts are reluctant to resolve if [a pendent] non-constitutional claim is dispositive. <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528 [94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577] (1974). In such, cases, if the claim for which fees may be awarded meets the \u201csubstantiality\u201d test, <em>see Hagans v. Lavine, </em>supra; <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715 [86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218] (1966), attorney\u2019s fees may be allowed even though the court declines to enter judgment for the plaintiff on that claim, so long as the plaintiff prevails on the non-fee claim arising out of a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra </em>at 725 [86 S.Ct. at 1138].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Comm, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the Judiciary, <em>Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, Source Book: Legislative History, Texts, and Other Documents </em>at 212 n.7 (Comm.Print 1976). Ah though in the present case the dispositive issue was not a pendent claim but a state-law question certified to the state supreme court, we think that the same analysis is appropriate. As we recently said in <em>Aubin v. Fudala, </em>782 F.2d 287 (1st Cir.1986): \u201c \u2018[V]ictory\u2019 in a civil rights suit is typically a practical, rather than a strictly legal matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Applying the merits test we find that plaintiffs have achieved not some but <em>all </em>the benefit they sought from their \u00a7 1983 claim. They challenged the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s decision and succeeded in having it overturned. The state-law issue on which they prevailed also arose from the same nucleus of common fact as the \u00a7 1983 issue \u2014 the Commissioner\u2019s decision. It was significant and substantial since its resolution disposed of the entire matter. Finally, the state-law issue was an issue \u201cin litigation\u201d even though it was not raised in the pleadings and, under <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 121, 104 S.Ct. 900, 919, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), could not have been pendent to the \u00a7 1983 claim unless the state waived its immunity. It was part of the case, and therefore \u201cin litigation,\u201d because the district court determined that under the abstention doctrine of <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), and <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1244, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), the issue had to be decided by the Rhode Island Supreme Court before the federal court could reach the constitutional issues in the case. We find the merits test is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Defendant invokes <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, arguing generally that it prevents us from interpreting \u00a7 1988 so as to allow a district court to award fees for state-court proceedings that litigated and determined a state-law issue over which the district court did not have jurisdiction. We do not think that <em>Penn-hurst </em>cuts such a wide swath. Indeed, <em>Pennhurst </em>encourages by implication the very certification procedure the district court employed here. The only way to harmonize the federalism concerns of <em>Pennhurst, </em>the abstention doctrine of <em>Pullman, </em>and Congress\u2019 desire to create an incentive under \u00a7 1988 for plaintiffs to seek enforcement of federal civil rights law in federal courts, is by awarding fees in certification cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We agree with the statement by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Bartholomew v. Watson, </em>665 F.2d 910 (9th Cir.1982), that if fees are not allowed for work done in state-court proceedings when the district court abstains from deciding federal \u00a7 1983 claims arising out of the same facts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APY\">serious strains between the state and federal court systems might develop. State defendants would be required to seek abstention until involved state law was adjudicated in state courts. Plaintiffs seeking relief under section 1983 would be compelled to oppose any move from federal court, despite the fact that an initial determination of certain matters by the state court might simplify or even moot the federal action because of the loss of the right to claim attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. A plaintiff\u2019s attorney would be penalized if some of his client\u2019s section 1983 claims were disposed of in a state forum. The ability to obtain counsel would therefore suffer. This double standard of awarding attorney\u2019s fees would encourage forum shopping and interfere with efficient allocation of issues and cases between the state and federal systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 913. There is solid precedent for allowing fees under \u00a7 1988 for work done in a state court. <em>See Lampher v. Zagel, </em>755 F.2d 99 (7th Cir.1985) (fees permitted plaintiffs for defense of state confiscation proceedings, district court had stayed \u00a7 1983 proceedings at the defendant\u2019s request); <em>Stathos v. Bowden, </em>728 F.2d 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(1st Cir.1984) (fees permitted plaintiffs under \u00a7 1988 for defense of state declaratory judgment action brought by defendants in anticipation of plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action); <em>Bartholomew v. Watson, </em>665 F.2d 910 (fees permitted plaintiffs for work done in state court proceedings to determine potentially conclusive state-law question, the district court had stayed proceedings at the defendants\u2019 request).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The Supreme Court has also recently indicated in <em>Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County, Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985), that in some cases state-court proceedings may be such an integral part of a federal \u00a7 1983 action that they are compensable under \u00a7 1988. In <em>Webb </em>the Court acknowledged that fees may be awarded for a \u201cdiscrete portion\u201d of work done in state proceedings \u201cuseful and of a type ordinarily necessary\u201d to the successful outcome of the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1929. <em>See also id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1930-31 (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting). Although the holding in <em>Webb </em>denied fees for work done by plaintiff\u2019s attorney in state proceedings, those proceedings were pursuant to state administrative remedies which were concluded before the federal \u00a7 1983 action was filed. Because there is no exhaustion requirement for bringing a \u00a7 1983 suit, <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 501, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2560, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982), the completed state administrative proceedings in <em>Webb </em>could not be said to have been an integral part of the federal action. <em>Webb v. Board of Education, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1927-28. <em>Cf. New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980) (under Title VII, where exhaustion of administrative remedies is required before suit may be brought, attorney\u2019s fees for prior state administrative proceedings are recoverable).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">We hold that <em>Pennhurst </em>does not bar us from finding that plaintiffs are \u201cprevailing parties\u201d under the merits test.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">The second test set out in <em>Nadeau, </em>581 F.2d 275, the catalyst test, applies to plaintiffs who have succeeded in achieving favorable results because of the filing of their \u00a7 1983 claim, but have not had a final judgment on the merits entered in their favor. Plaintiffs must first show that their \u201csuit and their attorney\u2019s efforts were a necessary and important factor in achieving\u201d an end result favorable to them. <em>Id. </em>at 281. They must also show that their unadjudicated constitutional claim was not \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Applying the catalyst test here, we find that the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 suit and their attorneys\u2019 efforts both in federal court and in the certification proceedings before the Rhode Island Supreme Court were \u201cnecessary and important factors in achieving\u201d a reversal of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The favorable ruling by the Rhode Island Supreme Court was a direct result of the federal \u00a7 1983 action. Defendant claims the \u00a7 1983 action was not \u201cnecessary\u201d to the result because the ordinary administrative appeal route would have also ended at the state supreme court. This argument overlooks two factors: that the Rhode Island Supreme Court could have denied certiorari to an appeal from a decision of the Board of Regents, and that a party need not exhaust his state administrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 action, <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. at 501, 102 S.Ct. at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Defendant urges that the mooting of the \u00a7 1983 action is dispositive. The law is otherwise. The Supreme Court in upholding an award of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs who prevailed on a consent decree, and not on final judgment, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-17\">[njothing in the language of \u00a7 1988 conditions the District Court\u2019s power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff\u2019s rights have been violated. Moreover, the Senate Report expressly stated that \u201cfor purposes of the award of counsel fees, parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5912.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). The law in this and other circuits is that plaintiffs may be \u201cprevailing parties\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1988 even though their \u00a7 1983 action was dismissed as moot. <em>See, e.g., Grano v. Barry, </em>733 F.2d 164, 168 <em>n.2 </em>(D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Coalition for Basic Human Needs v. King, </em>691 F.2d 597 (1st Cir.1982); <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375, 1379 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Morrison v. Ayoob, </em>627 F.2d 669 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1102, 101 S.Ct. 898, 66 L.Ed.2d 828 (1981); <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 2336, 68 L.Ed.2d 855 (1981); <em>Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981). We find that the catalyst test has also been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Defendant also challenges the award of attorney\u2019s fees on eleventh amendment grounds. As we construe it, he argues that since <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, holds that eleventh amendment sovereign immunity bars the federal courts from deciding pendent state-law claims against state officials that impact directly on the state, <em>id. </em>at 117, 104 S.Ct. at 917, it must also bar federal courts from awarding fees for work done in pursuing certified state-law claims before a state supreme court. This overlooks <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>439 U.S. 1122, 99 S.Ct. 1035, 59 L.Ed.2d 83 (1979), and <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, cases that reject this eleventh amendment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, held that Congress abrogated the states\u2019 eleventh amendment sovereign immunity when it enacted \u00a7 1988, permitting private persons to recover attorney\u2019s fees against a state when they prevail in actions for declaratory or injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 98 S.Ct. at 2574-75. <em>Hutto </em>built on <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </em>427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976), where the Court had recognized Congress\u2019 power under \u00a7 5 of the fourteenth amendment to abrogate the states\u2019 eleventh amendment sovereign immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2671. <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, then went a step further. In <em>Maher </em>a \u00a7 1983 action was brought for various constitutional and Social Security Act violations, and the case was eventually settled with a consent decree. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that an award of attorney\u2019s fees can only be made against the state if the district court enters judgment for a constitutional violation. The Court held that if a plaintiff alleges violations of her constitutional rights which are \u201csufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction under <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, [94 S.Ct. 1372,]\u201d and these constitutional issues \u201cremainf ] in the case until the entire dispute [i]s settled,\u201d then the eleventh amendment claim is foreclosed by <em>Hutto. Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. at 130-31, 100 S.Ct. at 2575. All nine justices \u201caccepted] <em>Hutto </em>as binding precedent for this case.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>448 U.S. at 135, 100 S.Ct. at 2577 (Powell, J., concurring). <em>Maher </em>is met here. There is no question that plaintiffs in this case raised a \u201csubstantial\u201d constitutional question under the establishment clause that supported federal jurisdiction, <em>see Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-41, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1378-81, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), and that this question remained in the case until disposition of the state-law issue mooted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Defendant argues that following <em>Penn-hurst </em>we must find this case differs from <em>Maher </em>for purposes of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity because in <em>Maher </em>all the work for which fees were granted was done in pursuit of claims over which the district court had jurisdiction. Here, the work in question was to litigate a state-law issue over which the district court could have no jurisdiction unless the defendant waived sovereign immunity. Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ing in our reading of <em>Pennhurst </em>suggests that we should distinguish this case from <em>Maher. </em>We have already noted that interpreting \u00a7 1988 to allow an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a certification case will best harmonize <em>Pennhurst </em>with the <em>Pullman </em>abstention doctrine and Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 1988. <em>Hutto </em>teaches that Congress has the power to abrogate the eleventh amendment in order to enforce the fourteenth amendment, and that it exercised that power when it enacted \u00a7 1988. We think it follows that the eleventh amendment sovereign immunity has been abrogated, and that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded in any case where fees are allowed under either the merits or catalyst test and the <em>Maher </em>requirements are met. Since this case meets both tests, and satisfies the requirements of <em>Maher, </em>we hold that an award of fees is not barred by the eleventh amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, defendant argues that there is no case or controversy because \u201cthere is no allegation that [any enforcement] powers were used or that their use was threatened\u201d by the Commissioner, and says that \u201cit is doubtful\u201d whether this case is \u201cripe\u201d for adjudication because the Board of Regents had not yet acted. Neither argument has merit. The Commissioner issued a final decision construing the Rhode Island statute, and ordered the school district to pay tuition for the son of a school district resident to attend a religiously affiliated high school. It later amended its order to require the money be paid into a special account pending final appeal of its decision. The district court later issued a temporary restraining order against the Commissioner\u2019s order. Surely a live case and controversy existed. Defendant\u2019s ripeness argument fails because the exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required before a \u00a7 1983 suit may be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The order of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Costs to appellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-12\">. The Associate Commissioner of Education issued the decision and order which plaintiffs claim violated the Constitution. The Commissioner approved it. For simplicity, we will do as the district court did and treat the defendants as one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">.
