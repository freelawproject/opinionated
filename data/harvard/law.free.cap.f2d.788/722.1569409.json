Robert William WADE, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b816-9\">No. 85-5446</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b816-10\">Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b816-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b816-12\">May 6, 1986.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b816-17\">Stanley Marcus, U.S. Atty., Jeff Fisher and David O. Leiwant, Asst. U.S. Attys., Miami, Fla., for U.S.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b816-18\">Robert William Wade, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b816-20\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, HILL and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b816-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b816-22\">Wade pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute and to the accompanying substantive offense, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 955c and 955a(a). On April 13, 1984 he was sentenced to four years on each count consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">This appeal is from the denial of a Rule 35 motion to correct the sentence as illegal because of the provision that the terms are consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-24\">The consecutive terms are not prohibited by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1837, 2031-34; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3561 <em>et seq. </em>Section 3584 thereof does not become effective until November 1, 1986. Moreover it relates to a consecutive term for an attempt and for another offense that was the sole objective of the attempt. 98 Stat. at 2000-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-25\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <em>et seq. </em>authorizes a commission to promulgate sentencing guidelines. Section 994(1 )(2) provides that the guidelines shall reflect the general inappropriateness of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to commit an offense and an offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy. This statute was not effective until October 12, 1984, six months after Wade was sentenced, the guidelines have not been drawn, and even if the statute were retroactive it does not prohibit consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-26\">The contention that Congress did not intend consecutive sentences for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955a(a) and 955c is foreclosed. <em>U.S. v. Allen, </em>724 F.2d 1556, 1558 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
