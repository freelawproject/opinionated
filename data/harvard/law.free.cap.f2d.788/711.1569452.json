The United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, 580 F.Supp. 967, found that the City of Tallahassee\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities were protected by the state action exemption to the federal antitrust laws because the activities were authorized by the State of Florida. Accordingly, the district court granted the City of Tallahassee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-24\">The Falls Chase Special Taxing District (the District) is a special district<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> created by Leon County ordinance on February 11, 1975. The District is located adjacent to the City of Tallahassee (the City), in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>unincorporated area of Leon County, Florida. On February 26, 1981 the District<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed suit against the City, alleging that the City violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 (1982), and the Florida Antitrust Act of 1980, Fla.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 542.15-.36 (1985), in attempting to acquire a monopoly over the provision of water and sewage treatment services in Leon County, and by tying the provision of sewage services to the provision of water services. There are no material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Beginning in 1972, the District\u2019s developers had attempted to secure a commitment from the City to provide the District with water and sewage treatment services. No agreement was reached. In 1978, the District decided to construct and operate its own water and sewage treatment systems. In 1979, the District applied to the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation for a permit to construct the water and sewage treatment systems. The City objected to the issuance of the permit. The District ultimately prevailed and brought this action in district court against the City for challenging the issuance of the construction permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Alleging that it is a potential competitor of the City in the collection and treatment of water and sewage, the District contended that the City engaged in \u201cvexatious litigation\u201d in attempting to gain an unlawful monopoly over the provision of water and sewage treatment services. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that Florida\u2019s statutes regulating the municipal provision of water and sewage services expressed a clear state policy to replace competition with regulation. <em>See Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1713, 1716, 85 L.Ed.2d 24 (1985). The court therefore concluded that the State action exemption shielded the City from liability under the federal antitrust laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District promptly appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Much of our work has already been done. In <em>Auton v. Dade City, </em>783 F.2d 1009, 1011 (11th Cir. Mar. 3, 1986), a panel of this court recently held that the Florida \u201clegislature contemplated municipalities would engage in anticompetitive conduct in the course of providing their citizens with a water supply.\u201d Because we see no meaningful distinction between this case and our case, we rely on, and quote copiously from, <em>Auton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-14\">The parties agree that this case is governed by the standard of municipal antitrust immunity expressed in <em>Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1713, 85 L.Ed.2d 24 (1985), which was decided approximately one month after the district court\u2019s decision in this case. Municipalities are not automatically exempt from the antitrust laws under the state action doctrine; \u201cto obtain exemption, municipalities must demonstrate that their anticompetitive activities were authorized by the State \u2018pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallie, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1716 (quoting <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., </em>435 U.S. 389, 413, 98 S.Ct. 1123, 1137, 55 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978) (Brennan, J., plurality). In order to show state authorization, a municipality \u201cmust demonstrate that it is engaging in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>challenged activity pursuant to a clearly expressed state policy.\u201d <em>Hallie, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1717. While a general grant of authority to govern local affairs is insufficient to constitute a clear articulation of state policy because the State\u2019s position is neutral with respect to the city\u2019s conduct, <em>Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, </em>54-56, 102 S.Ct. 835, 842-43, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982), it is not necessary for the legislature to state explicitly that it intends or expects the municipality\u2019s conduct to have anticompetitive effects. The clear articulation requirement is satisfied if the statutory provisions plainly show that the legislature contemplated anticompetitive conduct would result from the authority granted the municipality. <em>Hallie, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1718-19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">The issue in this case is whether the Florida statutes authorizing municipal water systems satisfy the \u201cclear articulation\u201d requirement expressed in <em>Hallie. </em>Appellants contend the statutes are closer to the neutral general authorization in <em>City of Boulder, supra. </em>Appellees argue, and the district court found, that the statutory scheme contains a clearly articulated state policy which authorizes Dade City to engage in anticompetitive conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">We hold Dade City\u2019s conduct was authorized by clearly articulated state policy. Appellants argue the Florida legislature was neutral toward this conduct because Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.06 is merely a vague enabling statute more analogous to the Home Rule Amendment in <em>City of Boulder </em>than the Wisconsin statutes in <em>Hallie. </em>We do not agree. The Colorado Home Rule Amendment was characterized as neutral because it was completely silent regarding the city\u2019s conduct. <em>City of Boulder, </em>455 U.S. at 55, 102 S.Ct. at 842-43. Here, the Florida legislature has enacted several statutes concerning municipalities and their water and sewage systems. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.06(3), (6) (1985) authorizes municipalities \u201cto provide a water supply for domestic, municipal or industrial uses\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and \u201cincidental to such purposes and to enable the accomplishment of the same, to construct reservoirs, sewerage systems, trunk sewers, intercepting sewers, pumping stations, wells, siphons, intakes, pipelines, distribution systems, purification works, collection systems, treatment and disposal works.\u201d Section 180.06 also provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">a private company or municipality shall not construct any system ... authorized to be constructed hereunder in the event that a system ... of a similar character is being actually operated by a municipality or private company in the municipality or territory immediately adjacent thereto, unless such municipality or private company consents to such construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">This indicates that the legislature recognized that municipal public works often require anticompetitive practices. To engage in one of the authorized public works, a municipality may exercise its corporate powers within its corporate limits and extend outside its corporate limits up to another municipality\u2019s boundary. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.02(1), (2) (1985). These sections are similar to the Wisconsin statutes found to satisfy the clear articulation requirement in <em>Hallie. </em>The Florida statutory scheme, however, contains additional provisions which strengthen the conclusion that the legislature contemplated municipalities would engage in anticompetitive conduct in the course of providing their citizens with a water supply. For example, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.22 (1985) grants municipalities the power of eminent domain in connection with the activities authorized by Chapter 180 while Fla.Stat. \u00a7 166.411 (1985) authorizes the use of eminent domain for, among other municipal purposes, the use of water pipes, sewage and drainage pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>poses, and Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.13 (1985) grants the power to fix water rates. The cumulative effect of these statutes is to grant Florida municipalities broad power to provide water to their inhabitants. The Florida legislature, concerned with ensuring \u201cadequate and dependable supplies of water\u201d to meet the needs of rapidly urbanizing areas, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 373.196(1) (1985), stated that \u201c[i]t is further the intent that municipalities, counties, and regional water authorities are to have the primary responsibility for water supply____\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 373.-196(2) (1985). \u201c[I]t is clear that anticom-petitive effects logically would result from this broad authority to regulate.\u201d <em>Hallie, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1718.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">We similarly hold that these statutory provisions evidence a clearly expressed state policy favoring the City\u2019s actions in our case. Our inquiry, however, is not yet completed. The District has raised an argument not discussed in <em>Auton. </em>It suggests that because the City acted outside the state authorization, its actions cannot be shielded. This argument is based upon the City\u2019s failure to follow the procedures outlined in the Florida statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In <em>Scott v. City of Sioux City, </em>736 F.2d 1207, 1215-16 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1864, 85 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985), the Eighth Circuit recently decided that a city\u2019s slight departure from state mandated procedures did not abrogate the city\u2019s antitrust immunity. \u201cThe city\u2019s departure from state procedural requisites would have to be extreme to warrant the threat of antitrust liability. State authorization for antitrust purposes does not require administrative decisions that are free from ordinary errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the District argues that the City did not abide by Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.02(3) (1985) because the City did not enact an ordinance creating a \u201czone or area\u201d within which it would provide utility services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that this slight error \u201cis not sufficient to strip the city of immunity.\u201d The City\u2019s slight departure from the procedural requisites of the Florida Statutes does not in this case raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City forfeited state authorization. <em>See Scott, </em>736 F.2d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">Based upon the above analysis and authorities, we conclude that the City\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities are shielded from antitrust liability. Accordingly, the summary judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida is</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-14\">. A \u201cspecial district\" is \u201ca local unit of special government ... created pursuant to general or special law for the purpose of performing prescribed specialized functions within limited boundaries and includes municipal service taxing or benefit units.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 200.001(8)(c) (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. Elba, Inc., Sunshine Land Development, Inc. and E. Lamar Bailey Associates were also named as plaintiffs. These plaintiffs own substantially all of the private property within the District and are developing the property for residential and commercial uses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. Originally, the district court denied the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. After the Supreme Court decided <em>Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1713, 85 L.Ed.2d 24 (1985), however, the City filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 20, 1985 the district court granted the motion for reconsideration and entered summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-18\">. The district court did not reach the pendent state antitrust claim. It was not necessary for the court to do so, however, because conduct exempt under the federal antitrust laws is also exempt from the Florida Antitrust Act of 1980. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 542.20 (1985). <em>See Auton </em>v. <em>Dade City, </em>783 F.2d 1009, 1010 n. 1 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\">. Similarly, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.06(4) (1985) authorizes municipalities \u201c[t]o provide for the collection and disposal of sewage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\">. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 180.02(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">In the event any municipality desires to avail itself of the provisions or benefits of this chapter, it is lawful for such municipality to create a zone or area by ordinance and to prescribe reasonable regulations requiring all persons or corporations living or doing business within said area to connect, when available, with any sewerage system constructed, erected and operated under the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, in the creation of said zone the municipality shall not include any area within the limits of any other incorporated city or village, nor shall such area or zone extend for more than 5 miles from the corporate limits of said municipality.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
