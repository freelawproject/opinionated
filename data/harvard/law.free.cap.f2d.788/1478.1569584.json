The investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>gation focused upon loan applications which had been submitted to Sunrise Savings and Loan, a federally insured savings and loan association, in connection with about a dozen sales of Stonewal lots to buyers who were close friends or business acquaintances of Thomas Waldron. The applications reflected a $75,000 purchase price for Stonewal lots, with $13,000 cash deposits, thus inducing Sunrise to lend $62,000 to the purchasers. The government contended that the actual purchase price was $62,000 and that the bank was being fraudulently induced by applications to lend the full purchase price, rather than the 85% maximum provided for by the loan contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">The investigation of the Stonewal sales commenced in May, 1984. Some witnesses testified that they paid $62,000 for the lots, and then signed, or were asked to sign, promissory notes reflecting that Waldron had lent them $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">On September 7 and October 26, 1984, appellant Frank P. \u201cSkip\u201d Petzold appeared before the grand jury. Petzold, a friend and business associate of Waldron, appeared as a witness in connection with the grand jury\u2019s examination of the sale of Lot 146, which had been sold to Alfred Reynolds, Petzold\u2019s neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-6\">During the spring of 1984, Alfred Reynolds purchased Lot 146 through Petzold, a licensed real estate broker. The purchase agreement reflected a purchase price of $75,000 with a $13,000 cash deposit. When the agreement was executed, no $13,000 deposit had been made. Sometime prior to closing, Petzold informed Reynolds that the purchase price would be $65,000 rather than $75,000. Reynolds then submitted a loan application to Sunrise for $62,000. On March 17, 1984, Reynolds gave Petzold a personal check in the amount of $3,000 as a deposit on Lot 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-7\">Prior to the closing on April 16, Sunrise Savings and Loan called Reynolds and requested more information about his loan application. Reynolds eventually obtained the $62,000 from another bank. This loan was secured by other property owned by Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-9\">The closing statement showed a $75,000 selling price and a $13,000 deposit. It did not show the $3,000 which Reynolds paid Petzold on March 17. Reynolds presented a cashier\u2019s check for $62,686.84, bringing to $65,000 the amount Reynolds paid for the lot plus the closing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-10\">On June 2, 1984, Petzold asked Reynolds to exchange $13,000 checks. Reynolds gave Petzold a $13,000 check payable to Skip Petzold Realty Escrow Account, noting \u201cpurchase of Stonewal.\u201d Petzold gave Reynolds a check for the same sum. This check was drawn on his personal account rather than his real estate escrow account. Petzold claims that Reynolds agreed to the exchange of checks because of his trust in Petzold and that there was no discussion of rebates, or promissory notes or discounts. The government describes this exchange as a series of sham transactions designed to give the impression that Reynolds had signed a $13,000 promissory note and then paid it off to cover the $13,000 deposit on his purchase of Lot 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-11\">After completing the exchange of checks, Petzold wrote a letter to Waldron dated June 3, 1984 on Skip Petzold Realty, Inc. letterhead. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-12\">Dear Tom,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-13\">I am in receipt of Mr. Reynolds $13,000 to cover your demand note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-14\">Please execute the note, satisfied, on Lot # 146 and I will deliver to you the funds in my escrow acct. to cover this payment in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-15\">Thank you,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-16\">Skip Petzold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1574-17\">The letter bears a \u201cReceived\u201d stamp dated June 6, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-18\">Petzold wrote another letter to Waldron bearing the date June 8, which reads: Dear Tom,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-19\">Just for your records, I left your Sec\u2019y, my escrow check in the @ of $13,000 to close out Mr. Reynolds\u2019 purchase of lot # 146 Stonewal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>Mr. Reynolds thanks you for the additional time and he loves his lot. I think he will build.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-4\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-5\">Skip</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">This letter bears a \u201cReceived\u201d stamp dated June 8, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-7\">Petzold also executed a check drawn on the Petzold Realty, Inc., escrow account, check no. 131, dated June 8, 1984, in the amount of $13,000 payable to \u201cStonewal Dev. Inc.\u201d The face of the check had a note stating: \u201cNote Pd, in full Bal due to close #146 Reynolds.\u201d The check was deposited to the account of Stonewal Development, Inc. at Sunrise Savings and Loan Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-8\">On June 22, approximately two weeks after the exchange of $13,000 checks with Reynolds, the issuance of the Petzold Realty escrow check to Stonewal and the writing of the two letters of explanation, Frank Petzold received two checks on behalf of Thomas Waldron, totaling $13,000. However, neither check was written on a Stone-wal account and neither was deposited into the Petzold Realty escrow account. Rather, one check was made payable to Frank Petzold from the Diamond C. Enterprises, Inc., account in the amount of $8,750. That check was deposited to the account of Frank Petzold. The other check was drawn on the account of Village Liquidators, payable to Frank Petzold in the amount of $4,250 and deposited to the account of Frank Petzold. Thus, there was a clear swap of checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">Appellant first testified before the grand jury on September 7, 1984. In describing the Reynolds purchase, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-10\">A1 Reynolds was to buy the lot for $65,000 if he got his own financing. That would be a discounted price, because it was my understanding that the lots were being offered for $70-5 thousand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-12\">If he paid, you know \u2014 used his own financing, whether it was borrowing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-14\">money or whatever, he would buy the lot for $65,000. That was his purchase price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-17\">At one point, the prosecutor asked, \u201cSir, did it ever come to your attention that in connection with the sales to insiders a number of promissory notes were typed and prepared?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-18\">On October 26, appellant appeared a second time. His testimony at the second appearance is the basis of the perjury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-19\">During his second appearance before the grand jury, appellant reaffirmed the truthfulness of the answers given during his September 7 appearance. The following is an excerpt of relevant testimony:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-20\">Q. In any event, I take it then you haven\u2019t discussed with Mr. Reynolds executing a $13,000 promissory note or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-21\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-22\">Q. And you\u2019re clear in your own mind that the $13,000 check on or about June 8th, that you gave back to Sto-newal, was not in payment of any promissory note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-23\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-24\">Q. Did Mr. Reynolds indicate to you that he had signed a promissory note in connection with the purchase of lot 146?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-25\">A. Never discussed the promissory note with Mr. Reynolds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-26\">Q. But you certainly never indicated to Mr. Waldron at that time that check 131 was in payment of a note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-27\">A. No. Really, I don\u2019t think there was any correspondence on it at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-28\">Q. Ok. But in any event, it was the check, it was, as you understood it, like a rebate, that was a series of checks to reflect a rebate. It was not in payment of any promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-29\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>The specifications of perjury are set out below, with the specific false declarations underlined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-4\">Q. ... Now, you also say here, though, on the top there \u2014 in the lower left legend, \u201cNote paid in full.\u201d Now, what did you mean when you wrote on there \u201cNote paid in full\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-5\">A. ... Now I also wrote under here, \u201cbalance to close number 146 Reynolds.\u201d That was a note for my bookkeeping purposes as to what these funds were being paid out for. This was the notation to me that this was to correct the accounting that I assume was incorrect \u2014 incorrectly done at the time of closing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-7\">Q. I see, I take it then that the check number 131 was in payment of a note, a demand note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-8\">A. No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-9\">Q. Did you ever indicate that check number 131 was in payment of a note, a demand note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-10\">A. No. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-11\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-12\">Q. But you certainly never , indicated to Mr. Waldron at that time that check 131 was in payment of a note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-13\">A. No. Really, I don\u2019t think there was any correspondence on it at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avr-dedup-0\">Q. Did you ever discuss with Mr. Wal-dron any promissory note for $13,-000 in relation to the Reynolds purchase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-14\">A. No._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1576-16\">The basis of the obstruction of justice charge is Petzold\u2019s alleged participation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azx-dedup-0\">... in the creation of false documents and an exchange of checks to create the false and misleading appearance that the purchaser of Lot 146 had received a loan for the amount of the down payment set forth in the purchase price ... and giving false, evasive and misleading testimony before the grand jury about the Reynolds transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1576-18\">The trial court denied appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-19\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-20\">(1) Whether the literal truth defense articulated in <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973), precludes appellant\u2019s perjury conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-21\">(2) Whether there is sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s obstruction of justice conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-23\">I. <em>Bronston v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-24\">Appellant cites <em>Bronston </em>for the proposition that \u201ca witness may not be convicted of perjury for an answer, under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.\u201d He further cites <em>Bronston </em>as stating unequivocally that: \u201cPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate to peijury.\u201d According to appellant, his perjury conviction should be reversed because his answer to each question was literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-25\">A. <em>Question about the Demand Note</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-26\">One of the alleged perjurious statements was appellant\u2019s testimony that he had never \u201cindicate[d] that check number 131 was in payment of a note, a demand note.\u201d Appellant argues that neither the June 3rd nor the June 8th letter to Tom Waldron makes specific reference to check number 131. He further argues that the check itself indicated \u201cNote pd. in full,\u201d rather than <em>\u201cdemand </em>note paid in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-27\">In response, the government argues that although the check refers to a \u201cnote\u201d rather than a \u201cdemand note,\u201d the \u201cnote\u201d to which it refers is that which is identified in the previous letter of June 3, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>reference is to a \u201cdemand note.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the government argues that \u201cthe term \u2018check 131\u2019 is not material to the substance of the question and its use as a shorthand reference does not give rise to the literal truth defense as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">As to the first part of the argument, the statement above shows that in the June 3 letter signed by Petzold, addressed to Tom Waldron, Petzold stated: \u201cPlease execute the note, satisfied, on Lot # 146 and <em>I will deliver to you the funds in my escrow account to cover this payment in full.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Then, in the June 8 letter, Petzold wrote: \u201cI left your secretary, my escrow check in the @ of $13,000 to close out Mr. Reynolds\u2019 purchase of the Lot # 146 Stonewal.\u201d The check enclosed was check no. 131 as to which Petzold, when testifying before the grand jury, stated that he never \u201cindicate[d] that check no. 131 was in the payment of note, a demand note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">It is true that the number of the check was not mentioned in either letter to Wal-dron, but the note which was enclosed in the second letter from Petzold to Waldron clearly \u201cindicated\u201d that the enclosed check was in payment of the note. Thus, it is clear that his testimony that he did not indicate this fact, was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">B. <em>Discussion with Waldron Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"avd-dedup-0\">One specification of perjury is based on this question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-8\">Q. Did you ever discuss with Mr. Wal-dron any promissory note for $13,-000 with relation to the Reynolds purchase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-10\">The heart of appellant\u2019s claim is that the question referred to a \u201cpromissory\u201d note, not a \u201cdemand\u201d note, and thus since Pet-zold and Waldron discussed a \u201cdemand\u201d note, Petzold\u2019s answer, \u201cno,\u201d to the question whether he discussed a \u201cpromissory\u201d note was literally true. It could not, therefore, constitute perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-12\">He also contends that there is no evidence of any \u201cdiscussion\u201d between him and Waldron with relation to the Reynolds purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-13\">The argument that the face of the check carried the notation \u201cnote paid in full\u201d rather than \u201cdemand note paid in full\u201d and that this prevents the answer from being false, is specious in the extreme. Not only did Petzold use the terms \u201cnote\u201d and \u201cdemand note\u201d interchangeably (probably because there were, in fact, no such notes in existence), the words \u201cnote paid in full\u201d clearly covered the \u201cdemand\u201d note, which appellant itself called a \u201cnote\u201d by his entry on the check he delivered to Waldron. The same answer must be given to appellant\u2019s criticism as to the use by the prosecutor in his question of the term \u201cpromissory note\u201d instead of \u201cdemand note.\u201d The term \u201cpromissory note\u201d is all inclusive, incorporating a demand note as well as any other type of promissory note. No one argues here that whatever note they were talking about would not be the ordinary promise of a borrower to pay a lender. That would constitute a promissory note even if it was also due on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-14\">With respect to the appellant\u2019s argument that there is no evidence of a \u201cdiscussion\u201d between Petzold and Waldron with relation to Reynolds\u2019 purchase, the government points to the correspondence between Pet-zold and Waldron as being sufficient from which the jury could infer that this correspondence and the delivery of the check by Petzold to Waldron could not have been carried out without some discussion between the two persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-15\">In the first of these letters, Petzold stated to Waldron: \u201cI am in receipt of Mr. Reynolds $13,000 to cover your <em>demand note\u201d </em>and \u201cPlease execute the note, satisfied, on lot 146 and I will deliver to you the funds in my escrow account to cover this payment in full.\u201d Then, five days later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>Petzold wrote another letter to Waldron stating: \u201cJust for your records, I left your secretary my escrow check in the amount of $13,000 to close out Mr. Reynolds purchase of lot # 146 Stonewal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">Although the government does not contend that these two letters, in and of themselves, amount to a \u201cdiscussion,\u201d which we consider it might well have argued, the prosecution contends that there can be no doubt that the jury could infer from these two letters and the actual check, which bore on its face the notation \u201cnote paid in full\u201d that during and/or before these acts by the parties there must have been some discussion between Petzold and Waldron concerning a promissory note for $13,000 with relation to the Reynolds purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">We agree. Since the standard by which we review the sufficiency of the evidence is that the evidence must be viewed, together with the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir., Unit B, 1982), the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find Petzold\u2019s statement was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-6\">We are satisfied that the evidence as to the course of conduct between the parties, including the correspondence between Pet-zold and Waldron, was sufficient to permit the jury to infer that Petzold had, in fact, discussed with Waldron something concerning a promissory note. The whole scheme set up, and discussed by the two persons in the correspondence involved the fictitious creation of promissory notes. A jury could reject the idea that' Petzold would create documents to be placed in the file of Wal-dron\u2019s company that would falsely represent the situation without some discussion with Waldron, especially when Waldron responded in the manner that the jury could find was agreed upon when he had his companies disburse checks to Petzold that corresponded to the penny with the check given him out of Petzold\u2019s escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-7\">C. <em>Another specification of perjury arises from the following question and answer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1578-8\">Question, what did you mean by \u201cNote Paid in full? In response to this question, appellant answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-9\">And I also wrote under here, \u201cBalance to close number 146 Reynolds.\u201d <em>That was a note for my bookkeeping purposes as to what the funds were being paid out for. This was the notation to me that this was to correct the accounting that I assume was incorrect </em>\u2014 incor<em>rectly done at the closing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1578-10\">Appellant argues that the underlined statements were literally and syntactically not responding to the prosecutor\u2019s question, but were an elaboration on the \u201cBalance to close number 146 Reynolds\u201d notation. According to appellant, he never responded to the prosecutor\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-11\">The response was ambiguous in the sense that it is impossible to tell whether, when the witness used the word \u201cnote,\u201d he referred to the word \u201cnote\u201d used in the prosecutor\u2019s question or to the notation he had written on the face of the check. Therefore, if his answer to the question had been true as to what was meant by the note he wrote on the face of the check, he might arguably defend his response as not being perjurious. However, and this is what decides .the case against him, the statement he made as to the notation to the effect that: \u201cThis was to correct the accounting that I assume was incorrect \u2014 incorrectly done at the closing\u201d is clearly false because it is undisputed that no such incorrect accounting had taken place at the closing, and his statement that this notation was to correct the records of the closing is clearly false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-12\">Accordingly, we conclude that since <em>Bronston </em>prohibited only the finding of guilt in a perjury trial if the answer of the alleged perjurer is literally true, it is of no aid to appellant here, because none of these statements was literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>II. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Obstruction of Justice Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1579-4\">The obstruction of justice count (Count One) was premised upon the allegation that Petzold participated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-5\">... in the creation of false documents and on exchange of checks to create the false and misleading impression that the purchaser of Lot 146 had received a loan for the amount of the down payment set forth in the purchase agreement submitted to Sunrise Savings and Loan Association of Florida, and by giving false, evasive and misleading testimony before the aforesaid Grand Jury on September 7, 1984, and on October 26, 1984, to conceal, cover up and withhold from the Grand Jury his knowledge that the above mentioned eschange [sic] of checks was a sham transaction designed by FRANK P. PETZOLD, JR. and others to trick federal criminal investigators into believing that the documents submitted to Sunrise Savings and Loan Association were accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-6\">We agree that specific intent to impede a grand jury investigation is an essential element of a \u00a7 1503 violation, <em>United States v. McComb, </em>744 F.2d 555 (7th Cir. 1984). It is also true, however, that intent may be inferred by a jury from all the surrounding facts and circumstances, <em>United States v. Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 81, 115\u2014 16 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 933, 97 S.Ct. 2641, 53 L.Ed.2d 250 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\">We are satisfied that the jury here could infer from the creation of the paper trail made up of fictitious transactions by Pet-zold, who was aware of the fact that the grand jury was investigating similar transactions of Waldron, that his acts were done for the very purpose of impeding the grand jury investigation. It is undisputed that the letters and check would create the false impression that Lot # 246 was sold to Reynolds for $75,000 when, in fact, it was sold for $62,000. It is also undisputed that this impression was created by the fictitious documents prepared by Petzold. The jury could then, of course, infer that this was done by appellant for the purpose of misleading the grand jury.
