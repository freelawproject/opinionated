Appellant\u2019s complaint sought to prevent the collection of taxes assessed against him. As such, it was proscribed by the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421 (1982). We agree with the district court that this action was not within the exception noted in <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., </em>370 U.S. 1, 6-7, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 1128-29, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). Moreover, appellant\u2019s action, to the extent he sought return of his property, was not properly before the district court because he did not allege he had filed a claim for refund or credit with the Internal Revenue Service. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a) (1982). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-17\">On appeal, the government asks that sanctions be imposed against appellant for filing a frivolous appeal. Where an appellant\u2019s contentions are stale and have long been settled, sanctions may be imposed, including double costs and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See e.g., Waters v. Commissioner, </em>764 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1985) <em>Biermann v. Commissioner, </em>769 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir.1985). Appellant asserts various tax protester type arguments: (1) the Internal Revenue Service has no jurisdiction over him; (2) his wages are not \u201cincome;\u201d and (3) he is not a person subject to tax. These arguments are patently frivolous and have been rejected by our court numerous times. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to award double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. We remand to the district court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to the government for the cost of defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-18\">AFFIRMED, (double costs assessed) and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
