The Secretary claims that the district court erred in computing the amount of attorney\u2019s fees by failing to apply the SSI windfall offset provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-25\">On March 28, 1980, William Detson filed claims for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>and for SSI benefits pursuant to Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>The Secretary denied those claims, finding that Detson was not disabled. Detson sought review before the district court and on September 20, 1983, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the court found that Detson was disabled, thereby reversing the Secretary\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Detson was awarded disability benefits beginning in April, 1980 and SSI benefits from April, 1980 through February, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On September 23, 1984, the Secretary notified Detson by letter that his gross retroactive benefits had to be reduced by $14,171.50. Pursuant to the SSI windfall offset provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Secretary could reduce retroactively payable disability benefits by the amount of SSI benefits which had been paid to the claimant but which the claimant would not have received if the Title II disability benefits had been paid when they were due rather than retroactively. The Secretary also informed Detson that 25 percent of his net past-due benefits, or $166.17, was being withheld to cover an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The Secretary cited section 206(a) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a), as authorizing the withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Based on the information provided in the Secretary\u2019s letter, Detson\u2019s counsel believed Detson\u2019s gross retroactive benefits totaled $14,942.80.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Detson\u2019s counsel requested 25 percent of that amount, $3,735.70, in a petition for award of attorney\u2019s fees filed with the district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On January 28, 1985, the district court awarded to Detson\u2019s counsel the requested fee of $3,735.70. The court stated that the fee was \u201cthe maximum amount allowable as it is twenty-five percent (25%) of the total past-due benefits payable to the claimant.\u201d The Secretary filed its timely appeal from that decision on March 28, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">On June 7, 1985, the Secretary filed a motion with the district court for an indicative ruling and for relief from the court\u2019s judgment. The Secretary asserted that the attorney\u2019s fee should have been based on Detson\u2019s net past-due benefits and argued that the district court had relied upon <em>Burnett v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>563 F.Supp. 789 (W.D.Ark.1983), which was subsequently reversed, <em>Burnett v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 621 (8th Cir.1985). The court denied the motion on July 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>1985, on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court also was of the opinion that an indicative ruling was unwarranted. The court recognized that the Eighth Circuit had adopted the Secretary\u2019s approach, but also observed that there was support within this Circuit for the district court\u2019s holding, namely <em>Carlisi v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>583 F.Supp. 135 (E.D.Mich.1984). The decision whether or not to deviate from <em>Carlisi, </em>the district court concluded, could only be made by this Circuit in the appeal from the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Before we address the merits of the Secretary\u2019s claim, we note that the Secretary has discovered an error was made in calculating Detson\u2019s past-due benefits. The Secretary calculated those benefits on the assumption that all of the SSI benefits owed to Detson were paid to him. However, due to an administrative error, the Secretary did not pay the full amount of SSI retroactive benefits. Accordingly, the windfall offset deduction of $14,171.50 was too high; the Secretary should have only deducted a windfall offset of $7,235.90. As a \u25a0result of this error, the Secretary has recalculated the attorney\u2019s fees withholding amount to be $1,483.97, which is 25 percent of the past-due benefits reduced by the adjusted SSI windfall offset. In accordance with the above recalculations, the Secretary urges this court to find that an attorney\u2019s fee of $1,483.97 is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The Secretary argues that the district court did not comply with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) and the regulation defining \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d in awarding the attorney's fee in this case. Pursuant to \u00a7 406(b)(1), a court may award attorney\u2019s fees. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under the sub-chapter [referring to Subchapter II] who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and award as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, <em>not in excess of twenty-five percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled </em>by reason of such judgment, and the Secretary may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(i) of this title, certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) (emphasis added). A regulation promulgated by the Secretary defines \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d as \u201cthe total amount of <em>benefits payable </em>under Title II of the Act to all beneficiaries that has accumulated because of a favorable administrative or judicial determination or decision, up to but not including the month the determination or decision is made.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1703 (emphasis added). The Secretary observes that the disability benefits \u201cpayable\u201d to a claimant are the net benefits derived after deduction of the windfall offset amount pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6. The Secretary asserts that the amount of past-due benefits used for calculating the 25 percent withholding amount under \u00a7 406(b)(1) should be the same net amount of disability benefits payable to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">As further support, the Secretary refers to the Preamble to the regulations implementing \u00a7 1320a-6, the SSI windfall offset provision. The Preamble states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">As for attorney\u2019s fees, the amount of retroactive benefits that is subject to withholding for payment of an attorney\u2019s fee is the total amount of retroactive Social Security benefits <em>payable </em>to the beneficiary (see [20 C.F.R.] \u00a7 404.1703). The amount payable is the amount of retroactive benefits less the amount of any deductions, reductions, or over-payments applicable to the retroactive period. Thus, the amount of retroactive benefits <em>payable </em>for purposes of withholding an attorney\u2019s fee is the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>of retroactive Social Security benefits reduced by the amount of any SSI payments received in the retroactive period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyW\">Preamble, 47 Fed.Reg. 4985, 4986 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the Secretary clearly has consistently maintained the view that only the net amount of past-due disability benefits, the total retroactive benefits reduced by the SSI windfall offset, are subject to the withholding provision of \u00a7 406(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In analyzing this case, we first note that the Secretary\u2019s implementation of \u00a7 406(b)(1) and interpretation of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d is accorded great deference. \u201cBecause Congress has entrusted the primary responsibility of interpreting a statutory term to the Secretary rather than to the courts, [the Secretary\u2019s] definition is entitled to \u2018 \u201clegislative effect.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Herweg v. Ray, </em>455 U.S. 265, 275, 102 S.Ct. 1059, 1066, 71 L.Ed.2d 137 (1982), citing <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 44, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2640, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981); <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 426, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2406, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). Our review of the Secretary\u2019s regulation defining \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d is thus limited to determining whether it \u201cexceeded the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and whether [it is] arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Campbell; </em>461 U.S. 458, 466, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1957, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983). We conclude that the Secretary\u2019s definition of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d as the net amount of disability benefits, or the amount <em>payable </em>to the claimant, is not arbitrary and capricious and does not exceed the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Having upheld the Secretary\u2019s regulation, we turn to the Secretary\u2019s contention based on that regulation that the amount of Title II past-due benefits subject to the withholding provision of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) must be reduced by the SSI windfall offset, even in a case where Title II and SSI benefits are concurrently adjudicated and the SSI benefits are paid retroactively. We believe this is the correct approach and therefore conclude that the district court erred in awarding Detson\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee based on the gross amount of past-due benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we find the analysis and holding of <em>Burnett v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 621 (8th Cir.1985), to be persuasive. <em>Burnett </em>involved the same issue presented in the instant case. In <em>Burnett, </em>the district court held that in actions seeking Title II disability benefits and SSI benefits concurrently, the attorney\u2019s fee withholding amount should be based on the gross amount of past-due benefits. <em>Burnett v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>563 F.Supp. 789, 793 (W.D.Ark. 1983). A primary basis for the court\u2019s holding was its belief that basing the withholding amount on net past-due benefits would operate as a disincentive for lawyers to represent claimants, since that method of calculation would reduce attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 793. Such a result, the court determined, was not intended by Congress when it enacted \u00a7 1320a-6. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">On appeal, faced with the same arguments raised in the instant case, the Eighth Circuit reversed. The court deferred to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d as set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1703. <em>Burnett, </em>756 F.2d at 625. The court also observed that the question whether past-due benefits had to be reduced by the windfall offset before calculating the withholding amount had been addressed by the Secretary in the Preamble to the regulations implementing \u00a7 1320a-6. <em>Id. </em>at 626-27. Consistent with the Secretary\u2019s view, the court held that \u201cthe amount of retroactive benefits payable for purposes of a court award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 404(b)(1) is the amount of retroactive disability benefits reduced by the SSI windfall offset or the net amount of disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The court recognized that this method of calculating the withholding amount would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>necessarily reduce attorney\u2019s fees, thereby constituting a financial disincentive to representing disability claimants. The court was unpersuaded that the financial disincentive mandated a contrary result, however. The court observed that \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s approach ... does produce a public benefit because it preserves a greater portion of the benefits for the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. The court also found that the Secretary\u2019s approach\" does not disrupt the primary financial incentive of \u00a7 406. The court concluded that the primary financial incentive provided by \u00a7 406 is not the <em>amount </em>of attorney\u2019s fees but is the <em>direct payment </em>of fees. Pursuant to \u00a7 406, the Secretary must pay the withheld attorney\u2019s fees directly to the attorney, thereby avoiding problems of collection from the claimant. The court correctly stated that this financial incentive is unaffected by the Secretary\u2019s method of calculating the withholding amount. <em>Id. </em>at 626. Also, the court stated that \u201ccomputation of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of the net amount of benefits is consistent with the Congressional goal of insuring that disability benefits are not consumed by attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, citing <em>Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 830, 91 S.Ct. 60, 27 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The Fourth Circuit, apparently the only other court of appeals which has addressed this issue, reached a result consistent with <em>Burnett. </em>In <em>Cuthbert v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>784 F.2d 1157 (4th Cir.1985), the court also approved the Secretary\u2019s approach to calculation of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406. In <em>Cuthbert, </em>the Secretary certified payment, pursuant to \u00a7 406(a), of 25 percent of the net past-due benefits as attorney\u2019s fees. The claimant\u2019s attorney subsequently brought an action against the Secretary, claiming that the fee should have been based on the gross amount of past-due benefits, unreduced by the SSI windfall-offset. The district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. In affirming the district court, the Fourth Circuit noted that the Secretary is required pursuant to \u00a7 406(a) to withhold up to 25 percent of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d for attorney\u2019s fees and that the Secretary had promulgated a regulation defining \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d as \u201cthe total amount of benefits payable under Title II.\u201d The court found that \u201c[t]his is a sensible reading of the statute, since the direct payment to the lawyer is to be made out of funds otherwise payable to the client.\u201d Thus, even though <em>Cuthbert </em>involved \u00a7 406(a) rather than \u00a7 406(b), it is consistent with both the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Burnett </em>and with our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We note that several district courts, including one within this Circuit, have adopted the approach taken by the district court below in the instant case. <em>See Carli-si v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>583 F.Supp. 135, 138 (E.D.Mich. 1984); <em>Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>607 F.Supp. 646, 649 (D.N.J.1985); <em>Motley v. Heckler, </em>605 F.Supp. 88, 93 (W.D.Va.1985); <em>McKenzie v. Heckler, </em>602 F.Supp. 1150, 1158-59 (D.Minn.1985). We hereby expressly reject the holding of <em>Carlisi. </em>All future calculations of attorney\u2019s fees made by courts within this Circuit pursuant to \u00a7 406(b)(1) shall be made in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s approach. That is, the amount of past-due benefits available for calculation of the attorney's fees withholding amount under \u00a7 406(b)(1) is the total retroactive benefits reduced by the SSI windfall offset: the net amount of past-due benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In approving the Secretary\u2019s approach, we are not unmindful that the fees of attorneys representing disability claimants will be reduced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, dissatisfaction with this result should be addressed by Congress and not the courts. We are limited to determining whether the Secretary\u2019s regulations interpreting and implementing the windfall offset provision and \u00a7 406(b)(1) are either arbitrary and capricious or exceed the Secretary\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>authority. Having found that they are neither, our inquiry is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court awarding attorney\u2019s fees of $3,735.70. We direct the court instead to award a fee in the amount of 25 percent of the net past-due benefits, or $1,483.97.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\">.
