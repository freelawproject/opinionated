WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1513-30\">Defendant Handy and her mother returned from Thailand. Customs officials at an international airport strip searched both women and found heroin in the mother\u2019s underpants. Later body cavity searches of both women recovered 27 rubber recepta-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>c\u00edes containing heroin. Both were convicted on stipulated facts and Handy appeals, challenging her strip search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-5\">In its written denial of the suppression motion, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-6\">(a) [Handy] was returning from Thailand, a known source country for narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-7\">(b) She was exceedingly nervous and trembling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-8\">(c) In her luggage or purse were found a lubricant, dental floss and an anti-laxative. It was known that these materials were commonly used by individuals transporting controlled substances in body cavities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-9\">(d) When asked about the lubricant, dental floss and anti-laxative, she gave a fanciful story that she did not know how those items got into her purse, that she had dropped her purse, and when she picked it up, those items were in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-10\">(e) Her posture and gait were not normal. She shuffled as she walked and was not able to move freely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-11\">(f) Her nose was running, she was sniffling and she had difficulty finding her passport in her purse. She had trouble finishing her sentences and in making sense out of what she was saying. All of these indicated that she may have been at the time under the influence of some kind of narcotic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-12\">(g) When a patdown search was conducted of her, a washcloth was observed in her panties. She stated that her period had started. Her use of a washcloth was suspicious, however, because tampons had been found in her purse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1514-13\">District Court Order of December 17, 1984 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-14\">Handy was sentenced to two concurrent 18-month terms in prison, a five-year period of probation and a special parole term. After sentencing, the district judge denied Handy\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal. Handy renewed her motion before this court. A motions panel reversed and ordered release on bail. <em>United States v. Handy, </em>761 F.2d 1279 (9th Cir.1985) (Far-ris, J., dissenting). The court reasoned that \u201cthe appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact ... likely to result in reversal or an order for new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-16\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-17\">The standard for reviewing the district court\u2019s determination that the search at issue was a valid border search is de novo. <em>See United States v. Cardona, </em>769 F.2d 625, 628 (9th Cir.1985). The standard for reviewing the court\u2019s findings of fact is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1200 n. 5 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-20\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-21\">Handy argues the government failed to show it had the necessary indicia that Handy was carrying contraband when its agents strip searched her. She asks that the evidence from the strip search, and from the body cavity search that followed, be suppressed. Although in her brief Handy appears to take issue with the court\u2019s factual findings, the record supports them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-22\">For a strip search at a border checkpoint, customs officials must have a \u201creal suspicion.\u201d <em>United States v. Aman, </em>624 F.2d 911, 912 (9th Cir.1980) (citing cases). \u201cReal suspicion\u201d was defined in <em>United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, </em>421 F.2d 876, 879 (9th Cir.1970), to be a \u201csubjective suspicion supported by objective, articulable facts that would reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs official to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border is concealing something on his body for the purpose of transporting it into the United States contrary to law.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>592 F.2d 553, 556 (9th Cir.1979) (discussing the three standards for different border searches\u2014 no suspicion for questioning and luggage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>searches; real suspicion for strip searches; clear indication for body cavity searches).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-4\">When evaluating a border search, we must view as a whole all factors that would be considered by an experienced and prudent customs inspector. <em>Rodriguez, </em>592 F.2d at 556 (citing <em>United States v. Mastberg, </em>503 F.2d 465, 469 (9th Cir.1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-5\">We reviewed several body cavity search cases in <em>United States v. Mendez-Jiminez, </em>709 F.2d 1300, 1303 (9th Cir.1983). While we cautioned \u201cthat the validity of a search is not controlled by comparison with ... other cases,\u201d we recognized that comparisons are helpful. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mastberg). </em>Comparing the facts here with those in the body cavity cases, we are persuaded that the government met not only the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d test, but also the higher \u201cclear indication\u201d test at issue in those cases. <em>See Mendez-Jiminez, </em>709 F.2d at 1303 (describing <em>inter alia United States v. Shreve, </em>697 F.2d 873 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Purvis, </em>632 F.2d 94 (9th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Erwin, </em>625 F.2d 838 (9th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Aman, </em>624 F.2d 911 (9th Cir.1980). <em>Cf. United States v. Quintero-Castro, </em>705 F.2d 1099, 1100 (9th Cir.1983) (facts that are insufficient to support an order authorizing body cavity searches).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-7\">The objective, articulable facts upon which the customs officials relied here are such that they would have led an experienced and prudent customs official to suspect Handy was concealing contraband on or in her body. The district court did not err in finding that the strip search was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-8\">Nor did the district court err in denying release on bail pending appeal. No substantial question of law or fact has been raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-9\">AFFIRMED. The mandate will issue now. No petition for rehearing will be entertained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
