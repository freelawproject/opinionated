For the reasons that follow, we conclude that \u00a7 2305(d)\u2019s broad grant of equitable discretion permits consideration of marital fault in the homestead distribution, and hence that the court\u2019s ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-17\">On August 31, 1982, Bernadette Charles (\u201cBernadette\u201d) instituted divorce proceedings against her husband, Albert Charles (\u201cAlbert\u201d) in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and St. John. In addition to seeking a divorce decree, Bernadette\u2019s complaint also requested disposition of all property acquired by the parties during the marriage, including the marital homestead<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> located at 37-29 Estate Pearl, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, with equity valued at $93,000; real estate located at 22-10 Estate Mandahl, St. Thomas, with equity valued at $6,000; a Wellcraft Suncruiser boat, with equity valued at $4,000; a $13,000 certificate of deposit and a $675 savings account, both in Albert\u2019s name; a $4,198.20 savings account in Bernadette\u2019s name; and other personal property of the parties worth $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-18\">On July 7, 1983, Judge Feuerzeig of the Territorial Court filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law granting the divorce and distributing the marital property. Judge Feuerzeig found that during their years of marriage, Albert repeatedly abused Bernadette verbally and physically, was continuously involved in extra-marital affairs, and failed to contribute to household expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also found that during the marriage, Bernadette earned two dollars for every one dollar earned by Albert. Judge Feuerzeig concluded that the \u201cequities of the parties\u201d necessitated a 66 %% share to Bernadette, and a 33 Vs% share to Albert. Accordingly, Judge Feuerzeig issued a second decree on September 1,1983, awarding Bernadette the marital homestead at Estate Pearl and awarding Albert all of the remaining property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Feuerzeig directed Albert to vacate the marital homestead on August 31, 1983, and deliver the keys to Bernadette or her attorney, Edith Bornn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Albert appealed from the second decree. He noted that Judge Feuerzeig had said that, regardless of their relative economic contributions to the marriage, he would ordinarily have given Albert one-half of Estate Pearl because the house had been bought primarily with proceeds of the sale of property owned by Albert prior to the marriage. Judge Feuerzeig refused to apportion Estate Pearl in this way, however, because he found that the breakdown of the marriage was due solely to Albert\u2019s misconduct. In effect, to punish Albert\u2019s misconduct, Judge Feuerzeig awarded the entire marital homestead to Bernadette.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Albert contended that consideration of marital fault in the distribution of the homestead was proscribed both by the Virgin Islands divorce code and the marital homestead distribution statute, V.I.Code Ann. \u00a7 2305(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">The District Court of the Virgin Islands affirmed Judge Feuerzeig\u2019s decision. Chief Judge Christian stated that, contrary to Albert\u2019s contention, neither the divorce code nor V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 2305(d) proscribe consideration of marital fault in the distribution of the marital homestead in an appropriate case, and indeed that \u00a7 2305(d) explicitly permitted such consideration. The district court further held that Judge Feuerzeig had not abused his discretion in his evaluation of marital fault. The district court therefore affirmed Judge Feuerzeig\u2019s decree. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">Two issues are raised on appeal. First, we must consider whether the direction in V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 2305(d) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>divide the marital homestead in accordance with the \u201cequity of the case\u201d is no longer effective since the 1973 amendment of the Virgin Islands divorce statute, V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16 \u00a7\u00a7 104,109, to exclude fault as a ground for divorce and as a factor in influencing decisions pertaining to alimony, support and certain other related matters. Assuming that \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 109 do not override \u00a7 2305(d), the second issue is whether \u00a7 2305(d)\u2019s \u201cequity of the case\u201d criterion permits consideration of marital fault in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">A brief historical survey of the relevant Virgin Islands law relating to divorce and marital property distribution is instructive. In 1973, the Virgin Islands legislature amended \u00a7 104 of the divorce statute to eliminate fault as a ground for divorce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time, the legislature amended \u00a7 109 of the divorce statute specifically to exclude consideration of marital fault in decisions pertaining to child custody and support, alimony, the possession or control of personal property of the other party, and the wife\u2019s decision to change her name. Section 109 now directs the divorce court to consider the \u201cneeds and welfare\u201d of the children with regard to custody and child support, and the \u201cneed\u201d of a party for support and maintenance with regard to alimony, irrespective of marital fault.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Quite significantly for present purposes, the legislature did not enact, as have most other jurisdictions, <em>see infra </em>at Part IV, a comprehensive legislative scheme covering all of the spouses\u2019 marital property, real and personal. Instead, the legislature left intact its Homestead Distribution Statute (contained, not in the Divorce Code, but in Chapter 81 of the Virgin Islands Code, dealing with taxation and finance. V.I. Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4001 (1967 &amp; Supp. 1985)) which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-8\">The homestead protection and exemption provided in this section shall continue to attach to the property after the death of the owner thereof, and shall inure to the favor of the surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>spouse while the latter continues to occupy the said homestead, and after the death of both spouses, to the favor of their children until the youngest surviving of these shall have attained majority. In case either spouse shall abandon the home, the homestead protection and exemption shall continue in favor of the spouse who occupies the property as a dwelling; and <em>in the case of a divorce, the court which grants it shall make disposition of the homestead in accordance with the equity of the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 2305(d) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Albert argues that the legislature\u2019s 1973 decision to amend the Virgin Islands divorce statute to exclude fault as a ground for divorce and as a factor influencing decisions pertaining to alimony and support, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>at 963, implies a legislative intent to exclude consideration of marital fault from <em>all </em>divorce-related proceedings, including those involving the disposition of the marital homestead. He thus argues that the new Virgin Islands divorce laws have in effect overridden that portion of V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 2305(d), that permits a divorce court to consider the \u201cequity of the case\u201d in the disposition of the marital homestead. In the alternative, Albert argues that even if a court can consider \u201cequity of the case,\u201d that phrase, as used in \u00a7 2305(d), refers to equities in a pure property sense, <em>i.e., </em>the value of the property the spouses contributed to the marriage, rather than to equities in the common-law sense. Once again, Albert\u2019s conclusion is that Judge Feuerzeig erred by considering Albert\u2019s role in the breakup of the marriage in the disposition of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Bernadette counters both of Albert\u2019s arguments. As to the first, she argues that there is no ground for reading the divorce law amendment as a <em>de facto </em>repeal of \u00a7 2305(d). It is well within the power of the Virgin Islands\u2019 legislature to repeal \u00a7 2305(d), she argues, and as it has not done so, this court should not. In response to Albert\u2019s second argument, Bernadette argues that the most natural reading of the phrase \u201cequity of the case\u201d in \u00a7 2305(d) suggests that the Territorial Court may, in its discretion, consider marital misconduct in an appropriate case. Had the legislature intended a narrower compass for decision, she argues, it would have provided for distribution in accordance with the \u201cequities of the parties\u201d or \u201cthe parties\u2019 respective equities in the homestead.\u201d As Albert has offered no evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, Bernadette concludes the most natural reading should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Our review of Virgin Islands case law reveals no prior cases where marital fault was expressly cited as a factor influencing the disposition of a marital homestead under \u00a7 2305(d). Neither, apparently, has the question whether marital fault could be considered in such dispositions heretofore been either raised or addressed, at least not in any published opinion. <em>See, e.g., Dyndul v. Dyndul, </em>541 F.2d 132 (3d Cir.1976). We are, therefore, faced with two questions of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Because neither \u00a7 104 nor \u00a7 109 refers explicitly to \u00a7 2305(d), we look first to the legislative history of the 1973 amendments to the divorce statute to see if we can glean from that history a legislative intent to override \u00a7 2305(d). The legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>of \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 109<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not mention Section 2305(d) and lacks any indicia whatsoever of legislative disapproval of that statute. Rather, the expression of legislative intent reflects other concerns: that a divorce should not be available only at the instance of the injured party and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agp-dedup-0\">the wife ought to be entitled to her personal property in the possession and control of the husband, whether or not she is a party at fault ... [and] that the question of custody ought to be determined on the basis of what is best for the child and what the capability of the parties involved [is] to provide the necessary care and custody of those children regardless of who is at fault.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_d\">Amendments to the divorce statute addressed these concerns through adoption of a standard for awarding child custody and support that is based solely upon the \u201cneeds and welfare\u201d of the children and, a standard for awarding alimony that is based solely upon the \u201cneed\u201d of a party for support and maintenance, regardless of fault. No such limitations were placed upon the divorce court\u2019s separate grant of jurisdiction to distribute the \u201cmarital homestead,\u201d however. There is thus no evidence that the 1973 amendments to the divorce statute override the legislative mandate in \u00a7 2305(d), and we hold that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">Our conclusion is supported by the fact that the Virgin Islands Legislature\u2019s decision to enact a type of \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce statute yet leave its homestead distribution statute separate and intact is not unusual. Indeed, the Virgin Islands\u2019 scheme is quite similar to those of several states. Despite the fact that every American jurisdiction except South Dakota has some form of \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cit is not uncommon to find that it is permissible to utilize fault for purposes of awarding alimony or splitting property when the divorce itself is granted on \u2018no-fault\u2019 grounds.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">Having determined that the 1973 amendments to the Virgin Islands divorce statute do not affect a divorce court\u2019s prerogative to consider the \u201cequities of the case\u201d in dividing the marital homestead, we turn to the second question: whether \u00a7 2305(d)\u2019s \u201cequity of the case\u201d criterion permits consideration of marital fault in an appropriate case, or whether it permits the court to consider only the economic benefit that the spouses contributed to the marriage. We conclude that \u00a7 2305(d) permits the consideration of marital fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">The plain meaning of \u201cequity of the case\u201d is that courts may consider marital fault.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cEquity of the case\u201d is a famil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>iar legal term that has been interpreted as a broad grant of jurisdiction to the courts, and any other interpretation of that phrase in \u00a7 2305(d) would be an unwarranted limitation of the term. This conclusion conforms to our prior observations that the jurisdiction of Virgin Islands divorce courts, while based in statute, is considered equitable in nature, <em>Poe v. Poe, </em>409 F.2d 40, 44 (3d Cir.1969), and that divorce courts may \u201cuse a variety of means to obtain an equitable result [under Section 2305(d)],\u201d <em>Stridiron v. Stridiron, </em>698 F.2d 204, 207 (3d Cir.1983). Although a statute\u2019s plain meaning can be overridden by a showing of clear, contrary legislative intent, <em>Paskel v. Heckler, </em>768 F.2d 540, 543 (3d Cir.1985), there is no such evidence here. There is no legislative history of \u00a7 2305(d). The general legislative history of Chapter 81 (which contains \u00a7 2305(d)) does not mention \u00a7 2305(d) or the term \u201cequity of the case.\u201d Nor does the definitional section, V.I.Code Ann. tit. 1 \u00a7 41 (1967 &amp; Supp.1985) provide guidance. Thus, the plain meaning must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Our conclusion is supported by the fact that other jurisdictions with statutes similar to \u00a7 2305(d) have interpreted them, as have we, to permit consideration of marital misconduct or fault in a distribution of property proceeding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even jurisdictions that lack specific statutory guidelines provide that consideration of marital misconduct in a property division is \u201ca matter for the discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Dowdy v. Dowdy, </em>473 So.2d 1091, 1092-93 (Ala.Civ. App.1985).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The rationale for allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>marital misconduct to be utilized as a factor in the property disposition calculus is that \u201ca spouse whose conduct has contributed substantially to the breakdown of the marriage should not expect to receive a financial kudo for his or her misconduct.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>187 Conn, at 72, 444 A.2d at 236; <em>see generally </em>24 Am.Jur.2d <em>Divorce and Separation, </em>\u00a7 927 (1983). We realize that many jurisdictions, following the same reasoning, refuse to award alimony to a guilty spouse.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, the fact that the Virgin Islands Legislature elected to exclude consideration of marital fault from alimony determinations does not, standing alone, reflect an intent to exclude such a consideration in property distribution proceedings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Virgin Islands is not alone in adopting a statutory scheme that expressly excludes consideration of marital fault in one determination but not in the other.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">We concede that \u201cequity of the case\u201d could also refer to the extent to which the spouses have brought income and property to the marriage. In two cases, <em>Knowles v. Knowles, </em>354 F.Supp. 239 (D.V.I.1973), and <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>337 F.Supp. 475 (D.V.I. 1972) the court did precisely that. Neither case, however, addressed the issue we face here, for neither case involved marital fault. Thus, neither case has precedential value on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">We conclude that a property distribution proceeding under \u00a7 2305(d) is neither dependent upon nor subject to the standards established by V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 109 (Supp.1985), and that the plain meaning of \u00a7 2305(d) confers a broad grant of equitable discretion to divorce courts. <em>See Stridiron, </em>698 F.2d at 207. The Territorial Court\u2019s distribution of the marital property was an intelligent and fair disposition. Therefore, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">. \"[A] homestead shall constitute the abode including land and buildings, owned by, and actually occupied by, a person, or by members of his family free of rental charges.\u201d V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 2305(a) (1967 &amp; Supp.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">. Albert\u2019s abusive behavior continued throughout the marriage. On August 24, 1982, one week before Bernadette filed for divorce, for example, Albert chased her out of the marital homestead and threatened that if she returned \u201che had a gun and was prepared to use it.\" Affidavit of Bernadette Charles 9-26-82, at 1.

Albert did not accede willingly to the decrees. On August 8, 1983, Bernadette went to the marital homestead with Ms. Bornn for the purpose of collecting personal clothing and jewelry, which the Territorial Court\u2019s July 7, 1983 order had also awarded her. Albert went into a rage at Bernadette\u2019s presence and attempted to choke her; the police were called and charges of aggravated assault and battery were filed against him. Police reports filed at the time of the incident indicate that Bernadette had abrasions on her neck and that she was taken to a hospital where she received medical treatment and Darvon. <em>See </em>Affidavit of Bernadette Charles, 8-31-83, and attached exhibits. Albert refused to vacate the marital homestead as directed on August 31, 1983, and, upon Bernadette's motion, Judge Feuerzeig entered a second order on November 17, 1983, directing Albert to vacate those premises. Despite Judge Feuerzeig\u2019s orders, Albert refused to do so. Inasmuch as Albert maintained that he was acting upon the advice of his counsel, Judge Feuerzeig declined Bernadette\u2019s invitations to find Albert in contempt. On June 4, 1985, Judge Feuerzeig entered a third order directing Albert to vacate the marital homestead and deliver a quitclaim deed to the premises to Bernadette. Judge Feuer-zeig\u2019s order provided further that upon Albert's failure to quitclaim the property by July 1, 1985, the Clerk of the Territorial Court would execute such a deed. <em>See </em>Order filed June 11, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1056-17\">. Specifically, the Territorial Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-18\">[i]n view of the contribution for the purchase of the Estate Pearl homestead, which came largely from the proceeds of the sale of the property owned by the defendant [Albert] prior to the marriage of the parties, the court would be inclined to find that the equities in the property would be on a 50-50 basis. The court believes, however, that it also must take into account the fact that the breakdown of the marriage appears to have been due solely to defendant's conduct, which included not only the fathering of a child outside the marriage, but a pattern of constant arguments and fights resulting in the court having to issue an order restraining each party from harrassing or molesting the other.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">. V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7 104 [Supp.1985] as amended, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-10\">A decree granting a legal separation or dissolving a marriage may be entered when the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that there has been a breakdown of the marriage relationship to the extent that the legitimate objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ay6-dedup-0\">Prior to the amendment a divorce could be granted only for one of the following causes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-11\">(1) impotency existing at the time of the marriage and continuing to the commencement of the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-12\">(2) adultery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-13\">(3) conviction for felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-14\">(4) willful desertion for the period of one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-15\">(5) cruel and inhuman treatment calculated to impair health or endanger life;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-16\">(6) insanity of either spouse occurring after marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-17\">(7) habitual gross drunkenness contracted since marriage and continuing for one year prior to the commencement of the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-18\">(8) incompatibility of temperament.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1057-19\">. Prior to 1973, V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7 109 gave preference in child custody to the party not in fault; child support and alimony were recoverable only from the party in fault; and only an innocent wife could recover her personal property and/or change her name. Section 109, as amended, provides in full that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-21\">Whenever a marriage is declared void or dissolved the court may, without regard to any determination that the breakdown of the marriage was the fault of one party or the other, further decree:</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-22\">(1) for the future care and custody of minor children of the marriage as it may deem just and proper, having due regard to the age and sex of such children and giving primary consideration to the needs and welfare of such children;</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-23\">(2) for the recovery from the party not granted care and custody of such children such an amount of money, in gross or in installments, as may be just and proper for such party to contribute toward the nurture and education thereof;</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-24\">(3) for the recovery for a party determined to be in need thereof an amount of money in gross or in installments, as may be necessary for the support and maintenance of such party;</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-25\">(4) for the delivery to the wife of her personal property in the possession or control of the husband at the time of giving the judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-26\">(5) for the appointment of one or more trustees to collect, receive, expand, manage, or invest, in such manner as the court shall direct, any sum of money necessary for the maintenance of the wife or the nurture and education of minor children committed to her; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-27\">(6) to change the name of the wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">. Section 2305(d) deals only with the marital homestead. Since the homestead refers only to the place occupied by the spouses, <em>see supra </em>n. 1, and since there are no other applicable statutes, there is a lacuna in the statutory scheme: there are no provisions for the disposition of non-occupied realty. Had the Territorial Court\u2019s authority to distribute Bernadette and Albert\u2019s real estate located at Estate Mandahl been challenged it would thus have been open to serious question.

Since Bernadette was not living in the marital homestead at the time she filed for divorce, Albert also argues that the court was not authorized to dispose of the homestead to the spouse who had \"abandoned\u201d it. He relies upon V.I. Code Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 2305(d), which provides that \u201d[i]n case either spouse shall abandon the home, the homestead protection shall continue in favor of the spouse who occupies the property as a dwelling.\u201d However, \u00a7 2305(d) provides further that \"in the case of <em>divorce, </em>the court which grants it shall make a disposition of the homestead in accordance with the equity of the case.\u201d (emphasis supplied) In <em>Todman v. Todman, </em>571 F.2d 149 (3d Cir.1978), we recognized that \u201d[a]s to both death and abandonment, [\u00a7 2305(d)] addresses [only] <em>continuation </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>\u2018homestead protection and exemption'; as to divorce, the section specifically empowers the court to <em>dispose </em>of the \u2018homestead'.\u201d (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 152. Thus, it is abundantly clear that in the event of divorce, as opposed to abandonment, the marital homestead is to be disposed of in accordance with the \"equity of the case,\u201d and not according to which spouse remains in the marital dwelling after the divorce is filed, Albert\u2019s other contentions on appeal are frivolous and not worthy of discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>GARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The decision of the Virgin Islands legislature to amend its divorce statute evinces a clear and explicit intention to eliminate marital fault as a factor in the adjudication of divorce cases. <em>See </em>V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7 109 (Supp.1985). The majority\u2019s opinion ignores the purpose and entire thrust of the post-1973 statutory scheme and reads fault back into the law. I therefore dissent from the holding of the majority and would hold instead that the amended legislation be given its full, complete, and clear meaning, and that the present case be remanded for a decision not based in any way on an evaluation of marital fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Until 1973, \u00a7 109 required that, \u201cunless otherwise manifestly improper,\u201d the court give preference to the party not at fault in awarding custody of children and child support, and provided for \u201cthe recovery from the party in fault such an amount of money ... as may be just and proper for such party to contribute to the maintenance of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">In 1973, \u00a7 109 was amended to delete any mention of fault. The Virgin Islands Assembly added the clause, \u201cwithout regard to any determination that the breakdown of the marriage was the fault of one party or the other,\u201d to the general empowering clauses at the head of \u00a7 109, and provided that child custody should be determined \u201cgiving <em>primary consideration </em>to the needs and welfare of the children.\u201d These changes evince a general determination to eliminate any consideration of fault, not only in the granting of the divorce itself, <em>see </em>V.I.Code Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7 104 (Supp.1985), but also in the ensuing disposition of property and in the awarding of child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">However, the language of V.I.Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 2305(d) that referred to disposition of the homestead \u201cin accordance with the equity of the case\u201d was not amended. This section, which is found in the Taxation and Finance section of the Virgin Islands Code and <em>not </em>in the statute addressing domestic relations, does bear tangentially on the issue before us because, among other things, it contains the provision on which the majority has decided this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Section 2305 is the Homestead provision of the Virgin Islands Code. Among other things, it defines homestead property, it provides for exemption of homestead property from real estate tax, it provides for continuation of the homestead exemption after an unmarried person dies, it provides criminal penalties for anyone improperly seeking the benefits of the homestead exemption, and it incidentally provides that \u201cin the case of a divorce, the court which grants it shall make disposition of the homestead in accordance with the equity of the case.\u201d \u00a7 2305(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">The majority\u2019s decision of this appeal is based on two conclusions: 1) that the amendment of \u00a7 109 to eliminate fault in the granting of a divorce, the awarding of alimony and custody, and the disposition of personal property did not operate to overrule \u00a7 2305(d), and 2) that the provision in \u00a7 2305(d) for consideration of the \u201cequity of the case\u201d in the disposition of the marital homestead allows for full consideration of marital fault in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">I concede that amended \u00a7 109 does not make direct reference to the Homestead provision in the tax code. It would have been better had it done so. However, just because the legislature of the Virgin Islands did not comb through the entire Virgin Islands Code when it attempted to replace \u201cfault\u201d with \u201cno fault\u201d in divorce proceedings, is no reason to hold that a statute outside of the domestic relations context permits consideration of fault when the legislature has unequivocally rejected that factor. The majority admits that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>decision has been reported in the Virgin Islands in which fault has been a consideration in the awarding of homestead rights upon divorce. Thus, it cannot be said that a prior practice of considering fault in the division of marital real property has been carried forward even after the 1973 amendments to \u00a7 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">My answer to the question of whether the disposition of homestead property permits consideration of fault is that it does not. First, there has been no historic or traditional interpretation allowing for the consideration of fault in dividing homestead property prior to the amendment of the statute. Second, the amendment of \u00a7 109 forcefully expresses the legislature\u2019s view that fault has no place in the scheme of property division when a divorce takes place \u2014 the primary considerations being the contributions of each party to the homestead and the maintenance or sustenance of spouse and children. Lastly, the very statute itself which speaks in terms of \u201cdispos[ing] of the homestead in accordance with the equity of the case\u201d does not connote that equity includes fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Rather, in my view, \u201cequity of the case\u201d should be read to include only the various <em>non-fault </em>factors generally addressed under modern equitable distribution statutes. These factors include the age, background, and earning abilities of the parties, the duration of the marriage, the standard of living of the parties during the marriage, contributions to the marital estate of each of the parties, present income, employment prospects, and mental and physical health of the parties, the source of income and property acquired during the course of the marriage, gifts between the spouses during the marriage, and debts and liabilities of the parties. These and other factors may properly be addressed in order to effect an equitable distribution of the marital homestead without resort to consideration of marital fault. <em>See Painter v. Painter, </em>65 N.J. 196, 320 A.2d 484 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">This reading of \u201cequity of the case\u201d is consistent with the treatment given to similar language in other states. For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded, in interpreting a statute providing for an \u201cequitable distribution of the property,\u201d that \u201cfault of a marital nature is not an appropriate criterion for consideration in effecting an equitable distribution of marital assets.\u201d <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 N.J. 196, 212, 320 A.2d 484, 492 (1974). In a companion case, <em>Chalmers v. Chalmers, </em>65 N.J. 186, 320 A.2d 478 (1974), the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that \u201cfault may be merely the manifestation of a sick marriage,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he concept of fault is not relevant to [equitable] distribution since all that is being effected is the allocation to each party of what really belongs to him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 320 A.2d at 482-83. The court concluded that \u201cwe are satisfied that the concept of equitable distribution requires that fault be excluded as a consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 320 A.2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">The New Jersey Supreme Court reached this conclusion regarding the consideration of marital fault <em>even though </em>the New Jersey statute provided that fault <em>could </em>be taken into account in awarding alimony. <em>See Painter, </em>65 N.J. at 205, 320 A.2d at 488. Indeed, if fault is to be considered only with regard to some aspects of the divorce proceeding and not others, it seems more reasonable to examine marital fault in connection with the awarding of alimony rather than in the division of property, where the respective contributions of the parties should perhaps be a central concern. That is New Jersey\u2019s approach. <em>See also </em>Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 401(d), 501(b)(14) (Purdon Supp.1985) (marital misconduct considered for alimony, but excluded for property distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">It is true, as the majority notes, that several states do permit consideration of fault in the division of marital property. However, the majority cites to no Virgin Islands authority supporting its position that \u201cequity of the case\u201d includes fault; it cites only to authority of other jurisdictions in different contexts. Indeed, most states permitting consideration of fault have statutes containing so-called \u201ccatch-all\u201d provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>sions permitting a court to consider any other factor deemed \u201cjust and proper.\u201d <em>See Hinton v. Hinton, </em>70 N.C.App. 665, 321 S.E.2d 161, 162 (1984). Even among these \u201ccatch-all\u201d states, there is a split of opinion on whether fault is a proper consideration in the distribution of marital property, and several such states have excluded it. <em>See, e.g., Blickstein v. Blickstein, </em>99 A.D.2d 287, 472 N.Y.S.2d 110 (2d Dept. 1984); <em>Hinton, </em>321 S.E.2d at 163. In the absence of specific statutory authorization for the consideration of marital fault in these other jurisdictions, and even where fault <em>may </em>be considered in the granting of the divorce and the awarding of alimony, I think the better rule is to exclude consideration of fault in the equitable distribution of marital real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In the Virgin Islands, however, we are faced with a much simpler situation. We are remitted to what the Virgin Islands legislature has effected by repealing the old \u00a7 109 and adopting the new \u00a7 109 with but one significant addition: the inclusion in the preamble of the statement that divorce decrees are to be rendered <em>\u201cwithout regard </em>to any determination that the breakdown of the marriage was the fault of one party or the other.\u201d (emphasis added). The Territorial legislature thus has made crystal clear, through its 1973 amendment of \u00a7 109, that it desires to join the modern trend in barring any consideration of marital fault from divorce decisions. In this context, I can see no justification for reading the out-of-context clause of \u00a7 2305(d) \u2014 contained not in the Virgin Islands divorce statute but in the Homestead subsection of the tax law \u2014 to permit such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">I would therefore hold that the district court erred as a matter of law in affirming the judgment of the Territorial Court, and would remand the present case to the district court with instructions to vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">. The Territorial Court stated in its November 17, 1983 order that even if it had erred \u201cby considering the equities,\u201d which I assume to mean by taking marital fault into account, ,it would still have awarded the homestead to the wife on the basis of need. Nevertheless, since it is unclear whether fault was improperly considered in the overall property distribution, and since the territorial court may have exceeded its powers in ordering the wife to quitclaim to the husband her interest in the Estate Mandahl property, <em>see Dyndul v. Dyndul, </em>541 F.2d 132, 134 (3d Cir.1976), I would still vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
