The district court sentenced appellant to a total of twenty years imprisonment with the provision that appellant would be immediately eligible for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">For reversal appellant argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the obstruction of justice counts, counts 1 and 4; (2) Bennett was not a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1512; (3) tape recordings were admitted without foundation evidence; (4) prosecutorial threats intimidated a government witness; (5) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on counts 2 and 4; (6) the district court abused its discretion in denying several defense motions; (7) the district court erred in refusing to give certain instructions to the jury; and (8) the government failed to disclose a substantial, contingent payment to its chief witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-20\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-1\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-21\">In February 1984 a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Iowa was investigating possible criminal violations of federal labor laws, including kickbacks, unlawful investments or loans, and the improper administration of the union health and welfare plan. The target of the grand jury investigation was Teamsters Local 147 and its president Vernon N. Bennett. Appellant owns the International Insurance Agency. Appellant was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury on February 23, 1984, and March 21, 1984. The grand jury asked appellant questions about his selling insurance to Teamsters Local 147, his relationship with Bennett and his role in the administration of the union health and welfare plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-22\">Bennett was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury on March 21, 1984. Bennett appeared before the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>and, upon the advice of his attorney, asserted the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">On May 15, 1984, Randall Cason and Thaddius Greenfield drove to appellant\u2019s office. Cason wanted to borrow $50 from appellant. When they arrived at the office, only Cason went inside the building. A short time later Cason and appellant left the building and got inside appellant\u2019s car. According to the government\u2019s evidence, appellant asked Cason if Cason could find someone who would perform a \u201ccontract\u201d killing. Appellant told Cason that a \u201cunion man\u201d was currently \u201cinvolved\u201d in a federal grand jury and that appellant was afraid that the \u201cunion man\u201d could \u201ccause him a problem.\u201d Appellant told Cason that if Cason knew of anyone who would perform the contract, Cason should have that individual call appellant using the name \u201cJoe White.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Cason rejoined Greenfield and told him what appellant had said. Unknown to Ca-son, Greenfield occasionally worked as an informant for the FBI. Greenfield told Ca-son that he might be able to help appellant with the contract killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">The next day Greenfield told FBI special agent William Barrett Root about appellant\u2019s conversation with Cason. Agent Root advised Greenfield to see if he could determine the identity of the \u201cunion man\u201d and then to report back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">On May 18,1984, at Greenfield\u2019s request, Cason called appellant to let him know that someone would be calling him. Posing as Joe White, Greenfield then called appellant and they arranged to meet at a local discount department store that evening. Greenfield unsuccessfully attempted to contact Agent Root to inform him about the arranged meeting. Later Greenfield and Cason drove to the discount department store. Greenfield parked his car some distance from the store and Cason stayed inside the car. Greenfield walked to the front of the store and met appellant there as arranged. Appellant offered Greenfield $2,000 to kill a man whom appellant identified only as a \u201cbig shot\u201d in the Teamsters who could hurt him in a federal grand jury hearing. Greenfield told appellant that he had come from St. Louis and requested money for expenses. Appellant gave Greenfield $30 and they arranged to meet again the next morning at appellant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">On May 19, before meeting appellant as arranged, Greenfield borrowed a small tape recorder in order to record the meeting. Greenfield then went to appellant\u2019s office. Greenfield and appellant discussed the \u201ccontract\u201d in appellant\u2019s car. Greenfield had concealed the tape recorder in his pocket and switched on the tape recorder as he entered the car. Appellant gave Greenfield an additional $50 for expenses and then told Greenfield that the person to be killed was at that time out of town, but would be returning to attend a niece\u2019s high school graduation, and was generally \u201cavailable\u201d during the morning from 7:00 to 8:30 a.m. Appellant also asked Greenfield if he had a silencer. Greenfield answered that he did and appellant responded that that would be necessary. Appellant also assured Greenfield that his intentions were serious and \u201cfor real.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">On May 21, 1984, Greenfield informed Agent Root of these developments. On May 23, 1984, Greenfield called appellant\u2019s office from the local FBI office. The call was recorded by the FBI. Appellant agreed to meet Greenfield the next morning. On May 24,1984, Greenfield, wearing a concealed recording device, met appellant as arranged. During this conversation appellant denied discussing a contract, asking about a silencer or offering Greenfield $2,000 to kill someone. Appellant instead described their prior conversations as involving a car wash and stated that he could not raise the money to invest in the car wash. Greenfield then asked appellant why he had agreed to meet him in the first place and appellant answered that he had done so out of curiosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">On May 25, 1984, Agent Root advised Bennett about appellant\u2019s recent conduct. Bennett informed Agent Root that he had been out of town during the past week and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>had returned in order to attend his niece\u2019s high school graduation. Bennett also recognized and identified one of the voices on the tape recordings as that of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-4\">Bennett\u2019s wife, Dixie Lee Bennett, worked for appellant in his insurance business. On May 25, 1984, Bennett called his wife at work and told her that someone had threatened his life but did not identify appellant. Mrs. Bennett left the office and met her husband at his attorney\u2019s office. When she returned to work, appellant asked her where she had been. Mrs. Bennett told appellant that someone had threatened her husband and that she had been at his attorney\u2019s office. About an hour later Bennett\u2019s attorney called Mrs. Bennett at work and advised her to go home. As she was leaving, appellant asked her where she was going. Mrs. Bennett told appellant that she had been advised to go home and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Shortly after Mrs. Bennett left appellant\u2019s office, appellant made a call from a pay telephone booth at a neighboring gasoline station. The gasoline station attendant overheard some of the conversation and heard appellant'say \u201cthe feds are on the case now,\u201d \u201cI tell you they are on the case,\u201d \u201che\u2019s being interviewed right now,\u201d and \u201cI tell you, my source says he is being interviewed right now.\u201d After appellant hung up, the attendant called the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">On May 30, 1984, Randall Cason was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Cason contacted appellant and asked him why he had been subpoenaed. Appellant asked Cason what he was going to say when he appeared before the grand jury. Cason indicated that all he could do was say what appellant had told him. Appellant then told Cason that \u201cit was all a joke\u201d and a \u201cscam\u201d and that he had only gone along with the plan to see how far it would go. Appellant also told Cason that if he would do him a favor, appellant would do a favor for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">On June 26, 1984, appellant was indicted by the federal grand jury and charged with two counts of obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 by endeavoring to hire someone to kill Bennett (count 1) and making false and misleading statements to Randall Cason (count 4) and two counts of witness tampering by engaging in misleading conduct toward Randall Ca-son (count 2) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1) and attempting to hire someone to kill Bennett (count 3) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(2)(A). Following a five-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of all four counts on October 5, 1984. Post-trial motions were denied. On November 2, 1984, the district court sentenced appellant to a total of twenty years imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-0\">OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND WITNESS TAMPERING</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">Appellant first argues that he was improperly charged in counts 1 and 4 with obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant argues that be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>cause the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), Pub.L. No. 97-291, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982), expressly deleted all references to witnesses from former \u00a7 1503<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and enacted provisions such as \u00a7 1512<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that specifically provide increased protection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>witnesses, \u00a7 1503 as amended no longer applies to witnesses. Alternatively, appellant argues that Bennett was not a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of either \u00a7 1503 or \u00a7 1512 because Bennett had already appeared before the grand jury and refused to testify and was unlikely to be recalled by the grand jury at the time appellant attempted to hire Greenfield to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Appellant has preserved this argument for appellate review. This argument was raised during trial in the district court and the government responded to defense motions by arguing that appellant had been properly charged under both \u00a7 1503 and \u00a7 1512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument about the relative scope of \u00a7 1503 as amended and \u00a7 1512. Similar arguments have been rejected by other circuit courts of appeal. <em>See United States v.

Wesley, </em>748 F.2d at 963-64 (footnotes omitted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-14\">[bjefore 1982, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 was entitled \u201cInfluencing or injuring officer, juror or witness generally,\u201d and it prohibited influencing or intimidating, \u201cany witness ..., grand or petit juror, or [court] officer\u201d in the discharge of his [or her] duty. The section also contained a residual [or omnibus] clause prohibiting anyone from obstructing or attempting to obstruct the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d In 1982 [in the VWPA], Congress amended \u00a7 1503, and removed all references to witnesses. At the same time, [Congress] also enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512 which focuses solely on the protection of witnesses, informants and crime victims from intimidation. The safeguards afforded by \u00a7 1512 are both more extensive and more detailed than those given by \u00a7 1503. Congress did not, however, remove the residual [or omnibus] clause of \u00a7 1503 in its 1982 [VWPA] amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">\u201cThe newly enacted section, \u00a7 1512, was intended to provide greater protection for witnesses than did \u00a7 1503. The new section protects witnesses against being influenced by intimidation and harassment [and misleading conduct] in addition to corruption, threats, or force to which \u00a7 1503 was limited.\u201d <em>United States v. Beatty, </em>587 F.Supp. at 1331. As further noted in <em>United States v. Lester, </em>749 F.2d at 1292-93 (citations omitted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-16\">Congress may well have intended to remove the protection of witnesses from section 1503. It by no means follows, however, that Congress intended to reduce the effectiveness of section 1503 in combating \u201cmiscarriage[s] of Justice by corrupt methods.\u201d Yet this is precisely the result to which [appellant\u2019s] urged construction would lead. If witness tampering should fall exclusively under section 1512, and if the accused used a method other than one prescribed in section 1512 (intimidation, physical force, threats, harassment, or misleading conduct), that conduct would no longer be prohibited. Neither section 1503 nor section 1512 would cover it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>We agree and hold that witness tampering is punishable under \u00a7 1503. However, the two statutes are not coextensive. For example, \u00a7 1512 is not restricted to witnesses but protects \u201cany person\u201d involved in an official proceeding. By comparison, \u00a7 1503 protects only \u201cwitnesses,\u201d as well as grand and petit jurors and court officers, although witness status has been expansively construed and applied. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chandler, </em>604 F.2d 972, 974 (5th Cir.1979) (rejecting limitation of \u201cwitness\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1503 to only while case is pending in trial court), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>444 U.S. 1104, 100 S.Ct. 1074, 63 L.Ed.2d 317 (1980); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 513 F.2d 456, 460 (1975) (fact that witness was discharged is immaterial to witness status for purposes of \u00a7 1503). In addition, \u00a7 1512 is expressly not limited to \u201cpending\u201d official proceedings, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(d)(1), or by considerations of admissibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1512(d)(2), and thus \u201cexplicitly covers \u2018po tential\u2019 witnesses and those witnesses whose testimony might not be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>730 F.2d at 898. By comparison, \u201c[a] prerequisite to any violation of section 1503 is the existence of a pending judicial proceeding known to the violator. A grand jury investigation is such a proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Vesich, </em>724 F.2d 451, 454 (5th Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Moreover, \u00a7 1512 prohibits only specific types of conduct \u2014 intimidation, physical force, threats, or attempts to do so, misleading conduct, or harassment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a),(b); <em>e.g., United States v. King, </em>762 F.2d at 238; <em>United States v. Lester, </em>749 F.2d at 1293. In particular, \u00a7 1512 prohibits intimidation and harassment, thus \u201cestablishing a lower threshold of criminal activity [than \u00a7 1503].\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>730 F.2d at 898; <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 532 at 15, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2521 (expanded scope of prohibited conduct to include verbal harassment). As noted in <em>United States v. Lester, </em>749 F.2d at 1293-94 (citations and footnote omitted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-5\">[t]he omnibus clause of section 1503, by contrast, is broader. It reaches conduct that \u201ccorruptly ... endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\u201d In decisions prior to the enactment of section 1512, ... the argument that the omnibus provision covers only activities obstructing justice that involve force, threats, or intimidation [was consistently rejected]. [Section 1503] includes noncoercive witness tampering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\"><em>Cf. United States v. King, </em>762 F.2d at 238 (\u00a7 1512 does not apply to nonmisleading, nonthreatening, nonintimidating attempt to have person give false information to the government, but may violate \u00a7 1503 if there was a pending judicial proceeding at the time); <em>United States v. Vesich, </em>724 F.2d at 454 (noncoercive witness tampering falls precisely within \u00a7 1503 when witness prevented from testifying in federal prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">The difference between the scope of \u00a7 1512 and \u00a7 1503 is illustrated in <em>United States v. King, </em>762 F.2d at 236. In <em>King </em>the defendant was charged and convicted of knowingly engaging in misleading conduct toward another person by making false statements in order to hinder and prevent the disclosure to law enforcement agents of the defendant\u2019s participation in counterfeiting. The jury found the defendant guilty of violating \u00a7 1512 and several other counts, but the district court vacated the verdict on the ground that the facts proven did not amount to a violation of \u00a7 1512. The government cross-appealed. The court of appeals affirmed because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMJ9\">the evidence did not indicate that [the defendant] had misled [the witness] in any way. Rather, \u201c[the defendant], simply and flat-out, tried to persuade [the witness] to lie\u201d to mislead the govern-ment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-8\">... [S]ince the evidence failed totally to support any inference that [the witness] was, or even could have been, misled, the conduct proven by the government was not within the terms of \u00a7 1512.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 237 (other citations omitted), <em>citing United States v. King, </em>597 F.Supp. 1228, 1231 (W.D.N.Y.1984). The court of appeals noted that prosecution under \u00a7 1503 was not possible \u201cbecause there was no pending judicial proceeding at the time [the defendant] sought to have [the witness] give false information.\u201d 762 F.2d at 238. <em>Cf. United States v. Lester, </em>749 F.2d at 1295-96 (non-coercive and nonmisleading witness tampering during pending judicial proceeding punishable under \u00a7 1503, but not \u00a7 1512). <em>But cf. United States v. Wesley, </em>748 F.2d at 964 (holding that \u201curging and advising\u201d a witness to testify falsely is prohibited by \u00a7 1512 and \u00a7 1503; unclear from published opinion whether there was intimidation or misleading conduct or whether there was a pending judicial proceeding at the time); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>730 F.2d at 897-99 (holding that threatening a potential witness violates only \u00a7 1512; unclear whether there was a pending judicial proceeding at the time).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">Here, the government proved that appellant attempted to hire Greenfield to kill Bennett, a grand jury witness, and that appellant engaged in misleading conduct toward another grand jury witness, Cason. Both types of conduct fall within the terms of \u00a7 1512 and \u00a7 1503. The government also proved that there was a pending grand jury proceeding known to appellant and that appellant acted with the intent to obstruct the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">We also hold that appellant\u2019s conviction under both \u00a7 1512 and \u00a7 1503 is not multiplicious in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment. <em>See United States v. Wesley, </em>748 F.2d at 963\u201465. Proof of a violation of \u00a7 1503 requires proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of a pending judicial proceeding, which is expressly not an element of a violation of \u00a7 1512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">Appellant alternatively argues that Bennett was not a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512 because Bennett had already appeared before the grand jury and refused to testify and was unlikely to be recalled by the grand jury at the time appellant attempted to hire Greenfield to kill him. As discussed above, witness status is expressly not required under \u00a7 1512, which specifically refers to \u201cpersons\u201d and not \u201cwitnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">. With respect to Bennett\u2019s status as a witness for purposes of \u00a7 1503, appellant\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cwitness\u201d is too narrow. In <em>Odom v. United States, </em>116 F.2d 996, 998 (5th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>313 U.S. 544, 61 S.Ct. 597, 85 L.Ed. 1511 (1941), the court held that a person was considered a witness \u201c[i]f he [or she] knows or is supposed to know material facts, and is expected to testify to them, or be called on to testify.\u201d A person\u2019s status as a witness continues even when judicial proceedings have already occurred as long as there is a possibility that the person would testify or be called upon to testify in the future. For example, in <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>604 F.2d at 975, the court applied a \u201cpragmatic definition of a section 1503 \u2018witness\u2019 in light of the protective purpose of the obstruction of justice statute\u201d and held that a person who had testified at trial remains a witness for purposes of \u00a7 1503 while the direct appeal is pending. Here, the grand jury had not concluded its investigation at the time appellant engaged in conduct prohibited by \u00a7 1503. Even though Bennett had asserted the fifth amendment privilege, he knew or was supposed to know material facts about the matters under investigation by the grand jury and could have been recalled to appear before the grand jury. Under these circumstances, we hold Bennett was a witness for purposes of \u00a7 1503.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">ADMISSIBILITY OF TAPE RECORDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">Appellant next argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the May 19 and May 24 tape recordings into evidence because the government failed to meet the foundational requirements for introducing tape recordings. As discussed above, Greenfield made the May 19 tape recording using a friend\u2019s tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>recorder \u00e1nd without FBI assistance. The FBI made the May 24 tape recording using a body recording device worn by Greenfield. Appellant argues that the government did not establish the capability of the equipment, the competency of the operator (Greenfield) or the accuracy of the tape recording with respect to the May 19 tape recording. <em>See, e.g., United States v. McMillan, </em>508 F.2d 101, 104 (8th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 916, 95 S.Ct. 1577, 43 L.Ed.2d 782 (1975). Appellant specifically argues that there were at least eight gaps in the May 19 tape recording and several unidentified speakers, Greenfield was not competent to operate the tape recorder, and there was no proof that the tape recording had not been tampered with.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">These arguments are without merit. \u201cThe very fact that the tape recording[ ] exist[s] establishes that the recording device was capable of picking up sounds and taking the conversation offered.\u201d <em>United States v. McCowan, </em>706 F.2d 863, 865 (8th Cir.1983) (per curiam), <em>citing United States v. Moss, </em>591 F.2d 428, 433 (8th Cir.1979). In addition, Greenfield testified that he learned how to use the tape recorder on the day he made the May 19 tape recording. \u201cThis fact, and the fact that [Greenfield] successfully made the tape recording[ ], satisfied the competency requirement of the ... <em>McMillan </em>test.\u201d <em>United States v. McCowan, </em>706 F.2d at 865. Greenfield also identified the tape recording as an accurate record of his May 19 conversation with appellant. The government expert testified that he had examined the May 19 tape recording and that in his opinion the tape recording was authentic, original and continuous except for eight brief erasures, which the expert believed were apparently caused after recording by rewinding and playing back the tape recording. The government expert also tentatively identified the unidentified speakers as background noise. Under these circumstances, the government adequately met the foundational requirements for introducing the May 19 tape recording into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">Appellant also argues that the May 24 tape recording was not voluntarily made because Greenfield improperly induced him to talk. The evidence presented by the government, however, indicated that appellant voluntarily entered into the conversation with Greenfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the tape recordings into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A3FF\">PROSECUTORIAL INTIMIDATION OF CASON .</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">Appellant next argues that he was unable to effectively cross-examine Cason, a key government witness, because Cason had been so intimidated by the prosecutor that he was unable to testify truthfully without fear of governmental reprisal. Appellant argues that before Cason appeared before the grand jury and again before trial, the prosecutor intimidated Cason by threatening to prosecute him for perjury. Appellant argues that this prosecutorial misconduct violated due process and deprived him of his sixth amendment right to present witnesses in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">The government argues that appellant\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s statements as \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d is unwarranted. The government admits the prosecutor advised Cason about the dangers and consequences of committing perjury. The government argues, however, that such statements were informative and merely cautionary and not intimidating, coercive or threatening. The government further argues that any error was harmless because the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cadvice\u201d did not in fact prevent Cason from testifying and being cross-examined at appellant's trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">\u201cIt is not improper <em>per se </em>for a ... prosecuting attorney to advise prospective witnesses of the penalties for testifying falsely. But warnings concerning the dangers of perjury cannot be emphasized to the point where they threaten and intimidate the witness into refusing to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>224 U.S.App. D.C. 350, 694 F.2d 1325, 1334 (1982) (citations omitted). The prosecutor\u2019s statements in the present case do not approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>mate the sort of governmental misconduct held unconstitutional in the leading case of <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 353, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (per cu-riam), in which the trial court gratuitously and at great length admonished only the defendant\u2019s single witness not to lie and warned him of the dire consequences of perjury, or in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 478 F.2d 976, 979 (1973), in which the prosecutor threatened to prosecute the prospective witness for <em>past </em>crimes if he took the stand and testified in a pending trial. Rather, the prosecutor\u2019s statements in the present case constituted a constitutionally permissible \u201cmere warning\u201d about the dangers of committing perjury. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blackwell, </em>694 F.2d at 1335; <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>216 U.S.App.D.C. 207, 670 F.2d 365, 371 (1982) (per curiam); <em>cf. United, States v. Harlin, </em>539 F.2d 679, 681 (9th Cir.) (trial judge\u2019s warning), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 942, 97 S.Ct. 362, 50 L.Ed.2d 313 (1976). The prosecutor told Cason about the serious consequences of perjury, including the possibility of prosecution and the range of punishment. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks here were limited to warning Cason about the serious consequences of perjury in the context of Cason\u2019s testimony in this case; the prosecutor did not threaten to prosecute Cason for other crimes or to retaliate against him if he testified truthfully. <em>See United States v. Blackwell, </em>694 F.2d at 1334 (citing cases involving threats of prosecution for other crimes, reindictment on dropped charges, revocation of probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">We note, however, that prosecuting attorneys should exercise considerable restraint when advising potential witnesses about the consequences of committing perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE OF MISLEADING CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">Appellant next argues that there was insufficient evidence that he engaged in misleading conduct by telling Cason that the plan to kill Bennett was a joke and a scam. Appellant argues that he did not engage in misleading conduct toward Ca-son because he actually believed that the conversations with Greenfield and the plan to kill Bennett were only a joke and a scam and that he was only attempting to influence Cason to tell what he believed to be the truth. However, in finding appellant guilty of obstruction of justice by attempting to hire Greenfield to kill Bennett, the jury implicitly found that appellant intended to hire Greenfield to kill Bennett and that the plan was not a joke. Thus, by telling Cason that the plan was only a joke, appellant engaged in misleading conduct toward Cason. <em>Cf. United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>722 F.2d 1175, 1181 (5th Cir.1983) (obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">TRIAL ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">Appellant next argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying several defense motions. In particular, appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for continuances, motions to dismiss for failure to produce exculpatory evidence, and motions for mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct. We have carefully reviewed appellant\u2019s allegations and find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in refusing to give certain instructions to the jury. Appellant argues that the district court improperly refused to give the \u201cusual\u201d witness credibility instruction and gave inadequate instructions on reasonable doubt, the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. We have carefully reviewed as a whole the instructions given by the district court and find no error in the instructions as given. The district court did instruct the jury about witness credibility. This instruction is somewhat cursory but adequate. The reasonable doubt instruction given by the district court is taken from 8th Cir. Model Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 3.11 (1985). The district court did not give separate instructions about the burden of proof or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>presumption of innocence but expressly stated and repeatedly referred to both principles in other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">NONDISCLOSURE OF PAYMENT TO GOVERNMENT WITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Before trial the district court ruled that government records of any payments made to Greenfield were exculpatory evidence and ordered the government to produce any such records. The government disclosed before trial and presented evidence during trial that the FBI had paid Greenfield $500 in connection with his work in the present case and $250 in connection with an earlier drug investigation. Under cross-examination Greenfield and FBI special agent Root denied that Greenfield had been promised any additional substantial payment for his investigative work in the present case. Agent Root testified, however, that the FBI paid \u201con results.\u201d At the sentencing hearing on November 2, 1984, defense counsel informed the district court that he had heard that Greenfield would be paid an additional $5,000 and that Greenfield had told others that he planned to go to Hawaii. To this information the prosecuting attorney responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the basis of [defense counsel\u2019s] information is. I don\u2019t know the internal workings of the FBI. I am not aware of any trips to Hawaii, or secret agreements, or anything of that nature, that [defense counsel] has urged.\u201d The district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for disclosure but directed the government to preserve its payment records so that they would be available for examination if necessary. On December 10, 1984, the prosecuting attorney informed the district court and defense counsel by letter that after the trial the FBI had authorized and paid Greenfield $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">Appellant argues that evidence of a potential financial reward which gave Greenfield, the government\u2019s chief witness, a direct and personal stake in appellant\u2019s conviction could have been used to impeach Greenfield by showing bias or interest and that its suppression denied him due process of law. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380-81, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 104-12, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397-2401, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Appellant argues that the government\u2019s nondisclosure misleadingly induced defense counsel, and ultimately the jury, to believe that Greenfield had received only $500 for his investigative work in the present case. Appellant also argues that Greenfield\u2019s testimony should be stricken because the $5,000 payment was in the nature of a reward or \u201cbounty\u201d made contingent upon appellant\u2019s conviction, citing <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>311 F.2d 441 (5th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">The government argues that the nondisclosure claim should not be considered on appeal because it was not raised in the district court. The government argues that appellant should dismiss the present appeal and file a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence in the district court. Brief for Appellee at 51 n. 11. On the merits the government argues that information about the $5,000 payment was not \u201csuppressed\u201d because the payment was not authorized until after trial and was not paid to Greenfield until after sentencing and, once payment was made, that fact was promptly disclosed to the district court and defense counsel. The government further argues that defense counsel\u2019s characterization of the $5,000 payment as a reward contingent upon appellant\u2019s conviction is speculative and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">Because the controversy about the $5,000 payment arose during sentencing and actual payment was not made until two months after trial, we could not rule upon the merits of appellant\u2019s nondisclosure claim on the basis of the then-existing record. Accordingly, on December 17, 1985, we remanded the case to the district court for the limited purpose of holding an evidentiary hearing and making findings of fact and conclusions of law. We directed the district court to determine (1) whether there was an agreement or understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>of any kind between the FBI and Greenfield about the possibility of a post-trial payment; (2) if such an agreement or understanding existed, its terms and conditions, including whether any payment was contingent upon conviction; and (3) under the new formulation of the materiality test set forth in <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 5. Ct. at 3384, whether there was a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">We appreciate the district court\u2019s thorough treatment and prompt disposition of this matter on remand. The district court conducted extensive discovery proceedings, held an evidentiary hearing and made detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>United States v. Risken, </em>No. 84-44 (S.D.Iowa Feb. 12, 1986) (certified findings and conclusions on remand). The district court found that \u201cno express agreement between Agent Root or anybody else on behalf of the FBI and Greenfield existed in advance of or during the trial concerning a post-trial payment to be made to Greenfield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. However, the district court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-7\"><em>before and during the trial there was an implied understanding between Root, on behalf of the FBI, and Greenfield about the possibility of a post-trial payment to Greenfield. </em>There was no understanding as to the amount of the payment but there was an implied understanding that the making of such payment and the amount thereof might depend on whether [appellant] was convicted. This ultimate fact finding rests on the entire record made at the remand hearing. Among the more compelling evidentiary facts leading to this ultimate fact finding are: Greenfield\u2019s past experience in being paid as an FBI informant; the conversation between Greenfield and Root on May 4 [, 1984,] in which Greenfield was told that there would be compensation for reliable information and that the amount would depend upon the quantity and quality of the information; Greenfield had been paid for his services up to May 29 but he had received nothing for his services as a witness in two pretrial hearings and at the trial and for the extensive time he spent being debriefed by government agents in preparation for the trial, and he had received nothing for his degradation in the eyes of his social peers for becoming an FBI informant; Root\u2019s contemplation during the pretrial hearings and the trial of the possibility of paying Greenfield more after the trial; the FBI\u2019s occasional, if not common, practice of making payments after trial; the FBI\u2019s practice of considering a conviction, along with other factors, in deciding whether to make a payment; and last but not least, Greenfield\u2019s statements to people during the summer and early autumn of 1984 that he was going to receive a large payment or other handsome reward after the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-9 (emphasis added). The district court concluded, however, that there was no reasonable probability that, had the implied understanding been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different because Greenfield\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the tape recordings and \u201c[p]rimarily, it was the tapes that convicted [appellant] on all counts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The district court also concluded that disclosure of the implied understanding in the pretrial hearings would not have changed the ruling on the admissibility of the tape recordings. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The parties then submitted supplemental briefs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">First, the fact that the $5,000 payment was contingent upon appellant\u2019s conviction would not alone require reversal. In <em>Williamson v. United States </em>the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>Circuit refused to sanction \u201ca contingent fee agreement to <em>produce evidence against particular named defendants as to crimes not yet committed.\u201d </em>311 F.2d at 444 (Rives, J.) (emphasis added). Later Fifth Circuit cases limited the <em>Williamson </em>holding to cases involving similar facts, that is, to \u201ccases in which the government directs the informant to implicate government-pretargeted specific defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Yater, </em>756 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 225, 88 L.Ed.2d 226 (1985). It is the government\u2019s pre-selection or pre-targeting of specific persons for implication by the informant that violates due process, not the fact that the informant\u2019s fee is contingent upon conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dailey, </em>759 F.2d 192, 199 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Valle-Ferrer, </em>739 F.2d 545, 546-47 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (fact that key government witness was eligible to receive a monetary award contingent upon defendant\u2019s conviction does not require reversal); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>720 F.2d 1527, 1539-40 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1108, 104 S.Ct. 1614, 80 L.Ed.2d 143 (1984). Appellant does not argue that the government pre-targeted him for conviction or that Greenfield was directed by the government to specifically implicate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">We now turn to the nondisclosure claim. In <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3377, the Supreme Court reviewed the standard of materiality to be applied in determining whether the government\u2019s failure to disclose impeachment evidence warrants reversal of a conviction. In <em>Bagley, </em>evidence of the government\u2019s prior agreements to pay two government witnesses for their cooperation and testimony was not disclosed to the defense. The defendant filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that nondisclosure violated <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>because the agreements could have been used to impeach the government witnesses. The district court found that the government\u2019s failure to disclose was harmless error. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cthe government\u2019s failure to provide requested <em>Brady </em>information to [the defendant] so that he could effectively cross-examine two important government witnesses requires automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Bagley v. Lumpkin, </em>719 F.2d 1462, 1464 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-8\">The Supreme Court reversed. The majority of the Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>requires disclosure only of evidence that is both favorable to the accused and \u2018material either to guilt or punishment' ... and \u2018that implicit in the requirement of materiality is a concern that the suppressed evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3379-80 (Blackmun, J.), <em>citing Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196, <em>and United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 2397. The Court expressly rejected any distinction between exculpatory and impeachment evidence for <em>Brady </em>purposes. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3380-81, <em>citing Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The majority stated that \u201ca constitutional error occurs, and the conviction must be reversed, only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial,\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3381, and reformulated the standard of materiality applicable to nondisclosed evidence, <em>id. </em>at 3381-84. The Court replaced the framework for evaluating the materiality of <em>Brady </em>evidence established in <em>United States v. Agurs </em>with the following test: \u201cevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3384; <em>id. </em>at 3385 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Court further defined \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d as \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3384, <em>citing Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-9\">We have carefully reviewed the record in the present case and conclude, as did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>district court on remand, that under the <em>Bagley </em>standard of materiality there is no reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the $5,000 payment been disclosed to the defense and used by defense counsel to cross-examine Greenfield. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3384; <em>Fryer v. Nix, </em>775 F.2d 979, 983-84 (8th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Ben M. Hogan Co., </em>769 F.2d 1293, 1299 (8th Cir.1985); <em>see also United States v. Pflaumer, </em>774 F.2d 1224, 1230 (3d Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1263, 89 L.Ed.2d 572 (1986); <em>Lindsey v. King, </em>769 F.2d 1034, 1041-43 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>768 F.2d 602, 610 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 861, 88 L.Ed.2d 900 (1986); <em>United States ex rel. Smith v. Fairman, </em>769 F.2d 386, 391-92 (7th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-8\">The government should have disclosed the implied understanding that existed between Greenfield and the FBI about the possibility of a post-trial payment. The defense could have used this information to further impeach Greenfield\u2019s credibility. Nonetheless, Greenfield\u2019s status as a paid government witness and his employment by the FBI as a paid informant had already been brought out before the jury, although the payments which had been disclosed to the defense and to the jury were substantially less than the post-trial payment. More importantly, however, the government\u2019s case did not depend upon Greenfield\u2019s testimony alone. <em>Cf. United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3386-88 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (government\u2019s entire case hinged on testimony of two private security guards who aided government agency in its investigation of defendant; omission of evidence of witnesses\u2019 possible bias cannot be held harmless error); <em>United States v. Pflaumer, </em>774 F.2d at 1230. Greenfield\u2019s testimony was strongly corroborated by the tape recordings of his conversations with appellant. We agree with the district court that the tape recordings constituted the critical incriminating evidence against appellant. At 1366. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the govemment\u2019s failure to disclose the implied understanding between the FBI and Greenfield about the possibility of a post-trial payment is sufficient to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-11\">Our holding that the evidence not disclosed by the government in the present was not material under the <em>United States v. Bagley </em>standard should not be construed as approval of the government\u2019s conduct. The fact remains that the government\u2019s failure to disclose known evidence favorable to the accused is incompatible with <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>even though nondisclosure in a particular case may not warrant reversal under the reformulated standard of materiality set forth in <em>United States v. Bagley. See United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3386-90 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 3398 &amp; n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting) <em>{Brady </em>violation is by definition constitutional error). As stated by Justice Marshall in his dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3389 (citations omitted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-12\">\u201c[t]he purpose of a trial is as much the acquittal of an innocent person as it is the conviction of a guilty one.\u201d When evidence favorable to the defendant is known to exist, disclosure only enhances the quest for truth; it takes no direct toll on that inquiry.
