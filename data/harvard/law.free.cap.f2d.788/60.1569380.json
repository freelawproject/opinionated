After the New Hampshire Supreme Court had rejected his appeals, petitioner filed the instant habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Noting that a person must be \u201cin custody\u201d to invoke the remedy of habeas corpus and concluding that petitioner had not satisfied the custody requirement, <em>see Harts v. Indiana, </em>732 F.2d 95 (9th Cir.1984) (one year suspension of driving license does not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement); <em>Westber-ry v. Keith, </em>434 F.2d 623 (5th Cir.1970) ($250 fine and one year license revocation); <em>see </em>also <em>Tinder v. Paula, </em>725 F.2d 801, 804 (1st Cir.1984) (habeas is not available as a remedy for a fine-only conviction), the district court dismissed the petitions and denied certificates of probable cause. Petitioner now seeks certificates of probable cause from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Petitioner, completely divorcing the case from its facts, reads <em>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 1810, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984), to hold that all persons released on bail or on their own recognizance are in custody for habeas corpus purposes regardless whether or not they face any possibility of incarceration. Petitioner then points to cash register receipts referring to bail he posted pending his state court appeals and contends he has been released on bail and therefore is \u201cin custody.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s state court appeals apparently have all been finally determined adversely to petitioner. But even if, at the time petitioner filed his \u00a7 2254 petitions, he was on \u201cbail\u201d in the sense that execution of his sentences calling for fines and license suspension had been stayed, nothing in <em>Lydon </em>\u2014 a case involving a defendant who, unlike petitioner, was awaiting bail and potentially faced incarceration if convicted \u2014 suggests that the modest fines and temporary suspension to which petitioner is subject render petitioner \u201cin custody\u201d for \u00a7 2254 purposes. Rather, we agree with those courts which have concluded that fines and suspensions of the amount here involved are not the sort of \u201c \u2018severe[ ] restraint on individual liberty\u2019 for which habeas corpus relief is reserved.\u201d <em>Harts v. Indiana, </em>732 F.2d 95, 97 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Westberry v. Keith, </em>434 F.2d 623, 624-25 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">The certificates of probable cause are denied and the appeals are terminated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
