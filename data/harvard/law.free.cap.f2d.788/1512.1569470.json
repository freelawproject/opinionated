We also hold that the Appeals Council\u2019s rejection of an AU\u2019s credibility findings is a relevant factor in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Appeals Council. Thus, the Appeals Council should ordinarily reject the AU\u2019s credibility findings expressly and state the reasons for its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AD2Y\">A. <em>Hand v. Heckler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1608-10\">Autry Hand was born in 1940, and has past relevant work experience as a mechanic and a security guard. He underwent a bilateral laminectomy and discectomy in 1980, and has complained of lower back pain since his operation. He also suffers from severe tremors in his hands, of unknown origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-13\">In 1980, Hand filed an application for Social Security disability benefits. The AU concluded that Hand was disabled since he did not retain the functional capacity to engage in any substantial gainful work activity. In reaching this determination, the AU found that the credible evidence established that Hand\u2019s pain imposed severe limitations on his functional capacity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-14\">The Appeals Council reviewed the AU\u2019s decision on its own motion, and reversed the AU\u2019s finding of disability because Hand\u2019s impairments did not prevent him from performing his past relevant work as a security guard. The Appeals Council considered Hand\u2019s allegations of severe pain, but concluded that the medical evidence did not establish the existence of an impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce such pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-15\">Hand filed suit in the district court challenging the Secretary\u2019s denial of disability benefits, but the district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision because substantial evidence supported the Appeals Council\u2019s de - termination that Hand could still perform his prior security guard work. On appeal, a panel of this court concluded that substantial evidence supported the Secretary\u2019s finding that Hand\u2019s impairments did not prevent the performance of his past work as a security guard. <em>Hand v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d 1545, 1547-49 (11th Cir.), <em>vacated for reh\u2019g en banc sub nom. Parker v. Heckler, </em>774 F.2d 428 (11th Cir.1985). In reaching this conclusion, the panel held that since the Appeals Council has the power to review <em>de novo </em>and reverse the AU\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>findings, federal courts may only review the decision of the Appeals Council to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1547 n. 1 (citing <em>Beavers v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>577 F.2d 383 (6th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-4\">B. <em>Parker v. Heckler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">Nelda Parker is a fifty-two year old licensed practical nurse whose prior work experience was as a nurse, bookkeeper and general office worker in a doctor\u2019s office. During the last three years of her employment, her declining health forced her to work only part-time, and in March 1983, Parker retired and has not worked since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-6\">In 1983, Parker applied for Social Security disability benefits. The AU found that she was suffering from hypertensive cardiovascular disease, fibromuscular dyspla-sia, and exogenous obesity, and concluded that she was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-7\">The Appeals Council reviewed the AU\u2019s decision on its own motion, and reversed. Contrary to the findings of the AU, the Appeals Council concluded that Parker was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act because her only impairment was non-severe hypertension. The Appeals Council also found that Parker\u2019s symptoms of fatigue, blurred vision and difficulty in standing were not disabling because the evidence did not establish the existence of a medical condition that could reasonably be expected to produce symptoms of the severity alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-8\">The district court affirmed the Appeals Council\u2019s finding of no disability. On appeal, a panel of this court reversed the district court\u2019s decision and remanded for an award of benefits. <em>Parker v. Heckler, </em>763 F.2d 1363 (11th Cir.), <em>vacated for reh\u2019g en banc, </em>774 F.2d 428 (11th Cir.1985). The panel first concluded that when the Appeals Council reverses an AU\u2019s finding of disability, federal courts must determine whether the Appeals Council correctly concluded that the AU\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1364-66. Relying on <em>Newsome v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>753 F.2d 44 (6th Cir.1985), the panel reasoned that the Appeals Council does not have \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d to reject the AU\u2019s determination, but rather may only review a case if (1) the AU abused his discretion; (2) there was an error of law; (3) the AU\u2019s determination is not supported by substantial evidence; or (4) the case involves a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest. 763 F.2d at 1365 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(a) (1985)). After considering the evidence in the record, the panel then concluded that the Appeals Council had no authority to review the AU\u2019s decision because the AU\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and because none of the other three categories of section 404.970(a) were implicated. <em>Id. </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-13\">We granted en banc consideration in this case to clarify the scope of judicial review in cases where the Appeals Council, on its own motion, reverses an AU\u2019s decision. Hand and Parker argue that under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(a) (1985), the Appeals Council\u2019s authority to reverse an AU\u2019s decision is limited to cases where one of four grounds is present: (1) the AU abused his discretion; (2) the AU made an error of law; (3) the AU\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence; or (4) the case concerns a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the public interest. Under this interpretation of the regulations and focusing only on the third<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the four grounds, the Appeals Council may review an AU\u2019s decision, only if that decision is <em>in fact </em>unsupported by substantial evidence; thus, they contend that federal courts must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>determine whether the Appeals Council was correct in concluding that the AU\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-4\">The Secretary contends, however, that since only the final decisions of the Secretary of Health and Human Services are subject to judicial review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and since the Secretary has clearly delegated the duty of making final decisions to the Appeals Council, federal courts must review the decision of the Appeals Council, not the decision of the ALJ, to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision. The Secretary also argues that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-970(a) (1985), which sets forth four categories of cases in which the Appeals Council will grant review, does not limit the Appeals Council\u2019s discretion to review ALJs\u2019 decisions under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.969 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-16\">A. <em>Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-17\">The Social Security Act provides that federal courts may only review the Secretary\u2019s \u201cfinal decision,\u201d and that judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining whether these findings are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to his rule-making authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Secretary has delegated the duty of making \u201cfinal decisions\u201d to the Appeals Council. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900, 404.981, 416.1400, 416.1481 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>the statute provides that federal courts may only review the Secretary\u2019s \u201cfinal decision,\u201d and since the Secretary has delegated his authority to make final decisions to the Appeals Council, federal courts must review the Appeals Council\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 872, 874-75 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Turner v. Heckler, </em>754 F.2d 326, 330 (10th Cir.1985); <em>Lopez-Cardona v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>747 F.2d 1081, 1083 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Baker v. Heckler, </em>730 F.2d 1147, 1149-50 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Beavers v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>577 F.2d 383, 386-87 (6th Cir.1978). <em>But see Scott v. Heckler, </em>768 F.2d 172, 179 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Newsome v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 44, 47 (6th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\">This interpretation is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 5. Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In <em>Universal Camera, </em>the Court rejected the argument that the National Labor Relations Board may only reverse an AU\u2019s decision when the AU\u2019s findings are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 71 S.Ct. at 467. The Court explained that such a result would be inconsistent with \u201c[t]he responsibility for decision ... placed on the Board\u201d by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 340 U.S. at 492, 71 S.Ct. at 467. Rather, the Court concluded that when the NLRB and an AU disagree, federal courts should determine whether the NLRB\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 469. The fact that the NLRB and the AU have reached different conclusions does not modify the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, but rather is simply one factor to be considered in determing whether this standard has been satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-12\"><em>Universal Camera </em>has been applied in circumstances closely analogous to the present situation. <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. Veterans Administration, </em>768 F.2d 1325, 1329-31 (Fed.Cir.1985) (holding that the fact \u201cthat the [Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s] decision differs from the presiding official\u2019s does not alter the requirement that we evaluate the <em>board\u2019s final decision </em>under the substantial evidence standard\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>WHW Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>753 F.2d 1132, 1139-44 (D.C. Cir.1985) (court must review FCC Review Board\u2019s decision, not the AU\u2019s, to determine whether substantial evidence standard is satisfied); <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 587, 592 n. 4 (9th Cir.1984) (rejecting the argument that a federal court should review the decision of the Provider Reimbursement Review Board rather than that of the Deputy Administrator because the latter \u201cis the <em>final </em>decision of the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] that we review\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Mattes v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 1125, 1128-30 (7th Cir.1983) (when the Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture (J.O.) rejects an AU\u2019s findings of fact, \u201c[t]he reviewing court still evaluates the J.O.\u2019s decision using the substantial evidence test with the caveat that \u2018evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced [AU] who has observed the witness and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board\u2019s than when he has reached the same conclusion\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 468); <em>Kirkland v. Railroad Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number><em>tirement Board, </em>706 F.2d 99, 103-04 (2d Cir.1983) (reviewing court applies substantial evidence standard to Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s decision, not the AU\u2019s); <em>Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 538, 542-43 (11th Cir.1983) (concluding that federal court must review ICC\u2019s decision, not ALJ\u2019s decision). <em>See generally </em>3 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 17.16 (2d ed. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">Hand and Parker contend that even if the statutorily mandated deference to findings of fact runs in favor of the decisions. of the Appeals Council, the Secretary has promulgated regulations restricting the Appeals Council\u2019s authority to review an ALJ\u2019s decision to one of the four categories enumerated in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(a) (1985). The Secretary, however, asserts that this list is not exclusive, and that under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.969 (1985), the Appeals Council retains the discretion to review, on its own motion, any decision of an AU. We agree with the Secretary\u2019s construction of sections 404.969 and 404.970(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">We note at the outset that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872-73, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2155-56, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977); <em>Eley v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 724, 726 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Baker, </em>730 F.2d at 1149. The administrative interpretation is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language and purposes of the regulation. <em>See, e.g., Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. at 872, 97 S.Ct. at 2155; <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-9\">The starting point for our analysis is the language of the regulations. Section 404.-969 gives the Appeals Council authority to review the ALJ\u2019s decision: \u201cAnytime within 60 days after the date of a hearing decision or dismissal, the Appeals Council itself may decide to review the action that was taken.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.969 (1985). Section 404.970(a), upon which Hand and Parker rely, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-10\">The Appeals Council will review a case if\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-11\">(1) There appears to be an abuse of discretion by the administrative law judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-12\">(2) There is an error of lav/;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-13\">(3) The action, findings or conclusions of the administrative law judge are not supported by substantial evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-14\">(4) There is a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1612-15\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(a) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-16\">Hand and Parker read section 404.970(a) as setting forth the only circumstances in which the Appeals Council may conduct own motion review of an AU\u2019s decision. This interpretation, however, would make section 404.969 superfluous. If the Secretary had intended to limit own motion review to the four grounds listed in section 404.970(a), it would have been unnecessary to include section 404.969.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>tion 404.970(a) does not provide that the Appeals Council can only review certain classes of cases, but rather states that the Appeals Council \u201cwill\u201d review an ALJ\u2019s decision if one of these grounds is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation, on the other hand, gives effect to the language of both sections. Under this interpretation, section 404.969 gives the Appeals Council the authority to review <em>any </em>ALJ\u2019s decision, while section 404.970(a) sets forth those categories of cases which the Appeals Council <em>must </em>review. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulations is also consistent with the Secretary\u2019s delegation to the Appeals Council of the authority to make \u201cfinal decisions,\u201d and with the general principle that in an intra-agency appeal, the agency (or the body to which it has delegated its authority to render a \u201cfinal decision\u201d) has all the power that it would have had in making the initial decision, <em>see, e.g., Lopez-Cardona, </em>747 F.2d at 1083; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-6\">Hand and Parker\u2019s interpretation of the regulation would also frustrate the purpose of the Bellmon Amendment, which provides that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Health and Human Services shall implement a program of reviewing, on his own motion, decisions rendered by administrative law judges as a result of hearings under section 221(d) of the Social Security Act.\u201d Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-265, \u00a7 304(g), 94 Stat. 441, 456. The Bellmon Amendment was intended to eliminate the perceived lack of uniformity among ALJs\u2019 decisions and between decisions rendered by ALJs and various state agencies. <em>See </em>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 944, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 57-58 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1392, 1405-06; S.Rep. No. 408, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 52-56 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1277, 1330-34. Hand and Parker\u2019s interpretation would limit the Appeals Council\u2019s ability to exercise supervisory power over ALJs\u2019 decisions, and would therefore undermine the purpose of the Bellmon Amendment, i.e., to promote uniformity in disability determinations. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation, on the other hand, would further the goal of uniformity because the Appeals Council would have the authority to review, on its own motion, any ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1613-14\">Accordingly, we hold that in cases where the Appeals Council reverses an ALJ\u2019s decision on its own motion, judicial review is limited to determining whether the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>Council\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">B. <em>Credibility Determinations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">The Appeals Council\u2019s reversal of an AU\u2019s decision presents a special problem when the Appeals Council rejects the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings. We hold that the Appeals Council is not bound by the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, but when it rejects such findings, it should ordinarily do so expressly, articulating the reasons for its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">In analogous contexts, the Supreme Court has discussed the weight that a reviewing court should give to an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., </em>349 U.S. 358, 363-64, 75 S.Ct. 855, 858-59, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 496-97, 71 S.Ct. 456, 468-69, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In <em>Universal Camera, </em>the Court held that while federal courts must determine whether the NLRB\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, the NLRB\u2019s rejection of an ALJ\u2019s decision is one factor to be considered in ascertaining whether the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard has been met, and the significance of the ALJ\u2019s decision would depend on the importance of credibility in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-7\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard is not modified in any way when the Board and its examiner disagree. We intend only to recognize that evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board\u2019s than when he has reached the same conclusion. The findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1614-8\">340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">In <em>Allentown Broadcasting, </em>the Court cautioned that an agency is not bound by an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. 349 U.S. at 364, 75 S.Ct. at 859. The Court concluded that an agency\u2019s power to reject an ALJ\u2019s credibility findings is not limited to cases where there is a \u201cvery substantial preponderance\u201d in the record that such findings are erroneous because this test would reinstate the clearly erroneous rule rejected in <em>Universal Camera. Id. Universal Camera </em>and <em>Allentown Broadcasting </em>therefore establish that, while an agency is not bound by an ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, a federal court still must consider the AU\u2019s credibility determinations in ascertaining whether the agency\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the weight given to the ALJ\u2019s decision will depend on the importance of credibility in that case. <em>See, e.g., Bosma v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>754 F.2d 804, 807-08 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>Moore v. Ross, </em>687 F.2d 604, 608-09 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1115, 103 S.Ct. 750, 74 L.Ed.2d 969 (1983). <em>See generally </em>3 K. Davis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.16, at 327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-11\">Other circuits have considered the role of an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations in determining whether the Appeals Council\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Howard v. Heckler, </em>782 F.2d 1484 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Turner v. Heckler, </em>754 F.2d 326 (10th Cir.1985); <em>Lopez-Cardona v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>747 F.2d 1081 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Parris v. Heckler, </em>733 F.2d 324 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Baker v. Heckler, </em>730 F.2d 1147 (8th Cir. 1984); <em>Beavers v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>577 F.2d 383 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Combs v. Weinberger, </em>501 F.2d 1361 (4th Cir.1974). These courts held that while the Appeals Council has the power to reject an ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, the Appeals Council should explain its reasons for rejecting such findings. <em>See, e.g., Howard, </em>782 F.2d at 1487-88; <em>Turner, </em>754 F.2d at 330-31; <em>Lopez-Cardona, </em>747 F.2d at 1084; <em>Parris, </em>733 F.2d at 327; <em>Baker, </em>730 F.2d at 1150; <em>Beavers, </em>577 F.2d at 386-88; <em>Combs, </em>501 F.2d at 1363. In <em>Beavers, </em>the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>Circuit explained the reason for this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1615-4\">It is beyond dispute that the Appeals Council, and the Secretary, have the <em>power </em>to conclude that testimony, even if uncontradicted in the record, is not credible, since the Secretary is entrusted with the duty of making all findings of fact. Since the statutorily-mandated deference to findings of fact runs in favor of the Secretary, not the administrative law judge, the Appeals Council has the power to do so even if the administrative law judge has determined otherwise. Nevertheless, this Court still has the responsibility of determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Appeals Council\u2019s decision, and when the administrative law judge has concluded that a witness\u2019s testimony is credible, that is an important factor to consider. The notion that special deference is owed to a credibility finding by a trier of fact is deeply imbedded in our law. The opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness, evaluating what is said in the light of how it is said, and considering how it fits with the rest of the evidence gathered before the person who is conducting the hearing, is invaluable, and should not be discarded lightly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1615-5\">If an Appeals Council decides to reject the credibility findings of an administrative law judge, or to disregard testimony which was clearly central to the administrative law judge\u2019s determination, it should do so expressly, identifying the considerations which led to its conclu-sion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\"><em>Beavers, </em>577 F.2d at 386-87 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">This court has imposed similar requirements in an analogous context, i.e., when we are reviewing an AU\u2019s decision-that has become the \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Secretary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Ryan v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 939, 941-42 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Hudson v. Heckler, </em>755 F.2d 781, 785-86 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1514-16 (11th Cir.1984). In <em>Owens, </em>we held that an AU should \u201cstate with at least some measure of clarity the grounds for his decision,\u201d and that when an AU rejects a claimant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds, he should do so explicitly. 748 F.2d at 1516. We explained that these requirements were necessary \u201cso that we can perform the function entrusted to us in the administrative scheme. We are neither to conduct a de novo proceeding, nor to rubber stamp the administrative decisions that come before us. Rather, our function is to ensure that the decision was based on a reasonable and consistently applied standard, and was carefully considered in light of all the relevant facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">This reasoning applies with equal force to the present situation. We cannot conduct a meaningful review of the Appeals Council\u2019s decision when the Appeals Council ignores an AU\u2019s credibility findings and fails to provide any explanation or justification for doing so. We therefore hold that the Appeals Council has the power to reject an AU\u2019s credibility findings, but in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Appeals Council, a federal court will consider the record as a whole, including, inter alia, the AU\u2019s credibility findings and the reasons those findings were rejected by the Appeals Council. In order to permit meaningful review, we also hold that the Appeals Council should ordinarily<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>the AU\u2019s credibility findings expressly and state the reasons for its conclusion. The Appeals Council\u2019s rejection of the credibility findings in light of the stated reasons must, of course, be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">Although the panel in <em>Hand v. Bowen </em>correctly focused on the decision of the Appeals Council as the final decision of the Secretary to which a reviewing court owes the statutorily mandated deference, we remand the case to the panel for further consideration since the panel did not consider whether the Appeals Council had complied with our requirement that reasons be identified for the Appeals Council\u2019s rejection of the AU\u2019s credibility findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">We also remand <em>Parker v. Bowen </em>to the panel for reconsideration in light of the standards herein articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-7\">REMANDED to panels.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1608-11\">. Appeals Council decisions occur in four ways: (1) the claimant can seek review of an adverse ALJ decision by filing an appeal with the Appeals Council within 60 days after he receives notice of that decision, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.968(a)(1) (1985); (2) the Appeals Council can, on its own motion, initiate review of any ALJ decision within 60 days of that decision, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.969, 404.970 (1985); (3) when a federal court remands a case for further consideration, the Appeals Council can either make a decision or remand the case to an ALJ with instructions to take action and return the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.983 (1985); or (4) in certain circumstances, the Appeals Council can reopen an otherwise final decision, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.987-989 (1985). This case involves only the second form of Appeals Council review, i.e., own motion review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1609-9\">. The Secretary does not assert that the Appeals Council\u2019s reversals of the AUs\u2019 decisions in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Heckler </em>and <em>Hand v. Heckler </em>were proper because of the presence of one of the three other grounds listed in \u00a7 404.970(a). Under Hand and Parker\u2019s construction of \u00a7 404.970(a), the Appeals Council could therefore reverse the ALJs\u2019 decisions only if their decisions were unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1610-5\">.

An examination of the predecessors to \u00a7\u00a7 404.969 and 404.970(a) suggests that \u00a7 404.-970(a) was not intended to provide an exclusive list of the cases that the Appeals Council could review on its own motion. In I960, the Secretary added \u00a7 404.947 (the predecessor to \u00a7 404.-969), which provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-7\">The Appeals Council may dismiss ... or, in its discretion, deny or grant a party\u2019s request for review of an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision, or may, on its own motion, within 90 days from the date of mailing notice of such decision, reopen such decision for review or for the purpose of dismissing the party\u2019s request for hearing for any reason for which it could have been dismissed by the [Administrative Law Judge]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a0e-dedup-0\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.947 (1976). This regulation gave the Appeals Council authority to undertake own motion review of any ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., White v. Schweiker, </em>725 F.2d 91, 93-94 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Gray v. Weinberger, </em>397 F.Supp. 304, 305-06 (W.D.Va.1975); <em>Hofacker v. Weinberger, </em>382 F.Supp. 572, 574-76 (S.D.N.Y.1974); <em>Maggard v.

If the Secretary had intended to restrict the Appeals Council\u2019s authority to conduct own motion review under \u00a7 404.947, the Secretary could simply have replaced \u00a7 404.947 with \u00a7 404.947a. Moreover, the preamble of the <em>Federal Register </em>notice does not suggest that the Secretary intended such a change. <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. 51,585-86 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-12\">In 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 404.947 and 404.947a were recodi-fied with minor changes as \u00a7\u00a7 404.969 and 404.-970(a). The preamble to the 1980 recodification does not indicate that \u00a7\u00a7 404.969 and 404.970(a) were intended to be given a different meaning than their predecessors. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 52,-078-80 (1980). Since neither the 1976 amendment nor the 1980 recodification suggests that the Secretary meant to disturb the existing interpretation of \u00a7 404.947, it is unlikely that \u00a7 404.-970(a) was intended to limit the Appeals Council\u2019s own motion review authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1613-16\">.

This method of assuring greater consistency of results would not be necessary if the proceedings before the administrative law judge were adversarial, but they are not; if the claimant wins, there is no one to appeal. It might not be necessary if there were few judges and few decisions; but the Social Security Administration has hundreds of administrative law judges deciding in the aggregate hundreds of thousands of disability cases a year. The need for greater consistency is acute____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1613-19\"><em>Delong v.

For example, the decision of the AU becomes the final decision of the Secretary if the Appeals Council declines to review the AU\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins v.

There may well be contexts in which it would be unnecessary for the Appeals Council to expressly reject the AU\u2019s credibility findings and explain its conclusion. For example, the Appeals Council may reject a credibility finding of an AU in a case where the credibility of the particular witness was unimportant to the decision. In such a case, the substantiality of the evidence to support the Appeals Council\u2019s decision would be little affected by whether or not the witness was credible. <em>See supra, </em>at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">Similarly, while it would be the better practice for the Appeals Council to expressly reject the AU\u2019s credibility findings and articulate its reasons, the reviewing court\u2019s function would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>not be frustrated if the Appeals Council's implicit rejection and explanation were sufficiently clear to permit review. <em>Cf., e.g., Tieniber v.
