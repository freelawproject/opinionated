KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">These consolidated appeals present the question whether section 15(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1), applies to holders of collateral obtained pursuant to perfected security interests. The United States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of Tennessee held that the FLSA applies to secured creditors. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">On December 14, 1983, defendant-appellant, Citicorp Industrial Credit, Inc. (\u201cCiti-corp\u201d), and Qualitex Corporation, an earlier name for a group of companies consisting of Ely Group, Inc. (\u201cEly Group\u201d) and its subsidiaries, Rockford Textile Mills, Inc. (\u201cRockford\u201d) and Ely &amp; Walker, Inc. (\u201cEly &amp; Walker\u201d), (collectively \u201cEly\u201d), signed a financing agreement. Under this \u201czero balance\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> financing arrangement, Citicorp agreed, in its discretion, to loan up to $11,-000,000 to provide the general working capital for Ely. As security for the loans, Ely granted Citicorp a security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and various other assets. Citicorp filed financing statements and other appropriate documentation to perfect its security interests so that Citi-corp undisputably qualifies as a perfected secured creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">In accordance with the financing agreement, Ely submitted various daily, weekly, and monthly reports to Citicorp. In the fall of 1984, Ely started missing sales projections. Accordingly, the loan balance considerably exceeded projections. In January 1985, Ely stopped sending reports to Citi-corp. A Citicorp field examination determined that Ely\u2019s computerized accounting system was not functioning properly. By early February 1985, Ely\u2019s loan balance had increased to approximately $9,500,000. February 8, 1985 was the last day Citicorp advanced any funds to Ely. On February 11, 1985, Citicorp ceased funding Ely\u2019s operations. Ely\u2019s employees, however, continued working until February 19, 1985, when Citicorp foreclosed, taking possession of the collateral, and Ely ceased operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">Since Ely defaulted on its payroll, its employees did not receive any wages for various workweeks, dating from January 27, 1985 to February 19, 1985. Consequently, the goods that Ely produced during this period were produced in violation of the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Acting on information that Ci-ticorp planned to ship the goods in interstate commerce, the Department of Labor brought these actions to enjoin the ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>ment of the goods under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">On March 15, 1985, Raymond J. Donovan, Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction and application for temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, to enjoin Rockford, Ely Group, and Citicorp from placing goods allegedly produced in violation of the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime provisions in interstate commerce. The District Court denied the application for a temporary restraining order on March 15, 1985. After hearing arguments, the District Court granted the motion for preliminary injunction on March 22, 1985. <em>Donovan v. Rockford Textile Mills, Inc., </em>608 F.Supp. 215 (E.D.Tenn.1985). Citicorp filed a notice of appeal from that ruling, which the Clerk of this Court docketed as No. 85-5249. On April 10, 1985, the District Court granted Citicorp\u2019s motion for a stay or suspension of injunction pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">On March 21, 1985, Ford B. Ford, Under Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a related complaint and motion for preliminary injunction and application for temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee against Ely Group, Rockford, Ely &amp; Walker, and Citi-corp. The District Court, following a telephone conference with counsel, granted the temporary restraining order on March 22, 1985. Following a hearing, the District Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction on March 27, 1985. Citicorp filed a notice of appeal, which the Clerk of this Court docketed as No. 85-5252. On March 28, 1985, the District Court denied Citicorp\u2019s motion to stay or suspend the injunction. Citicorp immediately filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this Court, agreeing to pay the unpaid employees the statutorily required wages in the event that this Court concluded that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1) applies to Citicorp. This Court granted the requested stay on March 29, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the FLSA\u2019s \u201chot goods\u201d provision, prohibits \u201cany person\u201d from shipping, delivering, or selling, in interstate commerce, goods that were produced in violation of FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime provisions. Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(a) defines \u201cperson\u201d as \u201can individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal representative, or any organized group of persons.\u201d Citi-corp thus falls within the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute. Citicorp, however, cites <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, </em>143 U.S. 457, 12 S.Ct. 511, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892), for the proposition that this Court should look beyond the plain mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>ing of the statute. In <em>Church of the Holy Trinity, </em>the Supreme- Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-5\">It is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 459,12 S.Ct. at 512. <em>See also United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 201, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2726, 61 L.Ed.2d 480, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>444 U.S. 889, 100 S.Ct. 193, 62 L.Ed.2d 125 (1979). Although courts may look behind the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a statute when a literal construction would produce a nonsensical result or \u201c \u2018bring about an end completely at variance with the purpose of the statute,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 202, 99 S.Ct. at 2726 (quoting <em>United States v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>345 U.S. 295, 315, 73 S.Ct. 706, 97 L.Ed. 1020, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>345 U.S. 961, 73 S.Ct. 935, 97 L.Ed. 1380 (1953)), we conclude that applying the \u201chot goods\u201d provision to secured creditors, in fact, furthers one purpose of the FLSA, which is to keep goods that were produced in violation of the FLSA out of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">In <em>United States v. Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941), the Supreme Court, after examining the declaration of policy in \u00a7 2(a) of the FLSA, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the FLSA\u2019s legislative history, stated that the purpose of the FLSA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\">is to exclude from interstate commerce goods produced for the commerce and to prevent their production for interstate commerce, under conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living necessary for health and general well-being; <em>and </em>to prevent the use of interstate commerce as the means of competition in the distribution of goods so produced, and as the means of spreading and perpetuating such substandard labor conditions among the workers of the several states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 109-10, 61 S.Ct. at 455 (emphasis added). While discussing \u00a7 15(a)(1) of the FLSA, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-11\">The motive and purpose of the present regulation are plainly to make effective the Congressional conception of public policy that interstate commerce should not be made the instrument of competition in the distribution of goods produced under substandard labor conditions, which competition is injurious to the commerce and to the states from and to which the commerce flows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 115, 61 S.Ct. at 457. <em>See also Roland Electric Co. v. Walling, </em>326 U.S. 657, 667-69, 66 S.Ct. 413, 417-19, 90 L.Ed. 383 (1946). Consequently, one of the reasons that Congress passed the FLSA was to exclude tainted goods from interstate commerce. Since Congress wanted to exclude goods that were produced in violation of the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime provisions from interstate commerce, prohibiting secured creditors, such as Citicorp, from shipping \u201chot goods\u201d in interstate commerce furthers that Congressional intent. Accordingly, we follow the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute and conclude that the phrase \u201cany person\u201d applies to Citicorp, as a secured creditor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>In reaching this conclusion, we refuse to follow and reject the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <em>Wirtz v. Powell Knitting Mills Company, Inc., </em>360 F.2d 730 (2d Cir.1966). In <em>Powell Knitting Mills, </em>the Second Circuit created a \u201cjudicial exception\u201d to the FLSA by holding that FLSA \u00a7 15 did not prohibit a factor, which had foreclosed its lien on an insolvent manufacturer, from selling the manufacturer\u2019s sweaters in interstate commerce on the ground that the manufacturer had produced the sweaters in violation of FLSA\u2019s minimum wage provisions. In <em>Shultz v. Factors, Inc., </em>65 Lab.Cas. (CCH) 1132,487 (4th Cir.1971), the Fourth Circuit followed <em>Powell Knitting Mills </em>with little discussion but added an additional requirement \u201cthat there be no collusion between the manufacturer and his financier permitting the introduction into the market of goods produced in violation of the Act.\u201d <em>See also Dunlop v. Sportsmaster, Inc., </em>77 Lab.Cas. (CCH) 1133,293 (E.D.Tenn.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">In <em>Powell Knitting Mills, supra, </em>the Secretary of Labor appealed from a district court order vacating a temporary restraining order that the district court had issued against a manufacturer of sweaters and the manufacturer\u2019s factor. The vacated order prohibited the factor from selling certain sweaters that the factor had acquired when it foreclosed its lien. The manufacturer had not paid eighty-six of its employees wages totaling $8,425 for the weeks ending February 18, February 25, and March 5, 1966. Beginning September 2, 1965, the factor had made approximately $700,000 in cash advances to the manufacturer, secured by liens on the manufacturer\u2019s inventory and equipment. The factor filed financing statements. On March 8, 1966, the manufacturer ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The factor foreclosed and the Secretary of Labor brought the action to enjoin the sale of certain sweaters which had been produced during the time when the manufacturer had not paid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">The Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[ujnder a literal, or, as Judge Zavatt called it, \u2018wooden\u2019 reading of the Act, the government would be entitled to an injunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. The court of appeals recognized that one purpose of the FLSA\u2019s \u201chot goods\u201d provision \u201cwas to prevent adverse competitive effects on those who comply with the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733. The Second Circuit, however, stated that \u201c[hjere there can be no connection between the asserted violation and any effects on competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the court also recognized that another purpose of the \u201chot goods\u201d provision was to assure that \u201cwage earners would be paid,\u201d the court \u201c[found] it hard to believe that Congress contemplated that the foreclosing creditor would have to pay the wage earners to avoid \u00a7 15.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed that \u201crestraining the .sale in interstate commerce (until the wage claims were paid) comes close to giving such wage claims a priority over secured creditors contrary to the scheme of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d <em>Id. See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A12\">The purpose of forcing payment of wages should not apply to the creditor who advanced funds long before the default in wages, and who merely forecloses his lien, at least where the value of the goods acquired does not exceed the debt left unpaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court order vacating the temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">Although we are reluctant to create an intercircuit conflict, we cannot agree with the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cjudicially created exception.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the purposes of the FLSA in <em>United States v. Darby, supra. </em>Congress does not want \u201chot goods\u201d to taint the channels of interstate commerce. Furthermore, the \u201chot goods\u201d in this case will compete with goods produced in conformity with the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime provisions if Citicorp places the goods in interstate commerce. The FLSA protects manufacturers who comply with the minimum wage and overtime provisions by keeping \u201chot goods\u201d out of interstate commerce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our holding does not change the priorities in bankruptcy. Citicorp \u201cowns\u201d the goods. The \u201chot goods\u201d provision merely prevents Citicorp from shipping, delivering, or selling the goods in interstate commerce. Finally, the equities of the situation balance somewhere between Citicorp and the employees. Although Citicorp provided the capital and the materials for the production of the goods, that does not dictate that Citicorp should receive the benefits of the employees\u2019 labor during the three weeks which they worked on the goods but were not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">Congress has created only two exceptions \u2014 one for common carriers and one for good faith purchasers \u2014 to the broad scope of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1), which otherwise applies to \u201cany person.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Citicorp definitely does not qualify as a common carrier. Citicorp has not raised the issue whether it could qualify as a good faith purchaser. We do observe, however, that although the extension of credit might qualify as a \u201cpurchase,\u201d Citicorp does not qualify as a \u201cgood faith purchaser\u201d because Citicorp did not rely \u201con written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance with the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>quirements of [the FLSA].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1). We agree that Congress never directly considered the question whether the \u201chot goods\u201d provision applies to secured creditors. Nevertheless, Citicorp should not be in a better position as a secured creditor, for which Congress has not created an exception, than as a \u201cgood faith purchaser,\u201d for which Congress specifically added an exception. Consequently, we conclude that <em>Powell Knitting Mills </em>created an exception for secured creditors that Congress did not and has not deemed appropriate. We, therefore, reject the reasoning in <em>Powell Knitting Mills </em>and hold that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(1) applies to secured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the orders of the District Courts granting the preliminary injunctions enjoining Citicorp from placing the goods in interstate commerce.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">. Under a \"zero balance\u201d financing arrangement, the creditor transfers funds, on a daily or an \"as needed\u201d basis, into the debtor\u2019s \u201czero balance\u201d bank account to meet the debtor's operating expenses. Accordingly, each day, after Ely\u2019s various banks informed Ely of the total amount of checks which had cleared, Ely personnel would notify Citicorp of the amount needed to cover those checks. Citicorp, in turn, would wire-transfer the necessary funds to Ely\u2019s bank accounts to fund Ely\u2019s disbursements, including payroll checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1295-16\">. FLSA \u00a7 6, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206, requires employers to pay each employee minimum wages at the prescribed rate.

We also note that in <em>Dunlop v.

Although twenty years have elapsed since the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, we do not think that the \"judicially created exception\u201d has become so well-settled as to preclude this Court from reexamining the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning. <em>Contra Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 380 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 683, 686 n. 10, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983) (courts had consistently recognized an implied cause of action under Rule 10b-5 for more than thirty-five years).

The dissenting opinion correctly notes that Citicorp has already sold the goods in question on the condition that it place the proceeds in escrow pending final resolution of this controversy. The dissent claims that \"[t]he practical effect of the majority\u2019s decision is not to remove any tainted goods from competition____\u201d Citi-corp, however, has effectively removed the \"taint\u201d from the goods by agreeing to pay the statutorily required wages if this Court holds that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a)(1) applies to secured creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">. We note that the legislative history of the FLSA does not conclusively indicate whether Congress intended the \u201chot goods\u201d provision to apply to secured creditors. Although the Senate Bill contained a provision that would have allowed a Labor Standards Board to exempt goods from the prohibition against interstate shipment if every person having a \"substantial proprietary interest\u201d in the goods could satisfy the Board that they had no reason to believe that any substandard condition existed in the production of the goods, the provision appeared in a reparation section. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 2738, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 20 (1938). The exemption accordingly required that every employer having a proprietary interest in the goods who failed to maintain the required wage or hour standard provide for the payment of reparation. The Senate Bill contained a separate section prohibiting the shipment of goods produced under substandard labor conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 17. Another section in the Senate Bill contained an exception to the prohibition against the interstate shipment of \"substandard goods\u201d for common carriers. <em>Id. </em>at 20. The House Amendment also prohibited the shipment of \"substandard goods\" in interstate commerce but also contained an exception for common carriers in the regular course of business. <em>Id. </em>at 26. The Conference Agreement adopted a version that closely followed the corresponding section of the House Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-2\">In the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, Congress added an exception for \"good faith purchasers\u201d of goods produced in violation of the FLSA. The Conference Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">This [exception] protects an innocent purchaser from an unwitting violation and also protects him from having goods which he has purchased in good faith ordered to be withheld from shipment in commerce by a \"hot goods\u201d injunction. An affirmative duty is imposed upon him to assure himself that the goods in question were produced in compliance with the act, and he must have secured written assurance to that effect from the producer of the goods. The requirement that he must have made the purchase in good faith is comparable to similar requirements imposed on purchasers in other fields of law, and is to be subjected to the test of what a reasonable, prudent man, acting with due diligence, would have done in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a7f-dedup-0\">Conf.R.

I would follow the lead of the Second Circuit in <em>Wirtz v. Powell Knitting Mills, Inc., </em>360 F.2d 730 (2nd Cir.1966), and of the Fourth Circuit in <em>Schultz v. Factors, Inc., </em>65 Lab.Cas. (CCH) 1132,487 (4th Cir.1971), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">If we were writing upon a clean slate, the majority opinion, in adopting a literal interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, would have considerable appeal for the term \u201cany person\u201d is indeed broad and has been carefully defined by Congress, as the majority opinion observes. Beyond that, there is little to be said for the construction here mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">The evils foreseen and sought to be corrected by the Congress in enacting the \u201chot goods\u201d provisions to the FLSA were twofold. Congress sought to improve working conditions by eliminating the incentive to manufacture goods at substandard wages and substandard hours; Congress also sought to prevent the injurious effect on trade that resulted when such goods were placed in interstate commerce in competition against goods that were manufactured in compliance with the FLSA. <em>See United States v. Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 109-10, 61 S.Ct. 451, 455, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941). To accomplish these goals, Congress took the profit and, hence, the incentive out of such practices by making it unlawful to place into interstate commerce goods that were manufactured in noncompliance with the minimum wage and hour provisions of the FLSA. This much is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">In my opinion, however, an employer\u2019s inability to pay wages at all due to insolvency was not the target of the Act, at least where, as here, the employer is not otherwise shown to have been in noncompliance with the minimum wage and hour requirements of the statute. The problem here does not seem to have been an employer\u2019s unwillingness to comply with the Act, but instead an inability to pay any wages at all due to financial distress. Characterizing the government\u2019s literal reading of the Act as \u201cwooden,\u201d the Second Circuit observed in a similar situation, and correctly in my opinion, that \u201c[o]ne purpose of making the sale illegal was to prevent the adverse competitive effects on those who comply with the Act. Here there can be no connection between the asserted violation and any effects on competition.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Powell Knitting Mills Co., </em>360 F.2d 730, 733 (2nd Cir.1966). It is just as reasonable to assume that perhaps one reason for the company\u2019s difficulty was its own previous compliance with the Act in the face of noncompliance by its competitors. No one has suggested that Congress, in passing the Fair Labor Standards Act, was seeking to tighten up the credit risks of producers of goods who may have otherwise been producing them in compliance with law but found themselves in financial difficulties. While imposing such risks upon lenders, as here, might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>hasten the demise of an insolvent company and thus avoid some loss to the wage earners who could not be paid at the end, the advantage of protecting otherwise valid security interests might equally have given the company precious time in which to recover from its straitened circumstances and thus to have provided employment at lawful wages longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">The practical effect of the majority\u2019s decision is not to remove any tainted goods from competition for, as happened here, almost always the result will be that the goods are sold, if not in foreclosure, then in bankruptcy, or by other attaching creditors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As here, the goods will go out in the market, but whether they are sold for competitively destructive prices will not depend on the cost of their production but upon the manner of their sale in any event. The real effect of the majority\u2019s interpretation is simply to create a judicial lien superior to the otherwise lawful lien which Citicorp possessed in the goods. In my view, this kind of pressure is the only motivation in the government in its present construction of the Act. Had it intended to create a federal lien law, Congress no doubt could have done so, but it did not. State laws governing creditors\u2019 rights, state laws protecting employees from non-payment of wages and bankruptcy laws generally, provide a great deal of relief for the protection of employees of defunct and insolvent corporations. It seems to me that in this special area of concern, the operation of these more traditional sources of law was intended by Congress to be sufficient. It is my opinion, therefore, that under a common sense application of section (15)(a)(l), Congress was looking instead at application of the Act in the course of the ongoing production of goods and not at the situation obtaining here and in the like cases in the Second and Fourth Circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Even were I to agree with the majority here, I would still be reluctant to depart from a construction of the Act which has been in effect in the Second Circuit for twenty years and in the Fourth Circuit for nearly fifteen years. The need for a uniform national construction of the Act is obvious. Adherence to the existing interpretation, while expressing disagreement with it, could highlight the dispute should certiorari be sought, but without in the meanwhile creating a conflict in the circuits. While I do not argue in favor of any new rule respecting standards for avoiding intercircuit conflicts, we cannot be unaware that the resolution of intercircuit conflicts places a heavy burden upon the limited resources of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Until there is a resolution of the problem, I would prefer to accept the judgment of other circuits where they have uniformly held to one construction over a long period of time, at least where I do not have an abiding and serious disagreement with the construction already in effect.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">. The record discloses that an agreement was made in the district court whereby the goods were in fact released on condition that Citicorp place the proceeds of the sale in a separate account pending final resolution of this matter. Citicorp was therefore free and expected to dispose of these goods and, thus, to introduce them into interstate commerce to compete against those goods that were presumably manufactured in compliance with the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">. <em>See generally </em>Burger, <em>The Time is Now for the Intercircuit Panel, </em>71 A.B.AJ. 86 (1985); Burger, <em>Annual Report on the State of the Judiciary, </em>69 A.B.A.J. 442 (1983); Carrington, <em>Crowded Dockets and the Courts of Appeals: The Threat to the Function of Review and the National Law, </em>82 Harv.L.Rev. 542, 596 (1969); <em>see also </em>Wallace, <em>Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, </em>71 Calif.L.Rev. 913 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
