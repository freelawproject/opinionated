The case concerns a spermicide manufactured by Ortho that allegedly caused Katie Wells to be born with birth defects. After reviewing the extensive factual record we affirm with respect to Or-tho\u2019s liability but modify the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-22\">I. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-23\">Katie Laurel Wells was born on July 1, 1981 with birth defects including deformity of her right hand, the complete lack of a left arm with only partial development of her left clavicle and shoulder, a cleft lip, and nostril deformity. A later diagnosis showed that she also has an optic nerve defect in her right eye. The plaintiffs alleged that these birth defects were caused by a spermicidal jelly used by the mother for approximately four weeks after conception until she discovered that she was preg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>nant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The spermicidal jelly used by Mary Maihafer, in conjunction with a diaphragm, was manufactured and marketed without a prescription by Ortho. Called Ortho-Gynol Contraceptive Jelly (\u201cOrtho-Gynol\u201d), this vaginal spermicide has as its active ingredient a non-ionic surfactant known as Octox-ynol-9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Ortho-Gynol label and package insert in 1980 contained only this warning \u2014 the spermicide might cause irritation to the female or male genitalia, is not 100 percent effective, and should be kept out of the reach of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Plaintiffs brought suit against Ortho alleging that Ortho-Gynol caused Katie Wells\u2019 birth defects, that Ortho negligently failed to warn that its spermicide could cause serious birth defects, and that Or-tho\u2019s failure to warn proximately caused the birth defects. Plaintiffs sought damages for Katie Wells\u2019 pain and suffering, medical expenses and disability, as well as Mary Maihafer\u2019s emotional distress and lost wages. The parties waived a jury, and the district court tried the case from January 1 through January 22, 1985. The district court found that plaintiffs had proven to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the birth defects of Katie Wells\u2019 left arm and shoulder and her right hand were proximately caused by Ortho\u2019s product, but found otherwise with respect to her cleft lip, nostril deformity and right optic nerve defect. The district court also found that Ortho knew or should have known that its product might cause birth defects. Damages were awarded exceeding $5.1 million.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ortho later moved to reopen the trial for the consideration of two new scientific studies, but the district court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In this appeal we must examine the district court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard. In our review we are guided by <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), in which the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">\u201cIn applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues <em>de novo.\u201d Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazel-tine Research, Inc., </em>395 U.S. 100, 123, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 1576, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969). If the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-12\"><em>Anderson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 1511-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">A. <em>Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">Defendant Ortho argues that plaintiffs failed to prove causation to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. <em>See Robertson v. Emory University Hospital, </em>611 F.2d 604, 608 n. 13 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Parrott v. Chatham County Hospital Authority, </em>145 Ga.App. 113, 243 S.E.2d 269, 270 (1978). Ortho asserts that the district court made a clearly erroneous finding of fact concem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ing causation and that this finding derives from a clearly erroneous fact-finding methodology. Ortho complains that despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific and medical studies introduced, the district court erroneously held that plaintiffs carried their burden of proof regarding causation. Ortho argues that the district court\u2019s findings based on the oral testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts should be set aside because those findings are not based on opinions with scientifically reliable foundations. In Ortho\u2019s estimation plaintiffs failed to focus sufficiently on epidemiology \u2014 the field of science dealing with the relationships of the various factors which determine the frequencies and distributions of certain conditions and diseases in human populations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ortho asserts that epidemiological studies should be rejied on to provide the essential data to formulate an opinion on causation. Ortho also challenges the district court\u2019s credibility choices in analyzing both sides\u2019 experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">After reviewing the record we reject Ortho\u2019s arguments and conclude that the district court\u2019s finding of causation is not clearly erroneous. We note that plaintiffs presented well qualified experts who testified at length concerning causation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These experts relied on their particular areas of expertise, their personal examinations of the child (at least by Dr. Buehler and Dr. Sutherland), and medical and scientific studies relative to causation to conclude that Ortho-Gynol caused Katie Wells\u2019 birth defects. Plaintiffs presented several epidemiological studies that indicated an association between spermicide use and deleterious effects on the fetus.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs noted various studies relative to absorption suggesting that absorption of the spermicide by the mother produced vascular disruption in the fetus that led to the birth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>defects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court turned to the oral testimony of the various expert witnesses to resolve conflicts in the studies presented by each side. The court stated that it \u201cfound the studies to be inconclusive on the ultimate issue of whether the Product caused Katie Wells\u2019 birth defects.\u201d In facing this \u201cbattle of the experts,\u201d the district court was thus forced to make credibility determinations to \u201cdecide the victor.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>736 F.2d 1529, 1535 (D.C.Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 545, 83 L.Ed.2d 432 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We recognize, as did the <em>Ferebee </em>court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">a cause-effect relationship need not be clearly established by animal or epidemiological studies before a doctor can testify that, in his opinion, such a relationship exists. As long as the basic methodology employed to reach such a conclusion is sound, such as use of tissue samples, standard tests, and patient examination, products liability law does not preclude recovery until a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d number of people have been injured or until science has had the time and resources to complete sophisticated laboratory studies of the chemical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1535-36. The district court properly noted that \u201cits ultimate focus was <em>the birth defects suffered by Katie Wells. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proving that Katie Wells\u2019 defects were caused by the Product did not necessarily require them to produce scientific studies showing a statistically significant association between spermicides and congenital malformations in a large population.\u201d As the D.C. circuit noted in <em>Ferebee, </em>a distinction exists between legal sufficiency and scientific certainty. <em>Id. </em>at 1536. If the factfinder here is convinced that plaintiffs have proven to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, which is the legal standard employed in this case, that Ortho-Gynol caused Katie Wells\u2019 arm, shoulder and hand defects, it does not matter in terms of deciding the case that the medical community might require more research and evidence before conclusively resolving the question. What matters is that this particular factfinder found sufficient evidence of causation in a legal sense in this particular case, and that that finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">B. <em>Failure to Warn</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Ortho next argues that the district court\u2019s liability finding based on Ortho\u2019s negligent failure to warn is clearly erroneous. Ortho contends that the district court misinterpreted Georgia law on the duty to warn, that the court\u2019s finding lacks substantial evidence in the record, and that the court improperly failed to consider two FDA review panels\u2019 determinations that no warning is necessary for non-ionic surfactant spermicides. We reject Ortho\u2019s arguments and conclude that the district court\u2019s finding concerning Ortho\u2019s negligent failure to warn is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">Georgia law states that a\u2019manufacturer has a duty to warn of non-obvious foreseeable dangers from the normal use of its product. <em>Rhodes v. Interstate Battery System, Inc., </em>722 F.2d 1517, 1519 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Kicklighter v. Nails by Jannee, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 734, 740 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980). If a manufacturer has actual or constructive knowledge of potential dangers of a product, the manufacturer must warn pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>chasers at the time of sale and delivery. <em>Id.; Beam v. Omark Industries, Inc., </em>143 Ga.App. 142, 237 S.E.2d 607, 610 (1977). Properly applying Georgia law, the district court found that prior to July 1980 when Mary Maihafer purchased Ortho-Gynol, Or-tho had actual or constructive knowledge that Ortho-Gynol might cause birth defects and thus was under a duty to warn purchasers, including Ms. Maihafer, of this risk. We conclude that this finding is not clearly erroneous in light of the evidence present in the record. Several studies existed prior to 1980 indicating that the use of spermicides might cause an increased risk of birth defects.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court found, and we agree, that these studies were available to Ortho. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts presented credible testimony that a warning was necessary, that the duty to warn arose prior to Mary Maihafer\u2019s purchase of the product, and that the failure to warn proximately caused Katie Wells\u2019 birth defects.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The warning present on the Or-tho-Gynol label and package insert at the time Mary Maihafer bought the product clearly did not mention the risk of birth defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The district court did consider the two FDA reports concerning non-ionic surfactant spermicides. The court, however, was not required to accept them as conclusive. An FDA determination that a warning is not necessary may be sufficient for federal regulatory purposes but still not be sufficient for state tort law purposes. <em>See Fer-ebee, </em>736 F.2d at 1540. As we have stated previously, \u201ccompliance with regulatory standards may be admissible on the issue of care but does not require a jury [or judge as factfinder] to find a defendant\u2019s conduct reasonable.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. Honda Motor Co., </em>655 F.2d 650, 656 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>670 F.2d 21 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 177, 74 L.Ed.2d 145 (1982). We affirm the district court\u2019s findings concerning Ortho\u2019s negligent failure to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">C. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Ortho asserts that the district court\u2019s determination of damages is clearly erroneous in that the court improperly awarded damages to Mary Maihafer for her emotional injuries. Ortho also argues that the court made a duplicative award of damages to Katie Wells for future lost earnings based on her total disability while at the same time making an award of damages to cure that total disability. We do not agree with Ortho\u2019s contention concerning Mary Maihafer\u2019s emotional injuries, but we conclude that the damage award to Katie Wells must be modified in light of the duplicative nature of part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The district court awarded Katie Wells $415,000 in damages for loss of future earnings. 615 F.Supp. 262. The court based this award on the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts Dr. Joseph Bussey and Dr. John Brown.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Bussey testified that \u201cthe impairments that [Katie Wells] has do constitute total and permanent disability for rating purposes.\u201d Dr. Brown analyzed Katie Wells\u2019 loss of future earnings from an economic perspective and stated that he was \u201cassuming a hundred percent disability for purposes of [his] report.\u201d The court noted that Dr. Brown had produced a figure similar to the $415,000 award based on the assumption that Katie Wells would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>have completed college, that her \u201cwork life expectancy\u201d would have been 27.91 years, and that she is totally disabled. In the court\u2019s estimation, the fact that Ortho had been found liable only for the defects of Katie Wells\u2019 left arm and shoulder and right hand would be offset by the court\u2019s finding that Katie Wells\u2019 \u201cwork life expectancy\u201d likely would have been longer than Dr. Brown\u2019s conservative estimate of 27.91 years given her intelligence and her mother\u2019s educational achievements. The district court also awarded Katie Wells $1.2 million for future medical expenses associated with the birth defects proximately caused by Ortho-Gynol. The court based this award on \u201cDr. Buehler\u2019s testimony concerning Katie Wells\u2019 future medical expenses, including regular replacement of prosthetic devices and modification of work and living space.\u201d Finally, the court noted in a footnote to its order that it was including damages for loss of earning capacity in the court\u2019s $3 million award to Katie Wells for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We conclude that the $415,000 award to Katie Wells was duplicative and clearly erroneous for the following reasons. Though the court\u2019s order is somewhat vague concerning damages it is apparent that in making the award for loss of future earnings the court was assuming Katie Wells\u2019 total disability because both experts relied on by the court, Dr. Bussey and Dr. Brown, made that assumption. A conflict arises, however, when one considers that the court then made a further award to Katie Wells for future medical expenses including damages for the outfitting of Katie Wells with prosthetic devices and the modification of work space so she could actually work. Dr. Buehler, experienced in rehabilitation medicine, indicated in his testimony that \u201cbased on my physical examination, even with that eye being, at least by the report, abnormal in vision, with her intelligence and the use of two arms and all, she could probably go up to the point of doing very, very important work with her arms, and she could have a very open career.\u201d Considering equipping her with prosthetic devices and training her to use a series of prostheses called myoelectrics, electrical-stimulated devices, Dr. Buehler testified that \u201cwe could pretty much return her to the potential of almost any occupation.\u201d Dr. Bussey also suggested that with pros-thetics Katie Wells likely could develop skills sufficient to be employable. We conclude that an award for loss of future earnings based on Katie Wells\u2019 total disability is duplicative in that it conflicts with an award for future medical expenses designed to make her employable and a further general damages award for loss of earning capacity included in the . pain and suffering award. The testimony of Dr. Buehler and Dr. Bussey indicates that Katie Wells would be employable if she is equipped with prosthetic devices and sufficiently trained to use them, and we therefore modify the damage award to Katie Wells by reducing it by $415,000, striking the award for loss of future earnings. <em>See Quality Foods, Inc. v. U.S. Fire Insurance Co., </em>715 F.2d 539, 543 (11th Cir.1983) (recognizing our authority to reduce a judgment); <em>see also Simpson v. United States, </em>322 F.2d 688, 693 (5th Cir.1963) (\u201c[wjhere there are firm guidelines establishing the basic elements of the award and it can be computed with some degree of certainty as easily by the appellate court as by the trial judge, it would be mere wasted motion to remand the cause for new findings\u201d). The judgment is thus reduced to the following amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">(1) Katie Wells:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">(a) future medical expenses $1,200,000</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">(b) past and future pain and $3,000,000 suffering</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">(2) Mary Maihafer:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">(a) medical expenses of Katie Wells $30</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">(b) loss of earnings $36,000</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">(c) mental distress $500,000</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">The case is remanded to the district court for entry of judgment in the amount of $4,736,030 in favor of plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> AF<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>FIRMED and MODIFIED in part, REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">.
