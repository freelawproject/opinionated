No. 99-80, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News (99 Stat.) 183 (to be codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412), for attorney fees and expenses for services rendered by petitioner\u2019s attorney before this court. (Peti-toner\u2019s Bill of Costs as prevailing party has been mutually agreed upon and allowed.) We grant petitioner\u2019s application, but with some reduction in amounts claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-8\">Petitioner had been an employee in California of the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cagency\u201d) for twenty-four years when he was removed, in 1984, for failure to accept a position of like grade and pay in Chicago.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After he unsuccessfully appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cboard\u201d), this court reversed. We held that because the agency had improperly defined the local commuting area for the purposes of reassignments of personnel to vacant positions to avoid implementing a RIF, petitioner\u2019s assignment was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-13\">In accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B), petitioner submitted \u201can application for fees and other expenses\u201d within thirty days of the date when this court\u2019s judgment in the main case became \u201cfinal and not appealable\u201d \u2014 i.e., within thirty days from the date that the Department of Agriculture\u2019s time for filing a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court expired. <em>See Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>785 F.2d 1568, 1570-71 (Fed. Cir.1986) <em>(in banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-14\">The pertinent authorizing provision of the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits in certain circumstances an award of \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d incurred by a party in proceedings before this court which sought judicial review of a board decision. <em>Gavette, </em>At 1573. In <em>Gavette, </em>we said that the \u201cFederal Circuit is in a better position than the board to determine the amount of fees and expenses to be awarded in connection with [an] appeal to this court\u201d and that the EAJA \u00a1application should be referred to the original merits panel. <em>Id., </em>At 1580. In the present case, it is appropriate for two of the three judges who comprised the original panel to determine the amount to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-15\">A court should impose reasonable fees and expenses under subsection (d)(1) unless it determines that circumstances excuse the government\u2019s actions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (\u201cthe position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust\u201d), 2412(d)(1)(C) (\u201cthe prevailing party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>the matter in controversy\u201d). Respondent does not contend that petitioner \u201cunduly protracted\u201d the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-5\">In opposition to petitioner\u2019s application for attorney fees and expenses, respondent argues that the agency \u201cmade its best judgment under the circumstances.\u201d However, in our merits opinion, we observed that the agency\u2019s action in excluding Watsonville from the San Jose community area appeared to be \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cbeyond the pale of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and that there was a \u201cdearth of specific, meaningful evidence supporting the exclusion of Watsonville.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that fees and expenses under the EAJA are allowable to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-6\">Petitioner has requested a total award of $8,602.57. However, the amounts of two items should be changed as follows: Attorney Fee requested for petitioner\u2019s attorney, Miller, is reduced from $5,295 (less $90.00 computation error) to $2,602.50, representing the maximum hourly rate of $75.00 provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A) with exceptions not here pertinent; general client costs of $553.53 is reduced to $208.60 (4% of attorney fees), because, as the government points out, the 7% figure used as the basis for petitioner\u2019s claim represents an \u201coffice average\u201d not necessarily attributable to this case (on the other hand, some allowance should be given in recognition of petitioner\u2019s point that complete itemization would entail increased costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-7\">In view of the foregoing, attorney fees and expenses are assessed against respondent in favor of petitioner in the amount of $5,565.14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1633-8\">In view of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-9\">(1) Petitioner\u2019s request for attorney fees and expenses is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-10\">(2) Respondent Department of Agriculture shall pay petitioner the sum of $5,565.14.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">(3) Respondent shall make such payment to petitioner on or before May 16, 1986.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1632-10\">. For a complete description of the facts, see the court\u2019s opinion concerning the merits of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1632-11\">. The subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1632-12\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1632-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (as amended in 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1633-11\">. In view of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gavette, </em>a hearing <em>in banc </em>suggested by respondent on the issue of applicability of the Back Pay Act is not indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
