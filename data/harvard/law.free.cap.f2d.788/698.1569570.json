They filed this lawsuit to challenge the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s termination of their benefits. The district court reinstated benefits retroactive to date of termination. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-25\">On October 9, 1984, President Reagan signed into law the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984. Pub.L. No. 98-460 (the Act). The Act listed new standards for determining when disability benefits paid pursuant to various titles of the Social Security Act are to be terminated. Section 2(a). It further provided that any \u201cactions relating to medical improvement\u201d pending in federal courts on September 19, 1984, be remanded to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereinafter Secretary) for reconsideration under the new standards. Section 2(d)(2). <em>See Parker v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 1474, 1475 (11th Cir.1985). On September 19, 1984, the claimants\u2019 cases were pending in federal court. The district court and this court granted the Secretary\u2019s motions to remand all pending cases for consideration under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also ordered that the claimants\u2019 benefits be reinstated from the date of termination. In response to that order, the Secretary filed a motion to alter or amend the portion of the judgment awarding benefits from date of termination. The Secretary contended that the Act intended that benefits be restored only after the Secretary\u2019s determination that the claimant is disabled under the new standards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the Secretary\u2019s motion. The Secretary now appeals the district court\u2019s award of retroactive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We address two issues: First, we must determine whether the district court\u2019s orders remanding the cases to the Secretary are appealable orders. Second, we must determine whether the district court acted within its power in awarding benefits to the claimants pending the Secretary\u2019s reconsideration of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The Secretary advances three theories supporting this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Secretary claims that this court has jurisdiction because (1) the district court\u2019s order is a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) it is an appealable collateral order under the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine; and (3) it is appealable as an injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Appellate jurisdiction generally depends on the entry of a final order. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351, 357 (1978). A final order is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 \u00da.S. 893, 104 S.Ct. 239, 78 L.Ed.2d 230 (1983) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911, 916 (1945)). The finality requirement of section 1291 is meant to avoid the drain upon judicial resources caused by the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal litigation. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. at 471, 98 S.Ct. at 2459, 57 L.Ed.2d at 359. Generally, an order of a district court remanding a case to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for further consideration is not an appealable order. <em>Biddle v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 1321 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>Howell v. Schweiker, </em>699 F.2d 524 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">As support for the claim that the district court\u2019s remand is a final order, the Secretary points to section 2(d)(4) of the Act. That section provides that the decision of the Secretary following remand \u201cshall be regarded as a new decision\u201d of the Secretary that \u201csupersedes\u201d the prior determination that was pending on judicial review. This argument is unpersuasive. On remand, the Secretary must follow the standards outlined in the Act to reconsider the earlier decision to terminate the claimants\u2019 benefits. In another social security disability benefits case, this court noted: \u201cThe district court\u2019s order [upon remand for further consideration] does not terminate the litigation. Rather, on remand the Secretary must review the case and reconsider____ Depending on the Secretary\u2019s determination, there may be another appeal to the district court and subsequently to this court.\u201d <em>Farr v. Heckler, </em>729 F.2d 1426, 1427 (11th Cir.1984). The district court\u2019s order is not a final order because it does not end the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">The <em>Farr </em>court noted that \u201c[i]f the order does not end the litigation, it must come within an exception to the final judgment rule to be reviewable on appeal.\u201d 729 F.2d at 1427. The Supreme Court has created an exception for certain collateral orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>which are not final orders. <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The <em>Cohen </em>Court recognized that the finality provision of section 1291 has historically been given a \u201cpractical rather than a technical construction.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226, 93 L.Ed. at 1536. The <em>Cohen </em>doctrine allows appeals to be taken from orders that (1) finally determine claims entirely collateral to and separable from the substance of other claims in the action, (2) require review because they present significant, unsettled questions, and (3) cannot be reviewed effectively once the case is finally decided. 337 U.S. at 545, 69 S.Ct. at 1224, 93 L.Ed. at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In <em>Cohen, </em>a shareholder brought a derivative action against a corporation. The corporation claimed that the shareholder was subject to a New Jersey statute requiring that shareholders holding below a threshold amount of equity who institute derivative actions may be required to post security in order to allow for payment of the corporation\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses if the corporation prevails. The corporation appealed the district court\u2019s finding that the statute was inapplicable, and the court of appeals reversed. The Supreme Court held that the district court ruling was appealable because the decision \u201cappears to fall in the small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. at 1536. The Court found that immediate review was proper because the decision on the applicability of the New Jersey statute was not a step toward a final decision of the case, and would not become a part of the final decision that could eventually be reviewed. The Court noted that if the order of the district court were not reviewed prior to termination of the litigation, \u201cit will be too late effectively to review the present order and rights conferred by the statute, if it is applicable, will have been lost, probably irreparably.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225, 93 L.Ed. at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">This exception to the general rule of finality was applied to a district court order remanding a social security disability claim in <em>Cohen v. Perales, </em>412 F.2d 44 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom., Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1970). In <em>Pe-rales, </em>the claimant objected to the admissibility of hearsay evidence at an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge (AU). The AU had allowed into evidence reports of physicians who had examined the claimant but were not present at the hearing. The AU relied upon these reports to deny benefits to the claimant. The district court found that the reports should have been excluded, and remanded, directing the Secretary to base his decision on first-hand evidence, stating that hearsay evidence could not constitute the substantial evidence needed to sustain the denial of benefits. In holding it had jurisdiction over the appeal of this remand, this court\u2019s predecessor found that the district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-n\">established standards for the admission of hearsay evidence and indicated that hearsay evidence is not substantial evidence. Unless the Secretary is allowed to appeal from this order, he will never be able to reach the questions involved, because on the next appeal, if there is one, the sole question may be the sub-stantiality of the evidence, not its admissibility. This seems to us to fit the rationale of the decisions in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. </em>[Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">412 F.2d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Similarly, in another case in which the Secretary denied social security disability benefits, the district court entered a remand order requiring the Secretary to meet the burden of proving jobs were available to the claimant. The court required use of a vocational expert who had personally interviewed the claimant and not merely second-hand information of existing job opportunities. <em>Gold v. Weinberger, </em>473 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>1376 (5th Cir.1973). The court of appeals found the order appealable because \u201cunless the Secretary is allowed to appeal from this order, he will never be able to reach the questions involved.\u201d 473 F.2d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We find the rationale justifying appellate review of remand orders in <em>Perales </em>and <em>Gold </em>applicable in this case. The three criteria outlined in <em>Cohen </em>are present. The issue of whether a court may order the Secretary to pay retroactive benefits prior to the determination of whether the claimants were improperly taken off the rolls is separable from the issue of whether the claimants have experienced a medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"AGR\">Second, this case presents an unsettled question which requires that we make a proper determination involving significant interests of the Secretary in protecting the public fisc. Likewise, the case involves important interests of the claimants in financial well-being and, perhaps, survival. Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) (1983) precludes recovery for overpayment of benefits from any person who is without fault, if such recovery \u201cwould defeat the purpose of this subchapter or be against equity and good conscience.\u201d Thus, it is unclear whether the Secretary would be able to recoup any overpayment in this situation. The Supreme Court has recognized that the theoretical right to recoupment of such benefits is largely illusory. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 346-49, 98 S.Ct. 893, 908-10, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 40-41 (1976). Furthermore, the Secretary will have at least lost the use of any money improperly paid until the time it is recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Finally, once this case is remanded and the Secretary pays benefits, the fundamental legal issue of whether payments are permitted prior to a determination of the disability claim under the Act will become moot. Thus, review at a later time will be meaningless. If after readjudication, the claimants are awarded benefits, the Secretary will have no right to appeal the determination. If the claimants are found not to be entitled to benefits, the Secretary will be able to present the issue only if the claimants opt to appeal the Secretary\u2019s new determination. Thus, as in <em>Perales, </em>\u201cthe sole question may be\u201d the fundamental issue of the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s determination, and not whether the benefits were properly payable pursuant to the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Because we find jurisdiction under the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine, we need not address the Secretary\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s order is appealable as an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">In <em>Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966 (11th Cir.1982), this court held that disability benefits may not be terminated without substantial evidence of improvement in the recipient\u2019s condition. Subsequent cases noted that the Secretary refused to apply the medical improvement standard enunciated in <em>Simpson </em>except when directed to do so by a federal court in a specific case. <em>See, e.g., Pickett v. Heckler, </em>608 F.Supp. 841, 843 (D.C.Fla.1985); <em>Thomas v. Heckler, </em>598 F.Supp. 492, 496 (M.D.Ala.1984). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 618, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 23, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3038, 3060. The <em>Thomas </em>court further concluded that \u201cin refusing to follow the law of this circuit as announced in <em>Simpson, </em>the Secretary has acted and is acting outside the law, flouting both the statutory and constitutional law of this land.\u201d 598 F.Supp. at 496-97. The Act was thus an attempt by Congress to reconcile differences in statutory interpretation between the Secretary and the courts in determining when benefits may properly be terminated. H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1039, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 38, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3038, 3080, 3096.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">The Secretary contends that the sole method for reinstatement of benefits is that contained in section 2(e) of the Act, which requires a claimant to make an election to have benefits reinstated pending a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>redetermination by the Secretary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary further contends that section 2(f) of the Act is the exclusive vehicle for the payment of retroactive benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the Secretary, these two sections of the Act demonstrate Congress\u2019s intent to allow the claimant to decide whether to reinstate benefits during the pendency of the Secretary\u2019s reconsideration of the claim. In the absence of an election, retroactive benefits will be paid only when the claim for such benefits has been finally adjudicated favorably to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Only one other circuit court of appeals has addressed this issue. In <em>White v. Heckler, </em>774 F.2d 994 (10th Cir.1985), the Tenth Circuit rejected the Secretary\u2019s arguments and affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of retroactive reinstatement of benefits. Two district courts have adopted the opposite view. <em>See Johnson v. Heckler, </em>606 F.Supp. 82, 86 (S.D.N.Y.1984); <em>Kinney v. Heckler, </em>596 F.Supp. 821, 822 (D.Me. 1984) (retroactive reinstatement appropriate only when the Secretary engaged in prejudicial delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We agree with the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit. Sections 2(e) and 2(f) provide the means by which a claimant may act to receive benefits, both interim and retroactive. Yet, neither of these sections, nor any other section of the Act, nor its legislative history address the courts\u2019 power to provide such relief. Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1983) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABL\">any individual, after a final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party ... may obtain a review of such decision ... in the district court of the United States____ The court shall have the power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary with or without remanding the cause for rehearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Clearly, Congress was aware of this historic equity power of the federal courts. Its failure to specifically address the courts\u2019 power leads us to the conclusion that the Act was not intended to limit the court\u2019s power to award retroactive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Once jurisdiction is established, courts maintain the authority to provide equitable relief commensurate to the harm. <em>Califa-no v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979) (affirming district court\u2019s injunction directing Social Security statute be implemented through procedures other than those authorized by the Secretary). The remanding court is vested with equity powers and \u201cmay adjust its relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 364-73, 59 S.Ct. 301-07, 83 L.Ed. 221, 229-30 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">While Congress has the authority to limit the equitable powers and discretion of the federal courts in order to implement important federal policy, such limitation will not be found in the absence of the clear legislative command. <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. at 705, 99 S.Ct. at 2559, 61 L.Ed.2d at 195; <em>Porter v. Warner Holding Co., </em>328 U.S. 395, 396-99, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 1088-89, 90 L.Ed. 1332, 1336-37 (1946). Ambiguities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>must be resolved in favor of that interpretation which affords a full opportunity for equity courts to exercise their traditional practices. <em>Hecht Co. v. Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 331, 64 S.Ct. 687, 692, 88 L.Ed. 754, 761 (1944). Congress must speak clearly to interfere with the historic equitable powers of the courts it has created. <em>Porter, </em>328 U.S. at 399, 66 S.Ct. at 1089, 90 L.Ed. at 1337. If Congress desired to make an abrupt departure from traditional equity practice, \u201cit would have made its desire plain.\u201d <em>Hecht Co., </em>321 U.S. at 331, 64 S.Ct. at 592, 88 L.Ed. at 761. The Secretary has not presented and we have not found any language in the Act or its legislative history which indicates that Congress intended to limit the equitable powers of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As previously noted, the Secretary failed to adhere to the orders we set forth in <em>Simpson v. Schweiker. </em>The district court order awarding retroactive benefits is an implicit recognition of the Secretary\u2019s effort to ignore our ruling in <em>Simpson. </em>The awarding of retroactive benefits plus the claimants\u2019 election to begin receiving interim benefits will place them in the same position they would have been had they not been improperly taken off the rolls. In <em>Simpson </em>we held that claimants could not be taken from the rolls until medical improvement was shown. Medical improvement has not been shown. Congress, aware of that ruling, did not limit or even mention the courts\u2019 power to so act. The law of this circuit is clear: a recipient of benefits may not be taken off the rolls until the Secretary shows medical improvement by substantial evidence. We hold that these claimants are entitled to benefits from date of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The Secretary\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s award violates principles of sovereign immunity is without merit. We hold that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) operates as a waiver of sovereign immunity by giving the federal courts the right to review and modify or reverse the Secretary\u2019s decisions. <em>See Wright v. Califano, </em>603 F.2d 666, 670 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 2999, 64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">In addition to these claimants, this opinion potentially affects only disability recipients terminated by the Secretary who had \u201cactions relating to medical improvement\u201d pending in federal courts of this circuit on September 19, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\">.
