The Tax Court held that neither item was deductible. We have jurisdiction, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-26\">The County of Fresno, California, employed Bobye G. Orvis during the first six months of 1978. As a condition of Mrs. Orvis\u2019 employment, the County required her to participate in a defined benefit retirement plan. The plan provided for employer and employee contributions in an amount sufficient to satisfy the total projected future liability for employee retirements. Upon termination of employment with the County after less than five years of service, an employee receives a refund of his contributions plus accrued interest (but does not receive any portion of the employer contributions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-27\">Mrs. Orvis terminated her employment with the County in June, 1978, and received a refund of her contributions to the plan plus interest. Because she had been employed by the County for less than five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>years, Mrs. Orvis forfeited her interest in the County\u2019s contribution and was no longer eligible for benefits. In September, 1978, Mrs. Orvis contributed $1,500 to an individual retirement account (\u201cIRA\u201d) and claimed a deduction for this amount on her and her husband\u2019s 1978 joint tax return. The Commissioner determined that the IRA contribution was not deductible, and the Tax Court affirmed. Mrs. Orvis appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code <em>de novo. See Dumdeang v. Commissioner, </em>739 F.2d 452, 453 (9th Cir.1984). Mrs. Orvis relies generally on I.R.C. \u00a7 219(a)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and specifically on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Foulkes v. Commissioner, </em>638 F.2d 1105 (7th Cir.1981) to support her position that the IRA contribution is deductible. In <em>Foulkes, </em>the Seventh Circuit held that section 219(a)(1) entitled the taxpayer to a deduction even though the taxpayer had been a member of a qualified retirement plan for a portion of the tax year. In so holding, the court determined that section 219(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code did not preclude deduction of the IRA contribution. That section provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-6\">(b) Limitations and Restrictions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC45\">(2) Covered by certain other plans</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avk-dedup-0\">No deduction is allowed under subsection (a) for an individual for the taxable year if for any part of such year\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5T\">(A) he was an active participant in\u2014 (i) a [qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus] plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-7\">The court in <em>Foulkes </em>found the term \u201cactive participant\u201d to be ambiguous and then examined the legislative history for guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 1109. The court reasoned that because the purpose behind section 219(b)(2)(A)(i) is to prevent the possibility of a double tax benefit through the taxpayer\u2019s participation in more than one retirement plan during the tax year, the term \u201cactive participant\u201d does not include the taxpayer who is no longer eligible for retirement benefits under a plan at the end of his tax year even though he contributed to the plan for a portion of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-13\">We believe that the <em>Foulkes </em>interpretation of section 219(b)(2)(A)(i) is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain meaning and the legislative history. Section 219(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code states that an IRA contribution is not deductible if the taxpayer is an active participant in a qualified plan <em>\u201cfor any part of such year. </em>\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 219(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). Mrs. Orvis was an active participant in a qualified plan for a part of 1978. The plain and unambiguous meaning of the Code dictates that her IRA contribution was not deductible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Hildebrand v. Commissioner, </em>683 F.2d 57, 59 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Johnson v. Commissioner, </em>661 F.2d 53, 55 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Orzechowski v. Commissioner, </em>592 F.2d 677, 678-79 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-14\">The legislative history of I.R.C. \u00a7 219 states that \u201c[a]n individual is to be considered an active participant in a plan if he is accruing benefits under the plan even if he only has forfeitable rights to those benefits.\u201d H.Rep. No. 93-807, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4639, 4794. Mrs. Orvis does not dispute that both she and the County contributed to the plan during the first six months of 1978. As a result, she accrued potential benefits under the plan during those months; the fact that these benefits were forfeitable is irrelevant. A taxpayer, like Mrs. Orvis, whose expected dollar val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>ue in retirement benefits increases because of her or her employer\u2019s contributions is an \u201cactive participant\u201d in a retirement plan for the purposes of section 219(b)(2)(A). <em>See Hildebrand, </em>683 F.2d at 58-59. We conclude that Mrs. Orvis was not entitled to deduct her 1978 IRA contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">Thomas V. Orvis was employed by Fresno County in 1978 as an assistant district attorney and was required to use his personal automobile in the course of his employment. Mr. Orvis was not aware that the County had a policy of fully reimbursing its employees for travel expenses, and did not seek reimbursement for these expenses during 1978. Mr. Orvis deducted $1,275 of travel expenses on his and his wife\u2019s 1978 joint tax return. The Commissioner denied the deduction, and the Tax Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Dumdeang, </em>739 F.2d at 453. Section 162 of the Code stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-7\">Trade or business expenses (a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-8\">There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-10\">(2) traveling expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1502-12\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-13\">Mr. Orvis does not dispute that he could have received reimbursement from the County for his automobile expenses had he requested it. Numerous courts have held that an expense is not \u201cnecessary\u201d under \u00a7 162(a) when an employee fails to claim reimbursement for the expenses, incurred in the course of his employment, when entitled to do so. <em>See, e.g., Coplon v. Commissioner, </em>277 F.2d 534, 535 (6th Cir.1960); <em>Heidi v. Commissioner, </em>274 F.2d 25, 28 (7th Cir.1959); <em>Stolk v. Commissioner, </em>40 T.C. 345, 356 (1963), <em>aff'd, </em>326 F.2d 760 (2d Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-15\">We agree with the reasoning of these courts. A bright line rule prohibiting deductions for reimbursable expenses avoids the difficult inquiry into the taxpayer\u2019s knowledge, and gives the taxpayer an incentive to determine which expenses are reimbursable. The rule also forecloses an avenue for tax manipulation by preventing the taxpayer from converting a business expense of his company into one of his own simply by failing to seek reimbursement. <em>See Coplon, </em>277 F.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-16\">The decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1500-18\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-9041 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) (hereinafter cited as I.R.C.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1501-8\">.
