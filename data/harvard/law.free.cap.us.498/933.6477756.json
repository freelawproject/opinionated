S. 989.]</seealso>\n<author id=\"b900-5\">Justice Blackmun.</author>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">It seems to me that some aspects of the fees and expenses now requested by the Special Master come close \u2014 if they do not exceed \u2014 the limits of allowability. See the dissents in <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>466 U. S. 921 and 923 (1984), and <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>475 U. S. 1004 (1986). As was there pointed out, fees and expenses charged by a Special Master, when allowed by this Court, represent our assurance to the parties that the charges are reasonable and proper. A party\u2019s consent to the allowance of fees and expenses does not absolve this Court of its duty to make that determination. With a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the Court\u2019s present order allowing fees and expenses that appear to be escalating in this case as to both amounts and personnel, inasmuch as no party has noted an objection on this particular occasion, I do not yet formally dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
