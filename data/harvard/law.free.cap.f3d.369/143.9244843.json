Pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 5K2.1, the court upwardly departed and sentenced Dos Reis to consecutive terms of 120 and 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, representing the statutory maximum on both counts, for a total term of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">On appeal, Dos Reis argues that: (1) the district court erred in departing upwardly and sentencing him to the statutory maximum on Count I based on conduct alleged in Count II; and (2) the extent of the departure impermissibly double-counted the victim\u2019s age, and, alternatively, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">We conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by upwardly departing and imposing the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mum on Count I. Because we review this challenge only for plain error, we address, but do not resolve, the unsettled issue of whether \u201ctotal punishment\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (which allows consecutive sentencing in multiple count cases) includes an upward departure based on conduct relating to only one count of conviction. Although Dos Reis\u2019s sentence is more than triple the upper limit of the Guidelines\u2019 range of 87 months, we hold that the district court did not double count and that the extent of the departure was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Thus, we affirm the sentence in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In 1998, Dos Reis \u201cmet\u201d 15-year-old \u201cJane Doe\u201d in an Internet chat room. Dos Reis wrote that he was 19, when in fact he was 20. After several weeks of communication, Dos Reis traveled from his workplace in Portchester, New York, to Jane Doe\u2019s home in Prospect, Connecticut, where they engaged in consensual sexual intercourse. After this encounter, they met twice more to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In 2002, Dos Reis met \u201cChristina\u201d over the Internet in a similar fashion. Christina was 13 years and 2 months old, but she said she was 14. Dos Reis was now 24 years old and married, yet he told Christina that he was 19. Within one week of meeting over the Internet, they met in person at a shopping mall in Dan-bury, Connecticut, and rented a motel room, where they engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">When they met again at the mall the following week, Dos Reis drove Christina to a nearby parking lot where they engaged in sexual intercourse in his car. Christina died during intercourse. Forensic analysis showed ligature marks on her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">At sentencing, Dos Reis claimed that Christina asked to be strangled, ostensibly to create an asphyxia \u201chigh.\u201d In his sentencing memorandum, Dos Reis claimed that Christina herself tied a seatbelt around her neck and asked him to tighten it to produce the desired effect. Finding that the seatbelt hurt and worried that it might leave a mark, she then \u201cshowed him how to grip her neck and how to squeeze and loosen his grip.\u201d Dos Reis proceeded to use his hands on her neck to create the supposedly desired asphyxia. When Christina appeared to be in trouble, Dos Reis asserts that he thought she was kidding around. Christina, however, soon became unresponsive. Dos Reis unsuccessfully attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, tasting blood in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The events following her death are undisputed. Dos Reis left Christina\u2019s body in a stream and discarded her personal belongings in a gas station dumpster. The next day, in an effort to concoct an alibi, Dos Reis sent a self-serving e-mail to Christina, asking her about a date that she supposedly had with another man the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Dos Reis was charged in both state and federal court for the crimes associated with Christina\u2019s death as well as his sexual encounters with Jane Doe. In state court, Dos Reis pled guilty to statutory rape and entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to a charge of manslaughter in connection with the crimes he committed against Christina. A year later, Dos Reis was sentenced in the Connecticut Superior Court to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>In federal court, Dos Reis pled guilty to two counts of interstate travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2428(b). Count I alleged his sexual abuse of Jane Doe in 1998; Count II concerned his sexual abuse of Christina in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) separated the two counts into two groups under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 8D1.2 because they involved separate victims. The offense level for each group was determined to be 28 predicated on: (1) a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(a)(l); plus (2) an additional 2 levels for misrepresentation of identity; and (3) an additional 2 levels for using the Internet. Next, the combined adjusted offense level was set at 30 based on: (1) calculating 2 units from separating the 2 groups; and (2) adding 2 levels to the group with the highest offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. From a combined adjusted offense level of 30, the PSR recommended a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, the single, combined offense level totaled 27, resulting in a sentencing range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Prior to his federal sentencing, the Government sought: (1) a denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility; (2) an upward criminal history departure; and (3) an upward offense level departure based on Christina\u2019s death. Dos Reis, in turn, requested an offense level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, and he opposed both of the Government\u2019s motions for upward departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">At sentencing, the court granted a three-level reduction for Dos Reis\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and adopted the PSR\u2019s suggested combined offense level of 27 and sentencing range of 70-87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1, the court also granted the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure based on Christina\u2019s death. The court found that Dos Reis \u201cknowingly risked Christina\u2019s death\u201d because \u201c[strangling ... is [an] inherently dangerous activity.\u201d Noting that it would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d for Dos Reis not to know that he was \u201crisking either death or serious physical harm to Christina at the time that he applied that pressure\u201d to her neck, the court stated that \u201c[wjhether or not, therefore, it was ... \u2018an accident\u2019 doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The court then analogized the crime to felony murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, concluding that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no dispute whatsoever that the death occurred during the commission of the offense at issue, that is sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">In considering the extent of the departure, the court reasoned that Christina\u2019s young age \u201cnot only makes the conduct more reprehensible but also ... increases the risk of death or serious harm from the conduct of choking or applying pressure to the neck.\u201d The court also noted that Dos Reis\u2019s disposal of the body and fabrication of an alibi were \u201cfactors that suggest a serious offense and suggest a more severe increase under the violations of 5K2.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The court upwardly departed to offense level 43 \u2014 corresponding to the offense level of felony murder under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1 \u2014 which would have warranted a term of life imprisonment. However, the court noted that it was not permissible \u201cto depart that far because the statutory maximum\u201d for the offenses limited the extent of departure to 25 years. Citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, which governs sentences imposed in cases involving multiple counts, the court imposed consecutive sentences of 120 and 180 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts I and II, respectively, the statutory maximum on each count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In its written judgment, the court did not list any factors in support of its upward departure. Upon motion by the Government, however, the court amended its judgment and listed the following reasons: (1) the offense level substantially understated the seriousness of the crime; (2) Christina\u2019s death was knowingly risked and merited a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d under \u00a7 5K2.1; and (3) Dos Reis\u2019s conduct was analogous to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Dos Reis does not contest the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1. He does, however, challenge the procedure used to calculate the total sentence and the magnitude of the upward departure. Dos Reis argues that: (1) the district court erred in departing upwardly and in sentencing him to the statutory maximum on Count I based on conduct occurring in connection with Count II; and (2) the extent of the departure impermissibly double-counted the victim\u2019s age, and, alternatively, was unreasonable. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">I. <em>Statutory Maximum Sentence on Count I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The district court upwardly departed on Count I (involving Jane Doe) from the combined Guidelines sentencing range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment based on Christina\u2019s death, as alleged in Count II. To come as close as possible to a sentence of life imprisonment \u2014 the punishment prescribed by the upward departure to offense level 43 \u2014 the district court imposed consecutive, statutory maximum sentences on both counts. Dos Reis now, for the first time, claims that the imposition of the statutory maximum on Count I was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Because Dos Reis did not object to his sentence on this ground below, we review his claim for plain error pursuant to Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 666 (2d Cir.2001). To obtain relief under Rule 52(b), Dos Reis must show among other things \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s][his] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">In a case, such as this, involving multiple counts of conviction, Chapter Three, Part D of the Guidelines \u201cprovides rules for determining a single offense level that encompasses all the counts of which the defendant is convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. D, intro, comment. It is only from this single offense level that the final sentence is calculated \u201cin accordance with the provisions of Chapter Five.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Chapter Five, Part G of the Guidelines, in turn, provides the rules for implementing the total sentence. Section 5G1.2(d), governing sentencing on multiple counts of conviction, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the <em>total punishment, </em>then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>352 F.3d 65, 71 (2d Cir.2003). The critical issue in this case \u25a0 is whether \u201ctotal punishment\u201d includes an upward departure based on conduct relating to only one of the two counts of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Dos Reis contends that the district court could not impose the statutory maximum sentence on Count I (Jane Doe) based on conduct from Count II (Christina). This argument, however, conflates the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d issue with the calculation of the underlying upward departure. Dos Reis misapprehends the way in which the district court calculated the upward departure. Contrary to his belief, the departure here was not calculated on a count-by-count basis. Instead, the district court adopted the PSR, which properly: (1) divided the counts into separate groups; (2) calculated the adjusted offense level for each count; (3) determined the combined adjusted offense level; and (4) arrived at the final combined offense level of 27. From this combined offense level, the court properly departed to offense level 43 without regard to the count on which the departure was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The decisive issue concerns what occurred next. Offense level 43 corresponds to life imprisonment, which is far beyond the statutory maximum of both counts. Applying \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the district court imposed consecutive, statutory maximum sentences of 120 and 180 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts I and II, respectively, to sentence Dos Reis as close as possible to the punishment prescribed by the upward departure. This raises the question whether the upward departure should be factored into the calculation of \u201ctotal punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The labyrinthian complexity of chapters three and five of the Guidelines is scarcely mitigated by the murky case law on the subject. The Guidelines\u2019 concept of \u201ctotal punishment\u201d is not well-defined. Although we have described \u201ctotal punishment\u201d as the \u201cpunishment determined after all relevant Guidelines\u2019 calculations have been made,\u201d <em>United States v. McLeod, </em>251 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir.2001) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b)), we have never expressly held that upward departures are factored into the calculation of \u201ctotal punishment.\u201d Other circuits, are split on this issue. <em>Compare United States v. Evans, </em>314 F.3d 329, 332 n. 1 (8th Cir.2002) (concluding that \u201c \u2018total punishment\u2019 ... includes a lawful upward departure\u201d), <em>and United States v. Hernandez Coplin, </em>24 F.3d 312, 320 n. 9 (1st Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he total punishment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl:2.is normally determined by the guideline range, but where the sentencing court lawfully departs from the guideline range, the total punishment is the punishment specified as a result of that departure .... \u201d (internal quotations and citation omitted) (alteration in original)), <em>and Kikumura v. United States, </em>978 F.Supp. 563, 582 (D.N.J.1997) (citing case law supporting the proposition that \u201ctotal punishment\u201d includes upward departures), <em>with United States v. Martinez, </em>274 F.3d 897, 904 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe text and structure of the guidelines leads us to conclude that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2\u2019s \u2018total punishment\u2019 calculation excludes departures.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The closest case on point in this Circuit is <em>United States v. Hui, </em>83 F.3d 592 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam), which implicitly recognized that \u201ctotal punishment\u201d may include at least some upward departures. <em>Id. </em>at 594 (affirming an upward departure and noting that it was \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d under \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to \u201cimpose the statutory maximum on each count, and to use a consecutive-term sentence as the starting point for a downward departure .... \u201d). But even if we concede that \u201ctotal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>punishment\u201d includes upward departures, it is not clear that the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d in this case would include an upward departure on Count I based on conduct relating solely to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Unlike in our case, the upward departure in <em>Hui </em>was premised on conduct related to <em>both </em>counts of conviction. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that the upward departure was not unreasonable as to both the manslaughter and alien-smuggling counts). Here, the upward departure on both counts was based solely on Christina\u2019s death, which derived from Count II and which occurred over four years after the incidents in Count I, which involved another victim. Even if we were to read <em>Hui </em>to hold that \u201ctotal punishment\u201d includes upward departures, the case at bar is distinguishable and merits more refined analysis. <em>See id. </em>(upward departure for the death of 10 illegal aliens attempting to swim ashore after the intentional grounding of a ship was directly related to manslaughter and alien-smuggling counts). We leave this question to another day on another record because, if error there was, it certainly was not \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Thomas, </em>274 F.3d at 667 (\u201cAn error is \u2018plain\u2019 if it is \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Dos Reis also maintains that the district court failed to state any reasons for its departure. We disagree. Section 3553(c) requires a district court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d and, if the court departs from the Guideline range, to include in its written order of judgment the specific reasons for a departure. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). A review of the sentencing hearing transcript and written amended judgment compels the conclusion that the court met this standard. In any event, because the departure was permissible for the reasons stated by the district court at sentencing, we would not remand for lack of specificity in the written judgment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f)(3); <em>see United States v. Orchard, </em>332 F.3d 1133, 1141 n. 7 (8th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] remand is not required if the reviewing court determines that the departure was not impermissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">II. <em>The Extent of the Upward Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Dos Reis challenges the extent of the departure on two grounds: (1) the departure impermissibly double-counted the victim\u2019s age; and (2) the imposition of consecutive statutory maximum prison terms was unreasonable. We uphold the extent of the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">A. <em>Double-Counting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Dos Reis contends that the district court improperly double-counted the victim\u2019s age as a factor in considering the extent of the upward departure based on Christina\u2019s death under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1. Because this objection was not raised below, it is reviewed for \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>see Thomas, </em>274 F.3d at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The Guidelines permit upward departures for \u201can aggravating ... circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1). \u201cThus, where the particular factor has already been considered in setting the base level, counting the factor again in making a departure violates \u00a7 3553(b) unless the factor is present in a degree which the Commission did not consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>967 F.2d 20, 24 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The defendant bears the burden of establishing that the departure was based, at least in part, upon a factor that the Commission had already considered in setting the sentencing range. <em>Williams v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). If he meets this burden, \u201ca remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless ....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Dos Reis\u2019s sentencing range was calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2: \u201cCriminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape).\u201d As the title indicates, the victim\u2019s age was one of the factors explicitly considered by the Sentencing Commission in establishing this provision. Thus, if the district court\u2019s upward departure was also premised in part on Christina\u2019s age, Dos Reis will have met his initial burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Notwithstanding several references to Christina\u2019s age, we conclude that there was no double-counting. The district court stated: \u201cThe age here not only makes the conduct more reprehensible but also, I believe, increases the risk of death or serious harm from the conduct of choking or applying pressure to the neck.\u201d Although the first clause suggests double-counting, the crux of the reference to age is the second clause, which states that the victim\u2019s young age made the risk of death more foreseeable. Because the degree to which death was \u201cknowingly risked\u201d is a factor g-uiding the extent of departure, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1, the court properly used the victim\u2019s age \u2014 -and implied physical vulnerabilities \u2014 as evidence of Dos Reis\u2019s knowledge of the risk of death or serious injury. <em>Cf. United States v. Castellanos, </em>355 F.3d 56, 60 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] district court may base two aspects of a Guidelines calculation on a single act where they serve different purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the court double-counted, we find that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 61 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cWhen a sentencing court relies on a combination of permissible and impermissible factors to justify a departure, the sentence will be affirmed if an appellate court determines the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent reliance on the impermissible factors.\u201d). Because the upward departure was primarily based on Dos Reis\u2019s knowledge of the risk of death or serious physical harm and the court\u2019s analogy to felony murder, we conclude that the district court would have imposed the same departure even without reference to Christina\u2019s age. Accordingly, we do not find any error, let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">B. <em>Reasonableness of the Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Alternatively, Dos Reis argues that the more than three-fold departure from the maximum sentence prescribed by his sentencing range was unreasonable because the victim\u2019s death was an accident and his conduct was \u201cmore akin to manslaughter, not murder.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the upward departure from a range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment to a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment was not unreasonable on the appalling facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In reviewing the extent of the upward departure, this Court examines whether the \u201csentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range,\u201d 18 U.S.C.- \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(C), and \u201cgive[s] due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Barresi, </em>361 F.3d 666, 671 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In determining whether the extent of the departure is reasonable, the Supreme Court has instructed appellate courts to consider \u201cthe amount and extent of the departure in light of the grounds for departing\u201d and \u201cto examine the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence under the Guidelines, as well as the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>court\u2019s stated reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203-04, 112 S.Ct. 1112. The determinative question is whether the \u201creasons given by the district court ... are sufficient to justify the magnitude of the departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 112 S.Ct. 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Authorization for the court\u2019s departure stems from \u00a7 2A3.2 and \u00a7 5K2.1 of the Guidelines. Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2A3.2, the relevant offense level guideline in this case, indicates that an upward departure may be warranted where the \u201coffense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, comment. (n.7). Policy statement 5K2.1 provides that a court may upwardly depart from the sentencing range if death results from the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1, p.s. However, \u201c[l]oss of life does not automatically suggest a sentence at or near the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When deciding the magnitude of the departure, a court should consider: (1) \u201cthe dangerousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which death or serious injury was intended or knowingly risked\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe extent to which the offense level for the offense of conviction ... already reflects the risk of personal injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The district court based its 213-month upward departure on: (1) the victim\u2019s young age, which, <em>inter alia, </em>made the likelihood of death from choking more foreseeable; (2) Dos Reis\u2019s knowledge of the risk of death or serious physical harm based on his conduct; (3) the disposal of Christina\u2019s body in a stream; (4) the creation of a false alibi after the crime; and (5) an analogy to federal felony murder, which carries an offense level of 43, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1, corresponding to life imprisonment, <em>id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Departing to the statutory maximum on both counts was not unreasonable on this record. The critical factor was Dos Reis\u2019s knowledge of the risk of death from squeezing Christina\u2019s neck. This knowledge, according to \u00a7 5K2.1, merits a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d above the sentencing range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1. Moreover, the court could also have reasonably found that the offense level applicable here, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, did not reflect the risk of personal injury because it generally applies to consensual sexual acts. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, comment, (backg\u2019d.); <em>cf. id. </em>\u00a7 2A3.1, comment, (backg\u2019d.) (\u201cSexual offenses addressed in this section are crimes of violence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The district court, moreover, cannot be faulted for analogizing the tragedy of Christina\u2019s death to federal felony murder. <em>See United States v. Fan, </em>36 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cReference to an analogous statute is a well-established method to determine the magnitude of an upward departure.\u201d). Federal felony murder constitutes first-degree murder, which includes any murder \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate ... aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>34 F.3d 44, 48-49 (2d Cir.1994) (recognizing that the intent to commit the underlying felony satisfies the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d requirement of first-degree murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">This Court has often affirmed upward departures that more than triple the upper-limit of the sentencing range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fei, </em>225 F.3d 167, 170-72 (2d Cir.2000) (affirming departure from 33-month upper-limit of the sentencing range to 120 months); <em>Hui, </em>83 F.3d at 594 (affirming a departure, based in part on \u00a7 5K2.1, from the range of 27-33 months up to 180 months, where illegal alien smuggling operation led to death of ten people); <em>United States v. Rivalta, </em>925 F.2d 596, 599 (2d Cir.1991) (affirming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u00a7 5K2.1 departure from approximately two to twenty years).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In sum, we defer to the district court\u2019s well-reasoned findings and departure to the statutory maximum. Whether or not the death was an accident, the court correctly found that \u201c[i]t is impossible ... for Dos Reis to not understand, that he did not know that he was risking either death or serious physical harm to Christina at the time that he applied that pressure\u201d to her fragile neck. Moreover, dumping her body in a stream and sending her a self-serving e-mail the day after her death to establish an alibi axe additional grounds to support the severe departure. <em>See United States v. Cordoba-Murgas, </em>233 F.3d 704, 710 (2d Cir.2000) (noting that the factors guiding departure are not exhaustive and are left to the court\u2019s discretion). Accordingly, the extent of the upward departure was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we Affirm the sentence entered by the district court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">. The 120- and 180-month consecutive sentences imposed on Counts I and II, respec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tively, result from the application of different versions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b). The 1998 version, applicable to Count I, carries a 120-month statutory maximum; the 2002 version, applicable to Count II, has a 180-month statutory maximum. Moreover, the district court directed that Count I was to be served consecutively to the state sentence, and that Count II was to be served concurrently with the state sentence. Therefore, Dos Reis\u2019s combined federal and state term of imprisonment is 40 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
