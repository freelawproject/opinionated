The employees were allowed to use these so-called \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles to travel from home to work and back \u2014 i.e., to commute to work. Section 209-a (1) (d) makes it an improper practice for a public employer to refuse to negotiate in good faith with the bargaining agent for its public employees. Many of the employees who lost \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles belonged to blue- or white-collar collective bargaining units represented by Local 237-International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Local 237).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that PERB reasonably applied precedent when making its determination, which is supported by substantial evidence; however, PERB\u2019s remedial order is unreasonable insofar as it requires the Town to restore vehicle assignments to the affected employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">On December 13, 1968, the Town enacted Local Law No. 4, which established a code of ethics and financial disclosure rules within the Town Code. Section 14-12, entitled \u201cUse of town-owned equipment or property\u201d states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201c[n]o officer or employee shall request or permit the use of Town-owned vehicles, equipment, material or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as municipal policy for the use of such officer or employee in the conduct of official business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Effective September 15, 1990, the Town revised its Administrative Procedure Manual on the subject of \u201cTown Vehicle Usage and Reporting of Accidents\u201d to \u201cspecify guidelines for the usage of [Town] vehicles and to provide instructions for the proper reporting of accidents\u201d (hereafter, the 1990 guidelines). Section 2 of the 1990 guidelines, captioned \u201cAssignment of Vehicles\u201d states in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201ca. Permanent Assignment. Certain Town employees by nature of their positions are required to be on call twenty-four hours a day, and those employees will be assigned the use of a Town car. Only those employees who have written authorization from the Supervisor will be granted this privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cb. Temporary Assignment. Other Town vehicles may be made available to Department personnel for official use if requested by the Department Head and approved by the Supervisor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Section 3 (a) specifies that \u201c[pjersonal or other unauthorized use of a Town vehicle is strictly forbidden, and any violation of this regulation will result in disciplinary action against the violator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Based on a combination of job title and seniority, though, certain employees who used town-owned vehicles to carry out their official duties were permanently assigned these cars, which they were permitted to drive to and from work, even though their jobs did not require them to be on call when off-duty. Additionally, successive Town Supervisors seem to have neglected to give written approval for any of these assignments, which were made by department heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">All employees with \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles were directed to keep a mileage log and not to use these cars for personal errands; they were issued a card and key for access to the Town\u2019s gasoline pumps, and the Town\u2019s fleet management division carried out repairs and maintenance. The Town\u2019s payroll office deducted $3 a day from their paychecks to reflect the estimated value, for tax purposes, of the provision of employer-owned cars for travel to and from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In September 2007, Local 237 and the Town began negotiations over the terms of successor contracts to the 2005-2007 collective bargaining agreements for the blue- and white-collar units. In October 2007, the Town proposed the topic of \u201ctake home\u201d vehicle use as a subject of bargaining in both units.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Town withdrew these proposals in December 2007, the month the existing agreements expired. In February 2008, an impasse was declared and a mediator was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Meanwhile, the Town Board of Supervisors (the Town Board) on April 29, 2008 adopted a resolution endorsing a fleet/vehicle policy to be put in place in three phases. The resolution\u2019s \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses recited that the Town Board was taking this action in order to lower fuel and maintenance costs, reduce the number of \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles and encourage the use of pooled vehicles;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that \u201cin implementing such a policy[,] the Town Board re-affirms the principle set out in \u00a7 14-12 of the Town Code, and set forth in the Town Administrative Procedure Manual [i.e., the 1990 guidelines] that \u2018Personal or other unauthorized use of a Town vehicle is strictly prohibited.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Under the new policy, which was attached to the resolution, only three categories of employees were to be assigned \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles: specified elected officials, 24/7 responders,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and employees with multi-work site jobs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All other employees were instructed to use the pool vehicles available at the locations where they reported to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">By letter dated June 6, 2008, three days before the 2008 fleet/ vehicle policy went into effect, the Town\u2019s Director of Labor Relations and Personnel informed Local 237\u2019s top executive that on account of a \u201crevision\u201d of existing policy, approximately 45 of the union\u2019s members would be \u201cshifted from taking a Town vehicle home to utilization of a pool vehicle located at their reporting location[s].\u201d The shift came about because these employees were not elected officials, 24/7 responders or workers who reported to multiple work sites, as required to qualify for a \u201ctake home\u201d car under the new policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>By letter dated June 9, 2008, the union\u2019s attorney responded that \u201cemployee use of Town-owned vehicles for personal purposes (driving to and from work) is an economic benefit and therefore, a mandatory subject of bargaining.\u201d On b\u00e9half of Local 237, he demanded that the Town retract any orders that unit members turn in the keys to assigned vehicles, pending negotiations over the Town\u2019s decision and its impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">On June 23, 2008, Local 237 filed an improper practice charge with PERB. The charge, as later amended, claimed that the Town violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (a) and (d) by unilaterally adopting the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy and thereby eliminating the ability of certain union employees to continue to use town-owned vehicles to commute to work. The union also alleged that the Town had adopted the new policy in order to undermine the stalled contract negotiations, thus engaging in bad-faith bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">After an evidentiary hearing on July 1, 2009, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a decision dated March 1, 2010, in which she found that the union had carried its burden of demonstrating a clear and unequivocal 20-plus-year practice with respect to determining which employees/job titles were eligible for \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles, thus creating a reasonable expectation among union members that the same practice would continue (43 PERB \u00b6 4514 [2010]). She ruled that the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy was not \u201ca mere modification or clarification of [this] existing vehicle policy,\u201d as the Town asserted, but rather manifested a change in practice; and that the Town did not retain any management right to alter its position on the use of \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles unilaterally, based on the provisions of section 14-12 of the Town Code and the 1990 guidelines, as the Town argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Additionally, the ALJ concluded that Local 237 had failed to prove that the Town refused to bargain the impact of the change; or engaged in bad-faith bargaining by withdrawing the October 2007 \u201ctake home\u201d vehicle use proposals and essentially implementing them the following June; or violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the charge of bad-faith bargaining, the ALJ credited the testimony of the Town\u2019s Director of Labor Relations and Personnel, supported by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>contemporaneous notes, that he withdrew the \u201ctake home\u201d vehicle use proposals in an honest, if mistaken, belief that the proposed change in policy was a management right in light of section 14-12 of the Town Code and the 1990 guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Accordingly, the ALJ held that the Town had violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (d) by canceling \u201ctake home\u201d vehicle assignments without negotiation, and dismissed the union\u2019s other claims. She ordered the Town to \u201crestore the vehicle assignments for commutation between home and work to those unit members who enjoyed the benefit prior to April 4, 2008\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to \u201cmake whole unit employees for the extra expenses incurred as a result of the unilateral withdrawal of the 24/7 vehicle assignment(s), if any, together with interest at the maximum legal rate\u201d; and to sign and post a notice in the workplace to inform employees of the remedies ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In a decision and order dated May 27, 2011, PERB denied the Town\u2019s exceptions and Local 237\u2019s cross-exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision and order, which PERB affirmed, essentially on the basis of the ALJ\u2019s reasoning (44 PERB \u00b6 3014 [2011]). By petition filed in Supreme Court on June 29, 2011, the Town then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul PERB\u2019s decision and order insofar as the Town was found to have violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (d) by issuing the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy, and to dismiss the improper practice charge. PERB cross-petitioned to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Upon transfer from Supreme Court pursuant to CPLR 7804 (g), the Appellate Division confirmed PERB\u2019s determination, denied the petition, dismissed the proceeding, granted PERB\u2019s cross petition and remitted the matter to Supreme Court for issuance of an order compelling compliance with its decision and judgment (104 AD3d 778 [2d Dept 2013]). The court held that substantial evidence supported PERB\u2019s determination that the permanent assignment of town-owned vehicles to the affected employees constituted a past practice as to a term or condition of employment, a mandatory subject of negotiation, which the Public Employees\u2019 Fair Employment Act (Civil Service Law art 14), known as the Taylor Law, barred the Town from unilaterally discontinuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The Appellate Division rejected the Town\u2019s argument that because \u201cits Ethics Code [specifically, section 14-12 of the Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Code] [forbade] the use of Town vehicles in violation of Town policy, the Town could not be forced to engage in collective bargaining over the issue,\u201d explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201c[t]he Town government was responsible for administering the Ethics Code [i.e., section 14-12 of the Town Code] and for managing its vehicle fleet. Yet, as substantial evidence in the record establishes, the Town frequently and openly ignored that Code and its policy for managing its vehicle fleet, only to contend later that the Code allowed it to act unilaterally in taking the vehicles away from the employees who had been permanently provided with them. The PERB was not required to give more effect to the Town Ethics Code than the Town itself gave to it. Second, for similar reasons, it cannot be said as a matter of law that it is unreasonable for employees to rely on the administering authority\u2019s interpretation and implementation of its policy and Ethics Code. Consequently, the PERB\u2019s determination was not affected by an error of law, arbitrary and capricious, or an abuse of discretion\u201d (104 AD3d at 781-782).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The Town subsequently moved for leave to appeal, which we granted on June 27, 2013 (21 NY3d 861 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The Taylor Law requires all public employers and employee organizations to negotiate in good faith to determine represented employees\u2019 terms and conditions of employment (Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a7 201 [4]; 203, 204). PERB has long held that employee use of an employer-owned vehicle for transportation to and from work is an economic benefit and a mandatorily negotiable term and condition of employment; therefore, a public employer may not unilaterally discontinue a past practice of providing its employees with this benefit <em>(see e.g. Matter of County of Nassau, </em>13 PERB \u00b6 3095 [1980], <em>determination confirmed sub nom. Matter of County of Nassau v Public Empl. Relations Bd. of State of N.Y., </em>14 PERB \u00b6 7017 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1981] [upholding PERB\u2019s determination that Nassau County committed an improper practice by ceasing to provide county-owned vehicles on a 24-hour basis to certain employees in its Department of Public Works], <em>affd </em>87 AD2d 1006 [2d Dept 1982], <em>lv denied </em>57 NY2d 601 [1982]; <em>Matter of County of Onondaga, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>12 PERB \u00b6 3035 [1979], <em>determination confirmed sub nom. Matter of County of Onondaga v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>77 AD2d 783, 783-784 [4th Dept 1980] [in a case where Onondaga County stopped allowing 24-hour use of county-owned cars by employees in the Division of Sanitation of the Department of Health, the court noted that \u201cPERB\u2019s determination that employee use of an employer-owned car for personal purposes is an economic benefit and a term and condition of employment which cannot be unilaterally withdrawn is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence\u201d]). To be binding, a past practice must be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201c \u2018unequivocal and . . . continued uninterrupted for a period of time sufficient under the circumstances to create a reasonable expectation among the affected [bargaining] unit employees that the [practice] would continue.\u2019 Further, \u2018the expectation of the continuation of the practice is something that may be presumed from its duration with consideration of the specific circumstances under which the practice has existed\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Chenango Forks Cent. Sch. Dist. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>21 NY3d 255, 263 [2013], quoting <em>Matter of County of Nassau, </em>24 PERB \u00b6 3029, 3058 [1991]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Our scope of review in this case is limited to whether PERB\u2019s determination that the Town engaged in an improper practice was \u201caffected by an error of law\u201d or was \u201carbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion\u201d (CPLR 7803 [3]). \u201cPERB is accorded deference in matters falling within its area of expertise\u201d such as \u201ccases involving the issue of mandatory or prohibited bargaining subjects\u201d <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>75 NY2d 660, 666 [1990] [citation omitted]). Additionally, an administrative determination made after a hearing required by law, such as PERB\u2019s determination here, must be supported by substantial evidence <em>(see Matter of Jennings v New York State Off. of Mental Health, </em>90 NY2d 227, 239 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The Town urges that PERB\u2019s determination of improper practice was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and not supported by substantial evidence for two related reasons: first, that an illegal practice cannot ripen into a binding past practice because employees may not reasonably expect illegal activity to continue indefinitely; and second, that it adopted the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy to conform its practice for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>permanently assigning \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles with section 14-12 of the Town Code, and an employer has no duty to negotiate with a union before discontinuing a past practice that is illegal under local law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Town, then, cannot succeed on this appeal unless its past practice contravened section 14-12 because commuting to work constitutes the \u201cuse of Town-owned vehicles . . . for personal convenience or profit,\u201d which that provision forbids.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Section 14-12 does not define \u201cpersonal convenience or profit.\u201d The record shows, however, that the Town has never interpreted this phrase to encompass commuting to work by employees eligible for \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles on account of their work duties and seniority. This is reasonable. After all, there is nothing inherently improper or unethical, much less illegal, about employer-sponsored commutation benefits. Moreover, the Town\u2019s interpretation did not change in 2008. The 2008 fleet/ vehicle policy simply reduced the categories and therefore the number of town employees who qualified to be permanently assigned \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles. Indeed, if the Town and the dissent are correct that any use of an assigned town-owned car to travel back and forth to work amounts to an illegal \u201cuse of Town-owned vehicles . . . for personal convenience or profit,\u201d then the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy perpetuated rather than cured the illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In sum, the Town asks us to rule in its favor on the ground that a public employer does not violate section 209-a (1) (d) of the Taylor Law when it unilaterally discontinues a past practice with respect to a term and condition of employment that is illegal under local law. Whatever the merits of the Town\u2019s position, we do not reach and need not consider them because the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>vant past practice was not, in fact, illegal under the local law. Accordingly, PERB reasonably applied its precedent to determine that the Town engaged in an improper practice when it unilaterally discontinued the permanent assignment of \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles to employees who enjoyed this benefit before the Town adopted and implemented the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy, and PERB\u2019s determination was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We review the remedies imposed by PERB with deference to its expertise <em>(see Matter of City of Albany v Helsby, </em>29 NY2d 433, 439 [1972]). Thus \u201ca remedy fashioned by PERB for an improper practice should be upheld if reasonable,\u201d although \u201c[i]t is for the courts to examine the reasonable application of PERB\u2019s remedies\u201d <em>(Matter of Manhasset Union Free School Dist. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>61 AD3d 1231, 1234-1235 [3d Dept 2009] [citations and internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 213 [d]). Here, PERB\u2019s remedial order requires the Town to \u201c[f]orthwith restore the vehicle assignments for commutation between home and work to those unit members who enjoyed the benefit prior to April 4, 2008.\u201d A PERB injunction was not sought to preserve the status quo ante, and the Town sold some or all of the cars formerly permanently assigned to blue- and white-collar unit employees. Forcing the Town to invest significant taxpayer dollars to replace these vehicles is unduly burdensome under the circumstances, and does not further the goal of reaching a fair negotiated result <em>(cf. Matter of Manhasset Union Free School Dist., </em>61 AD3d at 1235 [enforcement of a PERB order for the school district to restore the personnel and facilities of its former transportation department was unreasonable where the district had sold its buses and leased its garage, and compliance with the order might require taxpayer approval]). We therefore remit so that PERB may fashion a remedy that grants commensurate, practical relief to the employees subject to the improper practice without requiring the Town to purchase a whole new fleet of vehicles with an uncertain future.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by remitting thereto with directions to remand to PERB for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\">. Local 237 was decertified as the labor representative for the blue-collar and white-collar units in September 2010 and September 2013, respectively. The United Public Service Employees Union replaced Local 237 as the certified labor representative for both units. As used in this opinion, then, \u201cLocal 237\u201d refers specifically to Local 237-International Brotherhood of Teamsters, while \u201cunion\u201d may refer to either Local 237 or the United Public Service Employees Union, depending on chronology.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">.

As of April 2008, the Town owned 648 vehicles and employed 944 workers; 155 of the 648 vehicles, or just under one-quarter, were \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"><em>. </em>24/7 responders were defined as employees who held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cjobs which require[d them] to be available twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week to respond to an emergency/crisis throughout the Town of Islip at any number of locations.

With respect to multi-work site jobs, the policy stated that \u201c[w]hen a job requires the employee to report to various work sites at the beginning of each day and where reporting to a central work-site/dispatch area to be assigned a Town vehicle would be unproductive and time[-]consuming, then those job functions/individuals may be assigned a vehicle on a permanent basis and permitted to take a Town vehicle home.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (a) makes it an improper practice for an employer deliberately to \u201cinterfere with, restrain or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights [to join, form and participate in a union] for the purpose of depriving them of such rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">.

The Town now also contends, alternatively, that Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (4) (i), which states that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be deemed to eliminate or diminish any right that may exist pursuant to any other law,\u201d exempts the Town\u2019s enforcement of section 14-12 from mandatory negotiations under the Taylor Law. We do not consider this argument, which was not presented to the ALJ and is therefore not preserved for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">. The Town no longer seems to rely on the 1990 guidelines except to the extent that, consistent with section 14-12, they state that \u201cPersonal or other unauthorized use of a Town vehicle is strictly prohibited.\u201d In any event, guidelines, by definition, are not binding. As a result, it was not illegal for town officials to disregard the 1990 guidelines by assigning \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles to non-24/7 responders. And, of course, the 2008 fleet/vehicle policy does not itself comply with the 1990 guidelines as it extends eligibility for \u201ctake home\u201d vehicles to nonemergency personnel (i.e., employees who work at multiple sites during the workday).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b552-8\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_F\">(dissenting).The issue on this appeal is <em>not </em>whether a public employee\u2019s personal use of a take-home vehicle is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>economic benefit (majority op at 491-492), but, rather, whether a public employer must collectively bargain its way out of a previous policy that is plainly in violation of a duly-enacted local law. Chapter 14 of the Town Code of the Town of Islip entitled \u201cCode of Ethics and Financial Disclosure Law\u201d was adopted in December of 1968 and, apparently, as amended from time to time by the elected Town Board, has functioned without incident ever since. Section 14-12 of that law provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">\u201cNo officer or employee shall request or permit the use of Town-owned vehicles, equipment, material or property for <em>personal convenience </em>or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or <em>are provided as municipal policy for the use of such officer or employee in the conduct of official business'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention (majority op at 493-494), the question whether a public employer may unilaterally discontinue a past practice concerning a term and condition of employment that a local law had declared illegal is squarely presented for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In remarkably brief testimony from four witnesses, all employees of the Town, it is conceded that town employees were permitted to use municipal vehicles for personal use, namely, to drive town-owned vehicles to and from home. As such, the personal use of town-owned vehicles was plainly contrary to section 14-12. PERB erroneously concluded, however, that by allowing employees to drive vehicles home in violation of section 14-12, the Town could not unilaterally end that practice without violating the Taylor Law. Essentially, PERB\u2019s decision trumps a local law and requires the Town to bargain its way out of an illegal activity. This is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Illegal past conduct does not, and should not, evolve into binding terms and conditions of employment. Were it so, sloppy bookkeeping, lax supervision and perhaps, in some cases, rife favoritism could form the basis of a policy by which PERB could overrule a duly-enacted local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">There was nothing in the previous collective bargaining agreements or in the laws and regulations of the Town that would allow public employees to take advantage of taxpayers by obtaining municipally-provided transportation at discount rates. By the same token, it cannot be argued that this would, by custom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tradition, or negligence, be the subject of collective bargaining. It\u2019s clear. The conduct engaged in by the Town and its employees was against the law and PERB\u2019s determination could not make it legal. Therefore, that determination should be annulled and vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Rivera and AbdusSalaam concur with Judge Read; Judge Pigott dissents in an opinion in which Judge Smith concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Order modified, without costs, by remitting to the Appellate Division, Second Department, with directions to remand to the New York State Public Employment Relations Board for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
