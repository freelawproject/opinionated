The Jordan-Elbridge Central School District owed no legal duty to the plaintiff student, who was injured while outside of its custody and control. <em>(Pratt v Robinson, </em>39 NY2d 554; <em>Greenberg, Trager &amp; Herbst, LLP v HSBC Bank USA, </em>17 NY3d 565; <em>Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432; <em>Akins v Glens Falls City School Dist., </em>53 NY2d 325; <em>Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 41 NY2d 901; <em>Kimbar v Estis, </em>1 NY2d 399; <em>Lauer v City of New York, </em>95 NY2d 95; <em>Eiseman v State of New York, </em>70 NY2d 175; <em>Sheila C. v Povich, </em>11 AD3d 120; <em>Martinez v City of New York, </em>90 AD3d 718.)

II. The Jordan-Elbridge Central School District owed a duty to the plaintiff because her injury occurred during the act of busing and because the District placed her in a hazardous setting. <em>(Pratt v Robinson, </em>39 NY2d 554; <em>McDonald v Central School Dist.

The Jordan-Elbridge Central School District is liable under the cases which impose liability on a person for causing another person to believe that entering the street is safe. (Riley <em>v Board of Educ. of Cent. School Dist. No. 1, </em>15 AD2d 303; <em>Robbins v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>105 AD2d 616; <em>Barber v Merchant, </em>180 AD2d 984.) IV. The Jordan-Elbridge Central School District owed a separate and independent special duty to the plaintiff as a result of the special relationship created by the education plan. <em>(Wenger v Goodell, </em>220 AD2d 937; <em>Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255; <em>Reyes v City of New York, </em>238 AD2d 563; <em>Metz v State of New York, </em>20 NY3d 175; <em>McLean v City of New York, </em>12 NY3d 194; <em>Florence v Goldberg, </em>44 NY2d 189; <em>School Comm. of Burlington v Department of Ed. of Mass., </em>471 US 359.) V. Affirming the Fourth Department would not expand the liability of school districts, but if the Court determines that the Jordan-Elbridge Central School District did not owe a duty to the plaintiff under <em>Pratt v Robinson </em>(39 NY2d 554 [1976]), that decision should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>modified or limited. <em>(Ernest v Red Cr. Cent. School Dist., </em>93 NY2d 664.) VI. The Appellate Division properly determined that a question of fact exists as to whether the Jordan-Elbridge Central School District proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>(Mirand v City of New York, </em>84 NY2d 44; <em>Doe v Fulton School Dist., </em>35 AD3d 1194; <em>Bell v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>90 NY2d 944; <em>Bello v New York City Tr.

We conclude that defendant Jordan-Elbridge Central School District (the District) did not owe this or any other common-law duty to the child under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">On the date of the accident, March 13, 2008, A. was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student at Jordan-Elbridge Middle School. Her mother, plaintiff Rhonda Williams (plaintiff), described A., who was born in 1995, as having exhibited \u201cbehavioral issues\u201d while in kindergarten. Plaintiff at first chalked this up to A.\u2019s young age (she was a four-year-old kindergartner) and grief over the then recent death of her father. But even after A. repeated kindergarten, she remained \u201cvery behavioral, noncom-pliant, [and] couldn\u2019t identify letters, numbers, that type of thing.\u201d A. was diagnosed by her doctors in the Albany area, where plaintiff then resided, with ADD/ADHD (attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and mild mental retardation. At the age of seven, A. began receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits on account of her mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Plaintiff moved from the Albany to the Syracuse area in March 2005. Desiring to mainstream her daughter\u2019s schooling as much as possible, she enrolled A. in the Jordan-Elbridge school system, subject to an individualized education plan (IEP).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A.\u2019s IEP for the 2007-08 school year, which plaintiff assisted in formulating, specified under \u201cSpecial Transportation Needs\u201d that A. \u201cshould be transported to school even when she is within walking distance, due to concerns regarding her safety (big bus).\u201d There was no provision for any escort or monitor to assist A. with busing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Plaintiffs residence in March 2008 fronted Route 5, a busy state highway. A.\u2019s designated bus stop was at the end of the roughly 20-yard driveway connecting her home to Route 5. A red dumpster was located on the grass to one side of the driveway, about 15 to 20 feet away from the mailbox, which is where the school bus stopped. Plaintiff testified that A. typically left the house at about 6:50 a.m., and played for 10 or 15 minutes near the dumpster while waiting for the bus to arrive; that she imposed \u201ca very strict rule\u201d that A. was never allowed past the dumpster at any time when playing in the yard; that she told A. to wait at the dumpster until the bus completely stopped at the mailbox; and that A. was never allowed to cross Route 5 unescorted. According to plaintiff, A. dependably followed and observed these \u201cguidelines\u201d and \u201cboundaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">On March 12, 2008, the District\u2019s transportation supervisor rerouted the bus that A. had been taking since the beginning of the school year so as to pick up several children from a family newly moved to the District. Since this bus no longer passed A.\u2019s house, he assigned her to another bus whose existing route did. A.\u2019s house became the first stop on this bus\u2019s route; her pick up and drop off times remained almost exactly the same. There was a monitor on this bus for students who, unlike A., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>were subject to IEPs that required the District to provide them with extra assistance during the commute to and from school. But the monitor knew A. as she had previously worked with her one-on-one as a teacher\u2019s aide. They became reacquainted when A. rode home after school on March 12th on her newly assigned bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">On March 13th, A.\u2019s newly assigned bus, with the monitor onboard, left the bus garage on time, at about 6:50 a.m., or before sunrise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A.\u2019s house was less than 10 minutes away, much closer than the previous first stop on this route, and the bus driver simply forgot to pick her up as he traveled west on Route 5. Neither the driver nor the monitor waved or otherwise signaled to A., whom the monitor glimpsed standing near the red dumpster as the bus passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Alerted by the monitor to the missed stop, the bus driver proceeded 250 feet or so farther west to a vacant gas station on the corner where Route 3IB meets Route 5 at an angle. He turned right into Route 3 IB and entered the gas station, turned the bus around to face Route 5, waited for eastbound traffic to clear (there was no westbound traffic at the time) and exited onto Route 5, traveling east behind a car operated by defendant Sharon T. Weatherstone (Weatherstone). The bus driver intended to go past A.\u2019s house on the opposite (east) side of Route 5 a few hundred feet to a golf course, also on the highway\u2019s east side, where he could turn around again and pull back onto Route 5 traveling west. This would put him in position to pick up A. at her designated stop at the foot of the driveway to her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Shortly after the bus driver headed east on Route 5, though, both he and the monitor caught sight of what appeared to be debris being flung up into the air in front of the Weatherstone vehicle. Weatherstone steered her car off onto the shoulder of the highway, and as the bus driver slowed the bus down, the monitor spotted A. lying, obviously seriously injured, in the eastbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The State Police\u2019s \u201cCollision Reconstruction Findings Report\u201d (Collision Report) attributed the accident primarily to pedestrian error and secondarily to an obstructed view resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Weatherstone\u2019s failure to adequately clear frost from her car\u2019s windshield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked at the General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-h hearing if she had ever queried A. about \u201cwhy she went out into the road\u201d that morning, plaintiff replied that A. told her \u201cthat they forgot her and then they stopped and she looked both ways and she ran,\u201d which was the only explanation A. ever gave her. A. also testified about the accident at the 50-h hearing and gave a deposition. While her testimony was sketchy and variable, she fairly consistently said that she saw the bus go by and turn around, and that she looked both ways before crossing the road to catch the bus on the other side. A. further testified that plaintiff had told her to \u201cbe careful in the middle of the road . . . [b]ecause cars can hit you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On October 27, 2008, plaintiff commenced this personal injury action individually and on behalf of A. against Weatherstone and the District. The District moved for summary judgment on October 21, 2011, seeking an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint and all cross claims against it. The District argued generally that it owed no duty to a student not within its physical care or custody and that, in any event, its purported negligence was not a proximate cause of A.\u2019s injuries. The District and plaintiff submitted warring affidavits from experts in the field of school bus transportation. The experts differed about the propriety of the actions or inactions of District employees, and whether anything these employees (especially the bus driver) did or failed to do proximately caused the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On March 1, 2012, Supreme Court denied the District\u2019s motion in its entirety. Citing <em>Pratt, </em>the judge noted that while a school district \u201cowes its students a duty to exercise the same degree of care toward them as a reasonably prudent parent. . . under similar conditions,\u201d this duty \u201cexists only so long as a student is in [the district\u2019s] care and custody.\u201d In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>however, he held that A.\u2019s status as a special needs child justified an \u201cexpansion\u201d of the District\u2019s duty. The judge also denied that part of the District\u2019s motion seeking to dismiss the complaint for lack of proximate cause. He reasoned that the conflicting expert opinions created issues of fact and credibility for the jury. The District appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">On March 22, 2013, the Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting in part, modified on the law and, as so modified, affirmed (104 AD3d 1265 [4th Dept 2013]). The majority, disagreeing with Supreme Court, rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim that the District owed A. a duty of care because she was a special education student with an IEE The court observed that the IEP \u201crequired only that [the District] provide transportation to school [and] did not place [A.] within [the District\u2019s] orbit of authority while she waited for the school bus, [or] give rise to a duty ... to ensure that the child was safe while waiting for the bus outside her home\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1266 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Nonetheless, the Appellate Division concluded that, \u201cunder the facts presented,\u201d A. was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\u201cwithin the orbit of [the District\u2019s] authority such that [it] owed a duty to [her] <em>based upon the actions of [the District]; i.e., the bus arrived at the bus stop, passed it, and the driver turned around to pick up the child. </em>Thus, \u2018the injury occurred during the act of busing itself, broadly construed\u2019 . . . Where, as here, it was reasonably foreseeable that the child would be placed \u2018into a foreseeably hazardous setting [the District] had a hand in creating,\u2019 [the District] owed a duty to the child\u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Pratt, </em>39 NY2d at 561, and <em>Ernest v Red Cr. Cent. School Dist., </em>93 NY2d 664, 672 [1999], <em>rearg denied </em>93 NY2d 1042 [1999], respectively [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The court agreed with Supreme Court that an issue of fact existed about whether the District\u2019s alleged negligence proximately caused the accident. The Appellate Division agreed with the District, however, that Supreme Court should have granted it summary judgment on plaintiffs claim, as amplified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>bill of particulars, of negligence based on purported violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The dissenting Justices would have reversed Supreme Court\u2019s order and granted the District\u2019s motion in its entirety. Relying on <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Norton v Canandaigua City School Dist. </em>(208 AD2d 282 [4th Dept 1995], <em>lv denied </em>85 NY2d 812 [1995], <em>rearg denied </em>86 NY2d 839 [1995] [the school district had not yet assumed custody and control over a student injured when she crossed the street to wait for her school bus]), they observed the \u201cwell settled\u201d rule that the District\u2019s duty flowed from physical custody and control; that at the time of the accident the District did not have physical custody of the child, who thus remained outside its orbit of authority; and that the District therefore \u201cowed no duty to the child in this situation, and, absent duty, there can be no liability\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1267 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The dissenting Justices rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention, endorsed by the majority, that the District \u201cassumed a duty to the child as a consequence of the potentially hazardous situation allegedly created by the school bus driver in turning the bus around after missing the bus stop\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1268 [internal quotation marks omitted]). They distinguished <em>Ernest </em>on the ground that the District</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u201cdid not release the child from its custody and control into a situation of immediate and foreseeable danger. In fact, the child was never in [the District\u2019s] custody or control on the day of the accident. Instead, the child was and remained in the custody and care of plaintiff, her mother, who was at home at the time of the accident. Plaintiff has cited no cases, and we could find none, where a school district was found to owe a duty of care to a child who was not in its custody at the time of the injury or who was not released from the school district\u2019s custody into a hazardous condition that caused the child\u2019s injury\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">On June 7, 2013, the Appellate Division granted the District leave to appeal to us, and certified the following question: \u201cWas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the order of [the Appellate Division] entered March 22, 2013, properly made?\u201d We answer the question in the negative for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As the courts below and plaintiff recognize, <em>Pratt </em>is our seminal case on the duty owed by a school district to students whom it transports. Plaintiff also urges that, quite apart from <em>Pratt, </em>our decision in <em>Ernest </em>should compel us to conclude that the District owed a duty of care to A. We therefore consider both cases in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>Pratt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In <em>Pratt, </em>a seven-year-old child, having gotten off the bus at the regular bus stop closest to her family\u2019s residence, was struck by a truck and severely injured while crossing a heavily-trafficked street three blocks away from the stop while walking home. The school district had established the bus route; the actual transportation was supplied by a city-owned bus company. In ensuing litigation against the city, the school district and the bus company, plaintiffs (the child and her father) argued that the bus stop\u2019s location, while safe, was nonetheless negligently planned because it was located such that the child would have to cross the busy street while en route home.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Noting that \u201c[n]egligence of the sort here alleged can only be found if there existed a duty on the part of the school district to transport [the child] to a location from which she could walk home without crossing any dangerous streets on the way,\u201d we explored potential sources of such a duty (39 NY2d at 559). We first decided that the legislature had not imposed any duty by statute. Then we observed that the \u201ccommon-law custodial duty of a school toward its pupils\u201d did not \u201csupply any basis for liability\u201d because that duty \u201cstems from\u201d and is \u201ccoextensive with and concomitant to [the school\u2019s] physical custody of and control over the child\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 560). We added that \u201c[w]hen that custody ceases because the child has passed out of the orbit of [the school\u2019s] authority in such a way that the parent is perfectly free to reassume control over the child\u2019s protection, the school\u2019s custodial duty also ceases\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Finally, we considered \u201cone further and major source of liability\u201d; namely, a school district that undertakes to transport students has a duty to perform this task \u201cin a careful and prudent manner\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 561). We noted that \u201c[u]nder certain circumstances,\u201d school districts in New York and elsewhere</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201chave been held liable on this theory when children were injured, <em>even after they had technically been discharged from the bus </em>(see <em>McDonald v Central School Dist. No. 3, </em>179 Misc 333, affd 264 App Div 943, affd 289 NY 800; <em>Van Gaasbeck v Webatuck Cent. School Dist. No. 1, </em>21 NY2d 239; <em>Gleich v Volpe, </em>32 NY2d 517; <em>Shannon v Central-Gaither Union School Dist., </em>133 Cal App 124; <em>Gazaway v Nicholson, </em>61 Ga App 3, affd 190 Ga 345; Tort Liability of Public Schools and Institutions of Higher Learning for Accidents Associated With the Transportation of Students, Ann., 34 ALR3d 1210). Without exception, however, the liability in those cases stemmed either from the fact that the injury occurred during the act of busing itself, broadly construed, or from the violation of a specific statutory duty to see children safely across the street at which the bus is stopped, when their route took them across that street. No such issues have been raised in this case, nor would any apply to the facts here. New York\u2019s Vehicle and Traffic Law (\u00a7 1174, subd [b]), for example, requires school bus drivers to stop, to remain stopped with their lights flashing, and to instruct children in the proper crossing of the street in front of the bus\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 561 [emphasis added; other emphasis omitted]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Briefly reviewing the three New York cases cited, we mentioned that <em>McDonald </em>pinpointed the \u201cgenesis\u201d of what became the duties imposed by section 1174 (b) to \u201cthe fact that, when children must cross the street where the bus stops, the bus itself acts as an obstacle to their clear view of oncoming traffic\u201d; and commented that \u201c[interestingly, even such statutorily based liability addresses itself to <em>the students\u2019 transition from the area of transportation undertaken by the school district to the area which was outside its scope\u201d (id. </em>[emphasis added]). In the same vein, we added that in <em>Van Gaasbeck </em>\u201cwe did not in any way suggest any sphere of liability beyond the statutorily mandated one <em>within the area of disembarkation\u201d (id. </em>[emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>added]). And finally, we noted that <em>Gleich </em>dealt with whether the school district should be held liable for placing a bus stop at a location allegedly unsafe for disembarkation. In each of these three cases, and in the two out-of-state cases cited, a child was injured shortly after alighting from a school bus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">We further remarked that \u201c[c]ases in other States in which liability has been imposed for accidents resulting from the negligence of third parties <em>after a child has left a bus stop area </em>have been rare\u201d; that \u201c[n] early all of them fit within the analysis we have presented in that they too involved either negligence toward a child . . . <em>still in the custody of the school or else failure to perform a specific duty imposed by </em>statute\u201d; and that those</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\"><em>\u201cfew instances </em>in which other States have imposed liability for injuries <em>occurring at a point distant from the bus stop </em>involved the construction of a particular contractual obligation or else represented instances of straightforward judicial \u2018legislation\u2019 of a new duty on the part of school districts rather than the application of even liberal existing legal principles\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 562 [citations omitted and emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We perceived \u201cno basis, either in statutes or common law, for the creation of a school\u2019s duty to protect its students from hazards which may beset them once they are on their way home and outside the control of the school\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Thus, in <em>Pratt </em>we concluded that the school district fulfilled its duty to provide busing with due care; specifically, since \u201cit did not undertake to, and in fact did not, provide transportation from the bus stop to the home of the plaintiffs, there was no activity for the performance of which it could be held negligent\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 564).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\n<em>Ernest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In <em>Ernest, </em>a second-grade student was hit by a truck and severely injured while crossing the road on which his school was situated. There were no sidewalks on this road, and, additionally, there were no traffic signals or crosswalks to assist students who needed to cross the road to get to the nearest sidewalk, north of the school. Because of these conditions, the school, as a safety precaution, did not allow students to leave the school grounds on foot at the end of the day until all the school buses had departed. On the day of the accident, though, the school violated this long-standing policy. The driver of the truck did not see the student because his view was obstructed by a departing bus. The accident took place about 167 feet north of the school\u2019s northern boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We concluded that <em>Pratt </em>did not preclude liability because there, the plaintiff schoolchild was \u201c \u2018set down in a safe spot, and nothing untoward . . . occurred in the course of . . . disembarkation\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ernest, </em>93 NY2d at 672 [emphasis omitted], quoting <em>Pratt, </em>39 NY2d at 560). By contrast, the injured plaintiff in <em>Ernest</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cwas not released to a safe spot but to a foreseeably hazardous setting partly of the School District\u2019s making. Thus, while a school has no duty to prevent injury to schoolchildren <em>released in a safe and anticipated manner, </em>the school breaches a duty when it <em>releases a child without further supervision </em>into a foreseeably hazardous setting it had a hand in creating\u201d (93 NY2d at 672 [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We reversed Supreme Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the school district, affirmed by the Appellate Division, concluding that \u201ca jury could find that [the district] breached this legal duty by releasing [the child] to walk home before the school buses were out of the vicinity\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In support of our holding, we discussed <em>McDonald </em>in more detail than we had in <em>Pratt. </em>In <em>McDonald, </em>a child, after having exited a school bus, was hit by a car whose driver failed to stop as required by law. The school district had adopted a rule, communicated to students, that whenever a school bus stopped on the opposite side from a child\u2019s home, the child should walk directly in front of the bus when crossing the street. In rejecting the school district\u2019s motion for a new trial, we concluded that the jury might well have found that the district, by making this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>rule, assumed a duty to protect the child against the danger of approaching traffic and should have gone further by requiring the driver to signal when it was safe to cross the street. In <em>Ernest, </em>we summed up <em>McDonald </em>as \u201cstanding] for the proposition that a school district\u2019s duty of care requires <em>continued exercise of control and supervision </em>in the event that release of the child poses a foreseeable risk of harm\u201d (93 NY2d at 672 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Plaintiff proposes four theories to support the existence of a duty owed A. by the District: first, that A.\u2019s injuries \u201coccurred during the act of busing itself, broadly construed\u201d <em>(Pratt, </em>39 NY2d at 561); second, citing <em>Ernest, </em>that the District \u201cplaced\u201d A. in a hazardous situation which it created; third, that the District is liable under <em>Riley v Board of Educ. of Cent. School Dist. No. 1 </em>(15 AD2d 303 [3d Dept 1962]) and similar Appellate Division cases that impose a duty of care on someone who signals another that crossing the street is safe; and fourth, that by providing A. \u201cspecial busing services\u201d because of her mental limitations, the District owed her a separate and independent special duty. Finally, in the alternative, plaintiff argues that we should limit or modify <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Ernest </em>and hold what she claims these cases already imply: that a school district owes a duty to a child if it creates a foreseeably hazardous situation prior to the time the bus stops for boarding. We address each of these theories in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The Act of Busing, Broadly Construed</p>\n<p id=\"ANa\">Plaintiff reasons that A.\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cinjury clearly occurred during the act of busing[,] broadly construed[,] because the bus arrived at the bus stop, passed the plaintiff and turned around to pick her up. The bus was present at the scene and was attempting to pick up the child. The child saw the bus, was confused by its operation and was attempting to catch the bus, all of which relates to the act of busing[,] broadly construed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">This argument divorces the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe act of busing itself, broadly construed\u201d from its very particular context. We used this expression in <em>Pratt </em>solely with reference to cases where we, and other courts, have extended a school\u2019s duty to transport students in a careful and prudent manner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>cover a child injured just after alighting from a school bus. All the cases that we discussed or cited in <em>Pratt </em>shared this fact pattern. We concluded that a school owed a duty of care to a child within this often statutorily-based \u201carea of disembarkation\u201d or \u201ctransition\u201d even though, having stepped off the bus, the child was no longer within the school\u2019s physical custody <em>(id. </em>at 561). We reinforced the limited spatial and temporal nature of this duty by referring disparagingly to those \u201cfew instances\u201d where other states \u201cimposed liability for injuries occurring <em>at a point distant from the bus stop\u201d </em>as \u201cjudicial \u2018legislation\u2019 \u201d unless based on a contractual obligation <em>(id. </em>at 562 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The principles established in <em>Pratt </em>may be read to suggest that a school is equally liable for injuries to a child within the area of embarkation or transition created when a school bus stops to pick up passengers and engages its red flashing lights and stop sign to halt motorists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We need not address this issue, though, because A. walked onto the highway and was injured while the bus was still moving in traffic. She was therefore never within the District\u2019s physical custody, or any time- and space-limited area of implied custody and control that may arise once a bus stops and passengers begin to board. Thus, her injuries did not \u201coccur[ ] during the act of busing itself, broadly construed\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 561).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Creating a Hazardous Setting</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Citing <em>Ernest, </em>plaintiff argues that the District is liable for A.\u2019s injuries because it \u201cplaced\u201d her in a foreseeably hazardous setting of its own making. Plaintiff points to various purportedly negligent actions or inactions on the part of District employees (e.g., the transportation supervisor tried but failed to reach her by telephone on March 12th to let her know that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>different bus would be picking A. up the next day). She again highlights, though, that the bus driver missed A.\u2019s designated bus stop and then turned around down the road and traveled back toward the stop thereby, the argument goes, placing A. in a setting that was foreseeably hazardous because these actions \u201cconfused\u201d her into attempting to cross Route 5 on her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Even if the bus driver was negligent, as plaintiff alleges, negligence does not create duty, and plaintiffs reliance on <em>Ernest </em>to establish otherwise is misplaced. Critically, in <em>Ernest </em>the child was in the school\u2019s physical custody when he was released \u201cwithout further supervision\u201d into an arguably hazardous setting. In other words, the school was in a position to determine the timing, place and conditions for sending the child home, and the school was under a duty to release the child from its physical custody \u201cin a safe and anticipated manner\u201d (Ernest, 93 NY2d at 672). We emphasized this point further in our discussion of <em>McDonald (id. </em>[stating that <em>\u201cMcDonald </em>stands for the proposition that a school district\u2019s duty of care requires <em>continued exercise of control and supervision </em>in the event that <em>release </em>of the child poses a foreseeable risk of harm\u201d (emphases added)]). As we recently put it in <em>Stephenson v City of New York </em>(19 NY3d 1031, 1034 [2012]), <em>Ernest </em>marks an exception to the general rule that a school\u2019s duty of care does not extend beyond school premises, and is limited to \u201cinjury that occurred . . . shortly [after school hours] <em>upon the student\u2019s departure from the school\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Here, by contrast, A. was not injured while going home from school; indeed, she was never in the District\u2019s physical custody on March 13th, so the District was never in a position to \u201cplace\u201d or release her into a hazardous setting at any time. Instead, she was in plaintiffs custody while she waited near the dumpster for the school bus. By setting specific \u201cguidelines,\u201d \u201cboundaries\u201d and rules designed to keep A. away from busy Route 5 when she was outside by herself, plaintiff implicitly acknowledged her responsibility for A.\u2019s safety during those times.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Signaling</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Plaintiff also seeks to impose a duty on the District on the basis of Appellate Division case law broadly holding that a motorist who signals a pedestrian to cross a street risks liability if the pedestrian is hit by another vehicle <em>(see e.g. Riley, </em>15 AD2d at 305 [the defendant undertook an \u201caffirmative act of waving her hand to direct the discharged passenger\u201d]; <em>Robbins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>105 AD2d 616 [1st Dept 1984] [bus driver waved passenger to cross the street in front of the bus]; <em>Yau v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>10 AD3d 654 [2d Dept 2004] [same]). All of these cases entail some intentional hand motion or gesture directed by the motorist at the pedestrian. Having thereby assumed a duty to guide the pedestrian to safety, the motorist must exercise reasonable care in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Here, though, neither the bus driver nor the monitor waved at or signaled A. as the bus missed her designated bus stop, traveling west; after turning around to travel east, they did not even see her before the accident. In short, they made no gestures at all, much less any gesture that a jury might conclude intentionally summoned A. to cross the highway. Consequently, plaintiff proposes that the \u201cact of turning around the bus and coming toward [A.] was the functional equivalent of the hand signal given in Riley\u201d; and \u201c[t]he fact that the signal was by the bus, rather than by a hand, was no less communicative . . . , given [A.\u2019s] age and mental capacity.\u201d We find no basis in the case law for this novel theory. In any event, whatever A. may have thought when she saw the bus turn around, there is no reason to suppose from this record that the bus driver intended by driving east to signal A. to leave the safety of her designated bus stop and cross Route 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Special Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">An agency of government may be liable for the negligent performance of a governmental function when there exists a special duty to the injured person, in contrast to a general duty owed to the public <em>(see McLean v City of New York, </em>12 NY3d 194 [2009]). Plaintiff claims that A. is owed such a special duty by the District as a result of a special relationship created by the IEP; specifically, the \u201cspecial busing services\u201d afforded A. in the IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">But the IEP only directed the District to transport A. to and from school even though she lived within walking distance. In short, the District undertook in the IEP to provide the same busing for A. required of it for all children in \u201cgrades kindergarten through eight who live more than two miles from the school which they legally attend\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 3635 [1] [a]), although A. was furnished portal-to-portal busing <em>(see id., </em>\u00a7 3635 [1] [d]). Notably, the IEP did not call for an aide or escort to wait with A. at her designated bus stop <em>(see </em>US Department of Education, Q and A: Questions and Answers on Transportation [Nov. 2009], http://idea.ed.gOv/explore/view/p/,root,dynamic,Qu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Corner,12, [noting that \u201c(f)or students who may need assistance with \u2018going\u2019 to the bus stop or \u2018waiting\u2019 at the bus stop independently, adding a bus stop monitor can be considered\u201d by the child\u2019s IDEA Team]). Plaintiff suggests that busing a special needs child requires extra care, and therefore imposes additional transportation-related obligations on the District. But this argument is belied by the IEP itself, which did not specify any \u201cspecial busing services\u201d and required only regular bus transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Limiting or Modifying <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Ernest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Finally, plaintiff asks us to limit or modify <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Ernest </em>if we disagree with her position (as we do) that these cases provide a basis to impose liability on the District for A.\u2019s injuries without any \u201cadditional exception or extension.\u201d Basically, she urges that because of the \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d here, custody should not be the litmus test for duty. We have, however, repeatedly endorsed the efficacy and fairness of defining a school\u2019s common-law duty to supervise or transport students in terms of physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The concept of in loco parentis is the fountainhead of the duty of care owed by a school to its students <em>(see Mirand v City of New York, </em>84 NY2d 44, 49 [1994] [\u201c(t)he duty owed derives from the simple fact that a school, in assuming physical custody and control over its students, effectively takes the place of parents and guardians\u201d]). In <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Ernest </em>we identified limited situations where a school might be liable in the absence of physical custody of an injured child. But in the circumstances described, the school still exercised control over the time, place and conditions of a child\u2019s release from its physical custody to the protection of a parent or guardian. Here, A. never left plaintiffs custody and control on the morning of March 13th, and plaintiff trusted A. to wait at her designated bus stop independently. Because the accident did not happen while A. was within the District\u2019s custody and control, the District is not liable for A.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Accordingly, the order, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs; defendant School District\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against it granted; and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">.

By contrast, the way in which the dissent interprets the phrase \u201cthe act of busing itself, broadly construed\u201d is entirely open-ended. While I suspect that the dissenters would agree that a school district does not have a duty to warn or protect a child against all hazards that might arise during \u201cthe act of busing itself, broadly construed,\u201d they offer no limiting principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b461-8\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APH\">(dissenting).I would hold that on these facts the school district owed plaintiff\u2019s daughter a duty of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>care, and that there is a triable issue as to whether her injury was proximately caused by a breach of that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">A school\u2019s duty to its students arises because the school \u201cin assuming physical custody and control over its students, effectively takes the place of parents and guardians\u201d <em>(Mirand v City of New York, </em>84 NY2d 44, 49 [1994]). In <em>Pratt v Robinson </em>(39 NY2d 554, 560 [1976]), we explained that when the school district\u2019s custody of a child \u201cceases because the child has passed out of the orbit of its authority in such a way that the parent is perfectly free to reassume control over the child\u2019s protection, the school\u2019s custodial duty also ceases.\u201d Cases in which school buses are picking up or discharging children are at the borderline between the school\u2019s custody and the parents\u2019 control, and it can be difficult in such cases to decide when the school district\u2019s duty of care begins or ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">I find two school-bus cases especially relevant here, <em>Pratt </em>and one of the decisions it relies on, <em>McDonald v Central School Dist. No. 3 of Towns of Romulus, Varick &amp; Fayette, Seneca County </em>(179 Misc 333 [Sup Ct, Seneca County 1941], <em>affd </em>264 App Div 943 [4th Dept 1942], <em>affd </em>289 NY 800 [1943]). In <em>McDonald, </em>a child was injured while crossing the street immediately after getting off her school bus. The bus driver, in compliance with a school district rule, had waited at the stop after letting the children off, allowing them to cross in front of the bus. The driver saw, but failed to warn the child about, the car that hit her. A jury returned a verdict against the school district, and the trial judge, Justice Van Voorhis (later a Judge of this Court), denied a motion for a new trial. He said that \u201c[t]he presence of the bus necessarily created some hazard,\u201d because it obstructed the view of children and drivers, and he found evidence to support a finding that the school district \u201cassumed a duty to protect [the child] against the special danger which it had created by its own rule\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 336). The Appellate Division and this Court affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In <em>Pratt, </em>a child was dropped off by a school bus, walked three blocks toward her home, and then was hit by a truck while crossing a street. The school district was sued on the theory that it was negligent for failing to locate its bus stop at a place nearer to the child\u2019s home. We held that the school district owed the child no duty, because the child had left the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>district\u2019s custody, and her parents could have resumed control. We distinguished <em>McDonald </em>as a case in which \u201cthe injury occurred during the act of busing itself, broadly construed,\u201d and referred to Justice Van Voorhis\u2019s observation that \u201cwhen children must cross the street where the bus stops, the bus itself acts as an obstacle to their clear view of oncoming traffic\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 561). We expressed a similar view of <em>McDonald </em>in <em>Ernest v Red Cr. Cent. School Dist. </em>(93 NY2d 664, 671 [1999]), where we summarized it as holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">\u201calthough a school district\u2019s duty of care toward a student generally ends when it relinquishes custody of the student, the duty continues when the student is released into a potentially hazardous situation, particularly when the hazard is partly of the school district\u2019s own making.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">This case involves a child being picked up, not dropped off, by a school bus, but that distinction seems to me of little significance. I would hold that the case is within the rule established by <em>McDonald </em>and restated in <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Ernest: </em>A school district\u2019s duty to use due care exists where an injury occurs during \u201cthe act of busing itself, broadly construed\u201d and where the child is exposed to a hazard \u201cpartly of the school district\u2019s own making.\u201d Here, the school district\u2019s bus had gone to the child\u2019s house to pick her up, had mistakenly driven past and was returning to complete the pick up. This was the act of busing, broadly construed. And the hazard here was, accepting the facts as plaintiff claims them to be, of the school district\u2019s own making. Plaintiffs daughter went into the street in direct response to the bus driver\u2019s allegedly negligent maneuver. Imagine a case like this one, except with stronger proof of the bus driver\u2019s fault: suppose for example, that the driver had negligently stopped the bus across the street from the child\u2019s house, causing her to think she had to cross. In such a case, the school district surely should be liable for the resulting injury \u2014 and, on the duty issue, the hypothetical case is indistinguishable from this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The majority acknowledges that the logic of the school-bus drop-off cases might be extended to a pick-up case, but would find a duty, if at all, only where the child is \u201cwithin the area of embarkation or transition\u201d and only after the bus \u201cstops to pick up passengers and engages its red flashing lights and stop sign to halt motorists\u201d (majority op at 400). This limitation, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>which the majority offers no rationale, seems wholly arbitrary to me. What logic justifies excluding a case like this one, where, because of the driver\u2019s negligence, the bus failed \u201cto stop to pick up a passenger\u201d and then, according to plaintiff\u2019s claim, made an ill-judged turn that lured the child out of \u201cthe area of embarkation and transition\u201d? I think our precedents, fairly read, compel the conclusion that a duty existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">For me, the issue of whether the child\u2019s injuries were proximately caused by a breach of the school district\u2019s duty of care is more troublesome than the issue of whether there was such a duty. I do not find this a strong case against the school district. Indeed, I wonder whether plaintiff might have had more success on the duty issue if she had a stronger case on negligence and proximate cause. But I conclude that plaintiff has presented enough evidence on those issues to get to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Plaintiffs theory is, in essence, that the school district should have told its driver that plaintiffs daughter was a special needs child; that the driver, after he missed his stop, should either have taken her special needs into account or called in for instructions on what to do; and that the driver or his supervisor, knowing that the child\u2019s mental disability could impair her judgment, should have foreseen that the returning bus would lead her to put herself in danger. This theory, while debatable, is not plainly wrong. It was endorsed by plaintiffs expert witness, a specialist in the transportation of students and of passengers with special needs, and it found further support in the testimony of the school district\u2019s transportation supervisor. The supervisor testified that, had he known that the child \u201chad some issues with her capabilities to understand what to do and not to do,\u201d and had he been asked by the bus driver whether to turn the bus around, he would not have advised him to do so, because the turn could create confusion and danger. He would, he testified, have told the driver to go on his way and sent another bus; there was evidence that another bus was in the area. A jury could find that what the supervisor said he would have done is what due care required, and that the failure to exercise due care proximately caused the child\u2019s injuries. I would therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-8\">Judges Graffeo, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur with Judge Read; Judge Smith dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Pigott concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, with costs, defendant Jordan-Elbridge Central School District\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against it granted, and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
