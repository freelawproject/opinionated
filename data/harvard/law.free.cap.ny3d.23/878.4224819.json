The evidence against defendant included his confession, which he maintained was false and had been coerced by police. In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether the People committed a constitutional violation <em>(see Brady v Maryland, </em>373 US 83 [1963]) when they did not disclose that a federal civil action had been brought against one of their police witnesses, a homicide detective who interrogated defendant, alleging that the detective engaged in police misconduct in an unrelated case. We hold that the People\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence did not constitute a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">On July 18, 1998, Suffolk County police were called to investigate an overwhelming odor in a neighborhood in Wyandanch. The police discovered a dead body bundled up in sheets and dark colored plastic behind the fence of defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. Homicide detectives interviewed Frank Garrett, defendant\u2019s brother, and his girlfriend, J.C., who lived near defendant\u2019s mother. The detectives learned that J.C.\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, L.C., had been missing for almost two weeks and that she was last seen leaving her home with defendant. Defendant, who was then on parole, had previously lived with his brother and J.C., and often visited his mother\u2019s home, but he had not been seen since L.C.\u2019s disappearance. J.C. helped the detectives locate L.C.\u2019s dental records, which were used to positively identify the dead body as L.C. on July 21st.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">On July 23rd, detectives located defendant in an unoccupied residence in Coram, New York and arrested him pursuant to an outstanding parole warrant. They then transported defendant to the homicide bureau in Yaphank, where he was interrogated by several detectives, including Detective Vincent O\u2019Leary. Although defendant initially denied any involvement in L.C.\u2019s death, he eventually confessed orally and in writing that he had killed L.C. at his mother\u2019s home. In a signed sworn statement, defendant said that he had \u201cwanted to have sex with [L.C.],\u201d and when she refused, he grabbed her \u201ctight around her chest and lift[ed] her up off the ground . . . a lot of times,\u201d at one point holding her in \u201ca full nelson\u201d by \u201csqueezing her around the chest.\u201d L.C. went limp in defendant\u2019s arms, and when he could not revive her, he bound her body in electrical wire, wrapped it in sheets and garbage bags, and threw her over his mother\u2019s fence into an adjacent yard. After providing this statement, defendant drew a sketch of the crime scene and marked several crime scene photographs to depict, among other things, where he had deposited L.C.\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Defendant was indicted on three counts of murder in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25). Prior to trial, defendant filed a demand for discovery, in which he generally requested that the People disclose all <em>Brady </em>material. He also moved to suppress his confession as false and involuntarily made. At a suppression hearing held in November 1999, the People presented testimony from Detective O\u2019Leary and Detective Eugene Walsh. These witnesses testified, in essence, that after defendant was advised of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he voluntar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ily confessed to the murder without being coerced to do so. Defendant offered a very different version of events: he testified at the hearing that the detectives never read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that they coerced him into signing a false confession by subjecting him to intense physical and psychological abuse. Defendant also presented the testimony of several witnesses, including two other homicide detectives who had interrogated him. While questioning Detective Samuel DeJesus, defense counsel asked the detective whether he or Detective O\u2019Leary had been \u201cinvolved in the James Halverson homicide case,\u201d which counsel explained \u201cwas a case involving a false confession.\u201d The suppression court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to this line of questioning. After the hearing, the court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">At trial, the People presented defendant\u2019s incriminating statements primarily through Detective O\u2019Leary\u2019s testimony. The jury also considered circumstantial evidence implicating defendant in L.C.\u2019s death, including testimony that the electrical wire and sheets found on L.C.\u2019s body matched wire and sheets seized from defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, that L.C. was last seen alive leaving her home with defendant, and that, according to J.C., L.C. left with defendant to go to his mother\u2019s home. Detective O\u2019Leary also testified that defendant\u2019s bedding and belongings were found in an interior, windowless hallway in the residence where he was arrested, indicating that he had been attempting to avoid detection. While cross-examining Detective O\u2019Leary, defense counsel again referenced \u201cthe Halverson case,\u201d this time asking O\u2019Leary if he worked on that case or was \u201cfamiliar\u201d with it. The prosecutor objected and defense counsel explained, at a sidebar, that O\u2019Leary\u2019s involvement in the Halverson case was relevant because that case allegedly involved a false confession. The trial court sustained the objection and defense counsel did not pursue the inquiry further.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The jury returned a verdict convicting defendant of depraved indifference murder <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [2]) and felony murder <em>(id. </em>at [3]), and in June 2000, he was sentenced to two concurrent indeterminate terms of 25 years to life in prison. The Appellate Division affirmed on direct appeal <em>(see People v Garrett, </em>8 AD3d 676 [2d Dept 2004], <em>lv denied </em>3 NY3d 674 [2004]). The court held, among other things, that the suppression hearing evidence established that defendant\u2019s incriminating statements were made voluntarily after he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that the trial evidence was legally suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(see id. </em>at 676-677).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In December 2009, defendant, acting pro se, moved pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his judgment of conviction. Defendant claimed that the People committed a <em>Brady </em>violation by failing to disclose to him that an unrelated civil action had been brought against Detective O\u2019Leary and Suffolk County in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (hereinafter, EDNY) based on O\u2019Leary\u2019s alleged police misconduct in an arson case. According to an EDNY docket printout submitted in support of defendant\u2019s motion, the civil complaint was filed on June 1, 1998, and was answered by O\u2019Leary and Suffolk County via the Suffolk County Attorney on June 18, 1998, more than a month before defendant\u2019s arrest. The Federal District Court ordered the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office to unseal its files related to the civil case in January 2001, and the case was ultimately settled in March 2001, after defendant\u2019s trial and sentencing for murder had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The federal complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that O\u2019Leary coerced the plaintiff, Keith Schroeter, into confessing to third-degree arson charges by repeatedly striking Schroeter in the head with a telephone book while he was handcuffed and physically forcing him to sign a written confession. Defendant asserted that, because Detective O\u2019Leary was part of the prosecution\u2019s team, the People had constructive knowledge and a duty to learn of these allegations during the prosecution of defendant\u2019s case. Defendant further claimed that, had this information been properly disclosed, he would have used it to impeach O\u2019Leary\u2019s credibility at the suppression hearing or at trial. In opposition to defendant\u2019s motion, the People submitted an attorney affirmation averring that they had no actual knowledge of the allegations against O\u2019Leary until the District Attorney\u2019s Office was ordered to unseal its files in January 2001, after defendant had been convicted and sentenced. The People argued in the alternative that, even if they had been aware of the allegations, the information did not constitute <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. The court concluded that constructive knowledge of O\u2019Leary\u2019s alleged bad acts in a different case could not be imputed to the prosecution, and because the People demonstrated they had no actual knowledge of the federal action until after defendant had been convicted and sentenced, no <em>Brady </em>violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>A Justice of the Appellate Division granted defendant leave to appeal (2010 NY Slip Op 81496[U] [2010]), and that court reversed the County Court order and remitted the matter for a hearing <em>(People v Garrett, </em>106 AD3d 929, 930 [2d Dept 2013]). The Appellate Division determined that the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary \u201cconstituted impeachment evidence\u201d and that the People\u2019s failure to disclose them \u201cmay have denied the defendant the opportunity to conduct an investigation leading to additional exculpatory or impeaching evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 931). The information was also material, according to the Appellate Division, because \u201cthe credibility of the detectives who obtained the defendant\u2019s confession was of central importance in [defendant\u2019s] case\u201d and \u201cother evidence tying him to the crime was weak\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Contrary to County Court, the Appellate Division concluded that knowledge of the allegations could have been imputed to the People by \u201c[someone] to whom the obligation under <em>Brady </em>extended, other than perhaps O\u2019Leary himself\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at 932). Accordingly, the court remitted the matter for a hearing \u201cto determine whether the District Attorney\u2019s office had sufficient knowledge of the suit against O\u2019Leary so as to trigger its obligations under Brady\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 931-932). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal <em>(see </em>21 NY3d 1042 [2013]) and we now reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\"><em>Brady </em>proscribes \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to [the] accused . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment\u201d (373 US at 87). \u201cThe <em>Brady </em>rule is based on the requirement of due process,\u201d and \u201cKits purpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered,\u201d but to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial <em>(United States v Bagley, </em>473 US 667, 675 [1985]; <em>see People v Bryce, </em>88 NY2d 124, 129 [1996]). The People, in their role as truth-seekers in criminal trials, have a \u201cbroad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence,\u201d but a mere breach of this duty does not offend the defendant\u2019s due process rights unless all the \u201ccomponents of a true <em>Brady </em>viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tion\u201d are established <em>(Strickler v Greene, </em>527 US 263, 281 [1999]; <em>see also Bagley, </em>473 US at 675 [\u201c(U)nless the omission deprived the defendant of a fair trial, there was no constitutional violation . . . and absent a constitutional violation, there was no breach of the prosecutor\u2019s constitutional duty to disclose\u201d]). To make out a successful <em>Brady </em>claim, \u201ca defendant must show that (1) the evidence is favorable to the defendant because it is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature; (2) the evidence was suppressed by the prosecution; and (3) prejudice arose because the suppressed evidence was material\u201d <em>(People v Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d 259, 263 [2009], citing <em>Strickler, </em>527 US at 281-282; <em>see People v Hayes, </em>17 NY3d 46, 50 [2011]; <em>People v LaValle, </em>3 NY3d 88, 109-110 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\"> In this case, the parties disagree as to all three essential <em>Brady </em>components. The People assert that the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary were not favorable to defendant, suppressed by the prosecution, or material to defendant\u2019s guilt, while defendant maintains that the allegations meet each one of these elements. We conclude that, although the civil allegations were favorable to defendant, he has not proved that the People suppressed that information or that he was prejudiced by its nondisclosure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">\u201cEvidence is favorable to the accused if it either tends to show that the accused is not guilty or if it impeaches a government witness\u201d <em>(United States v Gil, </em>297 F3d 93, 101 [2d Cir 2002], citing <em>Strickler, </em>527 US at 281-282; <em>see also Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d at 263). Impeachment evidence \u201cfalls within the <em>Brady </em>rule\u201d because, when used effectively, it \u201cmay make the difference between conviction and acquittal\u201d <em>(Bagley, </em>473 US at 676; <em>see People v Baxley, </em>84 NY2d 208, 213 [1994]). However, the \u201cfavorable tendency\u201d of impeachment evidence should be assessed without regard to the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d as a whole <em>(Kyles v Whitley, </em>514 US 419, 451 [1995]; <em>see Walker v Kelly, </em>589 F3d 127, 140 [4th Cir 2009]; <em>see also Lambert v Beard, </em>537 Fed Appx 78, 86 [3d Cir 2013] [citing <em>Kyles </em>and stating that \u201cthe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence is \u2018favorable to the defense\u2019 even if the jury might not afford it significant weight\u201d]). In other words, impeachment evidence may be considered favorable to defendant even if it is not material to the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Here, the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary were favorable to defendant as impeachment evidence <em>(see Strickler, </em>527 US at 281-282; <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 450-451). Defendant argued at the suppression hearing that O\u2019Leary and other homicide detectives coerced him into making a false confession. The federal complaint made similar allegations against O\u2019Leary: although it did not explicitly allege that the confession O\u2019Leary procured was false, the complaint described coercive tactics O\u2019Leary allegedly used to extract a confession against the plaintiffs will. This evidence clearly had an \u201cimpeachment <em>character\u201d </em>that favored defendant\u2019s false confession theory, and we reach this conclusion without determining what, if any, \u201ceffect\u201d the complaint may have had on the verdict in light of the evidence as a whole <em>(Walker, </em>589 F3d at 140; <em>see Kyles, </em>514 US at 451).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">We consider now whether, under <em>Brady\u2019s </em>second component, the People \u201csuppressed\u201d the favorable evidence, \u201ceither willfully or inadvertently\u201d <em>(see Strickler, </em>527 US at 282). Exculpatory or impeaching evidence is subject to <em>Brady </em>disclosure only if it is within the prosecution\u2019s custody, possession, or control <em>(see People v Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d 412, 421 [2000]; <em>see People v Wright, </em>86 NY2d 591, 596 [1995]; <em>see also Lavallee v Coplan, </em>374 F3d 41, 43 [1st Cir 2004]). What constitutes \u201cpossession or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>control\u201d for <em>Brady </em>purposes \u201chas not been interpreted narrowly\u201d <em>(Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d at 421), and it is beyond cavil that \u201cthe government\u2019s duty to disclose under <em>Brady </em>reaches beyond evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s actual possession\u201d <em>(United States v Risha, </em>445 F3d 298, 303 [3d Cir 2006]; see Kyles, 514 US at 437-438; <em>Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d at 421). Specifically, the duty \u201cencompasses evidence \u2018known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor\u2019 \u201d <em>(Strickler, </em>527 US at 280-281, quoting <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 438). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Kyles, </em>in order to comply with <em>Brady, </em>\u201cthe individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police\u201d <em>(Kyles, </em>514 US at 437).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Applying <em>Kyles, </em>\u201cthis Court has charged the People with knowledge of exculpatory information in the possession of the local police, notwithstanding the trial prosecutor\u2019s own lack of knowledge\u201d <em>(Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d at 421; <em>see Wright, </em>86 NY2d at 598). Similarly, we have observed, as have many federal courts, that the People may be in \u201cconstructive\u201d possession of information known to government officials who \u201cengaged in a joint or cooperative investigation\u201d of the defendant\u2019s case <em>(Santorelli, </em>95 NY2d at 421; <em>see e.g. United States v Paternina-Vergara, </em>749 F2d 993, 997-998 [2d Cir 1984]). The rationale for the imputation of knowledge is that, when police and other government agents investigate or provide information with the goal of prosecuting a defendant, they act as \u201can arm of the prosecution,\u201d and the knowledge they gather may reasonably be imputed to the prosecutor under <em>Brady (see United States v Stewart, </em>433 F3d 273, 298 [2d Cir 2006] [noting that \u201cthe propriety of imputing knowledge to the prosecution . . . does not turn on the <em>status </em>of the person with actual knowledge\u201d but what that person <em>\u201cdid\u201d </em>to aid the prosecution]; <em>e.g. United States v Morell, </em>524 F2d 550, 555 [2d Cir 1975] [imputing law enforcement agent\u2019s knowledge of confidential file to prosecutors where agent supervised the witness, participated actively in the investigation and frequently sat at counsel table throughout the trial]).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">However, there are limits to the extent exculpatory knowledge may fairly be imputed to the prosecution. Particularly relevant to this case, the First and Third Appellate Division departments have held that \u201c[a] police officer\u2019s secret knowledge of his own prior illegal conduct in [an] unrelated case[ ] will not be imputed to the prosecution for <em>Brady </em>purposes where the People had no knowledge of the corrupt officer\u2019s \u2018bad acts\u2019 until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>. . . trial\u201d <em>(People v Johnson, </em>226 AD2d 828, 829 [3d Dept 1996]; <em>People v Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d 93, 95 [1st Dept 1995], <em>lv denied </em>88 NY2d 943 [1996]; <em>see e.g. People v Kinney, </em>107 AD3d 563, 564 [1st Dept 2013]; <em>People v Longtin, </em>245 AD2d 807, 810 [3d Dept 1997], <em>affd on other grounds </em>92 NY2d 640 [1998], <em>cert denied </em>526 US 1114 [1999]). In <em>Vasquez, </em>the First Department explained that a police officer is \u201cnot acting as an \u2018arm of the prosecution\u2019 \u201d when he or she conceals his or her own criminal activity in a prior, unrelated case, and the People therefore have no duty to discover and disclose the officer\u2019s \u201ccollateral criminal conduct\u201d under <em>Brady </em>(214 AD2d at 101). At least one federal appellate court has similarly \u201crefused to extend <em>Brady\u2019s </em>constructive knowledge doctrine\u201d where the police misconduct was known only to the officer and was unrelated to the case at hand <em>(United States v Robinson, </em>627 F3d 941, 952 [4th Cir 2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">The Appellate Division appears to have implicitly determined that O\u2019Leary\u2019s knowledge of his own alleged misconduct and the civil action against him was not sufficient to trigger the People\u2019s duty to discover and disclose this evidence <em>(see </em>106 AD3d at 932, citing <em>Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d 93). Nonetheless, the court remitted defendant\u2019s case for a hearing to determine, essentially, whether anyone other than O\u2019Leary \u201chad knowledge of the civil action\u201d that could have been imputed to the People (106 AD3d at 932). This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">A prosecutor\u2019s \u201cduty to learn\u201d of favorable evidence known to those \u201cacting on the government\u2019s behalf\u201d has generally been held to include information that directly relates to the prosecution or investigation of the defendant\u2019s case <em>(Kyles, </em>514 US at 429, 437-440 [evidence pointing to a person other than defendant as potential killer and contradicting state\u2019s witnesses]; <em>see e.g. Youngblood v West Virginia, </em>547 US 867, 868-870 [2006] [state trooper\u2019s knowledge of note written by women Youngblood allegedly sexually assaulted that was inconsistent with state\u2019s theory and consistent with defense of consent]; <em>Bagley, </em>473 US at 670-672 [undisclosed contracts between main prosecution witnesses and federal agency agreeing to pay for information against Bagley]; <em>Wright, </em>86 NY2d at 596 [victim\u2019s status as police informant establishing \u201cmotive for prosecution witnesses to corroborate\u201d his version of events and \u201cto disbelieve . . . (the) defendant\u201d]). It follows that, when a police officer engages in illegal conduct in the course of his or her investigation or prosecution of the defendant, knowledge of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>misconduct may be imputed to the People for <em>Brady </em>purposes, regardless of the officer\u2019s motivation or the prosecutor\u2019s actual awareness <em>(see Freeman v State of Georgia, </em>599 F2d 65, 69 [5th Cir 1979], <em>cert denied </em>444 US 1013 [1980] [imputing to the prosecution investigating officer\u2019s concealment of the identity of an exculpatory witness]; <em>see also In re Siggers, </em>615 F3d 477, 480 [6th Cir 2010] [holding that Siggers\u2019 allegations of \u201cpolice misconduct and coercion resulting in the introduction of perjured testimony . . . would satisfy the second <em>Brady </em>requirement\u201d]; <em>compare People v Robertson, </em>12 NY2d 355, 359-360 [1963] [misconduct by police witness who gave false testimony discrediting the defendant\u2019s involuntary confession defense \u201ccharged\u201d to the prosecution even though they were unaware of the falsity and the false testimony was given unintentionally]). But there is a distinction between the nondisclosure of police misconduct \u201cwhich has some bearing on the case against the defendant,\u201d and the nondisclosure of such material which has \u201cno relationship to the case against the defendant, except insofar as it would be used for impeachment purposes\u201d <em>(Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d at 100; <em>see Robinson, </em>627 F3d at 952). In the latter circumstance, the offending officer is not acting as \u201can arm of the prosecution\u201d when he or she commits the misconduct, and the agency principles underlying the imputed knowledge rule are not implicated <em>(see id. </em>at 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">We need not \u201cdraw . . . hard and fast lines here about the scope of <em>Brady </em>imputation\u201d <em>(Robinson, </em>627 F3d at 952). We are satisfied that, under the circumstances of this case, the People had no constructive knowledge of the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary. The allegations did not arise out of O\u2019Leary\u2019s investigation of defendant\u2019s case or his actions as part of the prosecution\u2019s team, nor were they directly related to defendant\u2019s murder prosecution. The federal lawsuit concerned O\u2019Leary\u2019s alleged misconduct in an unrelated criminal case, and the allegations were, at most, collateral to defendant\u2019s prosecution to the extent they may have provided impeachment material. Accordingly, O\u2019Leary\u2019s knowledge of his own alleged misconduct and the civil action against him could not be imputed to the People for <em>Brady </em>purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Defendant points out that, unlike <em>Vasquez </em>and other cases that concerned secret police misconduct, the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary were contained in a \u201cpublic federal lawsuit\u201d filed before defendant was arrested. This is a distinction without a difference under the facts of this case, where the allegations against O\u2019Leary could have been discovered only if the People had combed through the dockets of EDNY cases. Defendant asserts that this investigatory step is mandatory under <em>Brady, </em>specifically, he contends that the People were required to ask O\u2019Leary whether he was being sued \u201cin any court, for any reason related to his course of conduct as a Suffolk County Detective\u201d and to \u201c conduct [ ] a cursory check in state and federal court to see if the Detective had any civil rights cases against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We decline to construe the People\u2019s <em>Brady </em>obligations so broadly. \u201c [I]t is one thing to require prosecutors to inquire about whether police have turned up exculpatory or impeachment evidence during their investigation. It is quite another to require them, on pain of a possible retrial, to conduct disciplinary inquiries into the general conduct of every officer working the case\u201d <em>(Robinson, </em>627 F3d at 952). While prosecutors should not be discouraged from asking their police witnesses about potential misconduct, if they feel such a conversation would be prudent, they are not required to make this inquiry to fulfill their <em>Brady </em>obligations. Similarly, the People have no affirmative duty to search the dockets of every case in every federal and state court in New York for complaints against their police witnesses. A contrary rule, taken to its logical extreme, would require prosecutors to search for cases in every jurisdiction where investigating officers had a previous or existing connection \u201cjust in case some impeaching evidence may show up\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number><em>(United States v Lee Vang Lor, </em>706 F3d 1252, 1259-1260 [10th Cir 2013]; <em>see Risha, </em>445 F3d at 304 [\u2018\u2018(Prosecutors are not required to undertake a \u2018fishing expedition' in other jurisdictions to discover impeachment evidence\"]). This would impose an unacceptable burden upon prosecutors that is likely not outweighed by the potential benefit defendants would enjoy from the information ultimately disclosed on account of the People\u2019s efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Accordingly, defendant has not demonstrated that the People suppressed the civil allegations in violation of <em>Brady. </em>As County Court determined, the People have adequately proved that they had no actual knowledge of the allegations until after trial when their <em>Brady </em>obligations had ceased. We further hold that O\u2019Leary\u2019s personal, pretrial knowledge of the allegations could not be imputed to the prosecutor, and that the prosecutor had no duty to inquire about the allegations or to search for the \u201cpublic\u201d lawsuit. Defendant has maintained throughout this litigation that O\u2019Leary\u2019s knowledge of the allegations against him resulted in the imputation of that knowledge to the prosecutor; he has never alleged that the imputation derived from the knowledge of any other police officer or member of the prosecution team. Having concluded that the People had no actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations, we need not remit this matter for a hearing on suppression <em>(see </em>106 AD3d at 932).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Even if we were to hold that the People suppressed the allegations against O\u2019Leary, defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim would still fail because the nondisclosed evidence \u201cdoes not meet the materiality standard \u2014 the third prong required to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation\u201d <em>(Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d at 265). \u201cIn New York, where a defendant makes a specific request for a document, the materiality element is established provided there exists a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that it would have changed the result of the proceedings\u201d (i<em>d. </em>at 263, citing <em>People v Vilardi, </em>76 NY2d 67, 77 [1990]). \u201cWhere, as here, the defense did not specifically request the information, the test of materiality is whether \u2018there is a reasonable probability that had it been disclosed to the defense, the result would have been different \u2014 i.e., a probability sufficient to undermine the court\u2019s confidence in the outcome of the trial\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Hunter, </em>11 NY3d 1, 5 [2008], quoting <em>Bryce, </em>88 NY2d at 128; <em>see Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d at 263).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">We agree with the People that there was no reasonable probability that disclosure of the civil allegations against O\u2019Leary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>would have changed the result of defendant\u2019s proceedings. Although defendant claims he could have used the allegations to impeach O\u2019Leary\u2019s credibility at the suppression hearing or at trial, defendant previously tried and failed to admit similar impeachment evidence against O\u2019Leary at both of these stages of the proceeding, and the courts sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objections to the evidence based on relevance grounds. Thus, it seems unlikely that defendant would have had any greater success in admitting the evidence at issue here, which was only marginally more relevant. This Court has not squarely addressed whether, as some federal courts have held, inadmissible evidence may be considered \u201cmaterial\u201d under <em>Brady </em>so long as it \u201ccould lead to admissible evidence\u201d <em>(Gil, </em>297 F3d at 104; <em>see Hunter, </em>11 NY3d at 5 [citing <em>Gil </em>but declining to decide whether, as the defendant argued, \u201cinformation would be subject to <em>Brady </em>even if it was not itself admissible in evidence\u201d]; <em>but see People v Scott, </em>88 NY2d 888, 891 [1996] [no <em>Brady </em>violation because \u201cpolygrapher\u2019s opinions regarding the witness\u2019s veracity are not admissible evidence\u201d]; <em>cf. People v Ennis, </em>11 NY3d 403, 414-415 [2008] [holding attorney not ineffective for failing to preserve <em>Brady </em>claim \u201cthat had little or no chance of success\u201d because \u201cinadmissibility of the exculpatory information prevented it from being material\u201d]). In any case, defendant has failed to show what, if any, admissible evidence disclosure of the allegations against O\u2019Leary would have led to.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Finally, \u201cin the context of this case, the value of the undisclosed information as admissible impeachment evidence would have been, at best, minimal\u201d <em>(Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d at 264). In addition to O\u2019Leary, Detective Walsh testified at the suppression hearing about defendant\u2019s confession and the circumstances surrounding it. Since Walsh\u2019s testimony largely corroborated O\u2019Leary\u2019s version of events, it is not reasonably probable that admission of the impeachment evidence would have resulted in the confession being suppressed. Moreover, the allegations concerned a collateral issue that was only tangentially relevant to defendant\u2019s prosecution. Defendant\u2019s confession was undoubtedly important to the People\u2019s case, but unlike the Appellate Division, we do not consider the circumstantial evidence connecting defendant to the killing so \u201cweak\u201d as to compel the conclusion that the allegations against O\u2019Leary constitute <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed and the order of County Court reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. In moving for reargument before the Appellate Division, the People asserted, for the first time, that further investigation had revealed that the Detective O\u2019Leary named in the federal lawsuit was not the same Detective O\u2019Leary who questioned defendant. Because such information is dehors the record, we must assume for the purposes of resolving this appeal that the O\u2019Leary in the federal litigation is the same detective who was involved in defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">.  As a preliminary matter, we note that, although County Court did not expressly state whether the contents of the civil complaint against Detective O\u2019Leary were material for purposes of <em>Brady, </em>our decisions in <em>People v LaFontaine </em>(92 NY2d 470 [1998]) and <em>People v Concepcion </em>(17 NY3d 192 [2011]) do not bar us from deciding the materiality of that information. To be sure, <em>LaFontaine </em>and its progeny preclude our review of an entirely distinct alternative ground for affirmance which the court of first instance did not decide adversely to the appellant <em>(see Concepcion, </em>17 NY3d at 196-197; <em>LaFontaine, </em>92 NY2d at 472-474). However, for purposes of LaFontaine\u2019s procedural bar, a court\u2019s finding that the prosecution did not constructively possess or suppress potential <em>Brady </em>information and a court\u2019s finding that the information is not material are not separate alternative grounds for decision, as neither finding is clearly separate and analytically distinct from the court\u2019s determination that the information does not satisfy the multipronged <em>Brady </em>standard. Thus, in this case, as in other cases involving a single multipronged legal ruling, <em>LaFontaine </em>does not prevent us from reviewing all preserved aspects of the <em>Brady </em>issue simply because the nisi prius court neglected to mention an element of the multifactor <em>Brady </em>test <em>(see generally People v Alfaro, </em>19 NY3d 1075, 1076-1077 [2012] [upon review of the trial court\u2019s multipronged <em>Molineux </em>ruling, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision by adopting a different theory than the one accepted by the trial court with respect to one prong of the analysis, implicitly rejecting the dissent\u2019s contention that <em>LaFontaine </em>prohibited affirmance based on the reevaluation of that prong]; <em>see also id. </em>at 1079-1080 [Lippman, Ch. J., dissenting]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">. Contrary to the view taken by Chief Judge Lippman in his concurrence, our decision in <em>Wright </em>does not conflict with this holding. In <em>Wright, </em>we held that the People committed a <em>Brady </em>violation by \u201cfail[ing] to inform the defendant that <em>the complainant </em>had previously operated as an informant for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>local police department\u201d (86 NY2d at 593-594 [emphasis added]). We determined that this information was clearly \u201cfavorable\u201d to the defendant because she could have used it to impeach police officers\u2019 testimony \u2014 which differed in critical respects from reports the officers prepared after the crime \u2014 by showing they had a \u201cmotive\u201d to favor the complainant\u2019s version of events <em>(id. </em>at 596). The information also \u201cwould have provided the defense with an explanation for the decision by the police to disbelieve, and subsequently to arrest, [the] defendant\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Accordingly, although \u201cthe witness in <em>Wright </em>was not acting as an informant in that case\u201d (Lippman, Ch. J., concurring op at 897), the <em>information </em>in the police\u2019s possession \u2014 that the complainant had previously been a police informant \u2014 was directly related to the defendant\u2019s prosecution for assaulting the complainant and, therefore, knowledge of that information could be imputed to the People <em>(see </em>86 NY2d at 598).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"AH5\">(concurring). I concur on the ground that the impeachment evidence at issue is not material under <em>Brady v Maryland (373 US 83 </em>[1963]). In light of that conclusion, there is no need to reach the question of whether the evidence was suppressed. However, since the majority resolves both of these prongs in the People\u2019s favor, I write separately to express my belief that Detective O\u2019Leary\u2019s knowledge of the allegations pending against him in the federal lawsuit should be imputed to the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The majority\u2019s determination that the evidence was not suppressed relies on the so-called \u201cunrelated criminal activity exception\u201d to the imputation doctrine, which provides that a police officer\u2019s secret knowledge of his own misconduct in an unrelated case is not imputable to the People <em>(Campiti v Matesanz, </em>186 F Supp 2d 29, 49 [D Mass 2002], <em>affd </em>333 F3d 317 [1st Cir 2003], <em>cert denied </em>540 US 931 [2003]; <em>see also e.g. People v Kinney, </em>107 AD3d 563, 564 [1st Dept 2013]; <em>People v Seeber, </em>94 AD3d 1335, 1336-1338 [3d Dept 2012]; <em>People v Ortega, </em>40 AD3d 394, 395 [1st Dept 2007]; <em>People v Roberson, </em>276 AD2d 446, 446 [1st Dept 2000]; <em>People v Johnson, </em>226 AD2d 828, 828-829 [3d Dept 1996]; <em>People v Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d 93 [1st Dept 1995]). The majority\u2019s interpretation of suppression under <em>Brady </em>is patently contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kyles v Whitley </em>(514 US 419 [1995]) and subverts <em>Brady\u2019s </em>fundamental concern with \u201cinsurfing] that the accused receives a fair trial\u201d <em>(People v Bryce, </em>88 NY2d 124, 129 [1996]; <em>Strickler v Greene, </em>527 US 263, 280-281 [1999]). At its core, the majority\u2019s suppression analysis relies on the problematic distinction \u201cbetween the nondisclosure of police misconduct \u2018which has some bearing on the case against the defendant,\u2019 and the nondisclosure of such material which has \u2018no relationship to the case against the defendant, except insofar as it would be used for impeachment purposes\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 889, quoting <em>Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d at 100). According to the majority, \u201cwhen a police officer engages in illegal conduct in the course of his or her investigation or prosecution of the defendant, knowledge of that misconduct may be imputed to the People for <em>Brady </em>purposes, regardless of the officer\u2019s motivation or the prosecutor\u2019s actual awareness\u201d (majority op at 888-889). On the other hand, when the misconduct is \u201ccollateral\u201d to defendant\u2019s case, the majority declares that the officer\u2019s private knowledge thereof is not subject to imputation <em>(see </em>majority op at 889).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">This distinction is arbitrary and illogical in the context of <em>Brady\u2019s </em>suppression prong. Ultimately, the majority\u2019s error lies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>in conflating imputation and materiality. The tangential nature of impeachment evidence has no bearing on whether a police officer\u2019s knowledge thereof is attributable to the People. By contrast, the degree to which an officer\u2019s bad acts may be characterized as collateral to a particular case is certainly relevant to determining whether the evidence is material, that is, whether the failure to disclose it \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial\u201d <em>(Kyles, </em>514 US at 434, quoting <em>United States v Bagley, </em>473 US 667, 678 [1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">In support of its suppression analysis, the majority invokes agency principles underlying the imputation doctrine, reasoning that a police officer is not acting as an \u201carm of the prosecution\u201d when he conceals his own wrongdoing in an unrelated case <em>(see </em>majority op at 887-888, 889). It is difficult to square this conclusory position with the majority\u2019s concession that an officer <em>is </em>considered a member of the prosecution team when he conceals ultra vires acts committed during the investigation or prosecution of the defendant <em>(see </em>majority op at 888-889). In both instances, it is the act of concealing evidence that constitutes the <em>Brady </em>violation. And in both instances, it is not the officer\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d as a member of law enforcement, but his role in the investigation and prosecution of defendant\u2019s case that brings the concealment within the ambit of <em>Brady (cf. United States v Stewart, </em>433 F3d 273, 298-299 [2d Cir 2006] [expert witness for the prosecution was not an \u201carm of the prosecution\u201d when he provided false testimony because he \u201cacted only in the capacity of an expert witness\u201d and was not \u201cin any way involved with the investigation or presentation of the case to the grand jury\u201d or development of prosecutorial strategy]).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In other words, the majority\u2019s appeal to agency principles</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">\u201cmisses the point of <em>Brady. </em>Perhaps the officer was not a state actor when he engaged in the underlying corrupt conduct, but he was a state actor when he testified against the defendant and concealed his misconduct from the defense. There can be no doubt that the officer knew that the evidence, which bears on his credibility, is favorable to the defense. If the evidence satisfies the standard of materiality, then his failure to disclose it violates <em>Brady\u201d </em>(Robert Hochman, <em>Brady v Maryland and the Search for Truth in Criminal Trials, </em>63 U Chi L Rev 1673, 1704 [1996]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">The majority\u2019s position ignores the police officer\u2019s independent obligation to disclose impeachment evidence and improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>conveys to the police the discretion to make the judgment call on what misconduct qualifies as \u201ccollateral.\u201d This result presents precisely the sort of danger <em>Kyles </em>sought to avoid, namely, the unconstitutional substitution of \u201cthe police for the prosecutor, and even for the courts themselves, as the final arbiters of the government\u2019s obligation to ensure fair trials\u201d <em>(Kyles, </em>514 US at 438).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Notably, while <em>Kyles </em>concerned suppressed evidence that related directly to the defendant\u2019s case, the Supreme Court said nothing to imply that the scope of imputable knowledge should be so limited. Rather, the Court simply held that <em>Brady </em>material includes information \u201cknown only to police investigators and not to the prosecution]\u201d <em>(Kyles, </em>514 US at 438). Therefore, \u201cthe individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 437). Contrary to the majority\u2019s position on the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cduty to learn,\u201d courts addressing prior bad acts of police witnesses have interpreted <em>Kyles </em>more broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">For example, in <em>Arnold v McNeil </em>(622 F Supp 2d 1294 [MD Fla 2009], <em>affd on op below </em>595 F3d 1324 [11th Cir 2010]), the District Court granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus after determining that the collateral, illegal acts of the lead detective in a drug prosecution, which were unknown to the trial prosecutor, constituted <em>Brady </em>material. Citing <em>Kyles, </em>the court held that the detective\u2019s \u201cknowledge of his own criminal conduct, constituting evidence that would be favorable to the defense, demonstrate [d] that the prosecution both \u2018possessed\u2019 favorable evidence . . . and \u2018suppressed\u2019 exculpatory or impeachment evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1316). That the detective\u2019s misconduct in <em>Arnold </em>did not occur in the course of investigating the petitioner\u2019s case, or participating in its prosecution, was not dispositive of the suppression issue. Instead, the collateral nature of the detective\u2019s corrupt behavior affected the court\u2019s assessment of whether the evidence was material. Ultimately, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">\u201cthe illegal activities of [the detective] (many of which were strikingly close to the drug offense for which [the petitioner] was prosecuted), which were occurring at the precise time he was identifying [the petitioner] as the perpetrator and then testifying against him at trial, and [the detective\u2019s] failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>disclose those activities to the prosecution so the prosecutor could disclose them to the defense, create[d] a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different\u201d (622 F Supp 2d at 1321 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Moreover, the detective \u201cwas clearly a key member of the prosecution team whose information and testimony was vital to secure the conviction\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1315). On these facts, not only was the detective\u2019s private knowledge of his own unrelated, unlawful acts imputed to the People, but it was also material under <em>Brady, </em>and the court granted the petitioner habeas relief <em>(id. </em>at 1322).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Similarly, the federal court in <em>Campiti v Matesanz </em>(186 F Supp 2d at 49) suggested that restricting imputation to police knowledge of misconduct committed in the instant case is untenable after <em>Kyles. </em>Indeed, after noting that a number of courts had \u201cabsolved the prosecution of responsibility for failing to disclose the unknown, unrelated criminal activity of its corrupt officers\u201d (Ca<em>mpiti, </em>186 F Supp 2d at 49, citing <em>United States v Rosner, </em>516 F2d 269 [2d Cir 1975]; <em>Commonwealth v Waters, </em>410 Mass 224, 229, 571 NE2d 399, 402 [1991]; <em>People v Vasquez, </em>214 AD2d 93 [1st Dept 1995]; <em>People v Johnson, </em>226 AD2d 828 [3d Dept 1996]), the <em>Campiti </em>court expressed doubt as to whether those cases remained good law <em>(see Campiti, </em>186 F Supp 2d at 49 [\u201cSince <em>Kyles </em>established the applicable rule, the Commonwealth is hard-pressed to argue that it lacked responsibility for [the officer\u2019s] failure to disclose his unlawful activity. The cases with similar factual circumstances cited by the Commonwealth were decided before <em>Kyles, </em>with the exception of <em>Johnson, </em>which did not cite or distinguish <em>Kyles\u201d]). </em>Ultimately, the <em>Brady </em>claim in <em>Campiti </em>was rejected based on lack of materiality alone, and the court declined to reach the \u201cknotty issue\u201d of imputation <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Applying <em>Kyles </em>in the manner proposed herein is also consistent with this Court\u2019s precedent regarding imputation in similar contexts. For instance, in <em>People v Wright </em>(86 NY2d 591 [1995]) the defendant argued that the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over evidence that a prosecution witness had a \u201chistory as a police informant\u201d constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation, warranting post-conviction relief <em>(id. </em>at 598). This Court agreed. We determined that the evidence \u201cwas both favorable and material to the defense\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In addition, the fact that the witness\u2019 previous status was known only to police did not excuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose it <em>(id., </em>citing <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 437). Of particular relevance here is that the witness in <em>Wright </em>was not acting as an informant in that case <em>(see </em>86 NY2d at 593-594). Therefore, the undisclosed information, like the federal civil rights allegations against O\u2019Leary, constituted impeachment evidence arising from a prior case. But in <em>Wright, </em>we found that the People constructively possessed the information. Furthermore, we analyzed the value of the impeachment evidence, i.e., its relevance to the outcome at trial, under the materiality prong of <em>Brady, </em>concluding that under the circumstances, the collateral evidence was sufficiently material to warrant vacatur of the conviction <em>(id. </em>at 596-597; <em>see also Seeber, </em>94 AD3d at 1338 [granting a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL 440.10 (1) (b) based on the misrepresentations of a State Police forensic scientist both in prior cases and the one sub judice; noting that \u201crequiring a defendant to demonstrate that the People were aware of the subject misrepresentation in order to prevail . . . potentially sets the stage for a situation where a truly innocent person, whose conviction was obtained solely upon the basis of admittedly falsified, manufactured or otherwise unreliable evidence, might remain in prison simply because the People were unaware ... of misfeasance on the part of a law enforcement representative\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In sum, the exception endorsed by the majority imposes limits on the imputation doctrine that are wholly inconsistent with <em>Kyles. </em>That decision stands for the proposition that favorable, material evidence known only to police officers involved in a criminal investigation is not exempt from Brady\u2019s disclosure requirements. Members of the prosecution team, including the police investigators such as Detective O\u2019Leary here, are subject to the same disclosure obligations; the knowledge of every member of the team is imputed to the prosecution. There is no rational basis for charging the People with a police officer\u2019s knowledge of his own misconduct in the defendant\u2019s case but not with wrongdoings perpetrated by the same officer in another context. Consideration of the collateral nature of an officer\u2019s prior bad acts is more properly undertaken at the materiality stage of the <em>Brady </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Frequently, the improper conduct will be tangential, or its impeachment value will be minimal in light of the strength of the other evidence of guilt, weighing in favor of a finding that its suppression was immaterial. Moreover, as here, lack of materiality will often obviate the need to reach the suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>prong <em>(see e.g. Campiti, </em>186 F Supp 2d at 49-50). But, in the event that both favorability and materiality tip in defendant\u2019s favor, the fact that the bad acts were perpetrated against a different suspect should not foreclose an otherwise meritorious <em>Brady </em>claim. The majority\u2019s flawed imputation analysis undermines the due process protections which the <em>Brady </em>doctrine enshrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">In light of the above, it is unnecessary to address issues concerning the extent of the People\u2019s obligation to investigate the prior alleged misdeeds of police officers assigned to a particular case. Here, the detective\u2019s knowledge of the allegations lodged against him by a suspect in a different case was sufficient to trigger the disclosure obligation. Therefore, defendant satisfied the suppression prong of the <em>Brady </em>test.</p>\n<author id=\"b956-6\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQF\">(concurring). We held in <em>People v LaFontaine </em>(92 NY2d 470 [1998]) and reaffirmed in <em>People v Concepcion </em>(17 NY3d 192 [2011]) that neither the Appellate Division nor our Court may consider, in a criminal appeal, issues that \u201cwere either decided in [the appellant\u2019s] favor or not ruled on\u201d by the court of first instance (LaFontaine, 92 NY2d at 474). Here, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion under CPL 440.10 solely on the ground that the prosecution had neither actual nor constructive knowledge of the allegations made in the federal complaint against Detective O\u2019Leary. It did not consider the question of whether those allegations were \u201cmaterial\u201d information \u2014 i.e. whether there was a reasonable probability that they would have changed the result of the case <em>(People v Fuentes, </em>12 NY3d 259, 263 [2009]). The Appellate Division, however, did consider the materiality issue, and found the information material. One might think that this was obvious <em>LaFontaine </em>error, and that <em>LaFontaine </em>likewise bars this Court from deciding materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">But the majority holds that there is a distinction, for <em>LaFontaine </em>purposes, between \u201cseparate alternative grounds for decision\u201d and mere prongs of a \u201csingle multipronged legal ruling\u201d (majority op at 895 n 2). This distinction (not mentioned, as far as I know, in any previous discussion of <em>LaFontaine) </em>puzzles me. How is an appellate court to decide what is a separate alternative ground for decision and what is a prong? Why were not the alternative grounds for decision in <em>LaFontaine </em>\u2014 the existence of, and the necessity for, a valid and applicable warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest \u2014 prongs of a ruling on the arrest\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>validity? Why were not the two issues in <em>Concepcion </em>\u2014 the existence of consent to the search and the applicability of the inevitable discovery doctrine \u2014 prongs of a ruling on whether the Fourth Amendment required suppression of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">I do not know. But I am not complaining. As I explained in my dissent in <em>Concepcion, </em>the <em>LaFontaine </em>rule itself makes little sense to me, and if followed consistently (which it has not been) it will work enormous mischief. I thus welcome the majority\u2019s limitation of the rule \u2014 a limitation which perhaps amounts to an effective overruling of <em>LaFontaine.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b957-5\">Judges Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge AbdusSalaam; Chief Judge Lippman concurs in result in an opinion in which Judges Smith and Rivera concur; Judge Smith in a separate concurring opinion in which Judge Pigott concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Order reversed and order of County Court, Suffolk County, reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
