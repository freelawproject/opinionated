Smart, his associate Robert Verstreate and his girlfriend, whom we shall call Jane Doe, planned to burglarize a house in the Town of Greece. The three would-be burglars got into defendant\u2019s car to drive in search of a target, and Doe fell asleep in the back seat. As Doe would later tell a grand jury, she awoke to discover that the car was idling, sans defendant and Verstreate, in the driveway of an unoccupied house. Suddenly, the owner of the house arrived, and Doe sounded the horn of defendant\u2019s car to alert defendant and Verstreate, whom she assumed to be inside, to the owner\u2019s return. Defendant and Verstreate emerged from the back of the house and came to the driveway, where they were confronted by the homeowner. When the homeowner questioned the two men about their presence on her property, they claimed that they were visiting a friend in the mistaken belief that he lived there. Defendant and Verstreate rejoined Doe in their car and drove away. The homeowner then entered the house, where she discovered that her belongings had been displaced and that some of her jewelry was missing. The homeowner called the police, who eventually arrested defendant, Verstreate and Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Doe cooperated with the authorities and testified before the grand jury, conveying the account of the burglary set forth above. Doe received full transactional immunity from prosecution concerning all criminal acts described in her testimony. Following Doe\u2019s testimony, the grand jurors indicted defendant and Verstreate on a charge of burglary in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 140.25 [2]). Subsequently, Doe was released from police custody on bail, and she absconded.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">On February 23, 2009, the People appeared in County Court and sought permission to admit Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence, alleging that defendant had forfeited his right to preclude the admission of that testimony by tampering with Doe. County Court held a hearing to determine the admissibility of Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony pursuant to <em>People v Geraci (85 </em>NY2d 359 [1995]) and <em>Matter of Holtzman v Hellenbrand and Sirois (Sirois) </em>(92 AD2d 405 [2d Dept 1983]).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">At the hearing, investigators from the local sheriffs department and the district attorney\u2019s office testified that Doe was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>drug addict with a history of prostitution, and as a result of criminal activities that were apparently unrelated to the instant case, four warrants had been issued for Doe\u2019s arrest. During the roughly two weeks between Doe\u2019s absconding and the start of the <em>Sirois </em>hearing, the investigators made extensive efforts to obtain Doe\u2019s appearance at trial. In particular, the investigators attempted to subpoena Doe at numerous addresses where she, her parents or her friends were known to have lived, and they called various telephone numbers associated with Doe and tried to learn her whereabouts from other police sources. However, the investigators\u2019 efforts proved unsuccessful, and Doe remained at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The People also put into evidence recordings of defendant\u2019s jailhouse telephone conversations which had occurred between Doe\u2019s disappearance and the hearing. The recordings showed that, on the day on which the investigators started searching for Doe, defendant called her and inquired as to whether she would testify against him at trial. When she suggested that she would do so, defendant stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to [w]ring you[r] fucking neck,\u201d and Doe replied, \u201cI got to get the fuck outta here.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Doe told defendant that she loved him, and he said, \u201c[W]e will find that out at the last week of this month.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that day, defendant asked Doe, via telephone, why she was going to \u201cgive them [his] life\u201d and \u201cthrow [his] life away.\u201d Doe answered, \u201c[N]othing much I can do except not show up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In the recorded telephone calls, defendant also had conversations with his mother which revealed that his mother was watching over Doe at his behest. In some of those conversations, defendant expressed his belief that he would avoid conviction if Doe did not appear at trial, and he urged his mother to either send Doe to visit her own mother in another state or to drive Doe elsewhere. However, in a later call, defendant\u2019s mother reported that Doe had deserted her, leaving her unaware of Doe\u2019s whereabouts. At this, defendant berated his mother for failing to effectively chaperone Doe and remove her from the reach of the authorities, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201c[U]nless if she calls you and you put her in that car and drive[,] you hit that New York line[,] then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>she\u2019s gonna[,] [i]f you don\u2019t do that she\u2019s gonna be at trial. . . now they wanted to do my trial in June. I didn\u2019t want to hold off until June because I thought you had it under wraps. That\u2019s why I called you this morning. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201c[I]f she gets a hold of you[,] you need to get her in the mother fucking car and go. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201c[S]he\u2019s gotta go, use the fucking credit card, I don\u2019t give a fuck, go to Florida, wherever you got to go. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u201c[I]f you can\u2019t do that they gonna bury me. If you can\u2019t get her out somewhere it ain\u2019t never gonna work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">In a subsequent series of calls, defendant\u2019s mother stated that she was trying to contact Doe to \u201ckeep her off the streets until her mother g[o]t[ ] here,\u201d and when defendant asked whether Doe was going to appear at trial, defendant\u2019s mother indicated that Doe might not appear. However, defendant\u2019s mother \u201c[didjn\u2019t wanna say\u201d more on that subject \u201cover the phone.\u201d In telephone conversations in the days leading up to the hearing, defendant expressed his belief that Doe would testify against him at trial and said that he no longer cared whether she showed up in court. Defendant\u2019s mother told him that Doe was \u201claying low so they c[ould]n\u2019t summons her,\u201d but defendant insisted that Doe would appear because she was working with the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The People presented most of the recorded telephone conversations and other evidence on the first day of the hearing. On the morning of the second day of the hearing, defense counsel announced that Doe was once again in police custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel asserted that Doe was now available to testify at trial and that therefore her grand jury testimony could not be used against defendant. The prosecutor, apparently learning of this development for the first time, expressed skepticism about the timing of Doe\u2019s return to police custody, noting that it was \u201cvery coincidental given the fact that [the parties] were in the middle of a hearing\u201d about \u201cthe possibility of her Grand Jury testimony being used against the defendant.\u201d At the prosecutor\u2019s urging, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the court continued the <em>Sirois </em>hearing, stating that Doe might still refuse to testify and that, \u201cif the Court d[id] find by clear and convincing evidence that [defendant] [wa]s responsible for that, then [the court] w[ould] deal with it at that time.\u201d The hearing resumed and the People presented the remainder of their evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Later at the hearing, Doe\u2019s attorney appeared in court. According to Doe\u2019s counsel, she had told him that she would assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to testify at defendant\u2019s trial. Counsel initially suggested that Doe wanted to avoid testifying because she had not received immunity from any perjury prosecution that might arise as a result of her testimony at the hearing and at trial. Doe\u2019s lawyer noted, however, that his client\u2019s stance was puzzling in light of the immunity she had received with respect to the serious burglary charges in this case, and that Doe might not fully understand the implications of her choice. Doe\u2019s counsel explained that she had \u201cmade adamantly clear to [counsel] she ha[d] no intention of testifying,\u201d adding, \u201c[I]mmunity, no immunity, whichever, she does[,] she does not intend to testify.\u201d Doe\u2019s attorney later reiterated that she had \u201crepeatedly made clear her intention to not offer any testimony no matter what is it [sic] said to her by anybody.\u201d Doe did not appear in court to explain her refusal to testify, and the parties agreed to allow Doe\u2019s counsel to leave the courtroom without further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">After hearing extensive argument from the parties regarding whether the People had proved that defendant had wrongfully procured Doe\u2019s unavailability by coercing her into invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege, the court granted the People\u2019s motion to admit Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence at trial. After summarizing the hearing testimony and the telephone calls, the court found that defendant, \u201cacting in concert with his mother[,] pressured the witness\u2019s unavailability up to today through threats and chicanery, among other things, encouraging his mother to keep [Doe] away from trial.\u201d Commenting on one of the recorded telephone conversations between defendant and Doe, the court said, \u201cObviously, [this shows] the influence of the defendant on this woman.\u201d The court noted: \u201cThe fact she is here is moot [sic]. [Doe\u2019s lawyer] stated on the record she is not going to testify. She is so unavailable.\u201d The court concluded that the People had more than carried their burden at the hearing, saying, \u201cThe Court finds this is beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d At the end of the <em>Sirois </em>hearing, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>granted codefendant Verstreate\u2019s severance motion and severed his trial from defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">At trial, the People submitted Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony for the jury\u2019s consideration, and they called the owner of the burglarized home to the stand. Defendant attempted to call Doe to the stand, and she refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, sobbing as she left the stand. Defendant then testified on his own behalf, claiming that Doe had burglarized the house. According to defendant, he and Verstreate had been returning the property stolen by Doe when the homeowner confronted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The jury returned a verdict convicting defendant as charged. Defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict pursuant to CPL 330.30, renewing his argument that the court had erroneously admitted Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence because Doe had evidently refused to testify to avoid incriminating herself and not in response to defendant\u2019s misdeeds. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate prison term of from 20 years to life. The Appellate Division modified the judgment of conviction as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by reducing defendant\u2019s sentence to an indeterminate prison term of from 15 years to life, and otherwise affirmed <em>(see People v Smart, </em>100 AD3d 1473, 1473-1476 [4th Dept 2012]). Although two Justices dissented from the court\u2019s decision to reduce defendant\u2019s sentence <em>(see id. </em>at 1476-1480 [Scudder, P.J., dissenting in part]), the court unanimously rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court had erred in admitting Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence, reasoning that \u201c[t]he People [had] presented clear and convincing evidence establishing that misconduct by defendant and his mother, who acted at defendant\u2019s behest, caused the witness to be unavailable to testify at trial\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1474). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (21 NY3d 914 [2013]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Under the Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and article I, \u00a7 6 of the State Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him or her <em>(see </em>US Const Amend VI; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6; <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 678 [1986]; <em>People v Rawlins, </em>10 NY3d 136, 146 [2008]). The confrontation right is critical to the fairness of a trial because it \u201c \u2018ensur[es] the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>trier of fact\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Wrotten, </em>14 NY3d 33, 39 [2009], quoting <em>Maryland v Craig, </em>497 US 836, 845 [1990]). Given this important right, an unavailable witness\u2019s grand jury testimony, which by definition has not been subjected to confrontation, generally may not be admitted at trial on the People\u2019s direct case <em>(see Geraci, </em>85 NY2d at 365; <em>see also People v Green, </em>78 NY2d 1029, 1030 [1991]). However, \u201cwhere it has been shown that the defendant procured the witness\u2019s unavailability through violence, threats or chicanery,\u201d the defendant \u201cmay not assert either the constitutional right of confrontation or the evidentiary rules against the admission of hearsay in order to prevent the admission of the witness\u2019s out-of-court declarations,\u201d including the witness\u2019s grand jury testimony <em>(Geraci, </em>85 NY2d at 365-366; <em>see People v Bosier, </em>6 NY3d 523, 527-528 [2006]; <em>see also Giles v California, </em>554 US 353, 359-361 [2008]; <em>Davis v Washington, </em>547 US 813, 833-834 [2006]; <em>United States v Stewart, </em>485 F3d 666, 670 [2d Cir 2007]). This forfeiture rule, as articulated in <em>Geraci, </em>is based on sound public policy meant to prevent the defendant from taking advantage of his or her own wrongdoing and to protect the integrity of the proceedings by deterring the defendant from acting on the strong incentive to tamper with adverse witnesses <em>(see Geraci, </em>85 NY2d at 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The People may not admit a witness\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence merely because the defendant expressed hope that the witness would not testify against him or her at trial. Rather, the People must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant engaged in misconduct aimed at least in part at preventing the witness from testifying and that those misdeeds were a significant cause of the witness\u2019s decision not to testify <em>(see id. </em>at 366-368; <em>People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 456, 462 [1997]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because witness tampering is a surreptitious activity rarely admitted by the defendant or the witness, few cases will involve direct evidence of this causal link between the defendant\u2019s misconduct and the witness\u2019s refusal to testify or failure to appear in court <em>(see id. </em>at 369; <em>People v Cotto, </em>92 NY2d 68, 76-77 [1998]). Therefore, at a hearing held pursuant to <em>Sirois </em>and <em>Geraci, </em>the court may infer the requisite causation from the evidence of the defendant\u2019s coercive behavior and the actions taken by the witness in direct response to or within a close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>temporal proximity to that misconduct <em>(see Sirois, </em>92 AD2d at 415 [requiring the People to allege facts demonstrating only a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that defendant\u2019s misconduct caused a witness not to testify to obtain a hearing and permitting admission of grand jury testimony upon proof of misconduct and the absence of the witness in a manner suggestive of causation]; <em>see also People v Encarnacion, </em>87 AD3d 81, 85-89 [1st Dept 2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 952 [2011]; <em>see generally Commonwealth v Edwards, </em>444 Mass 526, 540-542, 830 NE2d 158, 170-172 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Here, the People proved by clear and convincing evidence that defendant committed misconduct, and the court drew a permissible record-based inference that defendant\u2019s wrongful actions were designed to prevent Doe from testifying at trial. For example, in recorded telephone conversations, Doe initially indicated to defendant that she might testify, and in response, defendant threatened to \u201c[w]ring [her] fucking neck.\u201d Defendant then said that it would be a \u201cgood idea\u201d for Doe to leave town. By threatening Doe with violence in response to her avowed willingness to testify and encouraging her to disappear, defendant obviously sought to prevent Doe from testifying at trial and from continuing her cooperation with the police. To achieve that same goal, defendant repeatedly urged his mother to remove Doe from the state so that Doe could not testify against him. Indeed, defendant\u2019s telephone conversations with his mother generally indicated that his mother was watching over Doe and giving her drugs at defendant\u2019s request to keep Doe away from court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">To be sure, defendant told Doe at one point to turn herself in and eventually expressed resignation to the fact that Doe would appear in court after his mother lost track of her. But those statements merely reflected defendant\u2019s recognition that Doe was cooperating with the police and that therefore his efforts to convince her not to testify might prove futile. Even assuming defendant wavered at times in his desire to stop Doe from testifying, the totality of the calls still revealed his desire, at least \u201cin part,\u201d to forestall Doe\u2019s potential trial testimony <em>(Maher, </em>89 NY2d at 462). Ultimately, the trial court, which was in the best position to choose among competing inferences of intent raised by the evidence, properly concluded that defendant meant to pressure Doe not to testify <em>(see Cotto, </em>92 NY2d at 76-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In addition, the record evidence of defendant\u2019s misconduct and Doe\u2019s responsive actions supports the court\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that defendant procured Doe\u2019s unavailability in the period leading up to the <em>Sirois </em>hearing. When Doe told defendant that she planned to testify, defendant threatened to wring her neck, and she immediately responded to his threat regarding her testimony by saying that she would \u201cget the fuck outta here,\u201d thus suggesting that defendant\u2019s threat had caused her to change her mind about testifying and to consider becoming a fugitive. In a follow-up call, defendant\u2019s complaints about Doe\u2019s potential testimony again persuaded her not to testify; when defendant accused Doe of trying to \u201cthrow [his] life away\u201d by testifying, Doe answered, \u201c[N]othing much I can do except not show up.\u201d Thus, the People demonstrated not only that defendant committed misconduct aimed at keeping Doe from testifying, but also that the misconduct had its intended effect insofar as it convinced her not to appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">When viewed in the context of defendant\u2019s successful efforts to keep Doe out of court up until the middle of the hearing, Doe\u2019s decision not to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds was plainly caused in part by defendant\u2019s malfeasance. Initially, as the prosecutor below observed, the timing of Doe\u2019s appearance halfway through a <em>Sirois </em>hearing tended to suggest that defendant had influenced her to come to court and take the Fifth. On the first day of the hearing, the People presented compelling evidence of defendant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s attempts to keep Doe out of court, creating the strong possibility that Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony would be admitted against defendant on forfeiture-by-wrongdoing grounds. The next day, Doe, who had evaded veteran investigators for weeks and reacted to defendant\u2019s threats by promising not to testify, suddenly returned to custody and then asserted her right to remain silent. In doing so, Doe appeared at the perfect moment to save defendant from the impending admission of her damning grand jury testimony, thus lending some credence to the notion that she was continuing to respond to defendant\u2019s entreaties by withholding her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Doe\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements provided further record support for the inference that defendant\u2019s threats and cajoling motivated Doe to refuse to testify. As was evident from her attorney\u2019s representations on her behalf, Doe did not refuse to testify solely because she lacked immunity from prosecution for perjury or other charges and thus feared incriminating herself. Regardless of any self-incrimination concern, Doe \u201cmade clear her intention to not offer any testimony no matter what\u201d was \u201csaid to her by anybody.\u201d Taken together with the proof of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>misconduct, Doe\u2019s reported admission that fear of self-incrimination was not prompting her refusal to testify logically suggested that she had another motivation: her love or fear of defendant, or both, which he had aroused by his threats and pleas in a deliberate attempt to keep her off the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Furthermore, while Doe herself did not tell the court her reasons for refusing to testify, that circumstance did not undermine the evidence that Doe refrained from testifying in response to defendant\u2019s misconduct and not just to serve her own interest in avoiding self-incrimination. Doe presumably had authorized her attorney, as her agent <em>(see People v Brown, </em>98 NY2d 226, 231-233 [2002]), to assert the privilege against self-incrimination on her behalf and to state the purported basis on which she had decided to take that action, and thus the court properly relied on the attorney\u2019s representations regarding Doe\u2019s decision to remain off the witness stand. Indeed, at the <em>Sirois </em>hearing, defendant never disputed that Doe\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements were made at her direction and genuinely reflected her asserted reasons for remaining silent. Thus, it may be assumed that, had Doe appeared in person to answer questions about her invocation of her privilege against self-incrimination, she would have echoed the substance of her attorney\u2019s account of her decision, and the court had no reason to demand a ritualistic repetition of those statements from Doe. Given that the existing evidence sufficed to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s chicanery caused Doe\u2019s unavailability at trial, the People were not obligated to call Doe to the stand to establish the admissibility of her grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony should have been excluded because she had a lawful basis for asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege. The <em>Geraci </em>rule is designed to deter improper attempts to induce a witness not to testify, and therefore the rule\u2019s application depends on whether the defendant has procured the witness\u2019s unavailability and not on whether the witness\u2019s refusal to testify would be lawful in the absence of the defendant\u2019s illicit influence. Were the rule otherwise, a defendant could effectively suppress a witness\u2019s testimony without fear of the evidentiary consequences by holding a gun, proverbial or literal, to the witness\u2019s head and demanding that the witness invoke a testimonial privilege which the witness might lawfully assert under different circumstances. We refuse to allow defendants to abuse witnesses\u2019 rights for the purpose of unjustly evading Geraci\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sanction in such a manner <em>(see Edwards, </em>444 Mass at 541-542, 830 NE2d at 171-172 [finding that \u201ca defendant\u2019s intentional procurement of a witness\u2019s unavailability through collusion will constitute a per se wrongdoing sufficient to trigger the doctrine (of forfeiture of the bar against admission of grand jury testimony), even if the collusion is carried out through lawful means\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are premised on the notion that unless Doe admitted that she was invoking her right to remain silent under pressure from defendant or there was some direct proof that defendant actually instructed Doe to take the Fifth, the trial court could neither blame him for her refusal to testify nor put her grand jury testimony into evidence. However, because the People \u201coften have nothing more to rely upon than circumstantial proof\u201d of the basis for the witness\u2019s refusal to testify, \u201cit would be unrealistic and unnecessarily rigid to adopt\u201d the \u201cformulate]\u201d requirement of direct evidence or a witness\u2019s admission, which \u201cwould make it impossible to establish the necessary foundation\u201d for the admission of a witness\u2019s prior statements \u201cin so many cases\u201d <em>(Geraci, </em>85 NY2d at 369). Instead, we think it better to follow the flexible approach reflected in certain decisions of the Appellate Division which rely heavily on circumstantial evidence and the sequence of events to determine a defendant\u2019s role in compelling a witness not to testify <em>(see e.g. Encarnacion, </em>87 AD3d at 85-89; <em>People v Clarke, </em>55 AD3d 1447, 1448 [4th Dept 2008], <em>lv denied 11 </em>NY3d 923 [2009]). The opinions in those cases comport with the Appellate Division\u2019s leading decision in this area, <em>Sirois, </em>which establishes a pragmatic framework for the admission <em>of </em>a witness\u2019s grand jury testimony based on inferences to be drawn from clear and convincing proof of the defendant\u2019s misconduct, the witness\u2019s unavailability and the surrounding circumstances, rather than making the defendant\u2019s or the witness\u2019s admissions an absolute foundational requirement <em>(Sirois, </em>92 AD2d at 415).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Finally, <em>People v Hamilton </em>(70 NY2d 987 [1988]), upon which defendant relies, is distinguishable from this case. In <em>Hamilton, </em>a witness testified in the grand jury that the defendant had made incriminating statements to her <em>(see id. </em>at 988). However, before trial, she told the court that she would not testify on Fifth Amendment grounds <em>(see id.). </em>At a <em>Sirois </em>hearing, the witness maintained that the defendant had no involvement in her refusal to testify at trial and that the police had pressured her into lying to the grand jury, and the witness\u2019s sister corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>those assertions <em>(see id.). A </em>police officer testified that the police never coerced the witness into testifying in the grand jury <em>(see id.). </em>At the hearing, the prosecutor admitted that the witness had told the prosecutor that she had not been threatened by anyone <em>(see id.). </em>On that record, we concluded that the witness\u2019s grand jury testimony was inadmissible because the People had failed to \u201cproduce any evidence that defendant had threatened [the witness]\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Here, unlike in <em>Hamilton, </em>the People adduced ample evidence at the hearing that defendant had attempted to convince Doe not to testify, including telephone conversations in which he pleaded with her to flee from the authorities who were seeking her presence at trial and threatened to harm her if she testified. Additionally, in contrast to the absence of evidence of causation in <em>Hamilton, </em>there was clear and convincing circumstantial evidence here that defendant\u2019s entreaties were a cause of Doe\u2019s refusal to testify, and thus the trial court properly ruled that defendant had forfeited his right to preclude the admission of Doe\u2019s grand jury testimony by his wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">. At some point during this conversation, defendant also suggested that Doe turn herself in to the police, and Doe declined, indicating that she feared suffering from withdrawal symptoms in police custody as a result of her recent drug use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">. The record does not indicate whether the police located and arrested Doe in the course of their investigation or she turned herself in.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. Of course, the <em>Geraci </em>rule also permits the inclusion of a witness\u2019s prior statements in the trial evidence when other individuals acting on the defendant\u2019s behalf and with his knowing acquiescence commit misconduct rendering the witness unavailable <em>(see Maher, </em>89 NY2d at 461).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b283-6\">Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"A8f\">(concurring). I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record supports the affirmed finding that defendant procured the witness\u2019s unavailability through the first day of the <em>Sirois </em>hearing. However, the situation changed overnight when the witness appeared in court and asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. I write separately because I believe that the trial court failed to focus fully on the relevant issue once she was physically present\u2014 whether the witness\u2019s refusal to testify was due to defendant\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">As the majority relates, defendant and his mother plainly set about to prevent the witness from coming to court. Rarely will we have tape-recorded conversations laying out such a roadmap of a campaign of threats and pleas designed to induce a witness to absent herself from trial. However, I am concerned about other aspects of this case. A prosecutor may very well be content with relying on the known, favorable, prior-recorded testimony of an unsavory witness. A defendant\u2019s vaunted constitutional right of confrontation can and should be protected in such instances by the vigilance of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The purpose of the <em>Sirois </em>hearing is to ensure that statements untested by cross-examination will be admitted \u201conly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>where the requisite link between the defendant\u2019s misconduct and the witness\u2019s silence has been established\u201d <em>(People v Johnson, </em>93 NY2d 254, 258 [1999]). Here, by contrast, virtually the entire hearing was devoted to the issue of defendant\u2019s responsibility for the witness\u2019s <em>physical </em>unavailability. Once she actually appeared, rendering the attempt to keep her away from trial unsuccessful, the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry should have shifted. At that point, the prosecutor represented that the witness \u2014 a subject of open warrants \u2014 had been arrested the night before in a highly intoxicated condition. A court presented with this dramatic turn of events might well be behooved to inquire more deeply into the reason behind the witness\u2019s refusal to testify, including any basis for her invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Instead, here, the court made only a brief inquiry of the witness\u2019s counsel, who represented that the witness intended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. Somewhat to the contrary, he also related that the witness had made clear that she would not testify regardless of whether the People offered her immunity with respect to her testimony at the hearing. He further expressed that he was having some difficulty explaining the situation to her, in light of the fact that she already had transactional immunity for the underlying charges, and noted that it was a \u201cvery chaotic\u201d and \u201cstressful\u201d atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Without making any direct inquiry of the witness, the court determined that her physical presence was \u201cmoot\u201d and found her unavailable based on her refusal to testify. The court held that defendant had \u201cpressured the witness\u2019s unavailability up to today through threats and chicanery.\u201d Upon this record, the Appellate Division found that the People had presented clear and convincing evidence that defendant and his mother had \u201ccaused the witness to be unavailable to testify at trial\u201d (100 AD3d 1473, 1474 [4th Dept 2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Before imposing a forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to confrontation, the trial court should make certain that the penalty is warranted <em>(see People v Maher, 89 </em>NY2d 456, 461-462 [1997]). However, under the circumstances of this case, where the evidence of witness tampering was overwhelming and there was apparently no valid basis for invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, the satisfaction of <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>requirement of a nexus between the defendant\u2019s misconduct and the witness\u2019s silence is implicit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur with Judge Abdus-Salaam; Chief Judge Lippman concurs in result in an opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
