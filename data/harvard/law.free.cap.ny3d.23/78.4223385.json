II. Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (b) (4), by way of plain language and legislative intent, entitles David Kaslow to the same application of credited service as a Tier 2 plan member and therefore entitles Mr. Kaslow to the same civilian service credit that applies to Tier 2. <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669; <em>Matter of Schriro v New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>63 AD2d 751; <em>Matter of Orens v Novello, </em>99 NY2d 180; <em>Matter of Auerbach v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>86 NY2d 198; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205.) III. Legislative history also supports that the Tier 3 CO-20 plan did not forfeit credit for civilian service. IV By forfeiting credit for civilian time, the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System has diminished David Kaslow\u2019s pension in violation of article V \u00a7 7 of the New York Constitution. <em>(Ballentine v Koch, </em>89 NY2d 51; <em>Matter of Guzman v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>45 NY2d 186; <em>Kranker v Levitt, </em>30 NY2d 574.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b138-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Petitioner David Kaslow (Kaslow), a member of the Tier 3 CO-20 retirement plan established by Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (hereafter, the Tier 3 CO-20 plan), retired from his position as a correction officer with the New York City Department of Correction (DOC) on July 2, 2009. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Kaslow\u2019s pension is defined in its entirety by Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (c) (2). As a result, the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System (NYCERS) properly did not consider Kaslow\u2019s previous civilian service with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) when calculating his pension benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Kaslow worked at DEP as a storekeeper from September 1987 until April 1991. While employed at DEI) he was a Tier 4 NYCERS member. On April 25, 1991, however, Kaslow was appointed a correction officer at DOC. Because he was first employed at DOC after December 19, 1990, when the statute establishing the Tier 3 CO-20 plan took effect, Kaslow was required to become a plan participant as of the date of his appointment <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [b] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>[4];<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> L 1990, ch 936, \u00a7 6). The Tier 3 CO-20 plan provides for a half-pay pension after 20 years of uniformed service and, for correctional service beyond 20 and up to a maximum of 30 years, an additional benefit of one sixtieth of final average salary per year of service <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [c] [2]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In 2001, Kaslow bought back service credit for three years of military service <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 1000 [allowing members of the state\u2019s public retirement systems to purchase up to three years of service credit for military service rendered during periods of military conflict]). As a result, Kaslow\u2019s earliest retirement date was in 2008 and, beginning in 2006, he periodically sought pension benefit estimates from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>NYCERS. Kaslow repeatedly inquired as to what pension benefit he would receive for his three-plus years of civilian service at DEI] and different NYCERS personnel just as repeatedly advised him that this service did not factor into the calculation of his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On December 8, 2008, an attorney at the law firm that represents Kaslow\u2019s union wrote to NYCERS, stating that her \u201cinquiry pertain[ed] to how NYCERS [would] credit! ] . . . the [time] that [Kaslow] worked for the DEP\u201d when determining his pension benefit. She noted that Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (b) (4) \u201centitled [Kaslow] to have the term \u2018credited service\u2019 applied to him in the same manner as it would be applied to\u201d a correction officer in Tier 2 who opted into the CO-20 retirement plan established by Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 445-a (hereafter, the Tier 2 CO-20 plan). The Tier 2 CO-20 plan, like the Tier 3 CO-20 plan, went into effect on December 19, 1990. The attorney took the position that since the benefit formula for these Tier 2 correction officers counts civilian service with the City of New York (the City or City) pursuant to New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 13-155 (a) (3) (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kaslow was likewise entitled to a pension benefit for his service at DEE</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">By letter dated March 25, 2009, NYCERS\u2019 general counsel responded that the \u201clook back\u201d to section 13-155 of the Administrative Code was only for purposes of defining service as \u201callowable service\u201d in the City\u2019s uniformed correction force, which would include service in DOC, or in, for example, the Police or Fire or Sanitation Departments immediately preceding service in DOC. She explained that Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (c) (2) governed the computation of Kaslow\u2019s pension benefit under the Tier 3 CO-20 plan, and this provision does not take civilian government employment into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In June 2009, Kaslow applied for retirement from DOC to take effect on July 2, 2009. On November 12, 2009, NYCERS informed Kaslow that his retirement had been approved, and that he would receive a total annual pension benefit of $54,640.19 ($4,553.34 per month). Meanwhile, in October 2009 Kaslow commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding against the City and NYCERS. He asked Supreme Court to declare unlawful NYCERS\u2019 refusal to credit his DEP service \u201cat the rate of 75% of l/60th of his final average salary per year of DEP service\u201d (c<em>f. </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 13-155 [a] [3] [c]);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to direct NYCERS to recalculate his pension to include his DEP service; and to enjoin NYCERS from refusing to grant service credit \u201cat the rate of 75% of l/60th of final average salary per year of civilian service.\u201d In a short-form order dated April 6, 2011, Supreme Court granted Kaslow\u2019s petition \u201cin its entirety,\u201d and directed NYCERS to \u201crecalculate [Kaslow\u2019s] pension to include his DEP service.\u201d The City and NYCERS appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In a decision and order dated January 16, 2013, the Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that NYCERS\u2019 interpretation of the term \u201ccredited service\u201d in section 504-a of the Retirement and Social Security Law was \u201cirrational, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the other applicable statutes governing the retirement benefits of officers employed with the DOC\u201d (102 AD3d 785, 786 [2d Dept 2013], citing Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7\u00a7 504-a [b], [c]; 445-a; Administrative Code \u00a7 13-155 [a] [3] [c]). Thus, the court continued, \u201cfor purposes of calculating his retirement benefits, [Kaslow] was entitled to have his credited service include his civilian service\u201d with the City <em>(id.). </em>We subsequently granted the City and NYCERS leave to appeal (21 NY3d 854 [2013]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">NYCERS is the public employee retirement system responsible for administering the retirement programs for employees of the City and various City-related participating employers (e.g., the City University of New York) <em>(see generally </em>L 1920, ch 427). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>City employees become members of NYCERS, which manages the system\u2019s invested funds and determines and pays out benefits to retirees according to requirements established by state and city law. In general, a member\u2019s retirement benefits vary by tier and plan, which are determined by date of membership and job title, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The legislature adopted the Tier 2 CO-20 and Tier 3 CO-20 plans to bring city correction officers below the rank of captain into rough parity with other uniformed city employees (in particular, police and firefighters), who already enjoyed a 20-year half-pay retirement plan <em>(see </em>Sponsors\u2019 Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1990, ch 936 at 17). This pension improvement was to be paid for by increased employee contributions <em>(id.). </em>Prior to chapter 936\u2019s enactment, Tier 2 and 3 correction officers were eligible to retire before the normal retirement age without benefit reduction, but only after 25 years of service. The eligibility requirements and benefit calculations for these plans differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Tier 2 correction officers<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were entitled to an unreduced pension upon completion of 25 years of uniformed correction service <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 13-155 [b] [a correction member may elect \u201cto contribute on the basis of a minimum retirement period of twenty-five years of <em>allowable service rendered in such correction force\u201d </em>(emphasis added)]). That is, NYCERS only credited service in the uniformed force of DOC or in another uniformed force <em>(e.g. </em>New York City Housing Police, Transit Police, Department of Sanitation, Police Department or Fire Department) immediately prior to the employee\u2019s appointment at DOC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NYCERS <em>excluded </em>non-uniformed state or city public service (if any) when determining a Tier 2 correction officer\u2019s eligibility for 25-year early service retirement. As noted earlier, though, such service would figure into the calculation of the Tier 2 correction officer\u2019s pension benefit <em>(see supra </em>at 82 n 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">By contrast, NYCERS credited service with both uniformed and non-uniformed state and city employers when determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the eligibility of Tier 3 correction officers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for 25-year early service retirement. Indeed, section 501 (3) of the Retirement and Social Security Law defines \u201c[c]redited service\u201d for purposes of article 14 (Tier 3) to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201call service which has been credited to a member pursuant to section [513] or which was credited to such member in a public retirement system of the state before such member became subject to this article and which is allowable as previous service pursuant to section [513].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 513, entitled \u201cCredit for service,\u201d generally provides in subdivision (b) for credit for most public service rendered in the state or City.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 25-year early service retirement benefit for Tier 3 correction officers is 50% of final average salary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">It was against this backdrop that the legislature in chapter 936 created three new 20-year early service retirement plans for correction officers below the rank of captain: the \u201coptional\u201d Tier 2 CO-20 plan for incumbent Tier 2 correction officers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>elected to participate <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 445-a [b] [2]); the Tier 3 CO-20 plan for incumbent Tier 3 correction officers and anyone who was subject to article 14 prior to December 19, 1990 and subsequently became employed as a correction officer, also an elective program <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [b] [1], [2]); and the Tier 3 CO-20 plan for correction officers who first became subject to the provisions of article 14 after December 19, 1990, who were mandated to join <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [b] [4]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The kind of service that fulfills the requirement for 20 years of \u201ccredited service\u201d varies by tier and, within Tier 3, by the date when the correction officer first became a Tier 3 employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As noted earlier, NYCERS has always interpreted \u201ccredited service\u201d for Tier 1 and 2 correction officers to be limited to \u201callowable correction service\u201d \u2014 i.e, uniformed service only. And NYCERS has also always interpreted \u201ccredited service\u201d for Tier 3 correction officers, as directed in Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7\u00a7 501 (3) and 513, to include both uniformed and non-uniformed service with the state and City. Chapter 936 does not change this service-crediting distinction between Tiers 2 and 3 <em>except </em>with respect to those correction officers who, like Kaslow, first became subject to article 14 after December 19, 1990. For these Tier 3 employees,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cthe term \u2018credited service\u2019 [shall be] applied to him or her in the same manner as such term would be applied to a similarly situated correction officer . . . who is governed by article eleven of this chapter, and who is a participant in the twenty-year improved benefit retirement program pursuant to section four hundred forty-five-a of such article eleven\u201d (Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [b] [4]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Thus, NYCERS argues, for post-December 19, 1990 Tier 3 CO-20 plan members, unlike the other participants in Tier 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>CO-20 plans established by chapter 936, only allowable correction service (i.e., uniformed service) counts towards eligibility for 20-year early service retirement because this is the only kind of service that has ever been considered \u201ccredited service\u201d for Tier 2 correction members, as the legislature knew.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This limitation on eligibility makes sense because, insofar as the 20-year half-pay retirement benefit was to be funded by plan participants, the legislature would naturally want to make new Tier 3 correction officers pay the additional member contributions for the maximum 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Kaslow does not dispute that \u201ccredited service\u201d means \u201callowable correction service\u201d (i.e., uniformed service) for purposes of his benefit eligibility. Rather, he interprets the reference to \u201ccredited service\u201d in section 504-a (b) (4) more broadly so as also to encompass and incorporate the Tier 2 benefit calculation formula in section 13-155 (a) (3) of the Administrative Code, as modified by article 11. Thus, he reasons, since a Tier 2 correction officer\u2019s 20-year service pension includes a calculation for non-uniformed government service, his pension should, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">NYCERS responds that section 504-a (c) (2) specifies the entire pension benefit for participants in the Tier 3 CO-20 plan, and this provision does not include a component to reflect any previous civilian government service; that \u201ccredited service\u201d is a term of art referring to the kind of service that counts towards pension eligibility; and that, as a result, the reference to \u201ccredited service\u201d in section 504-a (b) (4) simply reflects the legislature\u2019s intention to apply Tier 2 service eligibility rules to employees covered by that provision. Further, NYCERS adds, section 13-155 (a) of the Administrative Code, which Kaslow relies on, specifies that credited service is <em>\u201callowable service rendered in the uniformed correction </em>force\u201d (emphasis added), and the pension formula in section 13-155 (a) (3) uses the word \u201ccredited\u201d with reference to a correction officer\u2019s uniformed service, and the word \u201cacquired\u201d \u2014 not \u201ccredited\u201d \u2014 with respect to City-service <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 13-155 [a] [3] [a]-[c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">NYCERS\u2019 interpretation of the meaning of \u201ccredited service\u201d in the context of section 504-a (b) (4) and the Tier 3 CO-20 program enjoys a degree of deference <em>(see Matter of Suffolk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Regional Off-Track Betting Corp. v New York State Racing &amp; Wagering Bd., </em>11 NY3d 559, 567 [2008] [\u201cEven if no deference is owed to an agency\u2019s reading of a statute, a court can nevertheless defer to an agency\u2019s definition of a term of art contained within a statute\u201d]). What constitutes \u201ccredited service\u201d obviously differs from plan to plan, and NYCERS is the expert agency vested by the legislature with the authority to manage the City\u2019s complex public employee retirement plans <em>(see Matter of New York State Superfund Coalition, Inc. v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, </em>18 NY3d 289, 296 [2011] [\u201cCourts regularly defer to the governmental agency charged with the responsibility for administration of (a) statute in those cases where interpretation or application involves knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Moreover, NYCERS\u2019 explanation of how section 504-a (b) (4) applies and fits into the overall statutory design is coherent and reasonable. By contrast, Kaslow\u2019s interpretation conflicts with Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a (c) (2), which provides, as a pension component, for an amount equal to one sixtieth of the final average salary for uniformed DOC service beyond 20 years <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 504-a [c] [2] [i] [B]). But section 13-155 (a) (3) (c) of the Administrative Code, as modified by article 11, calls for an amount equal to <em>75% of one sixtieth </em>of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of such post-20 year DOC service plus the number of years of previous non-uniformed service. Kaslow\u2019s proposed pick-and-choose approach \u2014 claiming a benefit for non-uniformed service under section 13-155 (a) (3) (c) but electing to apply the higher fraction in section 504-a (c) (2) (i) (B) to compute the amount owed him for additional correction service \u2014 would maximize his pension but does not create a harmonious whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Order reversed, with costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">.
