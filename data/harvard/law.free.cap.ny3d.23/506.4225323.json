A defendant is nevertheless entitled, upon request, to an instruction that if the jury finds that the BAC was as the expert testified, it may find that the defendant was not intoxicated. Defendant here requested only the \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d instruction to which she was not entitled, and we therefore affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Defendant was stopped for speeding. She was given a breath test approximately an hour and 20 minutes after she was stopped, and was found to have a BAC of .09%. She was prosecuted for driving while intoxicated (DWI) under two different theories \u2014 so-called \u201cper se\u201d and \u201ccommon law\u201d DWI. Both names can be confusing. The \u201cper se\u201d crime is defined by Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (2) as driving while the driver \u201chas .08 of one per centum or more by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood as shown by chemical analysis.\u201d Despite the per se label, a valid blood test showing a result of .08% or more does not require conviction under this section; a defendant may try to show that her BAC was lower when she was driving than at the time she took the test <em>(People v Mertz, </em>68 NY2d 136 [1986]).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The \u201ccommon law\u201d crime is actually statutory, as all crimes are today, but the statute creating it, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3), says only that \u201c[n]o person shall operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition,\u201d and case law has provided the definition of \u201cintoxicated.\u201d A person is intoxicated within the meaning of section 1192 (3) when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201che is incapable of employing the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver\u201d <em>(People v Cruz, </em>48 NY2d 419, 428 [1979]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">At defendant\u2019s trial in Town Court, the People presented evidence of her breathalyzer test and also the testimony of the arresting officer that when she was stopped defendant smelled of alcohol, had glassy eyes, and failed four field sobriety tests (involving such things as standing on one leg and following a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>moving object with one\u2019s eyes). Defendant called several witnesses, including herself and an expert pharmacologist. The expert testified that in his opinion, based on defendant\u2019s testimony as to when she last consumed alcohol and the rate at which alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream, her BAC at the time she was stopped was between .03% and .04%.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Defendant asked the court to charge the jury in the following language, taken from the pattern jury instruction used in common law DWI cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cUnder our law, evidence that there was less than .08 of one per centum by weight of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood is prima facie evidence that the defendant was not in an intoxicated condition\u201d <em>(see </em>CJI2d[NY] Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [3] [driving while intoxicated]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The court refused to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The jury acquitted defendant of per se DWI, but convicted her of the common law crime. County Court affirmed, concluding that \u201cany instructions regarding prima facie evidence that can be presented as a result of v &amp; T Section 1195, must be based upon chemical analysis, and not the opinion testimony of a defense expert\u201d (footnote omitted). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (21 NY3d 1004 [2013]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The decisive issue in this case is whether the defense expert\u2019s testimony was \u201c[e]vidence\u201d entitled to the \u201c[probative value\u201d specified by Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1195 (2). This question can best be answered by reading the first two subdivisions of section 1195:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">\u201c1. Admissibility. Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of actions alleged to have been committed by any person arrested for a violation of any subdivision of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article, the court shall admit evidence of the amount of alcohol or drugs in the defendant\u2019s blood <em>as shown by a test administered pursuant to the provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of this article.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Probative value. The following effect shall be given to evidence of blood-alcohol content, <em>as determined by such tests, </em>of a person arrested for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>violation of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201c(a) Evidence that there was .05 of one per centum or less by weight of alcohol in such person\u2019s blood shall be prima facie evidence that the ability of such person to operate a motor vehicle was not impaired by the consumption of alcohol, and that such person was not in an intoxicated condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201c(b) Evidence that there was more than .05 of one per centum but less than .07 of one per centum by weight of alcohol in such person\u2019s blood shall be prima facie evidence that such person was not in an intoxicated condition, but such evidence shall be relevant evidence, but shall not be given prima facie effect, in determining whether the ability of such person to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of alcohol; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201c(c) Evidence that there was .07 of one per centum or more but less than .08 of one per centum by weight of alcohol in such person\u2019s blood shall be prima facie evidence that such person was not in an intoxicated condition, but such evidence shall be given prima facie effect in determining whether the ability of such person to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of alcohol\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">A \u201ctest administered pursuant to\u201d Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 is \u201ca chemical test of . . . breath, blood, urine, or saliva\u201d (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [2] [a]). Section 1195 (2) is expressly limited to evidence of BAC \u201cas determined by such tests.\u201d Since the evidence of her BAC that defendant presented here was not determined by a chemical test but was contained in the opinion of a defense expert, that evidence did not have the \u201cprima facie\u201d effect specified by the statute and defendant was not entitled to the charge she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">What has been said is enough to dispose of the case. It should not be thought, however, that the BAC thresholds specified in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1195 (2) must be entirely omitted from a jury charge in a common law DWI case or in a driving while ability impaired (DWAI) case brought under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (1) (\u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol\u201d). It is obvious from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 1192 (2) and 1195 (2) that the legislature has made judgments about the significance of certain statistical thresholds \u2014 i.e., that a BAC of .08% or more justifies an inference of intoxication; that a BAC below .08% justifies an inference of non-intoxication; that a BAC of .07% or more justifies an inference of impairment; and that a BAC equal to or less than .05% justifies an inference that the driver was neither intoxicated nor impaired in her ability to drive. There is no reason why juries should remain unaware of these legislative judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Thus, in this case Town Court should, if it had been requested to do so, have charged the jury in words or substance: If you find that there was less than .08 of one percent by weight of alcohol in defendant\u2019s blood while she was operating the motor vehicle, you may, but are not required to, find that she was not in an intoxicated condition. Similarly, in a DWAI case where the defendant proffers evidence other than chemical tests of a BAC at or below .05%, it would be proper to charge: If you find that there was .05 of one percent or less by weight of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood while she was operating a motor vehicle, you may, but are not required to, find that her ability to operate the motor vehicle was not impaired by the consumption of alcohol. And the People are entitled to a corresponding charge when they rely on evidence other than chemical tests to show that a defendant\u2019s BAC was at or above .08% in a DWI case, or .07% in a DWAI case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The difference between our \u201cif you find\u201d formulation and the \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d charge that defendant here requested is substantive, not just verbal. The \u201cprima facie\u201d charge instructs the jury on the weight to be given certain evidence \u2014 an instruction that is appropriate only when the evidence consists of chemical tests. The \u201cif you find\u201d charge allows the jury to evaluate the evidence for itself \u2014 i.e., lets it choose to believe the expert or not \u2014 but instructs it as to the inferences it may draw after it has made that evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Accordingly, the order of County Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-8\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
