Thereafter, she was subject to PINS violation petitions. Additionally, in February 2012, a juvenile delinquency petition was filed against Gabriela A., based on a complaint of physical abuse made by her mother (the February petition). On February 28, 2012, Gabriela A. appeared before Family Court in connection with her PINS violations and the February petition, and the court remanded her to a specified nonsecure detention facility. Gabriela A. immediately absconded from custody, and her probation officer, Amanda Flores, successfully sought a PINS warrant for Gabriela A. to be returned to the nonsecure facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On the morning of March 10, 2012, Officer Flores and five other probation officers visited Gabriela A.\u2019s home, based on information she was staying there overnight, to execute the warrant. Gabriela A. acknowledges that she did not comply with the probation officers\u2019 directions, but the parties dispute the severity of her resistance. The officers eventually succeeded in taking Gabriela A. into custody and transported her to the non-secure detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">When Gabriela A. appeared before Family Court on March 23, 2012 to address the PINS violations and the February petition, the Westchester County Attorney (hereafter, the presentment agency) served her counsel with a juvenile delinquency petition based on Gabriela A.\u2019s confrontation with probation officers on March 10th (the March petition). The March petition claimed generally that Gabriela A. violently resisted the officers\u2019 attempts to take her into custody and charged her with acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crimes of attempted assault in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 120.05 [1]; 110.00), resisting arrest (Penal Law \u00a7 205.30) and obstructing governmental administration (Penal Law \u00a7 195.05). Gabriela A. denied the charges. Her attorney argued that the presentment agency was improperly seeking to \u201cbootstrap[ <em>] ... a </em>PINS case into a juvenile delinquency case\u201d inasmuch as Gabriela A.\u2019s conduct on March 10th was \u201cclassic PINS behavior.\u201d After fact-finding, Family Court dismissed and sealed the February petition; disposition of the PINS violations and fact-finding on the March petition were adjourned. The court remanded Gabriela A. to secure detention, citing her history of absconding, the multiple warrants issued for her and the likelihood of reoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The fact-finding hearing on the March petition commenced on March 26, 2012, and continued on April 2 and 3, 2012. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the first day, the presentment agency submitted a \u201csuperseding amended petition,\u201d alleging that on March 10, 2012 Gabriela A. had committed acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crimes of resisting arrest (Penal Law \u00a7 205.30), obstructing governmental administration (Penal Law \u00a7 195.05), attempted assault in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 120.00 [1]; 110.00) and third-degree menacing (Penal Law \u00a7 120.15). The court accepted the amended petition over Gabriela A.\u2019s attorney\u2019s objections, and started the hearing. The presentment agency called two witnesses, Officer Flores and Officer Tony Ortiz, Jr. Gabriela A. testified on her own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Officer Flores, who had supervised Gabriela A. since she was adjudicated a PINS in August 2011, testified that after she and another female probation officer roused Gabriela A. at 9:30 a.m. on the morning of March 10th, Gabriela A. ignored repeated directives to get dressed and come along with them and to quit playing with her cell phone and texting friends; she yelled obscenities at the officers and screamed at them to get out of her bedroom. Further, when they \u201cattempted to restrain [Gabriela A.] so [they] could place her securely in handcuffs,\u201d she \u201cwas not compliant\u201d and \u201chid[ ] her arms between her body and the wall ... so [the officers] couldn\u2019t grab her arms to restrain her ... all the while flailing her torso and her shoulders about.\u201d Officer Flores described Gabriela A. as \u201cvery aggressive,\u201d and opined that her behavior \u201cput[ ] everyone in a dangerous situation.\u201d Further, \u201cat one point [Gabriela A.] grabbed . . . the open [hand]cuff,\u201d which made Officer Flores \u201cextremely nervous\u201d because \u201c[a] handcuff[ ] open in that fashion [could] be used as a weapon.\u201d She described leaning her \u201cright shoulder into [Gabriela A.\u2019s] back\u201d to \u201cpry [Gabriela A.\u2019s] fingers off of the cuff.\u201d Officer Flores testified that she suffered pain in her right shoulder as a result. On cross-examination, however, Officer Flores conceded that she did not mention this injury or \u201canything about being afraid of [Gabriela A.]\u201d in a report she wrote shortly after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Officer Ortiz, who was stationed in the hallway outside Gabriela A.\u2019s bedroom door, testified that she exhibited aggressive behavior and tried to run away down the hallway. He grabbed Gabriela A. because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want her either running out of the apartment or hurting her mother.\u201d Officer Ortiz reported further that Gabriela A. \u201cwas stomping her feet\u201d as the officers were trying to put handcuffs on her, and that she was \u201cnon-compliant and . . . was not going to just surrender herself on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the warrant.\u201d Officer Ortiz testified that he was concerned when Gabriela A. grabbed the handcuff since it was \u201copen . . . and serrated, [and] could be used as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">After the presentment agency rested, Gabriela A.\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the <em>agency </em>failed to make out a prima facie case. He argued there was \u201cno indication in [the officers\u2019] testimony that [Gabriela A.] was trying to injure either of them.\u201d Additionally, he claimed, there was insufficient proof of the officers\u2019 fear of imminent injury to justify a charge of menacing. Finally, Gabriela A.\u2019s attorney asserted that the charges of resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration were improperly \u201cbootstrapp[ed]\u201d to her PINS case. The presentment agency opposed the motion, arguing that \u201cbootstrapping\u201d was not prohibited for \u201ctrue delinquency acts.\u201d Family Court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Gabriela A. then testified on her own behalf. She told essentially the same story as Officers Flores and Ortiz, but insisted that she was not violent. Gabriela A. acknowledged that she refused to get out of bed and attempted to run away down the hallway. She also acknowledged moving her body around in an attempt to avoid being handcuffed. Although she admitted that she \u201ctried to make it hard for [the officers]\u201d to take her into custody, Gabriela A. denied trying to hit or kick anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">At the conclusion of the fact-finding hearing, Family Court found that Gabriela A. had committed acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crimes of resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration. The judge dismissed the counts alleging attempted assault and menacing, and remanded Gabriela A. to secure detention pending disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">At the dispositional hearing on April 11, 2012, Gabriela A.\u2019s attorney again unsuccessfully argued that Family Court was prohibited from adjudicating his client a juvenile delinquent because she had only been found to have acted in a manner consistent with PINS behavior, not juvenile delinquency. On the PINS violations, Family Court placed Gabriela A., with her consent, in the custody of the Commissioner of Social Services for Westchester County for placement for one year at an agreed-upon nonsecure detention facility. On the March petition, the court granted Gabriela A. a one-year conditional discharge to expire on April 11, 2013. Under the terms of the conditional discharge, Gabriela A. was to be physically transferred from secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>to nonsecure detention no later than April 13, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gabriela A. appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">On February 27, 2013, the Appellate Division reversed the dispositional order, vacated the underlying fact-finding order, dismissed the March petition and remanded the matter to Family Court for further proceedings pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 375.1 (103 AD3d 888 [2d Dept 2013]). Preliminarily, the court noted that \u201c[a] PINS is one who is . . . incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of a parent or other person legally responsible for such child\u2019s care\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 889 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). The court concluded that \u201c[u]nder the particular circumstances of this case, [Gabriela A.\u2019s] conduct was consistent with PINS behavior, not with juvenile delinquency,\u201d adding that \u201cFamily Court may not do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly \u2014 placing a PINS in a secure facility\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). The presentment agency sought leave to appeal, which we granted on June 6, 2013 (21 NY3d 857 [2013]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A PINS is, among other things, \u201c[a] person less than eighteen years of age who ... is incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of a parent or other person legally responsible for such child\u2019s care, or other lawful authority\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 712 [a]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By contrast, a \u201cjuvenile delinquent,\u201d as relevant here, is a person between 8 and 15 years old who \u201chaving committed an act that would constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>crime if committed by an adult... is not criminally responsible for such conduct by reason of infancy\u201d <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 301.2 [1]). A PINS cannot be confined to a secure facility <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 720 [1], [2]); a juvenile delinquent, however, may be remanded to secure detention <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 353.3 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Family Court Act \u00a7 718 sets out the procedure and the dispositional options available to the court when a PINS runs away. A peace officer (including, as here, probation officers) may \u201capprehend, restrain, and return such child\u201d to the placement facility or foster home from which the PINS absconded. The probation officers whom Gabriela A. resisted or obstructed were acting pursuant to this section, attempting to return her to the nonsecure facility where she had been placed. Family Court implicitly equated Gabriela A.\u2019s resistance to the restraint authorized by Family Court Act \u00a7 718 to the crimes of resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, and thus concluded that she was a juvenile delinquent under Family Court Act \u00a7 301.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The crime of resisting arrest requires that a person intentionally prevent \u201can authorized arrest\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 205.30). The restraint of a PINS pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 718, however, is not the same as a criminal arrest <em>(see Matter of Bernard G., </em>247 AD2d 91, 95 [1st Dept 1998]). A PINS proceeding is fundamentally civil in nature. In <em>Matter of Marrhonda G. </em>(81 NY2d 942, 945 [1993]), for example, we concluded that for Fourth Amendment purposes, a section 718 detention did not entitle a Port Authority police officer to conduct a full warrant-less search of a young man\u2019s bag. We reasoned that the detained youth\u2019s bag could only have been searched \u201cif [he] had been placed under arrest and the bag then searched as an incident thereto\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Thus, a PINS who resists being restrained or transported back to a placement facility is not resisting arrest within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Next, a person is guilty of the misdemeanor of obstructing governmental administration when he or she \u201cintentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function or prevents or attempts to prevent a public servant from performing an official function, by means of intimidation, physical force or interference\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 195.05). Probation officers qualify as \u201cpublic servants\u201d within the broad definition supplied in the Penal Law <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [15]), and Gabriela A. admitted that she wanted to \u201cmake it hard\u201d for Officer Flores and the other probation offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cers to handcuff and take her to the nonsecure facility. On the other hand, the legislature has defined a PINS to include someone who is \u201chabitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of. . . lawful authority\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 712 [a]). Thus, a PINS\u2019s disobedience and obstruction of \u201clawful authority\u201d is not necessarily the same as an adult\u2019s. Since Family Court Act \u00a7 720 (1) and (2) forbid placement of a PINS in a secure facility, the legislature surely did not intend the type of behavior that might cause a child to be designated a PINS in the first place to become the basis for secure detention <em>(see Matter of Naquan J., </em>284 AD2d 1, 5 [2d Dept 2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In a related line of cases, the Appellate Division has considered whether the Family Court\u2019s contempt powers can be used to bring a PINS into compliance with the court\u2019s orders or conditions by so-called \u201cbootstrapping.\u201d That is, the issue in these cases was whether the child\u2019s failure to comply with PINS requirements \u2014 what the courts referred to as engaging in typical PINS-type behavior \u2014 supplied a basis for imposing the sanction of criminal contempt, thus converting a PINS into a juvenile delinquent. The uniform conclusion has been that using the contempt power in this way is not allowed <em>(see Matter of Daniel </em>I., 57 AD3d 666, 667 [2d Dept 2008] [damaging electronic monitoring bracelet and breaking curfew]; <em>Matter of Edwin G., </em>296 AD2d 7, 10-11 [1st Dept 2002] [PINS absconded from placement]; <em>Matter of Jasmine A., </em>284 AD2d 452, 453 [2d Dept 2001] [elopement]). These cases construed the \u201cContempts\u201d provision in Family Court Act \u00a7 156, which allows use of the contempt power in Family Court proceedings (both PINS and juvenile delinquency) when there is no \u201cspecific punishment or other remedy\u201d provided elsewhere. In the case of a disobedient or absconding PINS, Family Court Act article 7 provides only for a return to placement or assignment to a new placement; it does not authorize contempt if the PINS fails to comply with the dispositional alternative imposed upon a PINS adjudication <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 756).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Physical resistance to probation officers, however, is different from ignoring a court order. Gabriela A.\u2019s fractious behavior arguably posed a danger to herself, the probation officers and/or her family, even though Family Court found that she did not attempt to assault or menace the officers. But the Appellate Division, contrary to Family Court, found that Gabriela A.\u2019s resistance fell within the bounds of acting \u201cbeyond the lawful control of . . . lawful authority\u201d rather than Penal Law \u00a7 195.05. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>this record, where Family Court and the Appellate Division disagreed when evaluating Gabriela A.\u2019s misbehavior, we simply conclude that the Appellate Division\u2019s factual findings more nearly comport with the weight of the evidence (see <em>e.g. Matter of State of New York v Daniel F., </em>19 NY3d 1086, 1087 [2012]). In short, we are not, as the dissent puts it, \u201cendorsing a] trend\u201d in the Appellate Division prohibiting \u201cbootstrapping\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or \u201cproposing a] test\u201d to immunize a PINS from juvenile delinquency proceedings for obstructing governmental administration (see dissenting op at 164-165).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. A \u201c \u2018[n] on-secure detention facility\u2019 \u201d means \u201c[a] facility characterized by the absence of physically restricting construction, hardware and procedures\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 712 [d]); by contrast, a \u201c \u2018[s]ecure detention facility\u2019 \u201d means \u201c[a] facility characterized by physically restricting construction, hardware and procedures\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 712 [c]). As it turned out, then, Gabriela A. experienced the \u201ctough love\u201d of secure detention for only the roughly three-week duration of the juvenile delinquency proceeding on the March petition (see dissenting op at 166).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. In March 2013, the Westchester County Department of Social Services informed Family Court that Gabriela A. had \u201cresponded positively to services\u201d at the nonsecure facility where she was placed in April 2012, \u201cmade excellent progress academically\u201d and \u201cactively participated in improving communication with her family.\u201d As a result, the Department did not seek to extend Gabriela A.\u2019s PINS placement. We note that the expiration of Family Court\u2019s dispositional order does not moot this appeal since the Appellate Division\u2019s order has the potential for future legal consequences <em>(see e.g. </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 381.2 [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. Family Court Act \u00a7 712 (a) also permits finding someone a PINS who is habitually truant, commits certain minor marijuana possession offenses, or who appears to be a \u201csexually exploited child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. While Gabriela A.\u2019s attorney employed this term, the Appellate Division did not. And however the dissent may define \u201cbootstrapping\u201d (see dissenting op at 164), the Appellate Division, as noted earlier, has generally reserved this term for discussions of Family Court\u2019s use of its contempt powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b222-6\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">(dissenting). There has been a spate of recent Appellate Division opinions that have held that \u201cFamily Court may not \u2018bootstrap\u2019 a PINS adjudication onto one alleging juvenile delinquency by charging a PINS who absconds from a non-secure facility with conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute escape\u201d <em>(Matter of Daniel </em>I., 57 AD3d 666, 667-668 [2d Dept 2008]), or obstructing governmental administration <em>(see id. </em>at 668), criminal mischief <em>(see id.) </em>or criminal contempt <em>(see Matter of Edwin G., </em>296 AD2d 7, 12 [1st Dept 2002]; <em>Matter of Jasmine A., </em>284 AD2d 452, 453 [2d Dept 2001]; <em>Matter of Naquan J., </em>284 AD2d 1, 6 [2d Dept 2001]). \u201cBootstrapping,\u201d as I see it, means using misconduct of the type that made someone a PINS in the first place (such as running away from home or a nonsecure facility) to subject a PINS to a juvenile delinquency petition charging acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute crimes. The theory is that a PINS may not be adjudicated a juvenile delinquent on the basis of an action that \u201cwhile defined statutorily as a crime, [is] a common characteristic of PINS behavior and more harmful to the juvenile than to society\u201d <em>(Daniel </em>I., 57 AD3d at 668).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The majority endorses this trend, suggesting that, as a PINS, Gabriela A. may not be charged with resisting arrest or obstructing governmental administration for her physical resistance to being restrained or transported to a placement facility <em>(see </em>majority op at 162-163). Under the test seemingly proposed by the majority, the presentment agency must first, before subjecting a PINS to a juvenile delinquency petition, determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>PINS was engaging in \u201cthe type of behavior that might cause a child to be designated a PINS\u201d (majority op at 163). For example, before alleging that a PINS engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute obstructing governmental administration, the presentment agency must divine whether the behavior of the PINS is tantamount to intentionally obstructing governmental function or, rather, is merely \u201cacting \u2018beyond the lawful control of . . . lawful authority\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 163, quoting Family Ct Act \u00a7 712 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The proposed test is unworkable. It will force probation officers, presentment agencies and courts to analyze whether specific instances of misconduct fit within the very abstract and ill-defined concept of \u201cPINS-type behavior\u201d or behavior \u201cmore harmful to the juvenile than to society.\u201d Such an assessment will make for constant disagreements of judgment. Of course, the history of the present case illustrates this. On the one hand, the Appellate Division and a majority of this Court find Gabriela A.\u2019s conduct to be the type of \u201cmore harmful to the juvenile than to society\u201d behavior characteristic of a PINS. On the other hand, the presentment agency, Family Court, and two Judges of this Court tend to consider her behavior potentially dangerous to others. I would reject the Appellate Division\u2019s prohibition of \u201cbootstrapping\u201d and simply consider each case of misbehavior by a PINS on its own facts, when determining whether it rises to the level of juvenile delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Notably, the majority\u2019s proposed test may immunize from juvenile delinquency proceedings even a PINS who, because of his physical stature and strength, is far more intimidating and dangerous to parole officers than Gabriela A. The majority\u2019s willingness to consider a PINS as merely fractious and ungovernable, rather than truly harmful, would be called into question were the PINS a male, six feet tall and weighing 180 pounds. Fortunately, the majority seems to reject the suggestion that the physical resistance to probation officers described in the officers\u2019 testimony but denied by Gabriela A. (trying to stomp on officers\u2019 feet) would be mere \u201cPINS-type behavior.\u201d But I suspect that if a large young man had engaged in even the less extreme resistance that Gabriela A. admitted to (flailing her body around and grabbing an open handcuff), my colleagues in the majority would conclude that he was properly adjudged a juvenile delinquent, even though his actions were identical to Gabriela A.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Moreover, I disagree with the majority\u2019s theory that resisting restraint under Family Court Act \u00a7 718 is fundamentally different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>from the crime of resisting arrest (majority op at 162). It may be misleading to describe detention pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 718 as a \u201cfull custodial arrest\u201d <em>(see Matter of Bernard G., </em>247 AD2d 91, 94-95 [1st Dept 1998]; <em>contrast Matter of Jamel J., 246 </em>AD2d 388, 389 [1st Dept 1998], <em>Matter of Michael J., </em>233 AD2d 198, 199 [1st Dept 1996], <em>Matter of Mark Anthony G., </em>169 AD2d 89, 93 [1st Dept 1991]), because the Fourth Amendment implications are somewhat different. However, this does not mean that the restraint of a PINS under Family Court Act \u00a7 718 is not \u201can authorized arrest\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 205.30. Consequently, there is no bar as a matter of law to alleging resisting arrest in a juvenile delinquency petition, on the basis of physical resistance by a PINS.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In my view, the presentment agency did exactly as it should in filing the petition alleging violent conduct in the form of acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute resisting arrest and obstructing of governmental administration. Family Court, in turn, did exactly as it should, in making the factual determination that Gabriela A. was guilty of such conduct. Overturning that determination, on the ground that Gabriela A.\u2019s behavior is more consistent with acting beyond the control of lawful authority than with criminal conduct, downplays the very real risk of harm to the probation officers in the present case, and will be interpreted as immunizing a PINS who engages in conduct threatening to arresting officers from prosecution as a juvenile delinquent. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s decision does not benefit children who fall into the PINS category. Like the PINS statutes, the laws that permit juvenile delinquency proceedings are intended in significant part to protect these young men and women from their own worst impulses and help them straighten out. Sometimes \u201ctough love\u201d \u2014 including some period of confinement in a secure facility \u2014 is the best way to accomplish that. Indeed, it seems to have worked for Gabriela A., who, according to her counsel, is now an exemplary teenager. There is no good reason to restrict the efforts of caring and devoted presentment agency employees and Family Court judges, simply on the basis that their efforts are considered \u201cbootstrapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I would reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s order, reinstate Family Court\u2019s fact-finding order and order of disposition, and reinstate the presentment agency\u2019s petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Rivera and AbdusSalaam concur with Judge Read; Judge Pigott dissents in an opinion in which Judge Smith concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
