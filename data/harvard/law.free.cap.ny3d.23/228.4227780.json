In this appeal, we consider the extent to which the police are obligated to advise a drunk driving suspect about an attorney\u2019s telephonic intervention before the administration of such a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Defendant Jonai Washington was driving an automobile in Nassau County at approximately 2:00 a.m. when she struck and killed a pedestrian. She told the responding police officers that she had consumed four beers <em>\u201ca </em>while ago.\u201d She failed field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving while intoxicated at 2:40 a.m. Defendant was then transported to Nassau County police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In the meantime, defendant\u2019s family contacted an attorney to arrange for him to represent her. The lawyer telephoned the Sheriff\u2019s Department at 3:29 a.m. and, shortly thereafter, an operator at police headquarters transferred his call at 3:32 a.m. to a sergeant. Counsel explained that he represented defendant, requested information about her status and asked the sergeant to instruct police officers not to question or test his client. The attorney was informed that he would be contacted by the arresting officer and the conversation ended at 3:39 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">At the same time that the attorney was pursuing telephone contact with law enforcement personnel, the police were processing defendant and advising her about the need for a chemical test to determine her blood alcohol content. The police read a standard chemical test authorization to defendant at 3:30 a.m. and she then signed the form, indicating her consent to take the breathalyzer test. Defendant was not informed about the attorney\u2019s communication before initiation of the breathalyzer test at 3:39 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Consequently, defendant was indicted for second-degree manslaughter, second-degree vehicular manslaughter and two counts of driving while intoxicated. She moved to suppress the results of the breathalyzer, claiming that it had been administered in violation of her right to counsel. Following an evidentiary hearing, Supreme Court agreed with defendant and suppressed the chemical test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Upon the People\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that the police violated defendant\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>right to counsel because she was not alerted to the lawyer\u2019s intervention before the breath test occurred and the People failed to establish that such notification would have unduly interfered with the ad ministration of the breathalyzer <em>(see </em>107 AD3d 4, 15 [2d Dept 2013]). A dissenting Justice believed that defendant\u2019s right to counsel was not transgressed since she had consented to the test prior to the attorney\u2019s conversation with the police <em>(see id. </em>at 25). The dissenter granted the People leave to appeal (21 NY3d 1012 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Driving while intoxicated is <em>\u201ca </em>very serious crime\u201d <em>(County of Nassau v Canavan, </em>1 NY3d 134, 140 [2003]) that has long posed a \u201cmenace\u201d to highway safety <em>(People v </em>Ward, 307 NY 73, 77 [1954]) and has caused many tragic consequences <em>(see e.g. People v Heidgen, </em>22 NY3d 259, 267-268 [2013]). In the effort to combat alcohol-related driving offenses, law enforcement agencies have been granted statutory authority <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194) to use an important investigative tool \u2014 chemical tests to determine blood alcohol content <em>(see People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d 544, 548 [2012]). Since alcohol metabolically dissipates from the bloodstream <em>(see Missouri v McNeely, </em>569 US \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 133 S Ct 1552, 1560, 1570-1571 [2013]), the use of these tests \u201cis a time-sensitive proposition; to maximize the probative value of BAC evidence, the police endeavor to administer chemical tests as close in time as possible to the motor vehicle infraction, typically within two hours of an arrest\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 548).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">To promote this objective, operators of motor vehicles in New York are deemed to have issued consent to chemical testing under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 (2) (a). The statute is designed to encourage those suspected of alcohol-related driving offenses to comply with requests to submit to chemical tests in order to obviate the need for securing court orders authorizing blood tests <em>(see </em>L 1953, ch 854; <em>People v Ward, </em>307 NY at 77). Section 1194 \u201cgrants a motorist a qualified right to decline to voluntarily take a chemical test\u201d after being warned that a refusal \u201cwill result in the immediate suspension and ultimate revocation of the motorist\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year,\u201d along with evidence of the refusal being admissible at any subsequent criminal trial <em>(People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 548). In general, \u201can uncounseled waiver of the statutory right to refuse the test . . . provides no basis for suppressing the results\u201d <em>(People v Shaw, </em>72 NY2d 1032, 1034 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In <em>People v Gursey </em>(22 NY2d 224 [1968]), however, we recognized a limited right of the accused to seek legal assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in alcohol-related driving cases. We held that, based on the warning procedure set forth in section 1194 (2) (b),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cif a defendant arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol asks to contact an attorney before responding to a request to take a chemical test, the police \u2018may not, without justification, prevent access between the criminal accused and his lawyer, available in person or by immediate telephone communication\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 549, quoting <em>People v Gursey, </em>22 NY2d at 227).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Violation of this right to legal consultation generally requires suppression of the scientific evidence <em>(see People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 550). Because time is of the essence in obtaining accurate chemical test evidence <em>(see id. </em>at 548 n 1), we further observed in <em>Gursey </em>that a suspect\u2019s communication with a lawyer regarding \u201cthe exercise of legal rights should not . . . extend so far as to palpably impair or nullify the statutory procedure requiring drivers to choose between taking the test or losing their licenses\u201d (22 NY2d at 229).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">It is therefore well established that \u201cthere is no absolute right to refuse to take the test until an attorney is actually consulted, nor can a defendant use a request for legal consultation to significantly postpone testing\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 549). In other words, conferring with counsel is permissible only if \u201c \u2018such access does not interfere unduly\u2019 \u201d with timely administration of the test <em>(id. </em>at 549, quoting <em>People v Gursey, </em>22 NY2d at 227).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We have at least twice emphasized that <em>Gursey </em>was directed at the accused\u2019s personal request to seek legal consultation before providing consent to a chemical test <em>(see People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 549; <em>People v Shaw, </em>72 NY2d at 1033-1034). <em>Gursey </em>is therefore distinguishable from the facts of this case in one significant respect \u2014 defendant never asked to speak to a lawyer before executing the consent form to take the breathalyzer test. Here, an attorney contacted the police at her family\u2019s behest at the same time that defendant agreed to undergo chemical testing. The issue then is whether counsel\u2019s intervention just prior to commencement of testing requires suppression of the results under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The People assert that suppression of the breathalyzer test is not warranted because defense counsel\u2019s telephonic communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>did not constitutionally preclude the police from continuing to proceed with testing defendant for alcohol consumption. They also maintain that the breathalyzer was properly performed under <em>People v Gursey </em>(22 NY2d 224 [1968]) because defendant did not personally inform the police that she wanted to consult with a lawyer before providing consent to the chemical test. Defendant acknowledges that her consent to be tested for alcohol was validly obtained, but asserts that her right to counsel was violated when the attorney contacted the police and she was not advised about the lawyer\u2019s communication before the breathalyzer test was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In our view, the statutory right to legal consultation applies when an attorney contacts the police before a chemical test for alcohol is performed and the police must alert the subject to the presence of counsel, whether the contact is made in person or telephonically. <em>Gursey </em>contemplated that a lawyer retained to represent a DWI arrestee can directly communicate with the police, reasoning that \u201claw enforcement officials may not, without justification, prevent access between the criminal accused and [the] lawyer, available in person or by immediate telephone communication, if such access does not interfere unduly\u201d with the administration of the alcohol test (22 NY2d at 227). The fact that defendant consented to the breathalyzer about the same time that the attorney was communicating with the police is not dispositive since defendant, after conferring with counsel, could have revoked her consent prior to administration of the test <em>(see generally </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 1194 [2] [b]; 1194-a [3] [c]). The police therefore must advise the accused that a lawyer has made contact on the accused\u2019s behalf <em>(see People v Pfahler, </em>179 AD2d 1062 [4th Dept 1992]; <em>People v Meytin, </em>30 Misc 3d 128[A], 2010 NY Slip Op 52276[U] [App Term, 1st Dept 2010], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 861 [2011]). Once so informed, the accused may choose to consult with counsel or forgo that option and proceed with the chemical test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>In this case, when the attorney telephoned the police to intervene on defendant\u2019s behalf, the police should have informed defendant of this development since breathalyzer testing had not yet begun. Defendant could then have decided if she wished to discuss her situation with counsel. Since the police officers here made no effort to advise defendant about the lawyer\u2019s communication and the People did not demonstrate that a notification of this nature would have been unreasonable under the circumstances, we hold that the chemical test was administered in violation of the statutorily-based <em>Gursey </em>right to counsel. Consequently, the courts below correctly concluded that defendant is entitled to suppression of the test results.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. Our dissenting colleagues would restrict the <em>Gursey </em>privilege to the time period before a drunk-driving suspect consents to a chemical test <em>(see </em>dissenting op at 237). The rationale of <em>People v Gursey </em>(22 NY2d 224 [1968]), however, was not so limited. A suspect who consents to a test may ultimately decline to perform it; only that final decision results in adverse legal consequences, such as revocation of driving privileges (see Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [2] [b] [1]); and our Court has recognized that an arrestee may seek legal counsel to understand the ramifications of refusing to undergo chemical testing (see <em>People v Gursey, </em>22 NY2d at 228-229). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>belief, there is no relevant distinction between legal consultation before or after consent is given \u2014 the operative point in time is the actual performance of the procedure and, until it occurs, legal assistance may be sought \u201cif such access does not interfere unduly\u201d with the administration of the chemical test <em>(id. </em>at 227).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">. Although the People assert that the exclusionary rule should not apply in this case, it is unnecessary to address the merits of that claim because the courts below did not find that the police acted in good faith and it is undisputed that they did not obtain a court order authorizing a chemical test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b292-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amg\">(dissenting). The majority holds that \u201cthe statutory right to legal consultation applies when an attorney contacts the police before a chemical test for alcohol is performed and the police must alert the subject to the presence of counsel, whether the contact is made in person or telephonically\u201d (majority op at 233). Further, the majority opines, it makes no difference \u201cthat defendant consented to the breathalyzer about the same time<footnotemark>[*]</footnotemark> that the attorney was communicating with the police . . . since [she] . . . could have revoked her consent prior to administration of the test\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, no statute confers upon a suspected drunk driver the legal right to consult with counsel before consenting to take a chemical breath test. And the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>jority offers no reason why we should alter the easy-to-apply common-law rule deriving from <em>People v Gursey </em>(22 NY2d 224 [1968]); i.e.; that <em>\u201ca </em>defendant who has been arrested for driving while intoxicated, but not yet formally charged in court, generally has the right to consult with a lawyer <em>before deciding whether to consent </em>to a sobriety test, <em>if he requests </em>assistance of counsel\u201d <em>(People v Shaw, </em>72 NY2d 1032, 1033-1034 [1988] [emphases added], citing <em>Gursey, </em>22 NY2d 224). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In <em>Gursey, </em>a motorist suspected of drunk driving was taken back to the station house where he was asked to submit to a chemical breath test; he refused and several times requested permission to call his attorney. The police officer in charge advised the uncooperative motorist that he had to take the test. When the motorist questioned what would happen if he continued to refuse consent, the officer replied \u201c \u2018[T]he State will take away your license,\u2019 \u201d whereupon the motorist submitted to the test <em>(id. </em>at 227).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The motorist unsuccessfully moved to suppress the test results on the ground that administration of the test after denial of his requests for counsel violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. He was subsequently convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, the Appellate Term ruled that \u201cthe denial of [the motorist\u2019s] request to telephone his attorney before he took the test violated his constitutional rights\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 227 [internal quotation marks omitted]). The court therefore reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial in light of the \u201csufficient other evidence\u201d of guilt <em>(id. </em>at 226).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We affirmed, but not on the basis of any constitutional or statutory right to advice of counsel enjoyed by a suspected drunk driver asked to undergo chemical breath testing. We noted that the motorist \u201cpossessed a number of <em>statutory options </em>which could be asserted only during the transaction at the station house, and <em>concerning which the advice of </em>counsel, <em>if </em>available, <em>was </em>relevant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 228 [emphases added]); specifically, he <em>might </em>have chosen to lose his license in lieu of taking the test <em>(see </em>former Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [1]). Further, the motorist, if he elected to take the test, was entitled to have a physician of his choosing conduct a chemical test in addition to the police-administered one <em>(see </em>former Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Observing additionally that honoring the motorist\u2019s wishes \u201cwould not have substantially interfered with the investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>procedure,\u201d we held that denial of his requests to talk to his lawyer \u201cmust be deemed to have violated\u201d what we called \u201chis privilege of access to counsel\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 228) or \u201c[t]he privilege of consulting with counsel concerning the exercise of legal rights\u201d under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 <em>(id. </em>at 229). We subsequently confirmed that this privilege is triggered only \u201cif [a motorist] <em>requests </em>assistance of counsel\u201d and does so <em>\u201cbefore deciding whether to consent </em>to a sobriety test\u201d <em>(Shaw, </em>72 NY2d at 1034 [emphases added]). We have recently reiterated that the privilege is invoked <em>\u201cbefore responding to a request </em>to take a chemical test\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>18 NY3d 544, 549 [2012] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">While section 1194 contemplates that a motorist may refuse to take a chemical breath test, there is no \u201cstatutory right to request legal consultation before consenting to a chemical test\u201d administered pursuant to that provision <em>(see </em>majority op at 230; <em>see also id. </em>at 233). The limited privilege to consult derives solely from <em>Gursey </em>and so is entirely judge-made <em>(see Gursey, </em>22 NY2d 224; <em>see also Smith, </em>18 NY3d at 549 [\u201cVehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 does not address whether a motorist has a right to consult with a lawyer prior to determining whether to consent to chemical testing. However, if the motorist is arrested for driving while intoxicated or a related offense, this Court has recognized a limited right to counsel associated with the criminal proceeding\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">As the majority acknowledges, \u201c[d]riving while intoxicated is a very serious crime that has long posed a menace to highway safety and has caused many tragic consequences\u201d (majority op at 231 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Here, defendant struck and killed a pedestrian. Given the undeniable scourge of drunk driving, we should not extend the reach of Gursey\u2019s judicially-created privilege absent strong competing reasons of public policy, and none are advanced or apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Additionally, expansion of the <em>Gursey </em>privilege is particularly ill-advised since the legislature enacted the \u201c \u2018right\u2019 of refused . . . merely [as] an accommodation to avoid a distasteful struggle to forcibly\u201d administer a chemical test to an unwilling subject, not to protect drunk driving suspects from the risk of supplying incriminating evidence <em>(People v Paddock, </em>29 NY2d 504, 506 [1971, Jasen, J., concurring]; <em>see also </em>Jack B. Weinstein, <em>Statute Compelling Submission to a Chemical Test for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Intoxication, </em>45 J Crim L Criminology &amp; Police Sci 541, 543 [1954-1955], available at http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4303&amp;context=jclc [noting the \u201csound practical reasons\u201d for the legislature\u2019s decision to provide that \u201calthough the driver has constructively consented to take the test, when the chips are down and he is actually apprehended he may renege on his imputed promise and refuse . . . (although) (s)uch a refusal is costly for it will result in the loss of his driver\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The majority seemingly reasons that it should make no difference whether the motorist asks to speak to the lawyer or vice versa before the test is performed. As a practical matter, though, the majority\u2019s enlargement of the <em>Gursey </em>privilege invites debate and thus uncertainty, especially when the attorney telephones rather than physically appears at the police station. In short, we are trading a limited and clear rule for a broader one bound to complicate and delay time-sensitive testing and generate questions of fact anytime an attorney enters a case, even when the defendant has already agreed to take the chemical test. This is evident here where, by any measure, mere minutes separate the attorney\u2019s first contact with the police from defendant\u2019s consent to the chemical breath test and the actual testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">And even assuming it made sense to extend <em>Gursey, </em>there is no reason why the privilege should attach so long as the attorney asks to speak to the motorist before the chemical test is administered, as the majority holds, rather than before the motorist consents. The rationale for the privilege in <em>Gursey </em>was that counsel\u2019s advice was relevant to the motorist\u2019s decision whether to consent to the test in the first place. The majority posits that defendant might have revoked consent after talking to her attorney, citing Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 1194 (2) (b) and 1194-a (3) (c). But these provisions address consequences of refusal to undergo a chemical test, not revocation of consent once freely given, as it concededly was here. Moreover, the majority does not explain why defendant\u2019s consent did not act as a waiver of any <em>Gursey </em>privilege. We have, after all, held that a motorist\u2019s statutory option to refuse a chemical test \u201cmay be waived without an attorney\u2019s assistance\u201d <em>(Shaw, </em>72 NY2d at 1033).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In <em>Gursey, </em>we created a limited privilege for a motorist suspected of drunk driving to request to consult with counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>before consenting to chemical testing. Expanding this privilege to cover the situation where the motorist has not asked for counsel or resisted testing disserves the legislative purpose animating section 1194 (2) (b); namely, to encourage voluntary participation in chemical testing, a measure shown to have \u201ccut drunken driving drastically\u201d <em>(see </em>Letter from Jack B.
