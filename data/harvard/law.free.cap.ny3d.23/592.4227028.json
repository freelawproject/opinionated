A court is not required to take judicial notice of a federal statute that contains only legislative fact-findings where the underlying statutory provision is not relevant to any issue in the case.

Gi Yi and Gerald Breen, the alleged owners of certain rental units in which he lived as a child. Giles alleges that he was exposed to lead-based paint in those rental units and suffered numerous injuries as a result. Giles\u2019s bill of particulars lists 34 injuries, including physical, neurological, and psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In July 2011, defendant Breen served medical examination notices under CPLR 3121 and requested \u201ccopies of any reports of any physicians who have treated or examined the plaintiff\u2019 in advance of the examination. Giles disclosed certain medical and educational records that showed that he had lead poisoning as a young child and that he subsequently had academic problems. These records, however, did not substantiate the 34 alleged injuries, nor did they causally relate the documented problems to lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Defendants Breen and Yi then moved to compel Giles to comply with 22 NYCRR 202.17 (b) (1) and produce medical reports detailing a diagnosis of the injuries allegedly caused by exposure to lead-based paint, or be precluded from introducing proof of these injuries at trial. Without this evidence, they argued, they would be required to pay for multiple medical professionals to examine plaintiff. They requested also that plaintiff be ordered to amend his bill of particulars to reflect those injuries actually sustained. Giles cross-moved for a protective order, arguing that defendants were prematurely requesting expert reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 motion and denied Giles\u2019s motion. It ordered Giles \u201cto produce . . . medical. . . reports of any treating or examining medical service provider detailing a diagnosis of any injuries alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff . . . and causally relating said injuries to plaintiffs alleged exposure to lead-based paint,\u201d and further, to amend his bill of particulars to reflect those injuries actually sustained, or be precluded from offering evidence of those injuries at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that \u201cSupreme Court did not abuse its broad discretion in directing plaintiff to produce a medical report containing a diagnosis of the alleged injuries sustained by plaintiff and causally relating such injuries to lead exposure before any CPLR 3121 examinations are conducted\u201d <em>(Giles v Yi, </em>105 AD3d 1313, 1316 [4th Dept 2013]). Justice Whalen dissented. In his view, the majority\u2019s holding imposed unnecessary burdens on plaintiff and was akin to forcing him to retain an expert prior to the defense\u2019s medical examination, something not required at that stage of the litigation <em>(id. </em>at 1319-1321).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Appellate Division subsequently granted plaintiff leave to appeal and certified the question of whether the order was properly made (107 AD3d 1647 [2013], 2013 NY Slip Op 79247[U] [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\n<em>Hamilton v Miller</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Plaintiff Christopher Hamilton, represented by the same counsel as Giles, commenced a similar personal injury action in July 2009 against John Miller, David Miller,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jules Musinger, Doug Musinger, and Singer Associates, the alleged owners of properties in which Hamilton lived as a child. Hamilton filed a bill of particulars alleging that he suffered 58 injuries from exposure to lead-based paint at defendants\u2019 properties. They included physical, psychological, psychiatric, and developmental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">During discovery, Hamilton disclosed certain medical and educational records that showed that he had lead poisoning as a young child and that he subsequently had academic, behavior, and speech problems. Just as in <em>Giles, </em>however, the records did not substantiate the 58 alleged injuries, nor did they causally relate them to lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Defendants\u2019 noticed medical examinations and requested that Hamilton comply with 22 NYCRR 202.17 (b) (1) and provide medical reports from his treating or examining medical service providers diagnosing his injuries and causally relating them to lead-based paint. Hamilton claimed that he was not obligated to provide any further records.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Defendants moved to compel Hamilton to disclose the reports and to amend the bill of particulars to reflect those injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>actually sustained, or otherwise be precluded from introducing proof of his alleged injuries at trial. Hamilton cross-moved for a protective order under CPLR 3103 and for the court to take judicial notice under CPLR 4511 of a federal statute codifying Congress\u2019s findings justifying the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 USC \u00a7 4851).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Supreme Court denied Hamilton\u2019s motion and granted defendants\u2019 motion, ordering Hamilton to produce medical reports of a treating or examining medical service provider detailing any injuries alleged to have been sustained as a result of defendants\u2019 negligence and causally relating them to exposure to lead-based paint. The court further ordered that, should Hamilton fail to produce these records, he would be precluded from introducing proof of his injuries at trial. Finally, the court ordered Hamilton to amend his bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed <em>(Hamilton v Miller, </em>106 AD3d 1476, 1478 [4th Dept 2013]), granted plaintiff leave to appeal, and certified the question of whether the order was properly made (107 AD3d 1648 [2013], 2013 NY Slip Op 79248[U] [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">CPLR 3121 (a) provides that when a party\u2019s mental or physical condition is in issue, any other party may serve on the party whose condition is in controversy notice \u201cto submit to a physical, mental or blood examination by a designated physician.\u201d A noticed party then is obligated under 22 NYCRR 202.17 (b) (1) to deliver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">\u201ccopies of the medical reports of those medical providers who have previously treated or examined the party seeking recovery. These shall include a recital of the injuries and conditions as to which testimony will be offered at the trial, referring to and identifying those X-ray and technicians reports which will be offered at the trial, including a description of the injuries, a diagnosis and a prognosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">In most personal injury cases, disclosure under this rule is straightforward. The injured plaintiff goes to the doctor for diagnosis and treatment. The doctor drafts a report. The plaintiff turns over the report to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">This case is more complicated. Plaintiffs allegedly suffered lead poisoning as children. Now adults, plaintiffs allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>their childhood exposure to lead caused them numerous injuries. It appears from the dearth of medical evidence in the record that plaintiffs may never have been treated for or diagnosed with many of the alleged injuries. This raises the question of what plaintiffs must disclose in order to comply with rule 202.17 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the rule requires them to turn over only those reports that currently exist from providers who have \u201cpreviously treated or examined\u201d them. They argue that they are not required to document or create medical evidence of every alleged injury. To the extent that plaintiffs are arguing that the rule does not obligate them to hire a medical provider to examine them and create a report solely for purposes of the litigations, we agree. Requiring a personal injury plaintiff to hire a medical professional to draft a report purely to satisfy 22 NYCRR 202.17 (b) (1) could make it prohibitively expensive for some plaintiffs to bring legitimate personal injury suits. Some plaintiffs may not be able to afford a medical examination or may not even have access to a doctor. Plaintiffs therefore need only produce reports from medical providers who have \u201cpreviously treated or examined\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">To the extent, however, that plaintiffs claim that they need to turn over only those medical reports that currently exist, we disagree. The rule obligates plaintiffs to provide comprehensive reports from their treating and examining medical providers\u2014 the reports <em>\u201cshall </em>include a recital of the injuries and conditions as to which testimony will be offered at the trial\u201d (22 NYCRR 202.17 [b] [1] [emphasis added]). Plaintiffs therefore cannot avoid disclosure simply because their treating or examining medical providers have not drafted any reports within the meaning of rule 202.17 (b) (1) <em>(see Ciriello v Virgues, </em>156 AD2d 417, 418 [2d Dept 1989] [\u201c(T)he fact that a report never was prepared does not obviate the party\u2019s obligation under the rules\u201d]; <em>Davidson v Steer/Peanut Gallery, </em>277 AD2d 965, 965 [4th Dept 2000]; <em>Pierson v Yourish, </em>122 AD2d 202, 203 [2d Dept 1986]). If plaintiffs\u2019 medical reports do not contain the information required by the rule, then plaintiffs must have the medical providers draft reports setting forth that information <em>(see id.).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>If that is not possible, plaintiffs must seek relief from disclosure and explain why they cannot comply with the rule <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 202.17 [j]).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We conclude therefore that Supreme Court abused its discretion in requiring plaintiffs to provide medical evidence of each alleged injury or otherwise be precluded from offering evidence of that injury at trial. Supreme Court\u2019s motivation for granting that relief is understandable. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed boilerplate bills of particulars and then did not disclose medical records substantiating the alleged injuries. To that end, plaintiffs should amend their respective bills of particulars to reflect those injuries actually sustained. Nonetheless, although Supreme Court had wide, inherent discretion to manage discovery, foster orderly proceedings, and limit counsel\u2019s gamesmanship <em>(see Kavanagh v Ogden Allied Maintenance Corp., </em>92 NY2d 952, 954 [1998]), the ordered relief exceeded the court\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Supreme Court also granted relief beyond that contemplated by 22 NYCRR 202.17 (b) (1) by requiring plaintiffs to produce, prior to the defense examination, a medical report causally relating plaintiffs\u2019 injuries to lead paint exposure or be precluded from offering proof of such injuries at trial. The rule requires that the medical reports \u201cinclude a recital of the injuries and conditions as to which testimony will be offered at the trial, . . . including a description of the injuries, a diagnosis and a prognosis.\u201d There is no requirement that medical providers causally relate the injury to the defendant\u2019s negligence or, in this case, the lead paint exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">If determining causation requires evidence from a medical professional, causation is more appropriately dealt with at the expert discovery phase and pursuant to CPLR 3101 (d). If defendants wish to expedite expert discovery, they can move in Supreme Court for amendment of the scheduling orders. Should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>plaintiffs fail to produce any evidence of causation, then defendants can move for and obtain summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Supreme Court properly denied plaintiff Hamilton\u2019s CPLR 4511 motion to take judicial notice of 42 USC \u00a7 4851. That provision contains Congress\u2019s findings justifying legislation aimed at reducing lead \u2014 findings such as: \u201cat low levels, lead poisoning in children causes intelligence quotient deficiencies, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, and behavior problems\u201d; and \u201cthe Federal Government must take a leadership role in building the infrastructure \u2014 including an informed public, State and local delivery systems, certified inspectors, contractors, and laboratories, trained workers, and available financing and insurance\u2014 necessary to ensure that the national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing can be achieved as expeditiously as possible\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 4851 [2], [8]). Hamilton apparently sought judicial notice of the federal provision in order to avoid having to prove general causation \u2014 that lead paint exposure can cause some or all of his alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">CPLR 4511 allows a court to take notice of federal and foreign state law, not facts, that is relevant to a proceeding (CPLR 4511; <em>Pfleuger v Pfleuger, </em>304 NY 148, 151 [1952]). The congressional findings in support of legislation seeking to reduce amounts of lead in homes, though codified in a federal statute, are not \u201claw\u201d that is relevant to Hamilton\u2019s case. Taking judicial notice of them under CPLR 4511 would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">What Hamilton really wanted was to have Supreme Court take judicial notice of the <em>fact </em>that exposure to lead paint can cause injury. \u201cTo be sure, a court may take judicial notice of facts which are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to easily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy\u201d (Pe<em>ople v Jones, </em>73 NY2d 427, 431 [1989] [internal quotation marks omitted]). But general causation, at least in scientifically complex cases, is not such a fact. Hamilton needs to prove, through scientific evidence, that exposure to lead-based paint can cause the injuries of which he complains <em>(see Parker v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>7 NY3d 434, 448 [2006]). He cannot avoid that burden simply because Congress, in statutory preambles, has opined on the dangers of lead-based paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by remitting to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-5\">Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Smith dissents and votes to affirm for the reasons stated in the memorandum of the Appellate Division (106 AD3d 1476 [2013]).</judges>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In <em>Hamilton v Miller: </em>Order modified, without costs, by remitting to Supreme Court, Monroe County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-7\">Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Smith dissents and votes to affirm for the reasons stated in the memorandum of the Appellate Division (105 AD3d 1313 [2013]).</judges>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">In <em>Giles v Yi: </em>Order modified, without costs, by remitting to Supreme Court, Monroe County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\">.

We note that prior to April 17, 1998, rule 202.17 (b) (1), which had required the plaintiff in advance of the examination to serve on all parties reports of physicians who had previously treated or examined the plaintiff, also required the reports to \u201cinclude a \u2018detailed recital of the injuries\u2019 about which testimony is to be offered at trial, and this was generally construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>require a narrative report rather than the briefer notations found in . . . insurance and workers\u2019 compensation forms\u201d (73 Siegel\u2019s Practice Review 1, <em>Amendment of Rules Dispenses with \u201cDetailed\u201d Recitation of Injuries </em>[July 1998]). The April 17, 1998 amendment struck out the word \u201cdetailed\u201d which, according to a member of the committee that recommended the amendment, would \u201callow the plaintiff to prosecute his personal injury case from inception through trial without ever obtaining a narrative report <em>if </em>his provider form(s) contains the essential information, i.e., a description of the injuries, a diagnosis and a prognosis, and, if X-rays or technicians\u2019 reports will be offered at trial, a reference to those reports\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]; <em>see </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 363 [5th ed 2011] [Note: online treatise]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
