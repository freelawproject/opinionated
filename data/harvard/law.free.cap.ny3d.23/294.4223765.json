Contrary to the views expressed in Justice Catterson\u2019s majority opinion, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that Vincent Barone and V.

The evidentiary rulings connected to the mix-design counts were proper. <em>(People v Goodman, </em>31 NY2d 262; <em>People v Kisina, </em>14 NY3d 153; <em>Smith v United States, </em>188 F2d 969; <em>United States v Brookshire, </em>514 F2d 786; <em>Burnett v United States, </em>222 F2d 426; <em>Newton v Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>135 F3d 266; <em>United States v Seelig, </em>622 F2d 207; <em>United States v Riley, </em>550 F2d 233; <em>United States v Christo, </em>614 F2d 486; <em>People v Gilman, </em>28 Misc 3d 1217[A], 2010 NY Slip Op 51379[U].) IV There was overwhelming evidence that Vincent Barone tampered with Testwell Laboratories, Inc.\u2019s test data. V The evidence amply proved that the defendants each intentionally aided in the steel inspection scheme. <em>(People v Alfaro, </em>66 NY2d 985; <em>People v Satloff, </em>56 NY2d 745; <em>People v Stahl, </em>53 NY2d 1048; <em>People v Tucker, </em>55 NY2d 1; <em>People v Rayam, </em>94 NY2d 557; <em>Dunn v United States, </em>284 US 390; <em>People v Horne, </em>97 NY2d 404.) VI. The three judicial comments Vincent Barone attacks could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>(People v Killgo, </em>33 AD2d 226; <em>People v Charleston, </em>56 NY2d 886; <em>People v Moulton, </em>43 NY2d 944; <em>People v Yut Wai Tom, </em>53 NY2d 44.)

The court provided a meaningful response to the jury\u2019s note about the crime of false filing. <em>(People v O\u2019Rama, </em>78 NY2d 270; <em>People v Weinberg, </em>83 NY2d 262; <em>People v Steinberg, </em>79 NY2d 673; <em>People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d 296; <em>People v Santi, </em>3 NY3d 234; <em>People v Almodovar, </em>62 NY2d 126; <em>People v Torres, </em>8 AD3d 123; <em>People v Washington, </em>35 AD3d 288; <em>People v Overlee, </em>236 AD2d 133; <em>People v Lugo, </em>81 AD3d 532.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b356-6\">Graffeo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">We are asked in these appeals whether the Appellate Division applied the correct legal standard when it reviewed the sufficiency and weight of the evidence supporting defendants\u2019 convictions for enterprise corruption (Penal Law art 460). We hold that the Appellate Division did not properly consider the elements of the crime under <em>People v Western Express Intl., Inc. </em>(19 NY3d 652 [2012]), that the trial evidence sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>established defendants\u2019 commission of enterprise corruption and that the Appellate Division should reassess its weight of the evidence determination under the applicable statutory standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Construction contractors in New York City often hire licensed testing firms to ascertain proper compliance with building code provisions due to the stringent nature of those regulations <em>(see </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 28-701.1 <em>et seq.) </em>and the limited resources of the City\u2019s Department of Buildings. One such compliance firm was Testwell Laboratories, Inc., a leading materials testing company operating in the metropolitan area. Defendant V Reddy Rancharla, a professional engineer, served as Testwell Laboratories\u2019 president and chief executive officer. Defendant Vincent Barone was a company vice-president in charge of the corporation\u2019s engineering department.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">A grand jury charged defendants and others with engaging in a pattern of criminal activity while intentionally conducting and participating in the affairs of a criminal enterprise \u2014 referred to as the \u201cTestwell Group\u201d \u2014 consisting of Testwell Laboratories, Inc., and a number of its officers and employees. The indictment alleged that defendants committed or allowed certain of the corporation\u2019s employees to engage in a multitude of illegal acts involving the falsification of test results, improper inspections of construction projects and double-billing of clients. Those offenses were grouped under distinct, but interrelated, criminal schemes related to five categories of Testwell Laboratories\u2019 material testing services: (1) \u201cMix-Design\u201d; (2) \u201cSteel Inspections\u201d; (3) \u201cCertified Inspectors\u201d; (4) \u201cField Tests\u201d; and (5) \u201cCompressive/ Flexural Strength Alterations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The essence of the \u201cmix-design\u201d scheme was that Testwell Laboratories would be retained by contractors or project owners to test and determine the strength of proposed concrete mixtures used at various construction sites. Instead of engaging in appropriate laboratory testing of the concrete samples, it was alleged that Testwell Laboratories merely used a mathematical formula to replace actual analysis and then issued reports falsely certifying that the results were based on legitimate test results. Those reports bore Rancharla\u2019s signature and engineer\u2019s stamp, and their falsity became obvious since Testwell Laboratories charged far less ($300 or $500) for those reports than it ordinarily billed when concrete was analyzed with laboratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>testing (approximately $4,000). Furthermore, different reports, created months apart, displayed improbably similar results with distinct patterns, and some reports were generated within days of being ordered despite the fact that the building code mandated longer intervals between sequential tests. Testwell Laboratories also designed a computer program that automatically generated figures for concrete strength after a desired final result was specified. In the course of the criminal investigation \u2014 in which Testwell Laboratories\u2019 laboratory director cooperated with the People \u2014 scores of blank mix-design reports were discovered that were pre-signed by Rancharla and bore his seal. Rancharla acknowledged wrongdoing, but claimed that he committed regulatory violations of the building code rather than criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The \u201csteel inspections\u201d plot was premised on evidence that Testwell Laboratories failed to properly conduct steel inspections according to the code since it assigned two agents to multiple construction projects that they could not possibly have inspected on a full-time basis without additional assistance. Investigators found that neither inspector was in attendance at a steel fabrication facility and mandatory inspection records were not maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The charges pertaining to \u201ccertified inspectors\u201d arose from a school construction project in Queens. Testwell Laboratories falsely certified that two of its employees had proper professional certifications to test concrete as it was being poured. The related \u201cfield tests\u201d category involved false confirmations that Testwell Laboratories had performed various concrete tests at two construction sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Finally, the adequacy of laboratory testing of concrete was the focus of the \u201ccompressive/flexural strength alterations\u201d allegations. The building code mandates that concrete being poured must be collected and formed into cylinders (for compressive testing) or beams (for flexural testing), which are then brought to a laboratory for scientific analysis of actual strength. A Testwell Laboratories computer system was programmed to permit certain employees to engage in the alteration of testing data. The program hid the employees\u2019 identities and issued warnings if inputted data did not generate an acceptable concrete strength. Company staff notified Barone or another Testwell Laboratories\u2019 supervisor when such alerts were received and Barone would instruct data entry personnel to change the computations. Investigators discovered facsimile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>messages from Barone that listed hundreds of numerical changes and a technician who participated in the fraud cooperated with the prosecution. In total, investigators determined that data had been altered several thousand times on more than 100 different construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In connection with these alleged illegal activities, Rancharla and Barone were tried jointly before a jury on 50 counts that included a charge that they were members of the Testwell Group \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d under article 460 of the Penal Law. In support of that offense, Rancharla was charged with committing various criminal \u201cpattern acts\u201d while participating in the schemes involving mix design, steel inspections and certified inspectors; Barone was charged with multiple offenses for his alleged involvement in the schemes for steel inspections, compressive/flexural strength alterations, and certified inspectors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rancharla was ultimately found guilty of enterprise corruption, all 13 mix-design counts and one steel inspections count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barone was likewise convicted of enterprise corruption, along with five crimes under the compressive/flexural strength alterations scheme; seven offenses for the steel inspections scheme; and the certified inspectors scheme as a pattern act for enterprise corruption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rancharla was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 7 to 21 years and Barone received a 5Vs-to-16-year aggregate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The Appellate Division modified by vacating the enterprise corruption convictions and reducing the sentences for both defendants in the interest of justice to lVs to 4 years (101 AD3d 585 [1st Dept 2012]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded that the enterprise corruption convictions lacked sufficient proof and were against the weight of the evidence because \u201cthe People failed to produce any evidence that either defendant knew that test results and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>inspection reports were fabricated, much less that the defendants spearheaded a criminal enterprise\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 587). The court also found that the prosecution did not establish <em>\u201ca </em>leadership structure, overall planning of the criminal enterprise, or any communications ... in furtherance of the criminal enterprise\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 592). The Appellate Division rejected defendants\u2019 challenges to the non-enterprise corruption offenses. One Justice dissented and would have affirmed the enterprise corruption convictions; another Justice dissented and would have ordered a new trial on all of the remaining non-enterprise corruption counts. Both parties were granted leave to appeal to our Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Our primary concern in this appeal focuses on the enterprise corruption convictions. The People argue that the Appellate Division did not apply the proper legal standard for criminal enterprises in reviewing the sufficiency and weight of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict. More particularly, the People assert that the Appellate Division vacated the convictions based on a misunderstanding of Penal Law article 460 and <em>People v Western Express Intl., Inc. </em>(19 NY3d 652 [2012]). Defendants, in contrast, ask us to dismiss the cross appeal on jurisdictional grounds because they believe that the Appellate Division examined the correct legal rules and decided only questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Sufficiency and weight review are distinct concepts. To determine whether a verdict was based on sufficient proof, a court must \u201cmarshal competent facts most favorable to the People and determine whether, as a matter of law, a jury could logically conclude that the People sustained [their] burden of proof\u2019 <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]). Evidence of guilt is legally sufficient if the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the People, provide a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which the finder of fact could have rationally concluded that the elements of the crime were established beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(see e.g. id.; People v Heidgen, </em>22 NY3d 259, 277 [2013]; <em>People v Delamota, </em>18 NY3d 107, 113 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">A legally sufficient verdict, however, may be against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d at 349). Unlike a sufficiency analysis, weight of the evidence review requires an intermediate appellate court to act, in effect, as a second jury <em>(see People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 633, 644 n 2 [2006]) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>by rendering its own determination of the facts as proved at trial \u201cin light of the elements of the crime as charged to the other jurors, even when the law has changed between the time of trial and the time of appeal\u201d <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d at 349). In according \u201c[g]reat deference ... to the fact-finder\u2019s opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony and observe demeanor\u201d <em>(People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]), the reviewing court must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">\u201cfirst . . . determine whether an acquittal would not have been unreasonable. If so, the court must weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions. Based on the weight of the credible evidence, the court then decides whether the jury was justified in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d at 348, citing <em>People v Crum, </em>272 NY 348 [1936]; <em>see e.g. People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004], <em>cert denied </em>542 US 946 [2004]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This standard generally requires factual assessments that are within the exclusive province of the intermediate appellate courts <em>(see </em>CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>see e.g. People v Rayam, </em>94 NY2d 557, 560 [2000]). Consequently, we cannot review a weight of the evidence challenge unless the intermediate appellate court manifestly failed to consider the issue or did so using an incorrect legal principle <em>(see e.g. People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d at 646). Where the court below erred as a matter of law, the remedy is to reverse and remit for a proper assessment of the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d at 349-350; <em>People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d at 646).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Our evaluation of the sufficiency of the enterprise corruption convictions begins with the relevant Penal Law provisions. The \u201cOrganized Crime Control Act\u201d (Penal Law art 460) was created in 1986 <em>(see </em>L 1986, ch 516) \u201cto address the particular and cumulative harm posed by persons who band together in complex criminal organizations\u201d <em>(People v Besser, </em>96 NY2d 136, 142 [2001]). It outlawed participation in a \u201ccriminal enterprise,\u201d defined as \u201ca group of persons sharing a common purpose of engaging in criminal conduct, associated in an ascertainable structure distinct from a pattern of criminal activity, and with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>continuity of existence, structure and criminal purpose beyond the scope of individual criminal incidents\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 460.10 [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We addressed the concept of enterprise corruption in <em>People v Western Express Intl., Inc. </em>(19 NY3d 652 [2012]). In that case, the corporation was controlled by a defendant who maintained a website providing a medium for other defendants to independently purchase or sell stolen credit card information. Based on the text of the enterprise corruption statutes, we observed that it is \u201cnecessary to distinguish between . . . mere[ ] patterns of criminal conduct and . . . patterns of such conduct demonstrably designed to achieve the purposes and promote the interests of organized, structurally distinct criminal entities\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 658). Only the second situation is encompassed within Penal Law article 460 because the crime of enterprise corruption \u201cdemand[s] proof of an association possessing a continuity of existence, criminal purpose, and structure \u2014 which is to say, of constancy and capacity exceeding the individual crimes committed under the association\u2019s auspices or for its purposes\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We found the proof of guilt to be insufficient in <em>Western Express </em>because there was no \u201cstructured, purposeful criminal organization\u201d or \u201cinference of a distinct, beneficially related criminal enterprise\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 659).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In this case, the Appellate Division did not apply the proper legal standards when it reviewed the sufficiency of defendants\u2019 enterprise corruption convictions. It concluded that \u201cthe People failed to introduce any evidence of a leadership structure, overall planning of the criminal enterprise, or any communications between Rancharla, Barone, and any of the Testwell employees in furtherance of the criminal enterprise\u201d (101 AD3d at 592). Those determinations were erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Testwell Laboratories itself was a corporate entity that had a distinct hierarchical apparatus with Rancharla positioned as its leader and manager. Corporate officers and employees of a legitimate business organization can fall within the ambit of the enterprise corruption statutes <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 460.20 [3]; Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1986, ch 516, 1986 McRinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY at 3177 [Penal Law article 460 was designed to encompass \u201ca criminal group existing and operating within (a) legitimate enterprise\u201d]). Here, the People demonstrated adequately that the Testwell Group had a \u201ccontinuity of existence, criminal purpose and structure . . . exceeding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>individual crimes committed under the association\u2019s auspices or for its purposes\u201d <em>(People v Western Express Intl., Inc., </em>19 NY3d at 658). The offenses were perpetrated in conjunction with five interrelated illegal schemes that covered hundreds of construction projects. And the operations of the corporation established the necessary continuity beyond the individual criminal offenses. In this regard, <em>Western Express </em>is clearly distinguishable from the facts presented here because the persons involved in that scheme were ad hoc operators who used the defendant corporation\u2019s website as a medium to independently traffic in stolen credit card information with \u201cno hint that any of the market participants acted except for and according to their own particular interests\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 659). In contrast, the members of the Testwell Group can reasonably be viewed as engaging in their illicit and fraudulent activities within Testwell Laboratories\u2019 existing corporate structure with the common purpose to promote its status as a major metropolitan materials testing laboratory and increase profits, despite the fact that the ill-gotten gains comprised only a small portion of the company\u2019s overall revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The Appellate Division further observed that there was no direct evidence of communications, planning or concerted activity between the Testwell Group actors. Direct proof of this nature, however, is not essential to a legally sufficient case of enterprise corruption. To the contrary, the overall pattern of criminal activity and the involvement of various individuals at all levels of Testwell Laboratories\u2019 corporate structure allowed the jury to infer that Kancharla and Barone, as high-level corporate officers, were aware of, participated in and directed others to commit crimes in furtherance of the Testwell Group\u2019s objectives. Indeed, Kancharla admitted that he personally provided blank mix-design reports bearing his signature and engineer\u2019s stamp so that concrete strength could be fraudulently certified by another company employee using a mathematical formula instead of performing actual tests in the laboratory. Barone, in turn, attempted to conceal those falsehoods with additional fraud \u2014 altering testing results so it would appear consistent with acceptable, expected results. When Barone did not do so personally, he directed others to falsify the data, and company employees used a computer program designed to hide the identity of the individuals inputting the fake data and warn them if true information had already been conveyed to clients of Testwell Laboratories. Nor did defendants have to be privy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>every crime or scheme committed by the Testwell Group \u2014 it was enough that they were aware of the general structure of the enterprise, had knowledge of the overarching criminal design, and engaged in a requisite pattern of criminal activity <em>(see e.g. </em>Penal Law \u00a7 460.10 [3], [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In sum, there was a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences <em>(see e.g. People v Heidgen, </em>22 NY3d at 277; <em>People v Delamota, </em>18 NY3d at 113) from which the jury could have rationally concluded that defendants operated the Testwell Group and participated in its illegal activities in a manner that satisfies the definition of a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d The People\u2019s evidence was therefore legally sufficient to support the enterprise corruption convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The Appellate Division alternatively concluded that, based on its review of the \u201claw and the facts,\u201d the findings of guilt were against the weight of the evidence. Looking beyond that assertion <em>(see People v D\u2019Alessandro, </em>13 NY3d 216, 218-219 [2009]; <em>People v Giles, </em>73 NY2d 666, 670 [1989]), however, it is evident that the court\u2019s weight of the evidence analysis was infected by the same error of law that led it to vacate the enterprise corruption convictions on sufficiency grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Division should therefore reconsider its determination under the appropriate legal standards <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 460.00 <em>et seq.; People v Western Express Intl., Inc., </em>19 NY3d 652 [2012]). In light of our conclusion, it is unnecessary to address defendants\u2019 remaining contentions at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by remitting the cases to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Read, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur; Judge Abdus-Salaam taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In each case: Order modified by remitting to the Appellate Division, First Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. The certified inspectors scheme was charged as a \u201cpattern act\u201d for enterprise corruption because it occurred in Queens County and the New York County grand jury therefore lacked geographical jurisdiction to indict defendants on specific crimes pertaining to that scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">. Specifically, Rancharla was convicted of enterprise corruption, two counts of scheme to defraud in the first degree, nine counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree and three counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">. The jury found that Barone committed enterprise corruption, attempted grand larceny in the third degree, two counts of scheme to defraud in the first degree and nine counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">. The court also vacated two counts of offering a false instrument for filing against Rancharla. The propriety of that ruling is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">. For this reason, the People\u2019s appeal satisfies the requisites of CPL 450.90 (2) (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
