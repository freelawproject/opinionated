This lawsuit is the second to come to us in which IDT Corp. claims that Tyco International, Ltd. breached its obligation under a 2000 settlement agreement to negotiate additional agreements in good faith. In the previous lawsuit, we held IDT\u2019s claim to be unsupported by the record <em>(IDT Corp. v Tyco Group, S.A.R.L., </em>13 NY3d 209, 215 [2009]). More negotiations took place after our decision, and IDT sued Tyco again in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We again reject IDT\u2019s claim. Parties who agree to negotiate are not bound to negotiate forever. It is clear on this record that the parties have reached an impasse and that IDT has no valid cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The relationship between the parties goes back at least to 1999, when IDT and Tyco (terms we use to include the parent corporations, IDT Corp. and Tyco International, Ltd., and their subsidiaries and affiliates) signed a memorandum of understanding relating to a joint venture that would develop an undersea fiber optic telecommunications system. Three lawsuits arising out of this proposed transaction were brought in 2000, and were settled by a Settlement Agreement dated October 10, 2000. Two later lawsuits, the one we decided in 2009 and the one we decide today, arose out of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">As we explained in our earlier opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u201cThe settlement agreement, among other things . . . called for Tyco to provide IDT with an \u2018indefeasible right of use\u2019 (IRU) of certain fiber optic capacity free of charge for a 15-year period. The capacity was to be on Tyco\u2019s TyCom Global Network (TGN), a subsea cable system planned to connect North America, Asia and Europe. At the time of the settlement, the TGN was not yet constructed. The agreement states that \u2018[t]he IRU shall be documented pursuant to definitive agreements to be mutually agreed upon and, in any event, containing terms and conditions consistent with those described herein.\u2019 These further definitive agreements, and the IRU, were to be in writing and consistent with Ty-co\u2019s standard agreements with similarly situated customers. Tyco\u2019s standard agreements were not in existence at the time the settlement was made\u201d <em>(IDT Corp., </em>13 NY3d at 212 [footnote omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In a round of negotiations stretching from 2001 to 2004, the parties failed to reach the \u201cdefinitive agreements\u201d by which the IRU was to be \u201cdocumented.\u201d In the course of the negotiations, Tyco proposed terms that were, in IDT\u2019s view, inconsistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. We said in our previous opinion, summarizing the record before us: \u201cNegotiations continued to be active, but flagged after a sharp drop in the market greatly reduced the value of the capacity Tyco had agreed to supply. The negotiations finally came to an end in March 2004\u201d <em>(id.). </em>IDT sued Tyco in May of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We affirmed a grant of summary judgment dismissing IDT\u2019s 2004 complaint. We agreed with IDT that the 2000 Settlement Agreement \u201cwas a fully enforceable contract\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 213), but held that Tyco\u2019s obligation under that contract to furnish IDT with capacity was subject to conditions \u2014 most important among them the negotiation and execution of the IRU \u2014 that were never met. We recognized the parties\u2019 obligation \u201cto negotiate the terms of the IRU and other agreements in good faith\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 214), but held that Tyco had not breached its obligation merely by proposing (as distinct from insisting upon) terms allegedly inconsistent with the Settlement Agreement. We concluded that \u201cthe record does not support a finding that Tyco breached any of its obligations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Five weeks after our decision, counsel for IDT sent a letter to Tyco demanding that Tyco \u201cimmediately comply with [its] obligations\u201d under the 2000 Settlement Agreement by providing fiber optic capacity to IDT. Tyco replied that it had no further obligations under the Settlement Agreement \u2014 a position that it reaffirmed several times in the following months \u2014 but nevertheless agreed to negotiate. This round of negotiations was no more successful than the previous one, and IDT brought the present case in November of 2010, asserting separate causes of action for breach of contract and for breach of Tyco\u2019s duty to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">IDT\u2019s new complaint recounts a series of written and oral communications between IDT and Tyco in 2009 and 2010. This narrative concludes with the allegation that in an October 13, 2010 telephone conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u201cTyco continued to insist on terms that conflicted with the Settlement Agreement and made a definite and final communication to IDT of Tyco\u2019s intent to forgo its obligations under the Settlement Agreement, including its obligation to provide to IDT the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>use of the Wavelengths described in the Settlement Agreement for fifteen years and in a manner fully consistent with that described in the Settlement Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The complaint is not more specific about what Tyco representatives allegedly said on October 13. The only document in the record that purports to summarize the October 13 conversation is an email sent the following day by Tyco\u2019s counsel. The email does not support the complaint\u2019s description of the conversation; it neither makes any nonnegotiable demands nor suggests that Tyco is unwilling to continue negotiating.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On Tyco\u2019s motion pursuant to CPLR 3211, Supreme Court, interpreting our previous decision to mean \u201cthat Tyco has no further obligations under the Settlement Agreement,\u201d dismissed IDT\u2019s 2010 complaint for failure to state a cause of action (2011 NY Slip Op 33843[U], *6 [2011]). The Appellate Division reversed, concluding that Tyco\u2019s \u201cobligations . . . did not have an expiration date\u201d and that \u201cthe parties were obligated to continue to negotiate until either side insisted that the open terms be as set forth in [Tyco\u2019s] standard agreements\u201d <em>(IDT Corp. v Tyco </em>Group, <em>S.A.R.L., </em>104 AD3d 170, 176 [1st Dept 2012]). The Appellate Division also held that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 statements that they had no further obligations to negotiate\u201d were \u201can anticipatory breach of the contract\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 176-177), and that the result of the previous action did not bar IDT\u2019s present claims under the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel <em>(id. </em>at 178). Two Justices concurred in the result, agreeing that our decision in the previous action did not bar the present one and finding IDT\u2019s allegation, quoted above, that Tyco had insisted on terms in conflict with the Settlement Agreement to be sufficient \u201cat this pre-discovery stage of the proceeding\u201d to withstand a motion to dismiss <em>(id. </em>at 179 [Friedman, J., concurring]).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The Appellate Division granted Tyco leave to appeal, certifying to us the question of whether its order was properly made (2013 NY Slip Op 74325[U] [2013]). We answer in the negative, reverse and reinstate Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">As our 2009 decision makes clear, parties may enter into a binding contract under which the obligations of the parties are conditioned on the negotiation of future agreements. In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>case, the parties are obliged to negotiate in good faith. But that obligation can come to an end without a breach by either party. There is such a thing as a good faith impasse; not every good faith negotiation bears fruit. As then-District Judge Leval explained in <em>Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Assn. of Am. v Tribune Co. </em>(670 F Supp 491, 505 [SD NY 1987]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c[I]f, through no fault on either party, no final contract were reached, either because the parties in good faith failed to agree on the open secondary terms, or because, as often happens in business, the parties simply lost interest in the transaction and by mutual tacit consent abandoned it without having reached final contract documents, no enforceable rights would survive based on the preliminary commitment.\u201d <em>(See also Adjustrite Sys., Inc. v GAB Bus. Servs., Inc., </em>145 F3d 543, 548 [2d Cir 1998] [if the parties \u201cfail to reach ... a final agreement after making a good faith effort to do so, there is no further obligation\u201d]; <em>Snakepit Auto., Inc. v Superformance Intl., LLC, </em>19 Misc 3d 1114[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 50683[U], *5 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 2008] [finding that the parties \u201chave negotiated in good faith\u201d but \u201cwere unable to reach an agreement\u201d].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Tyco says that in this case its obligation to negotiate came to an end in 2004. It relies on our 2009 decision, and the facts underlying it, as establishing that the negotiations reached impasse, or were abandoned by both parties, in 2004, without bad faith on Tyco\u2019s part at least.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We did indeed hold in 2009 that IDT had failed to show bad faith by Tyco. We also said that, after adverse developments in the marketplace, negotiations \u201cflagged\u201d and \u201cfinally came to an end in March 2004\u201d (13 NY3d at 212). IDT is technically correct that this last statement does not bind it as a matter of res judicata or collateral estoppel; whether the negotiations had \u201cfinally\u201d ended in 2004 was not directly in issue in the earlier case. Our statement that they did end then, however, was supported by the record before us, and no fact alleged by IDT in the present case is inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">But even on the assumption that Tyco\u2019s obligation under the 2000 Settlement Agreement to negotiate additional agreements in good faith still existed in 2009-2010, IDT\u2019s complaint does not sufficiently allege any breach of the obligation. It is true, as the concurring Justices in the Appellate Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>pointed out, that courts normally give a generous reading to pleadings that are attacked as insufficient on their face. But it is not too much to ask that a pleading filed after more than a decade of back and forth between the parties contain some specific facts supporting the claim of bad faith \u2014 not just the bald conclusions, contradicted by the only relevant document referred to, that Tyco insisted \u201con terms that conflicted with the Settlement Agreement\u201d and \u201cmade a definite and final communication\u201d of its intent to violate its obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">While some specific details of the 2009-2010 negotiations are contained in IDT\u2019s 2010 complaint, none of them, in our view, support an inference that Tyco failed to negotiate in good faith. IDT seems to rely heavily on Tyco\u2019s repeated insistence, while continuing to negotiate with IDT, that it was not bound by the 2000 Settlement Agreement to do so. But this mere statement of Tyco\u2019s legal position \u2014 whether or not the position was meritorious \u2014 is not in itself a refusal to negotiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the order of Supreme Court reinstated, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b562-7\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9X\">(dissenting). While I agree with the majority that parties may sometimes reach an \u201cimpasse\u201d during contract negotiations (majority op at 500), neither party claims that is what happened here. Rather, IDT alleges that Tyco insisted that it had no obligation to negotiate and when Tyco did entertain negotiations, it did so in bad faith. Tyco admits that it took the position that it had no obligation to negotiate after this Court\u2019s 2009 decision. Because Tyco had not been discharged of its obligations, either by this Court\u2019s 2009 decision or by operation of law, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The obligation for Tyco to supply IDT with the wavelengths capacity arises out of the parties \u201cvalid settlement agreement\u201d from 2001 <em>(IDT Corp. v Tyco Group, S.A.R.L., </em>13 NY3d 209, 214 [2009]). In 2009, this Court held that IDT could not be successful on a claim for an anticipatory breach of the agreement for Tyco\u2019s failure to turn over the wavelengths because the terms of that turnover were not yet completed and, at that juncture, there was no record support for the claim that Tyco had acted in bad faith during the negotiations of the turnover <em>(id. </em>at 214-215). We did not say, contrary to Tyco\u2019s interpretation of our decision, that the parties were no longer bound to negotiate the terms of the turnover contemplated by the agreement. Rather, we expressly recognized that additional good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>negotiations were to . proceed as required by the settlement agreement <em>(id. </em>at 214 [\u201cunder the settlement agreement, the parties were required to negotiate the terms of the IRU and other agreements in good faith\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The current lawsuit concerns Tyco\u2019s actions, and inaction, after our 2009 decision. While the majority criticizes the lengthy history of the parties\u2019 dispute and IDT\u2019s failure to include more documentary support for its allegation <em>(see </em>majority op at 503-504), this is a pre-pleading CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss the complaint. IDT was simply required to state a valid cause of action and, in my view, it did.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-6\">Judges Read, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur with Judge Smith; Judge Pigott dissents in an opinion in which Judge Graffeo concurs; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Order reversed, with costs, order of Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
