The narrative of what happened and its aftermath, as developed at defendant\u2019s jury trial in May 2009,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> follows. The issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge should have submitted a charge of second-degree manslaughter to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Enrique Navarette, who had in the past occasionally worked at the Brooklyn bar as a bouncer, arrived there between 11:30 and 11:45 p.m. on February 26, 2005. While sitting in the front corner of the bar, near the entrance, he saw defendant and three male companions walk in. Defendant was wearing a camouflage jacket with a hoodie; one of the four men was wearing a green cap, but Navarette could not recall which one. After the bouncer patted them down for weapons, the defendant and his companions stopped by the bar for beers and then continued to the back of the room towards the dance floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m., Ojeda, along with Carlos Solomon, Jonathan Dominguez and another friend, arrived at the Brooklyn bar, having left a nearby strip club where they had been since about 11:30 p.m. Shortly after arriving, Solomon walked to the back of the bar to the men\u2019s room. He had been standing with Ojeda in front of a side exit door near a jukebox, not far from the dance floor. On his way to the men\u2019s room, Solomon saw defendant dancing with a woman on the dance floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">After rejoining Ojeda, Solomon witnessed defendant approach Ojeda and whisper something in his ear. He could not hear what was being said, \u201c[b]ut there was [a] conversation going on.\u201d Defendant was joined by two of his friends. Solomon asked one of these men, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d and the two began to quarrel. Then \u201call of a sudden\u201d Solomon saw defendant \u201cstrike\u201d or \u201cpunch\u201d Ojeda twice in Ojeda\u2019s left shoulder or chest. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Navarette saw defendant abruptly \u201cpush\u201d Ojeda with one hand \u201ctwice, maybe\u201d on the upper left side of Ojeda\u2019s chest near his shoulder. Neither Solomon nor Navarette noticed whether anything was in defendant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The bouncer rushed in to break up the fighting, and Navarette followed to back him up. Defendant and one of his companions quickly left the Brooklyn bar, chased by the bouncer, and Navarette stayed behind to stop anyone from following. Navarette separated Solomon and Dominguez from defendant\u2019s remaining companion, who turned out to be defendant\u2019s brother, Julio Rivera, but they both managed to throw punches at Julio before he, too, left the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Dominguez had been standing with his back to Ojeda and Solomon, talking to someone, before he became aware of the \u201cscuffle\u201d behind him and turned around. When Dominguez asked Ojeda and Solomon what was happening, Ojeda replied \u201cI\u2019m stabbed.\u201d Dominguez saw blood \u201cleaking down\u201d from Ojeda\u2019s neck. Ojeda, although choking and bleeding heavily, was able to make it on his own to Solomon\u2019s car, parked near the Brooklyn bar. Solomon drove Ojeda, along with Dominguez and their other friend, to Lutheran Medical Center, about 20 blocks distant, running red lights along the way. The trip took minutes, but Ojeda lost consciousness before reaching the hospital, where medical personnel were unable to revive him. Ojeda was apparently the only individual to suffer knife wounds during this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Later on February 27, 2005, Dr. Frede Frederic, a forensic pathologist who works as a medical examiner in New York City\u2019s Office of Chief Medical Examiner, autopsied Ojeda. Frederic, who had by that point in her career performed more than 5,000 autopsies, determined that Ojeda suffered three stab wounds. One stab wound was in the upper left chest and was about five inches deep and 174 inches long. This wound pierced the upper lobe of the left lung and \u201ccut through\u201d the second rib, causing Ojeda to bleed to death. The second stab wound was to the left upper back. It was 21/4 inches deep and about IV4 inches long. The third wound, also in the back of the left shoulder, was two inches deep and about 11/4 inches long. These last two nonlethal stab wounds injured the skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle of the left shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">All three wounds went from left to right and downward at an acute angle, and were consistent with having been inflicted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the same knife or sharp instrument, which was either sharp on both sides or had a very thin edge on the unsharpened side. Dr. Frederic opined at trial that Ojeda\u2019s wounds could not have been caused by someone \u201cwaving\u201d a knife around because \u201cyou have to stab the person. The knife has to go through.\u201d According to Dr. Frederic, the fatal stab wound would have caused Ojeda to bleed profusely, lose consciousness in a few minutes, after the loss of enough blood, and then die a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On February 28, 2005, two detectives went to an apartment believed to be defendant\u2019s residence to search for him. There they met defendant\u2019s brother Julio, who had been with defendant at the Brooklyn bar, and returned to the precinct with him. Later that morning, at about 1:20 a.m., detectives returned to this apartment. They knocked on the door and were let in by defendant\u2019s mother. One of the detectives noticed a green camouflage jacket, brown hoodie sweatshirt and green army cap lying on the bedroom floor; bloodstains on the cap were subsequently matched to Ojeda\u2019s DNA. Defendant acknowledged having worn this green cap to the bar on February 27th.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A few hours later, Detective John Darino, the detective assigned to the Ojeda case, learned from defendant\u2019s brother Julio that defendant was at a house in Queens, where the police found him at 4:20 a.m. Detective Darino informed defendant that he was investigating an incident at a Brooklyn bar, and handcuffed and transported him to the precinct, where he was taken to the detective squad interview room. Detective Darino read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and defendant agreed to speak with the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective Darino told defendant that people had placed him in the Brooklyn bar, and he wanted defendant\u2019s version of what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Defendant relayed that when he went up to the bar to buy a round of drinks, he got \u201clooks\u201d from someone who asked him \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He responded \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d Defendant said he then felt \u201cgrabbing and punching,\u201d and so took out a knife and \u201cstarted swinging it at the crowd,\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know that he actually hit anybody or hurt anyone.\u201d He then left the premises, \u201cjumped in his car\u201d and drove away. Detective Darino asked defendant if he would be willing to write out a statement, and defendant agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In his written statement, which was read to the jury, defendant similarly stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cWhile I was [at the Brooklyn bar] having a few drinks I had a small confrontation with a guy. It was just words, but as the night goes on, I\u2019m getting these eyes . . . contacted [sic] but nothing to it. Now, as I go to the bar to get my second round, the guy is still looking at me and I happen to look back at him. So he said \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 and I asked him what seems to be the problem. And right away the crowd rose. Then I felt punches and grabbing. So I take out a knife, used it in self defense, swinging it at the crowd not knowing that I really hurt anyone. I got out of there, got in my car and went home. I didn\u2019t know someone was hurt. It was self defense. I didn\u2019t mean it. I was just scared. I know by saying sorry is not going to bring that person back, but I really didn\u2019t mean this to go down this way. I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">On February 28th, defendant also gave a videotaped statement to the assistant district attorney, which was shown to the jury. When asked during the videotaped statement to demonstrate how he wielded the knife, defendant, who was sitting, moved his arm weakly at mid-chest level from right to left at a slight downward angle. Additionally, he told the assistant district attorney that he threw the knife away after he left the Brooklyn bar. Later that day, Navarette and Solomon separately identified defendant in a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">At trial, defendant\u2019s brother Julio testified that he had gone to the Brooklyn bar with defendant and two other friends, Little Julio and J.E Julio reported that he had heard men cursing, observed \u201chand gestures\u201d and \u201cpointing fingers\u201d and that he had gone towards them and \u201cjust got in the middle.\u201d Julio separated the two groups of men, but when one of them punched him, he hit back, and then \u201call the punches started going off.\u201d J.E grabbed Julio, \u201ctrying to get\u201d him out of the Brooklyn bar. Julio said that he would not leave without defendant, but then he saw that defendant and one of the bouncers were already almost out the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He recounted that after watching a boxing match and drinking beer with his brother Julio at the barbershop that he operated with another brother, he and Julio went to the Brooklyn bar to meet friends. Defendant denied bringing a knife with him. Defendant related that when he received a phone call, he stepped into the men\u2019s room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>so that he could hear his caller over the loud music. When Ojeda walked in and commented \u201cThis ain\u2019t no phone booth,\u201d defendant hung up and rejoined his friends. Upon leaving the men\u2019s room, Ojeda purposely \u201cbrushed into\u201d defendant, staring at him \u201ca little aggressive [ly]\u201d as he walked by. Defendant assumed Ojeda was drunk and \u201c[paid] it no mind,\u201d but he \u201clet Little Julio know.\u201d Defendant finished his drink and went to the bar to buy another round for himself and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">After purchasing the drinks, defendant looked around for one of his friends to help him carry them. Defendant saw Ojeda, who looked his way and \u201cbopped his head like \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 \u201d At this point, defendant thought \u201cthis kid, he[\u2019s] really got a problem,\u201d so he went over to Ojeda and asked \u201c[W]hat seems to be the problem?\u201d Ojeda replied, \u201c T ain\u2019t got no problem. You got a problem?[\u2019]\u201d Meanwhile, Little Julio joined defendant, who took out a business card for his barbershop, gave it to Ojeda and told him to come visit him sometime. As defendant was trying in this way to defuse the \u201chostility\u201d projected by Ojeda, Solomon approached and stood \u201creal close.\u201d Then defendant\u2019s brother Julio arrived. By this time, there was \u201ca little cursing going back and forth.\u201d Defendant was trying to get Little Julio to calm down, but then Solomon \u201ctook a swing\u201d at defendant and hit him. He reacted by throwing punches, hitting both Ojeda and Solomon. Defendant denied possessing or wielding a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">According to defendant, a bouncer then \u201cmanhandled\u201d him out the door onto the sidewalk. Finding the door locked behind him, defendant went to his car and turned on the ignition. Little Julio exited the Brooklyn bar and joined defendant, who did not want to leave without his brother Julio. When Little Julio got into the car, defendant noticed \u201cblotches\u201d of blood on the chest or shoulder of his jacket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant asked Little Julio where the blood came from, and Little Julio assured him that he was not bleeding. On cross-examination, defendant conceded that he had never before mentioned the presence of blood on Little Julio\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Defendant radioed his brother Julio on a walkie-talkie, and his brother eventually radioed back that he and J.E were on their way to a diner that was a neighborhood meeting place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>after a night of clubbing. Defendant then drove off with Little Julio and met up with Julio and J.E Defendant thought \u201cthe night was too young,\u201d but Julio and J.E told him they were going home. Defendant made a phone call to a female friend, and dropped off Little Julio near the apartment building where he lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Defendant claimed that he confessed, after he was brought to the precinct on February 28th, because Detective Darino threatened that if he did not, both he and his brother Julio would be charged with murder, and Julio would face life imprisonment. According to defendant, Detective Darino told him that the police knew that he was \u201ckicked out\u201d of the Brooklyn bar and Julio was left behind; that his brother was now at the precinct \u201cbeing charged with murder\u201d because he tried to protect defendant in the fight; and that if defendant \u201c[took] the weight\u201d for (i.e., confessed to) killing Ojeda in self-defense, Julio would be freed and defendant would only face 8 to 10 years in prison. Detective Darino testified that he never made any such threats or representations to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">During the charge conference, defendant requested that Supreme Court submit second-degree manslaughter (Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]) and criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law \u00a7 125.10) to the jury as lesser included offenses of the murder count. Defense counsel argued that \u201cif you\u2019re swinging a knife at a crowd[, i]t\u2019s like firing a weapon at a crowd. It\u2019s reckless,\u201d and therefore not intentional. The trial judge refused this request, noting that the medical examiner had testified that the stab wounds \u201ccould not have been inflicted by someone just swinging a knife around. They had to have been stabbed \u2014 stabbing wounds caused by intentional infliction. So there is no basis to submit a reckless count on the evidence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Supreme Court submitted the indicted charge of second-degree murder (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]) and first-degree manslaughter (Penal Law \u00a7 125.20 [1]) as a lesser included offense. The judge also charged the jury on intoxication as relevant to intent (Penal Law \u00a7 15.25).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury acquitted defendant of murder and found him guilty of first-degree manslaughter (Penal Law \u00a7 125.20 [1]). On June 8, 2009, Supreme Court adjudicated defendant a second violent felony offender and sentenced him to a determinate prison term of 25 years to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Defendant appealed, arguing that the court violated his due process right to a fair trial by refusing to submit second-degree manslaughter to the jury because a reasonable view of the evidence supported the conclusion that he killed Ojeda recklessly. On November 7, 2012, the Appellate Division affirmed, holding that there was, in fact, \u201cno reasonable view of the evidence that would support a finding that the defendant acted recklessly when he stabbed the victim\u201d (100 AD3d 658, 660 [2d Dept 2012]). On March 1, 2013, a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (20 NY3d 1103 [2013]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">A party who seeks to have a lesser included crime charged to the jury must satisfy a two-pronged inquiry. First, the crime must be a lesser included offense within the meaning of Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 1.20 (37).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, defendant asked the trial judge to charge second-degree manslaughter, which is a lesser included crime of second-degree intentional murder <em>(see People v Tai, </em>39 NY2d 894 [1976] [reckless manslaughter is a lesser included offense of intentional murder]). Second, the party making the request for a charge-down \u201cmust then show that there is a reasonable view of the evidence in the particular case that would support a finding that [the defendant] committed the lesser included offense but not the greater\u201d <em>(People v Glover, </em>57 NY2d 61, 63 [1982]; CPL 300.50 [1]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In assessing whether there is a \u201creasonable view of the evidence,\u201d the proof must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>looked at \u201cin the light most favorable to [the] defendant\u201d <em>(People v Martin, </em>59 NY2d 704, 705 [1983]), which requires awareness of \u201cthe jury\u2019s right to accept some part of the evidence presented by either side and reject other parts of that proof\u2019 <em>(People v Green, </em>56 NY2d 427, 434 [1982]). We have never, however, \u201c countenance [d] selective dissection of the integrated testimony of a single witness as to whom credibility, or incredibility, could only be a constant factor\u201d <em>(People v Scarborough, </em>49 NY2d 364, 373 [1980]; <em>see also People v Negron, </em>91 NY2d 788, 792 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">A \u201creasonable view of the evidence\u201d does not mean, as defendant insists, that a trial court must charge reckless manslaughter as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder unless the record \u201ccompletely excludes the possibility that the defendant acted recklessly.\u201d Rather, in <em>Scarborough </em>we rejected this notion that \u201cevery possible hypothesis but guilt of the higher crime must be excluded to eliminate submission of lesser included crimes\u201d <em>(Scarborough, </em>49 NY2d at 372 [internal quotation marks omitted]); or that \u201creasonable view\u201d means \u201cany view,\u201d with the consequence that \u201cthe spectrum of all theoretical lesser included offenses . . . would have to be charged on request in each case within each family of criminal transactions, e.g., controlled substances, larceny, theft, assault, homicide, sex offenses\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 373). Instead, we held in <em>Scarborough </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cif, on the whole record, there is not some identifiable, rational basis on which the jury could reject a portion of the prosecution\u2019s case which is indispensable to establishment of the higher crime and yet accept so much of the proof as would establish the lesser crime, then the lesser included offense may not be submitted\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 369-370).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASn\">Without such an identifiable basis, \u201c \u2018charging the lesser included offense would force the jury \u201cto resort to sheer specula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tion\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 371, quoting <em>People v Discala, </em>45 NY2d 38, 43 [1978]; <em>see also Negron, </em>91 NY2d at 792).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Here, the question is whether the trial judge should have charged second-degree manslaughter in addition to first-degree manslaughter. First- and second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder share the actus reus of causing the death of another person. The crimes differ in mens rea: second-degree intentional murder and first-degree or intentional manslaughter require intent to cause death and intent to cause serious physical injury, respectively, while second-degree or reckless manslaughter requires only a reckless state of mind.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the trial judge charged first-degree manslaughter after determining that a reasonable view of the evidence would support finding that defendant meant to cause serious bodily injury, but did not actually intend to kill Ojeda or anyone else. In contrast, to obtain a second-degree manslaughter instruction, defendant needed to show that a reasonable view of the evidence supported finding that he recklessly caused Ojeda\u2019s death <em>without </em>intending to cause serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Again asserting that a trial judge must submit second-degree manslaughter as a lesser included offense of intentional homicide \u201cunless the evidence entirely excludes the possibility that the defendant caused the death recklessly,\u201d defendant posits that \u201c[o]nly in a truly \u2018exceptional case\u2019 will the wounds themselves be so numerous or extreme that they can be relied on to rule out a reckless homicide.\u201d He cites <em>People v Butler </em>(84 NY2d 627 [1994]) as an example of such an \u201cexceptional case,\u201d noting that the victim there suffered three head contusions and 34 kitchen knife stab wounds, nine of which were lethal, while here, there were three stab wounds, only one of which was fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">First, as discussed earlier, defendant misstates the test for determining whether a trial judge must charge a lesser included offense. Second, the main issue in <em>Butler </em>was whether, since the trial judge gave an instruction on the possible effect of intoxication on the defendant\u2019s mental state, he was thereby required to instruct the jury on intentional and reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We held that the judge was not under any such obligation, and repeated then-Judge Fuld\u2019s warning that a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">\u201c \u2018should avoid doing anything, such as submitting lower crimes in an inappropriate case, that would constitute an invitation to the jury to foreswear its duty and return a compromise or otherwise unwarranted verdict. Or, to express the matter in somewhat different terms, the jury\u2019s power to dispense mercy, by favoring the defendant despite the evidence, should not be allowed so to dominate the trial proceedings as to impede or interfere with the jury\u2019s primary fact-finding function\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 632, quoting <em>People v Mussenden, </em>308 NY 558, 563 [1955]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The People took the position in <em>Butler </em>that the \u201cnature and brutality of the slaying,\u201d showed that the defendant could only have acted with an intent to kill, \u201cirrespective of the arguable intoxication palliative offered to the jury\u201d (Butler, 84 NY2d at 634). We agreed with the People that, in light of the facts in <em>Butler, </em>no instruction on either first- or second-degree manslaughter was \u201cwarranted or compelled\u201d because \u201c[t]he crime was intentional murder in the second degree or nothing, under the law and under the explicit instructions that were given\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Thus, <em>Butler </em>does not stand for the proposition, advocated by defendant, that reckless manslaughter <em>must </em>be charged unless a murder victim\u2019s wounds are \u201cnumerous or extreme.\u201d No minimum number of knife wounds is required to manifest intent <em>(see e.g. People v Lopez, </em>72 AD3d 593, 593 [1st Dept 2010] [court properly declined to submit reckless manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense where a \u201c(d)efendant\u2019s conduct in inflicting a very deep stab wound to the victim\u2019s vital organs could only be interpreted as evincing a deliberate design to cause the victim\u2019s death, or at least gravely injure him, and the crime was intentional or nothing\u201d] [citing Butler]; <em>People v Henderson, </em>110 AD3d 1353, 1354 [3d Dept 2013] [the defendant\u2019s request to charge the lesser included offense of second-degree manslaughter was properly denied where he \u201cadmitted that he intended to hurt the victim when he stabbed him and, based on the nature and force of the fatal stab wound, the only reasonable view of (his) conduct was that it was intentional\u201d] [citing <em>Butler]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Finally, defendant argues that testimony from his brother Julio, if credited by the jury, would substantiate that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>harbored no animus towards Ojeda, but rather \u201cacted recklessly in causing [Ojeda\u2019s] death during a chaotic barroom brawl[ ] . . . among numerous men all of [whom] had been drinking.\u201d And according to defendant, his pretrial statements, viewed in the light most favorable to him, show that he recklessly waved a knife around during the melee and did not even know that he had hurt anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">This record, however, does not reasonably support that defendant acted with mere recklessness. To credit defendant\u2019s pretrial statements about indiscriminately waving a knife, the jury would have to disregard the forensic pathologist\u2019s testimony that Ojeda\u2019s wounds could not have been inflicted in that way because they were stab wounds \u2014 the fatal one delivered forcefully enough to plunge five inches deep into his chest, piercing his left lung and cutting through a rib. The jury would have to discount the pathologist\u2019s uncontroverted description of the depth, angle and location of Ojeda\u2019s wounds, which were all delivered to the upper left chest area where vital organs (the heart, lungs) are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">There is simply not any \u201cidentifiable, rational basis on which the jury could reject\u201d the pathologist\u2019s testimony and the evidence of the nature and depth of Ojeda\u2019s wounds <em>(see Scarborough, </em>49 NY2d at 369). Three penetrating stab wounds to the same person, who \u2014 according to defendant \u2014 picked a fight with him, is strong evidence of intent to cause at least serious physical injury, and inconsistent with defendant\u2019s pretrial claims that he aimlessly swung a knife in a crowd of people when caught up in the turmoil and panic of a bar fight, oblivious to the possible consequences of his actions and unaware that he had struck anyone. In sum, on this record there exists \u201c[no] reasonable basis in the evidence for a finding of guilt of the lesser count and rejection of the greater count\u201d <em>(id.).</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\">. This was defendant\u2019s second trial; the first ended in a mistrial as a result of a hung jury <em>(see Matter of Rivera v Firetog, </em>11 NY3d 501 [2008] [dismissing defendant\u2019s CPLR article 78 petition to preclude a retrial for murder on double jeopardy grounds]). During the first trial, Supreme Court dismissed the weapon possession charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">.

Defendant also testified, though, that he did not observe the blood until the end of the evening, when he dropped Little Julio off near his residence. Defendant\u2019s attorney suggested at trial that Ojeda\u2019s blood might have gotten on defendant\u2019s green cap by virtue of contact with the bloody splotches that defendant professes to have observed on Little Julio\u2019s jacket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">.

A prima facie case of second-degree manslaughter entails \u201cthe creation of a substantial and unjustifiable risk; an awareness and disregard of the risk on the part of the defendant; and a resulting death\u201d <em>(People v Licitra, </em>47 NY2d 554, 558 [1979]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">. The dissent argues that \u201cit would be reasonable to conclude that defendant\u2019s intoxication rendered him unable to appreciate the risk of death he created by aggressively brandishing a knife in the middle of a barroom brawl,\u201d thus justifying a conviction for second-degree manslaughter (dissenting op at 127). On the dissent\u2019s theory of reckless manslaughter, though, the jury would have to speculate that defendant was too drunk to realize that he actually plunged the knife three times into Ojeda, as the undisputed forensic evidence showed, rather than merely waving it indiscriminately and defensively at a crowd, as he claimed in his pretrial statements. This goes well beyond viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant; rather, the dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>constructs a scenario more favorable to defendant than his pretrial statements, apparently on the assumption that he may have been so drunk during the fight that he was unable to accurately recall afterwards how it had unfolded. (As noted earlier, the trial judge charged the jury to consider intoxication as relevant to defendant\u2019s intent.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"AKr\">(dissenting). In my view, there exists a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a finding that defendant acted recklessly, but not intentionally, when he stabbed Edgar Ojeda, and defendant therefore was entitled to submission of the lesser included offense of second-degree manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Defendant\u2019s intent has always been the central issue in this case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s lengthy opinion boils down to the erroneous assessment that the forensic evidence is <em>conclusive </em>on that issue. It is true that the nature and severity of the victim\u2019s wounds present \u201cstrong evidence of intent to cause at least serious physical injury\u201d (majority op at 124). However, the question of whether a defendant was entitled to a charge-down \u201cis not directed at whether persuasive evidence of guilt of the greater crime exists\u201d <em>(People v Van Norstrand, </em>85 NY2d 131, 136 [1995]). Indeed, for our purposes, \u201cevaluation of the persuasiveness of the evidence of guilt of the greater crime is irrelevant\u201d <em>(People v Green, </em>56 NY2d 427, 434 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Instead, our inquiry focuses on whether \u201cthere is a reasonable view of the evidence in the particular case that would support a finding that the defendant committed the lesser included offense, but not the greater\u201d <em>(People v Heide, </em>84 NY2d 943, 944 [1994]; <em>see also </em>CPL 300.50). Critically, to determine whether such a reasonable view exists, we are required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant <em>(see e.g. People v Martin, </em>59 NY2d 704, 705 [1983]; <em>People v Henderson, </em>41 NY2d 233, 236 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Viewed in that light, I believe that, notwithstanding the medical evidence, a jury could reasonably find that defendant committed reckless, rather than intentional, homicide. The trial testimony established that Ojeda was stabbed during a late-night barroom brawl between two groups of intoxicated men. When several of the People\u2019s witnesses attempted to downplay the chaos of the scene, they were impeached with testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>from defendant\u2019s first trial, in which they said the stabbing occurred amidst <em>\u201ca </em>big ruckus,\u201d with \u201c[p]eople running back and forth,\u201d \u201cscreaming,\u201d and \u201cyelling.\u201d The testimony of defendant\u2019s brother Julio similarly depicted a melee in which \u201call the punches [were] going off\u2019 so that he was unable to discern the direction from which the blows were coming. Consistent with the depiction of drunken chaos and confusion, none of the four eyewitnesses who testified actually observed a knife in defendant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In addition, the People introduced defendant\u2019s pretrial statements, from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant, in a state of intoxication, wielded the knife in an attempt to repel his opponents, but that he lacked the intent to cause serious physical injury or death. In taking a contrary view, the majority fails to draw reasonable inferences in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">When questioned following his arrest, defendant explained that, moments after he approached Ojeda, the \u201ccrowd rose,\u201d and defendant \u201cfelt punches and grabbing\u201d and the crowd \u201cshifting\u201d around him. He described receiving a blow from an unknown source beside or behind him, reaching for his knife, and \u201cswinging] to get out of there.\u201d He also expressly denied acting intentionally. Instead he insisted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it\u201d and was \u201cswinging [the knife] at the crowd,\u201d \u201ctrying to get out of there.\u201d Defendant also explained that he had been intoxicated and could recall almost nothing about Ojeda\u2019s appearance. When asked if he swung the knife at the person standing in front of him (Ojeda), defendant replied, \u201cthere [were] a few of them standing in front of me.\u201d Additionally, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, it is far from clear that defendant\u2019s mild gesticulation in the video was intended to be a reenactment of his motions with the blade. To draw such an inference ignores our duty to view the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant. Viewing defendant\u2019s fleeting hand motion in the appropriate light, a jury could reasonably decline to attribute significance to this unremarkable gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Moreover, a factfinder would have reason to doubt the reliability of defendant\u2019s recollection given the evidence of his inebriation, which resulted in the issuance of an intoxication charge to the jury. The majority addresses this aspect of the case only to note that, in <em>People v Butler </em>(84 NY2d 627, 630 [1994]), we rejected a per se rule that an intoxication charge should automatically entitle a defendant to submission of reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>less manslaughter as a lesser included offense. What the majority fails to recognize is that <em>Butler </em>itself acknowledged that it was an \u201cexceptional case\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 631), and noted the \u201cgenerality\u201d that, \u201cin a great many cases in which an intoxication instruction may be warranted and is given, some corresponding lesser-included offense might be necessitated\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 630, 631). In Butler, the \u201cseverity of the numerous wounds,\u201d 34 in total, \u201cnine of which were individually fatal\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 634), warranted an exception. Such an exception is not warranted here. Rather than 34 stab wounds, nine of them lethal, there were three stab wounds, one of which was fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">As <em>Butler </em>recognizes, entitlement to an intoxication charge will frequently coincide with a reasonable view of the evidence that a defendant possessed a reckless state of mind. Here, it would be reasonable to conclude that defendant\u2019s intoxication rendered him unable to appreciate the risk of death he created by aggressively brandishing a knife in the middle of a barroom brawl. Under our law, such failure of perception due to voluntary intoxication falls within the definition of recklessness (Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [3] [\u201c(a) person who creates (a substantial and unjustifiable) risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In addition, while there may well be \u201c[n]o minimum number of knife wounds . . . required to manifest intent\u201d (majority op at 123), Ojeda\u2019s wounds bore no resemblance to those in cases where the forensic evidence was dispositive of intent <em>(see Butler, </em>84 NY2d at 629-630; <em>People v Vega, </em>68 AD3d 665, 665 [1st Dept 2009] [\u201c49 stab wounds, mostly to (the) victim\u2019s neck and chest,\u201d penetrating \u201cthe heart, lung, liver and spleen\u201d]; <em>People v Alexis, </em>65 AD3d 1160, 1160-1161 [2d Dept 2009] [victim\u2019s throat slashed 14 times; two wounds severed the jugular vein]; <em>People v Collins, </em>290 AD2d 457, 458 [2d Dept 2002] [six stab wounds; five fatal]). That Ojeda was stabbed twice in the back of his shoulder, as well as once in the front, reinforces the reasonableness of a finding that defendant swung the knife indiscriminately, albeit forcefully, while the crowd was \u201cshifting\u201d around him. The medical evidence does not, therefore, lead to an inexorable conclusion that \u201c[t]he crime was intentional ... or nothing\u201d <em>(Butler, </em>84 NY2d at 634).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, the cases cited by the majority, in which defendants were denied a charge-down based on the nature of wounds less numerous than those in <em>Butler, </em>are readily distinguishable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>their facts, or lack thereof <em>(see People v Henderson, </em>110 AD3d 1353 [3d Dept 2013], <em>and People v Lopez, </em>72 AD3d 593 [1st Dept 2010]). While the circumstances surrounding the stabbing in <em>Lopez </em>are not recounted in the opinion, the stabbing in <em>Henderson </em>clearly occurred during a one-on-one confrontation in an apartment <em>(Henderson, </em>110 AD3d at 1353), not a tumultuous altercation in the midst of a crowded bar. There was also proof in <em>Henderson </em>that the defendant confronted the victim, left to retrieve a knife, and committed the stabbing upon his return, having expressed a desire \u201cto even the odds\u201d <em>(Henderson, </em>110 AD3d at 1353). Such circumstances are simply inapposite to the facts here, especially since there is no indication that either <em>Lopez </em>or <em>Henderson </em>involved evidence of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In sum, the testimony regarding the chaotic bar fight, combined with defendant\u2019s post-arrest statements and the evidence of his intoxicated state, provided a reasonable basis to find defendant guilty of reckless manslaughter and to acquit on the intentional counts. Under these circumstances, it was reversible error to refuse defendant\u2019s request for a charge of manslaughter in the second degree. Accordingly, I would reverse the Appellate Division order and grant defendant a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-6\">Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur with Judge Read; Chief Judge Lippman dissents and votes to reverse in an opinion in which Judge Abdus-Salaam concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> At defendant\u2019s first trial, where the court did submit second-degree manslaughter as a lesser included offense, the jury struggled with the mens rea element and sought \u201cclarification of the terms \u2018bodily harm\u2019 and \u2018reckless action\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Rivera v Firetog, </em>11 NY3d 501, 504 [2008], <em>cert denied </em>556 US 1193 [2009]).
