II. The Court below did not order the appellant to \"issue an unrestricted license\u201d.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b500-5\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A licensing officer will issue a license to possess and carry a concealed firearm only when \"proper cause exists\u201d (see, Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 [2] [f]). Other than in New York City and Nassau and Suffolk Counties, where licenses are subject to renewal every three or five years, respectively, the procedure to amend a \"carry concealed license\u201d to add or delete weapons is by application to the licensing officer <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 [9], [10]). In furtherance of both the regulatory and public safety purposes of Penal Law \u00a7 400.00, we hold that a licensing officer is authorized to engage in a \"proper cause\u201d inquiry when presented with an application to amend a carry concealed license.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On March 31, 1987, Albany City Court granted petitioner\u2019s application for a carry concealed license, restricted to hunting and target practice. In 1989, petitioner applied to amend his license to cover two additional firearms and remove the hunting and target shooting restrictions. On June 29, 1989, petitioner\u2019s application was granted, without a proper cause inquiry, and he was issued an unrestricted carry concealed license for his two semiautomatic pistols and one revolver. In early 1990, petitioner again sought to amend his license to reflect the acquisition of another semiautomatic handgun. On February 1, 1990, the same licensing officer approved the amendment, again without conducting a proper cause inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The third time petitioner applied to amend his license he sought to substitute one revolver for another and add another semiautomatic handgun, and requested the issuance of a license that conformed with the recently redesigned license format. This application was reviewed by a different licensing officer, who concluded that petitioner failed to demonstrate proper cause to hold an unrestricted carry concealed license under Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 (2) (f). Thus, the licensing officer granted petitioner\u2019s application to amend his license to the extent of authorizing the addition of one weapon and deletion of one weapon \u2014 for a total of five firearms \u2014 and restricting the license to hunting and target shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Petitioner protested, and the licensing officer agreed to meet with him to consider his request for removal of the hunting and target shooting restrictions. According to the licensing officer, petitioner could not articulate any valid reason when he was asked why he needed to carry up to five concealed weapons at virtually any time. Indeed, petitioner informed the licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>officer that he wanted an unrestricted carry concealed license because \"[i]t just makes me feel better.\u201d The licensing officer adhered to the original determination that the proper cause shown by petitioner only supported a license restricted to hunting and target shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Petitioner challenged this determination in a CPLR article 78 proceeding, initiated in the Appellate Division pursuant to CPLR 506 (b) (1), to compel the licensing officer to remove the restrictions from petitioner\u2019s license on the ground that the licensing officer was not authorized to modify his valid unrestricted license. Petitioner argued that under Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 (10) his unrestricted license remains \"in force and effect until revoked\u201d and the licensing officer improperly revoked the license issued by the prior licensing officer. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, granted the petition to the extent of directing the removal of the hunting and target shooting restrictions and the issuance of an unrestricted license, ruling that an application to amend a license \"does not trigger the opportunity for another 'proper cause\u2019 determination\u201d (see, <em>Matter of O\u2019Brien v Keegan, </em>207 AD2d 5, 7-8). We disagree, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Eligibility for a license in the first instance or for renewal is contingent upon an investigation by the licensing officer, and a finding that all statements in the application are true (see, Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 [1]). Thus, as a threshold matter, the investigation of an applicant for a carry concealed license must yield \"proper cause\u201d to the licensing officer\u2019s satisfaction for a license to issue (see, Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 [2] [f]). At the other end of the spectrum, the licensing officer is statutorily invested with the power to <em>sua sponte </em>revoke or cancel a license (see, Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 [11] [other than in New York City and Nassau and Suffolk Counties, a Judge or Justice of a court of record acts as the licensing officer]). This extraordinary power reposed in a licensing officer in and of itself supports respondent\u2019s determination to restrict the scope of petitioner\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Additionally, we recently held that a licensing officer\u2019s power to determine the existence of \"proper cause\u201d for the issuance of a license necessarily and inherently includes the power to restrict the use of a license to the purposes that justified its issuance <em>(see, Matter of O\u2019Connor v Scarpino, </em>83 NY2d 919, 921). \"Without such a power to condition, the licensing officer\u2019s authority to allow possession of a handgun only for proper cause would be rendered meaningless and the obvious regulatory purpose of the statute would be frustrated\u201d <em>(id..). </em>This ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>plies with equal force to the licensing officer\u2019s powers upon review of an application to amend a license. To find otherwise would nullify the purpose underlying a formal amendment procedure and conflict with the dual aims of Penal Law \u00a7 400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, it was not unreasonable for respondent to restrict petitioner\u2019s license. While petitioner does not dispute that respondent was justified in inquiring about \"changed circumstances,\u201d petitioner insists that Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 (9) does not permit respondent to alter his license upon an application to amend, absent some \"cause\u201d related to his fitness to hold a firearm. Petitioner reads the statute too narrowly. Petitioner\u2019s inability to demonstrate a need \u2014 or much less, any reason \u2014 for an unrestricted license, which would permit him to carry several concealed firearms, supports the licensing officer\u2019s finding that there was no \"proper cause\u201d to justify an unrestricted carry concealed license. Consequently, the licensing officer\u2019s restriction of petitioner\u2019s license was neither arbitrary nor capricious, promoting both the regulatory and public safety aims of Penal Law \u00a7 400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith and Levine concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
