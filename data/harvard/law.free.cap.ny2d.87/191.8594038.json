This appeal requires us to consider the appealability and reviewability of compensation orders issued pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The dispute arises out of services that were rendered by respondent Hillel Bodek, a certified social worker, in connection with several criminal cases that were pending before the Supreme Court in New York County. In each instance, Bodek had been appointed by the court to provide professional services to indigent defendants and the court directed that the City of New York pay him at a rate of $100 an hour for those services. In seven of the eight cases, the court also found \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying significant departures from the statutory norm of $300 per case <em>(see, </em>County Law \u00a7 722-c).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The Director of the Assigned Counsel Plan for New York City asked the two Supreme Court Justices who had issued the compensation orders to reconsider them, particularly in light of contemporary budget constraints and the $45 maximum hourly rate for social workers prescribed by the Chief Administrator of the Courts <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 127.2 [b]). Her requests for relief, which were made through informal letters and a formal motion <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 127.2 [b]), were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Following the denial of all of her fee reduction requests, the Director attempted to appeal from the Supreme Court\u2019s various \"orders.\u201d The Appellate Division consolidated the appeals and affirmed. Conceding that the challenged orders might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>technically be appealable by the Director, an aggrieved nonparty, the Court nevertheless declined to consider the appeals\u2019 merits, holding that the orders were not reviewable under <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta (supra). </em>This Court subsequently granted the Director leave to take a further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Initially, we note that, with respect to the appealability question, there is no meaningful distinction between the County Law '\u00a7\u00a7 722 and 722-b assigned-counsel compensation order sought to be appealed in <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta (supra) </em>and the County Law \u00a7 722-c assigned-expert compensation orders sought to be appealed here. Nonetheless, the rationale in <em>Werfel </em>does not pose an impenetrable barrier to appealing these challenged orders, since the analyses in more recent cases such as <em>Matter of Abrams (John Anonymous) </em>(62 NY2d 183), <em>Matter of Hynes v Karassik </em>(47 NY2d 659) and <em>Matter of Cunningham v Nadjari </em>(39 NY2d 314) are fatal to the continuing validity of that rationale in the present context <em>(cf., Matter of Santangello v People, </em>38 NY2d 536; <em>Matter of Alphonso C., </em>38 NY2d 923).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Despite the technical appealability of the challenged orders, however, the Appellate Division did not err in refusing to entertain the merits of the Director\u2019s challenge. As is indicated in the final paragraphs of <em>Werfel (supra, </em>at 627), trial court orders granting or denying increases in the statutorily recommended fees under County Law \u00a7\u00a7 722, 722-b and 722-c \"provide no basis for justiciable review.\u201d Such orders are essentially administrative in nature and, accordingly, are not amenable to judicial review on the merits by an appellate panel <em>(cf., Matter of Harvey v County of Rensselaer, </em>83 NY2d 917 [addressing court\u2019s <em>power </em>under County Law \u00a7 701 to award compensation for services performed by Special Prosecutor\u2019s associates]).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Although the point is not dispositive, we note that formal appellate review of these compensation orders is impractical, since the appeals courts are several steps removed from the circumstances in which the services were rendered and are therefore not well positioned to assess the wisdom of the Trial Judges\u2019 discretionary choices. To the extent that the trial courts\u2019 unreviewable discretion produces truly anomalous consequences or patterns of abuse in particular situations, the problem can and should be addressed through the available administrative tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b256-9\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW2\">(concurring). Judge Smith and I also vote to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>affirm, but only under the constraint of <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta </em>(36 NY2d 624) on the nonjusticiable reviewability point and for these separately stated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The genesis of this exceptional compensation controversy is a long-standing practice of some Supreme Court Justices in Manhattan using a social services expert to provide the court with help in connection with a series of criminal cases. No one questions the right and need for the Judges to receive this assistance or the entitlement of experts to be properly compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In the assembly of the cases now before us, the certified social worker was appointed, and after completion of the services, he submitted separate applications for court-ordered compensation. In seven of the eight cases, the courts found that the \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d statutory standard warranted compensation greatly in excess of the $300 prescribed maximum per case <em>(see, </em>County Law \u00a7 722-c). The courts also ordered the City of New York to pay at a rate of $100 an hour for services rendered in each of the separate criminal proceedings, a factor itself more than double the rate reflected in the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s rule (22 NYCRR 127.2 [b]). The City of New York was never a party to the payment proceedings and was never afforded any opportunity to contest the fee requests or ordered payments. In total, the social worker was awarded in excess of $28,300 for just these cases \u2014 10 times greater than the statutory and rule maxima that would have totalled only $2,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant, the Director of the Assigned Counsel Plan for New York City, became obligated, pursuant to the judicial orders, to pay the fees out of budgeted New York City appropriations. She sought at the earliest opportunity an initial review from the Justices who in the first instance ordered the payments. She requested that the courts at least adhere to the $45 per hour maximum rate for social workers prescribed by the Chief Administrative Judge (22 NYCRR 127.2 [b]). In each case, the trial courts granted reconsideration but adhered to their original orders. The Director\u2019s further attempt at review, pursuant to the Rules of the Chief Administrator (22 NYCRR 127.2 [b]), was rejected by the Justices on the ground that they were the sole, unreviewable adjudicators of these compensation matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Director then appealed four separate orders of Supreme Court that respectively denied seven applications of review or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>reconsideration of ordered payment vouchers for expert services. The Appellate Division consolidated the appeals and affirmed (207 AD2d 307). That Court treated the orders as appealable by affirming, but then ruled that they were \"nevertheless not reviewable\u201d under <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta </em>(36 NY2d 624, <em>supra) (id., </em>at 308). This Court granted leave to appeal and we agree unanimously under recent precedential developments that <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta (supra) </em>is not a bar to appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Matter of Hynes v Karassik </em>(47 NY2d 659), <em>Matter of Abrams (John Anonymous) </em>(62 NY2d 183) and <em>Matter of Codey (Capital Cities, Am. Broadcasting Corp.) </em>(82 NY2d 521) justify our treating, these compensation orders made pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722-c as civil, rather than criminal in nature. They in no way affect the criminal proceeding or judgment itself and are entirely collateral to and discrete from the criminal proceeding <em>(see, Matter of Hynes v Karassik, </em>47 NY2d 659, 661, n 1, <em>supra). </em>The express authorization for ordering the compensation at issue is also located in a <em>civil </em>compilation of statutes, County Law \u00a7 722-c. Thus, the appealability threshold issue is different from <em>Werfel (see also, Matter of Harvey v County of Rensselaer, </em>83 NY2d 917; <em>Yalango v Popp, </em>84 NY2d 601).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The other half of the <em>Werfel </em>equation \u2014 justiciable review-ability even under the peculiar and narrow circumstances of this intractable controversy \u2014 continues, however, to confound and block desirable and realistic solution. It is for that reason that we must join in the affirmance result.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">County Law \u00a7 722-c provides that a court may authorize expert services in connection with the prosecution of an action against an indigent defendant. The statute provides that \"[t]he court shall determine reasonable compensation for the services and direct payment to the person who rendered them or to the person entitled to reimbursement. Only in <em>extraordinary circumstances </em>may a court provide for compensation <em>in excess of three hundred dollars'\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In <em>Matter of Werfel v Agresta </em>(36 NY2d 624, <em>supra), </em>this Court, <em>inter alla, </em>addressed the reviewability aspect of an assigned counsel compensation order made pursuant to County Law \u00a7 722-b, a statute similar, but not identical, to County Law \u00a7 722-c. This Court was divided, but held that the Appellate Division lacked power to review the lawyer\u2019s request to increase the allowance made pursuant to County Law \u00a7\u00a7722 and 722-b. The Court held further that the assigned attorney had no right to relief under CPLR article 78 and stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>fixing compensation for assigned counsel \"might\u201d be characterized as \"administrative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">While the civil proceeding and appeal are undeniably properly before this Court and some different procedural and juridical features from <em>Werfel </em>are present, we can discern no principled legal, route to overcome its binding precedential effect on the justiciability and reviewability issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Distinctive features include that the Director and the municipal payor in this case were never parties in these matters originally, as attorney Werfel was in his case; nor did the appellant or City have any opportunity to contest, participate in or challenge the payment proceedings. They reasonably relied from the outset on statutory and formal administrative rule caps, limits and standards, and assigned counsel Werfel took his assignment with binding knowledge of the limitations of his statutory service. Arguably, the proceeding to challenge the excessive fees here is not essentially \"administrative,\u201d as in <em>Werfel, </em>because a statute and a regulation with prescribed standards and limits appear to have been facially and egregiously overridden in this case. Yet, with all that said, the equal application and general rationale of the justiciabilityreviewability bar erected in <em>Werfel </em>compel adherence on stare decisis grounds alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We would like to emphasize, however, that the lack of any judicial review or appropriate check-and-balance of unilateral trial court action in these public services and public fiscal matters is unfortunate. As this case demonstrates, substantial fiscal consequences to a municipality are in play, as well as serious inter- and intra-branch tensions and contests relating to completely unchecked power of the purse and compensation authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">It seems entirely fitting, proper and appropriate that some specific regulatory and review power with respect to \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d public services payments situations be explicitly invested in the Appellate Division or the Chief Administrative Judge or both (see, <em>e.g., People v Perry, </em>27 AD2d 154, 163; <em>Yalango v Popp, </em>84 NY2d 601, 607-608, <em>supra). </em>As this case demonstrates, unless the legislative and the judicial branches exercise their available and appropriate regulatory powers (see, <em>e.g., </em>NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 28; Judiciary Law \u00a7 212) to promulgate effective mechanisms for some review of such matters, a provider may be unilaterally rewarded far in excess of extant statutory or rule authorizations and limitations. This imprudent potentiality, no less the actuality, reflected so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>dramatically by the intractable situation underlying this controversy, should be remedied for the sake of sound procedure and the protection of the public purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Judges Simons, Titone and Levine concur in Per Curiam opinion; Judge Bellacosa concurs in result in a separate opinion in which Judge Smith concurs; Chief Judge Kaye and Judge Ciparick taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
