Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with driving while intoxicated as a felony and was sentenced by County Court to a five-year term of probation, to include six months of incarceration in county jail and one year of electronic monitoring. County Court also ordered defendant to attend a victim impact panel and pay a fine and administrative fees in the amount of $1,155. At sentencing, defendant voiced an objection to the electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s sentence, rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that the condition of electronic monitoring was beyond County Court\u2019s power to impose <em>(People v McNair, </em>212 AD2d 550). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Analysis of the issue on appeal \u2014 whether electronic monitoring is a statutorily authorized condition of probation \u2014 begins and ends with <em>People v Letterlough </em>(86 NY2d 259, <em>supra). </em>In <em>Letterlough, </em>this Court invalidated the scarlet-letter condition of probation that required an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated to affix a fluorescent sign to the license plate of his car bearing the words, \"convicted dwi.\u201d The Court cited two separate reasons for striking down the probationary condition as exceeding the sentencing court\u2019s authority under Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l). </em>First, the condition of probation was not fundamentally rehabilitative, but was predominantly punitive and deterrent. Second, the condition could not be imposed absent specific legislative authorization because of the difficult policy choices involved and the need for uniform State-wide standards. For these very reasons, the probationary condition of electronic monitoring at issue in this case similarly exceeds the court\u2019s authority under the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l) </em>permits a sentencing court to fashion probationary conditions \"reasonably related to * * * rehabilitation.\u201d In <em>Letterlough, </em>we rejected an expansive reading of section 65.10 (2) <em>(l) </em>and held that given the probation statute\u2019s \"singular focus\u201d on rehabilitation, the catch-all provision only permits probationary conditions that are \"fundamentally 'rehabilitative\u2019 in the sense of that word that distinguishes it from the societal goals of punishment or deterrence\u201d (86 NY2d, at 265, <em>supra). </em>If the condition of probation is not \"fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>tally rehabilitative,\u201d we held, it is invalid notwithstanding any incidental rehabilitative effects.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">A condition of electronic monitoring requires the defendant to wear an electronic device that transmits a signal to a central computer alerting the Probation Department when the defendant travels beyond a certain distance in violation of sentence restrictions. In an effort to demonstrate the rehabilitative purpose of the electronic monitoring in this case, the People rely on the sentencing court\u2019s statement that electronic monitoring is necessary to provide the court \"reasonable assurance that you\u2019re going to comply with treatment, that you\u2019re going to recognize that you can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d However, a reading of the entire relevant passage from the record reveals that the sentencing court was motivated by something other than rehabilitation. In response to defendant\u2019s objection to the condition of electronic monitoring, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">\"[Y]ou have to earn society\u2019s trust not to drive a car and get drunk. And I looked at your record and you have three DWI\u2019s in your past. And so I have to assure myself that the world is safe from your driving. The only way I could do that is to either send you to state prison or to enter an arrangement like this where I have some reasonable assurance that you\u2019re going to comply with treatment, that you\u2019re going to recognize that you can\u2019t do this anymore. And between the time you get out of jail and the time they let you off the electronic monitor, if you are compliant with the terms of probation, then you will have earned that trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">This case is thus remarkably similar to <em>Letterlough </em>in that the sentencing court\u2019s \"true design was not to advance defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, but rather to 'warn the public\u2019 of,\u201d or in this case protect the public from, \"the threat presented by [defendant\u2019s] presence behind the wheel\u201d (86 NY2d, at 266, <em>supra). </em>Because the sentencing court\u2019s true aims in this case were public safety and surveillance, not rehabilitation, <em>Letter-lough </em>requires that the condition of electronic monitoring be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>As the sentencing court itself stated, the electronic monitoring was imposed primarily to \"assure [the court] that the world is safe from [defendant\u2019s] driving.\u201d This is plainly a public safety aim. According to <em>Letterlough, </em>questions of public safety, such as the \"degree of threat this defendant posed to society,\u201d may not be considered in determining whether a condition of probation is proper under the catch-all provision (86 NY2d, at 265, <em>supra). </em>The promotion of public safety, while commendable, is not a \"fundamentally rehabilitative\u201d purpose and will not validate a condition of probation under Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l) (see, Letterlough, </em>86 NY2d, at 269, <em>supra </em>[\"the reference in the probation statute\u2019s catch-all provision to the lone goal of rehabilitation renders County Court\u2019s stated public safety motivation for imposing the special condition improper\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In tandem with the public safety aim of the electronic monitoring, the sentencing court also imposed this condition of probation to keep defendant under the Probation Department\u2019s surveillance. However, the use of electronic monitoring as a surveillance device serves the goal of specific deterrence by incapacitating defendant from drinking and driving, not the distinct goal of rehabilitation <em>(cf., </em>Kagehiro, <em>Psycholegal Issues of Home Confinement, </em>37 St Louis U LJ 647 [1993] [\"a home confinee convicted of DUI may be prevented from driving while drunk, but home confinement does not prevent drinking\u201d]). If surveillance has any rehabilitative effect, it is only in the purely incidental sense of restricting defendant\u2019s mobility and thereby reducing his opportunity for illicit behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Finally, the use of electronic monitoring raises a host of policy issues \u2014 penological, ethical, technological, and fiscal\u2014 that are the province of the Legislature, not the Judiciary <em>(see, People v Letterlough, </em>86 NY2d 259, 267, <em>supra). </em>While the People attempt to downplay the need for legislative involvement by citing defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate any abuses associated with the particular probationary program in this case, a ruling upholding electronic monitoring would inevitably lead to the uneven and intrusive application of the electronic monitoring technology as courts around the State experiment with this unregulated sentencing tool. Under the circumstances, a sentencing alternative such as electronic monitoring requires legislative enactment of uniform standards to regulate its use <em>(cf., Letterlough, </em>86 NY2d, at 267, <em>supra; see generally, </em>Burns, <em>Electronic Home Detention: New Sentencing Alternative Demands Uniform Standards, </em>18 J Contemp L 75 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>In light of this analysis, we do not reach defendant\u2019s arguments that the sentencing court improperly delegated sentencing power to the Probation Department or that the condition of electronic monitoring constituted an extension of imprisonment in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 60.01 (2) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the plea vacated and the case remitted for further proceedings on the superior court information.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\"> The converse of this rule, as we recognized in <em>Letterlough, </em>is that a condition of probation that is fundamentally rehabilitative will be upheld notwithstanding incidental punitive or deterrent effects (86 NY2d, at 264-265, <em>supra). </em>Thus, the dissent\u2019s concern that our holding limits permissible conditions of probation to those that are \"exclusively \u2014 not merely primarily \u2014 rehabilitative\u201d is unfounded (dissenting opn, at 780).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b839-6\">Chief Judge Kaye</author>\n<p id=\"Ablq\">(dissenting). Convicted for the third time of the felony of driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192), defendant \u2014 an admitted alcoholic \u2014 received a sentence of five years\u2019 probation, the first six months of which were to be served in jail, followed by a one-year period of electronic home monitoring. Because we conclude that the electronic monitoring imposed was well within the sentencing court\u2019s statutory discretion under Penal Law \u00a7 65.10, we respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (1) states as a general proposition that conditions of probation \"shall be such as the court, in its discretion, deems reasonably necessary to insure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him to do so\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [1]). Implicit in this language are two important principles. First, as we recently observed in <em>People v Letter-lough </em>(86 NY2d 259), a condition of probation must be primarily rehabilitative in nature \u2014 intended to assist a defendant in resisting the temptation to commit a crime once again. The second important principle, also derived directly from the language of the statute, is that the decision as to which combination of conditions to impose on a particular defendant is a matter of the sentencing court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In accordance with these explicit statutory principles, Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) lists a dozen or so different types of conduct which a court may order a defendant to perform or to refrain from doing as a condition of its sentence of probation. These include refraining from frequenting disreputable places, finding suitable employment, participating in an alcohol or substance abuse program, supporting dependents and making restitution (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [2] [b], [c], [e], [f], [g]). Recognizing, however, that none of these conditions \u2014 alone or in combination \u2014 is likely to do much good if ignored or evaded, the statute goes on to prescribe a variety of supervisory mechanisms that can be imposed in addition to the other conditions in an effort to insure compliance \u2014 for example, by having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>a defendant report regularly to a probation officer or remain within the jurisdiction (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [3] [a], [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">That the above measures were not intended to be exclusive, but merely illustrative, is made pellucidly clear by Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l), </em>which permits courts to impose \"any <em>other conditions reasonably related to </em>* * * rehabilitation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Plainly, the purpose of this broad catch-all provision is to provide sentencing Judges with flexibility to fashion additional conditions \u2014 not expressly listed in the statute \u2014 based on the particular rehabilitative needs and circumstances of the defendants before them. \"In sentencing a defendant to probation, the court has open-ended authority under Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l) </em>to impose conditions which are 'reasonably related to [defendant\u2019s] rehabilitation\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Howland, </em>145 AD2d 866, 867). By reversing the order of the Appellate Division, the majority has, for all practical purposes, eliminated this flexibility and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Believing itself constrained by our recent decision in <em>People v Letterlough </em>(86 NY2d 259), the majority concludes that the one-year electronic monitoring program imposed here exceeded the bounds of the court\u2019s discretion under Penal Law 65.10 (2) <em>(l). </em>As the majority asserts: \"Analysis of the issue * * * whether electronic monitoring is a statutorily authorized condition of probation * * * begins and ends with <em>People v Letter-lough\u201d </em>(majority opn, at 774). This simply is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\"><em>Letterlough, </em>decided only last year, deals with the different and far more draconian sanction of requiring a defendant to attach to the license plate of his car a large sign with fluorescent lettering reading \"convicted dwi.\u201d In vacating defendant\u2019s plea in that case, we noted that the court\u2019s \"true design\u201d in imposing the \"convicted dwi\" sign as a condition of probation was not to rehabilitate defendant, but instead to punish and humiliate him by publicly disclosing the fact of his crime (86 NY2d at 266). Given this motive and noting that the \"convicted dwi\u201d sign \"is out of step with the various other devices specifically authorized [in the statute],\u201d we concluded that the \"punitive and deterrent nature of the disputed 'scarlet letter\u2019 component of the ['convicted dwi\u2019 sign] overshadows any possible rehabilitative potential\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The general rule to be drawn from <em>Letterlough </em>is that a court may not create its own probationary condition which is predominantly punitive in the sense that its punitive elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>overshadow its rehabilitative components. Conditions that are not primarily punitive in nature, however, are still authorized by the language of Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (2) <em>(l) </em>and <em>Letterlough </em>does not diminish their availability or lawfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">It is beyond question that no such predominantly punitive condition is present here. The electronic monitoring device at issue was part of an integrated rehabilitative plan requiring defendant to abstain from purchasing or drinking alcohol, attend an accredited alcohol treatment program and avoid places associated with alcohol consumption such as a bar, tavern or liquor store. Utilized in conjunction with these conditions, the electronic monitoring was designed to allow defendant to remain in the privacy of his own home with his family \u2014 instead of in prison \u2014 while learning to control himself in the presence of alcohol <em>(see, e.g., </em>Burns, <em>Electronic Home Detention: New Sentencing Alternative Demands Uniform Standards, </em>18 J Con-temp L 75, 89-90 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In sharp contrast to the fluorescent license plate sign, the only physical manifestation of the electronic monitoring is a small bracelet around defendant\u2019s ankle or wrist which sends an electronic signal notifying the Probation Department when he leaves his home without authorization <em>(see, People v Ryan, </em>134 Misc 2d 343, 344-345 [describing Nassau County Electronic Home Detention Program]). By ordering defendant to wear such a device, the trial court clearly did not intend to humiliate him publicly. Nor is the electronic monitoring likely to \"negate any positive effect derived from the imposition of [the] other therapeutic conditions\u201d imposed to treat his addiction <em>(Letterlough, </em>86 NY2d at 266). In fact, while noting that it would otherwise have imposed a prison sentence of up to four years in light of defendant\u2019s recidivism, the court explained at defendant\u2019s sentencing that only through electronic monitoring could it \"have some reasonable assurance that you\u2019re going to comply with treatment, that you\u2019re going to recognize that you can\u2019t do this any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Moreover, unlike the \"convicted dwi\u201d sign at issue in <em>Letterlough, </em>the electronic monitoring device used here is not different in kind from the remaining devices listed in Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 <em>(see, Letterlough, </em>86 NY2d at 266). Like several of the conditions already authorized, such as reporting to a probation officer (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [3] [a]), not leaving the jurisdiction <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [3] [b]) and posting a bond (Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 [2] [j]), electronic monitoring simply insures that defendant complies with the other specified conditions by keeping the Probation Department informed about his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Even more troubling, however, is the majority\u2019s expansive reading of <em>Letterlough </em>beyond its legal and factual particulars. Ignoring that <em>Letterlough </em>actually involved a highly unusual, \"scarlet letter\u201d-type probationary condition, the majority reasons that the only conditions that are acceptable under <em>Letterlough </em>are those that are exclusively \u2014 not merely primarily \u2014 rehabilitative. But as this Court in <em>Letterlough </em>readily conceded, many if not most of the probationary sentences already authorized by Penal Law \u00a7 65.10, such as requiring a probationer to make restitution or refrain from frequenting disreputable places, though unquestionably rehabilitative, have some \"punitive and deterrent effects\u201d as well (86 NY2d at 264-265). Thus, <em>Letterlough </em>cannot fairly be read to stand for the proposition that a probationary condition not mentioned in Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 is prohibited simply by virtue of the fact that it also serves as a punishment or specific deterrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">As noted above, Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 (1) begins with the direction that the conditions of probation \"shall be such as the court, in its discretion, deems reasonably necessary to insure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him to do so.\u201d This language reflects the Legislature\u2019s commonsense understanding that without the aid of additional conditions to insure compliance with the court\u2019s order, attempts at rehabilitation are likely to be for naught. Boiled down to its essential features, a fluorescent license plate sign reading \"convicted dwi\" is by no means \"remarkably similar\u201d (majority opn, at 775) to an unobtrusive electronic bracelet worn under defendant\u2019s clothing mainly in his own home, which was intended to assist defendant in his efforts at rehabilitation. By concluding that <em>Letterlough </em>prohibited the trial court\u2019s imposition of electronic monitoring in this case, the majority has effectively written the broad catch-all provision out of the statute. The argument that electronic monitoring could not be imposed without comprehensive legislative authorization <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 776) belies not only what appears to be common practice throughout this State <em>(see, People v Johnson, </em>187 AD2d 532; <em>People v Ryan, supra), </em>but also the language of Penal Law \u00a7 65.10 itself. The unfortunate consequence will be to deprive Judges of the discretion to fashion sentencing alternatives other than those explicitly mentioned in the statute \u2014 a discretion which the Legislature clearly intended sentencing courts to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Judges Simons, Titone and Smith concur with Judge Ciparick; Chief Judge Kaye dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judges Bellacosa and Levine concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Order reversed, defendant\u2019s plea vacated and case remitted to County Court, Dutchess County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
