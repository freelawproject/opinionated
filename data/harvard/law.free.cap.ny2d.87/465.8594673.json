Duke bequeathed a large portion of her estate to charity. Bernard Lafferty, described as her assistant and confidant, was named in Duke\u2019s will as the lone individual coexecutor of her estate. Exercising discretionary authority granted solely to him in the will, Lafferty selected United States Trust as the corporate coexecutor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The dispute before this Court concerns the propriety of the Surrogate\u2019s summary removal of both coexecutors for misconduct pursuant to SCPA 719. While section 719 grants a Surrogate the authority to summarily remove fiduciaries, we conclude that the Surrogate abused her discretion by removing these executors without affording them a hearing under the unique circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">On November 1, 1993, United States Trust and Lafferty filed a petition for probate of Doris Duke\u2019s will and were issued preliminary letters testamentary <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1412). In January 1995, after United States Trust and Lafferty applied for leave to distribute certain bequests, counsel for several interested parties moved for the coexecutors\u2019 removal, submitting an affirmation containing sensational allegations of misconduct, including charges of kidnapping, murder, waste, commingling of estate assets and substance abuse by Lafferty. Because of the magnitude of the estate and the seriousness of the allegations, the Surrogate requested suggestions from counsel for \"an accelerated procedure for preliminary inquiry into the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>sue[s].\u201d In response, the coexecutors denied the allegations and suggested that a Referee be appointed to determine whether there was any reason to take further action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On January 20, 1995, the Surrogate rejected the suggestion to appoint a Referee, noting \"the inevitable delays, squabbles over evidence and witnesses, and time and resources which would be consumed by a formal hearing.\u201d She also declined to authorize Dr. Demopolous, a named executor under a codicil to a prior will, to investigate the preliminary coexecutors\u2019 conduct, citing the potential for bias. Instead, referring to SCPA 702 (8), (9) and (10), the Surrogate issued limited letters of temporary administration to Richard Kuh, an attorney in private practice, authorizing him to \"examine the allegations of misconduct, examine the affairs of the estate, conduct interviews to the extent deemed necessary, <em>and report to the Court </em>within 45 * * * days <em>as to the need, if any, for further ac</em>tion\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In issuing this order, the Surrogate indicated that Kuh\u2019s investigation was to be \"informal and expeditious,\u201d but otherwise gave Kuh broad discretion in the procedures he would employ to gather information. The Surrogate also advised the parties that Kuh \"is not going to be a fact-finder\u201d and noted that concerns about the Kuh report should be raised, \"if they exist, during the period you have to respond to [it].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Kuh\u2019s report and its supplement, which were filed with the Surrogate, are based on interviews with over 50 persons. However, because the report did not contain sworn statements and the identities of the witnesses contacted were largely undisclosed, counsel for the coexecutors objected to its use on due process grounds, arguing that they were unable to test its veracity. The coexecutors additionally submitted substantive written responses, which included affidavits from Lafferty and three senior officers of United States Trust, as well as from 30 estate employees, friends, physicians and advisors of Doris Duke, that raised factual disputes about the information contained in the Kuh report.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">On May 22, 1995, after reviewing the submissions, the Surrogate made an order summarily removing Lafferty and United States Trust. In her opinion, the Surrogate divided the Kuh report\u2019s disclosures into two classes: those that are undisputed and those \"that rely upon factual allegations that are disputed.\u201d As to Lafferty, the Surrogate concluded that undisputed facts established four grounds for removal as a fiduciary: (1) commingling of estate and personal assets, based on his use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>estate residences and credit cards; (2) waste of estate assets, shown by his unauthorized use and destruction of Duke\u2019s Cadillac; (3) improvidence and want of understanding, shown by Lafferty\u2019s lavish personal spending habits and limited literacy; and (4) substance abuse. As to United States Trust, the Surrogate concluded that it had been guilty of misconduct in failing to \"rein in\u201d Lafferty\u2019s misconduct. Further, according to the Surrogate, United States Trust created a conflict of interest by giving Lafferty an unsecured loan of approximately $825,000, and had also engaged in its own acts of waste by retaining the services of nonresident alien employees and thereby incurring interest and penalties to be charged to the estate. The Surrogate concluded that \"the full panoply of undisputed actions demonstrates such a serious lack of understanding of appropriate fiduciary responsibility that immediate removal of both fiduciaries is warranted as a matter of law.\u201d The Surrogate replaced Lafferty and United States Trust with Alexander D. Forger, an attorney, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company as the temporary individual and corporate co-executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A divided Appellate Division affirmed. Although the majority rejected the Surrogate\u2019s characterization of the facts on which she relied as \"undisputed,\u201d it concluded that summary removal was proper because \"the unfitness of the coexecutors was established by a combination of documentary proof and the coexecutors\u2019 own concessions,\u201d and that no triable issue of fact was raised by the totality of the submissions. (220 AD2d, at 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Finding merit in the position taken by the coexecutors and the Attorney-General, who represents the charitable beneficiaries of Duke\u2019s will, the two-Justice dissent concluded that removal of the designated executors without an evidentiary hearing was an extraordinary and unwarranted measure since \"it has yet to be established that the estate has sustained any loss, much less been placed in jeopardy.\u201d (220 AD2d, at 244.) The dissenters initially noted that because no hearing had been held, there was no factual record for appellate review and no \"proof of serious misconduct, which the law requires to justify supplanting the decedent\u2019s choice of executors.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 242.) The dissent also concluded that the language in the SCPA authorizing a Surrogate to revoke letters issued to a fiduciary \"without a petition or the issuance of process\u201d means \"only that no formal notice is required to bring on a hearing for removal * * * [and] does not mean that the dismissal of an execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tor by the Surrogate may rest on less than compelling grounds * * * [or] that such action may be based on a record that is less than adequate to permit appellate review.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">That two-Justice dissent on a question of law serves as the predicate for this Court\u2019s jurisdiction of the coexecutors\u2019 appeal. We share the dissenters\u2019 concern over the state of the record and the Surrogate\u2019s summary disposition of this fact-laden controversy \u2014 a view strongly echoed in the Attorney-General\u2019s submissions to this Court. Accordingly, we now reverse and remit to the Surrogate for limited further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We begin our analysis with SCPA 719, which provides that a Surrogate \"may\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> suspend, modify, or revoke letters testamentary <em>without service of </em>process<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the fiduciary, in certain enumerated circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents contend that if a fiduciary may be removed without notice under that provision, it follows that a hearing is not required before the statute\u2019s authority may be invoked. While the Surrogate is clearly granted the exceptional authority to summarily remove executors without the formality of commencing a separate proceeding, the authority to exercise the ultimate sanction summarily is not absolute. The Surrogate may remove without a hearing only where the misconduct is established by undisputed facts or concessions <em>(see, DePicabia v Chester Natl. Bank, </em>50 AD2d 812; <em>Matter of Grossman, </em>250 App Div 503, 504), where the fiduciary\u2019s in-court conduct causes such facts to be within the court\u2019s knowledge <em>(see, 2 </em>Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogates\u2019 Courts, \u00a7 20.11 [3] [a], at 20-129 [6th ed]; <em>Matter of Flaum v Birnbaum, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>191 AD2d 227, 228) or where facts warranting amendment of letters are presented to the court during a related evidentiary proceeding <em>(see, Matter of De Beixedon, </em>262 NY 168).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">By contrast, issuance of a decree without a hearing under section 719 will constitute an abuse of discretion where the facts are disputed, where conflicting inferences may be drawn therefrom <em>(see, Matter of Farber, </em>98 AD2d 720), or where there are claimed mitigating facts that, if established, would render summary removal an inappropriate remedy. In other words, where it is clear that the full factual picture has not yet been painted, \"immediate action should [not] be taken without the fiduciary being heard\u201d (2 Warren\u2019s Heaton, <em>op. cit, </em>\u00a7 20.11 [3] [c], at 20-130). In such circumstances, an opportunity to be heard and to present or contest relevant evidence would properly follow <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Irwin, </em>60 AD2d 885; <em>Matter of Bosco, </em>106 Misc 2d 454).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Upon finding a fiduciary\u2019s violation of section 719, the Surrogate is vested with discretion to select among a number of courses of relief, the most serious of which is revocation of letters and removal of the fiduciary <em>(see, Stolz v New York Cent. R. R. Co., </em>7 NY2d 269, 273). Removal of a fiduciary constitutes a judicial nullification of the testator\u2019s choice and may only be decreed when the grounds set forth in the relevant statutes have been clearly established <em>(Matter of Leland, </em>219 NY 387, 392). Accordingly, the rule has long prevailed that \"courts are required to exercise the power of removal sparingly and to nullify the testator\u2019s choice [of executor] only upon a clear showing of serious misconduct that endangers the safety of the estate; it is not every breach of fiduciary duty that will warrant removal [of an executor]\u201d <em>(Matter of Israel, </em>64 Misc 2d 1035, 1043, citing <em>Matter of Braloff, </em>3 AD2d 912, <em>affd </em>4 NY2d 847).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In this case, the fiduciaries had notice that the Surrogate was considering action pursuant to SCPA 719. Thus, the pivotal question here is whether the Surrogate\u2019s failure to afford the coexecutors a hearing prior to their removal constituted an abuse of discretion. We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Turning first to the procedures employed by the Surrogate here, we preliminarily note that the propriety of the Surrogate\u2019s novel grant of limited letters testamentary to Mr. Kuh, under the authority of SCPA 702, is not before us since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>an appeal by the coexecutors on that issue was abandoned. However, even assuming that Kuh\u2019s appointment was technically permitted under the broad language of section 702 (10)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for preliminary investigative purposes, the information contained in the Kuh report is woefully inadequate as a predicate for judicial action. The report contained no sworn statements, and its sources remained largely undisclosed. As a consequence, it had little worth as an evaluative tool, since it did not give the Surrogate a record from which to make her own factual findings. Notably, in this case, the Surrogate had not delegated her fact-finding authority pursuant to SCPA 506, which provides for the appointment of a Referee \u2014 a process that includes certain evidentiary safeguards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although her reasons for doing so \u2014 concern for delay and waste \u2014 are valid in the abstract, the interests of procedural fairness would have been better served if the Referee-appointment authority had been invoked.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When a Referee is appointed, the compensation and allowable expenses are fixed by statute (see, SCPA 506 [5]). Although the Kuh report yielded little usable information, the costs associated with its completion by a private attorney, including disbursements and experts\u2019 fees, are likely to exceed those associated with a reference, and have been estimated at over $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Additionally, the Surrogate did not delineate the function that the report would serve. In fact, the terms of the limited letters issued to Kuh, which directed him to alert the Surrogate \"to the need, if any, for further action,\u201d themselves suggested that something more \u2014 such as a hearing \u2014 would take place before the Surrogate would act on the information Kuh gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Given that fundamentally flawed procedure, the information contained in the Kuh report \u2014 upon which the Surrogate pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>marily relied in removing the coexecutors \u2014 provided an insufficient factual predicate for the grant of summary relief pursuant to SCPA \u00a7 719. Similarly, given the uncertainty surrounding the Surrogate\u2019s intended use of the Kuh report, the coexecutors\u2019 failure to dispute certain allegations contained therein did not automatically present the Surrogate with \"conceded\u201d facts that obviated the need for a hearing. On the contrary, the coexecutors persistently disputed the disclosures contained in the report, and sought an opportunity to defend themselves. Additionally, none of the traditional circumstances that justify the grant of summary relief were present here: the Surrogate had no independent knowledge of any statutory grounds for removal, no facts had been presented to the Surrogate in a related evidentiary proceeding, and the Kuh report did not provide a proper factual predicate for such ex parte judicial action. Indeed, the Attorney-General strongly urges this Court to reject the Surrogate\u2019s summary disposition and remit for further proceedings, citing the inherent unfairness of removing fiduciaries without proper pleadings or a hearing on these contested facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">To be sure, certain facts establishing sanctionable misconduct, such as waste, were contained in the coexecutors\u2019 own affidavits and documentary proof submitted to the Surrogate in response to the Kuh report. Nonetheless, given the numerous factual controversies concerning the coexecutors\u2019 fitness for their posts, and the fact that the fiduciaries were denied any reasonable opportunity to present mitigating facts that may have affected the Surrogate\u2019s choice of relief, summary removal of the testatrix\u2019s chosen executors under SCPA 719 without a hearing and based largely on the untested hearsay assembled here was an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we reverse and remit for further limited proceedings to address whether any of\" the disputed allegations of misconduct against the fiduciaries are established by a proper factual predicate, and, if substantiated, whether removal or some other less severe sanction may provide adequate redress for those wrongs <em>(see, Matter of Vermilye, </em>101 AD2d 865, 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Given the serious allegations of misconduct that have been levelled against both coexecutors and have taken the probate proceedings off course for a period in excess of two years,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Surrogate\u2019s decision, in the interests of efficiency and economy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>to determine the dispute without a hearing, though erroneous, was understandable. On remittal, those goals would best be served by conducting a limited evidentiary hearing that is tightly controlled by the Surrogate and confined to particular factors, which, if fairly proven, would warrant any sanction within the Surrogate\u2019s extensive powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs payable out of the estate, and the matter remitted to Surrogate\u2019s Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Order reversed, with costs to all parties appearing separately and filing separate briefs payable out of the estate, and matter remitted to Surrogate\u2019s Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">.
