Lamar Jr. (hereinafter called the Third) brought their petition, alleging that they were the executrix and executor, respectively, of the last will and testament of Henry J. Lamar, deceased (called the Second), and praying for an accounting against Walter D. Lamar as executor of Henry J. Lamar Sr. (referred to in the petition as the First). It is alleged in the petition, that the defendant, as executor aforesaid, is in possession of certain shares of stock which had been bequeathed by the third item of the will of Henry J. Lamar Sr. (the First) to Henry J. Lamar Jr. (the Second) in fee simple, and that petitioners are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>entitled to the possession of the stock so bequeathed, and certain dividends and profits arising therefrom. It appears from the answer filed in the case that the executor of Henry' J. Lamar the First differs with the petitioners in their construction of the will of this testator, insisting that the shares of stock referred to in the third item of the will were not bequeathed to the legatee named -in that item in fee simple, but that the bequest was affected by certain restrictions and limitations appearing in another item of the will. The portions of the will material to a consideration of the issues in the case are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b765-5\">\u201cItem 1st.

The item closes thus: \u201cHaving received by due transfer all the parental powers of his father over my said grandson, I hereby appoint Henry J.

Lamar Sr., deceased, which were in the possession of the testator, Henry J. Lamar Jr. (the Second), at the date of the latter\u2019s death. The court entered up judgment accordingly,'and further decreed that \u201cthe legacy of Henry J. Lamar 2nd, in and to the three stocks mentioned in the petition, that is, the special legacy in item three of the will of Henry J. Lamar 1st, as well as the legacy of the excess shares as shown in paragraph four of said will, has reverted to the estate of said H. J. Lamar 1st, to be divided among the other children of H. J. Lamar 1st, as provided in said will and under the terms of said will, said Henry J. Lamar 2nd, and his heirs, administrators, executors, and assigns, being excluded from the division of said reversion, which excluded both corpus and dividends.\u201d The plaintiffs made a motion for a new trial, which the court overruled, and they excepted. The defendant, by cross-bill of exceptions, assigned error upon the exclusion of certain documentary evidence offered by him at the trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b770-6\"><em>Guerry, Hall &amp; Roberts, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b770-7\"><em>Hall &amp; Hall, </em>-for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b770-8\">Beck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1hs\">(After-stating the foregoing facts.) An examination of the will of the testator will show, that, relatively to the stock in three specified companies, a common purpose or scheme pervaded the entire will, in the respect hereafter mentioned. Certain shares of this stock were left to the legatees. As to some of these, there were trusts or limitations over, and it was also specified that the bequest as to the stock was subject to a restriction stated in a later item of the will; and similar language as to a limitation was used in regard to another distributive share, where there was no trust. By the third item a share in the estate was left to a son. This included stock in the same three companies. Here there was no declaration of a trust or remainder over, and no specific reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>made to a future item. Then followed item 4. This began with the following words: \u201cI desire and direct that all the shares of stock of the Lamar &amp; Rankin Drug Company, the \u2018 S. S. S.\u2019 (Swift\u2019s Syphilitic Specific) Company, and the Bradfield Regulator Company, herein devised under the preceding items and paragraphs of this my will, shall be held by my executors, hereinafter named, until the first day of January in the year of our Lord 1925,\u201d when a distribution should take place. It is beyond controversy that this language was sufficiently broad to cover the shares of stock in the three companies mentioned which had previously been bequeathed to all of the legatees, including those which had been bequeathed to the pon absolutely, as well as those which had been bequeathed to others incumbered with a trust or remainder. Therefore item four began by dealing with all the shares of stock in those three companies, which had been bequeathed, and not merely some of them. It was then declared, that, at the date mentioned, the stock should be distributed among the legatees mentioned in items one and three and paragraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of item two, as in each of said items and paragraphs written. It could not have been the purpose of the testator, by this language, to limit the retention of stock until the date mentioned merely by saying that, when it should be divided, it should be distributed as written in previous items and paragraphs of the will. After providing for divisions of dividends and profits arising from the stock in the interval, the item then declared: \u201cThe corpus and income herein provided for,\u201d etc. What corpus and income was \u201cherein provided for\u201d? Obviously it included all of the shares of stock in the three named companies previously mentioned, for, as stated above, the item is careful to cover and provide for all such shares dealt with in any preceding item of the will. Therefore, when the expression, \u201c the corpus and income herein provided for,\u201d was employed, it could not be restricted to anything less than all the shares in those companies which had previously been provided for. Omitting for the moment the reference to the uses and trusts applicable to some of the distributive shares, the item then proceeds: \u201cprovided, however, that if any of the legatees, to whom the same is devised,, shall die before the first day of January, 1925, leaving no child or children, the income and dividends from the said stocks so bequeathed to such legatee, as well as the stock, shall re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>vert to and become a part of my estate to be distributed amongst my surviving children in equal shares.\u201d What is the meaning of the words, \u201cif any of the legatees, to whom the same is devised\u201d? The same as what? Unquestionably the same as something which had preceded, \u2014 the same stock as that which had been mentioned, or as to which provision had been already made in that item. As has been seen, there had been a provision and reference so made to all of the stock in the three companies which had been bequeathed in previous portions of the will. What, then, could the same stock mean, except all of the stock which had been so bequeathed? To be the same it must be all, not a part, of whatever those words refer to. It Can not be held that the statement, \u201c the corpus and income herein provided for to be subject to the same uses, trusts, and limitations as is provided for in item first, and paragraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this my will and testament,\u201d operated to limit the other provision for a reversion of the stock to only so much of it as had been made subject to certain uses, trusts, and limitations in the previous item and paragraphs mentioned. The testator was preserving and carrying forward the uses, trusts, and limitations respectively applicable to certain distributive shares. But by so doing he did not cut down the amount of the stock dealt with in item four from the whole to only a fractional part, or destroy the express provision for a reversion, applicable to all the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">This construction is further borne out by the fact that there was an excess of shares in the three companies beyond those which had been specifically bequeathed in previous items of the will. In the item which is now under consideration the testator undertook to deal with this excess, thus showing that he had in view, in making this item of the will, the entire stock in these three companies, first, that which he had previously bequeathed specifically, and second, all the excess of stock in those companies which he might own and which he had not previously specifically dealt with. In other words, the fourth item of the will shows an intent on the part of the testator to deal with the stock in these three companies entirely and in accordance with a general testamentary purpose in the respect mentioned. In that portion of the item which deals with the excess of the stock it was provided, that, \u201c in the event of the death of any one of my children before January 1, 1925, leaving no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>child or children, then his or her share of this stock, as well as the dividends, shall revert to my estate to be distributed amongst my surviving children, share and share alike.\u201d In this connection again the testator mentioned the trusts and limitations previously created as to certain shares of the estate, and, in pursuance of the general scheme in that regard, said: \u201cthe said stock and dividends therefrom to be subject to the same uses, trusts, and limitations as is provided for in paragraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this my will.\u201d It can not be successfully contended that, by this reference, the testator intended to limit the provision for distribution of the excess, so as to make the clause as to a reversion apply to only a part of such excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">So that, construing the fourth item as a whole, the references to the uses, trusts, and limitations expressed in other items neither limited the amount of stock dealt with in that item, nor the general provision (applicable to all of the stock so dealt with) that upon the death of a legatee prior to the date fixed for distribution, leaving no child or children, the stock applicable to that share should revert to the estate and be distributed among the testator\u2019s surviving children in equal shares. This construction gives to the will a consistent testamentary scheme as to these stocks. The construction which would exclude from the reversionary provision the bequest of stock in the companies to the son, contained in the third item of the will, would attribute to-the testator inconsistency, and lack of harmony in intent as to these stocks. Carrying out the same general purpose, by item six it is provided, that, should any of the property \u201c herein bequeathed \u201d revert to the estate, it should \u201cbe divided equally amongst my surviving children.\u201d He again adds, \u201cto be held for such uses and trusts and with the same restrictions and limitations as attach to the legacies herein bequeathed to such children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">If the construction which we have thus placed upon item four is a correct one, it is evident that it must be construed with and modifies the broad language employed in the third item, which gave absolutely some of these stocks to one of the testator\u2019s sons. A testator unquestionably has the power, after having given, in one item of his will, a bequest to a legatee for himself and his heirs forever, to attach a condition, by a later item, under which the property will revert upon a certain contingency. If the contingency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>did not happen, the legatee would have an absolute title. If it did happen, there would be- a reversion. The question is not can he do it, but has he done it. We think that the testator has by the fourth item expressly provided for a reversion applicable to this distributive share as well as to others. The decree of the court was in accordance with what is ruled above.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed on main bill of exceptions.
