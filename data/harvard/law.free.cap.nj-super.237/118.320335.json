It applied to the Planning Board of the Township (Board) for subdivision approval and for certain variances, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c(2) of the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -112, in order to create an 82-lot subdivision using a \u201clot averaging plan.\u201d Plaintiffs 570-acre parcel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>was in the R-5 zone, which permitted single-family residences on a minimum lot size of five acres, with a minimum lot width of 300 feet at the front setback line and an inscribed circle with a minimum diameter of 300 feet tangent to the front setback line. This zone also required a front yard of 80 feet, one side yard of 50 feet, two side yards totalling 120 feet, and a rear yard of 80 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Under plaintiffs lot averaging plan, 76 wetland acres of its 570-acre parcel were dedicated to the Morris County Park Commission for park purposes and 27 acres were dedicated for road rights-of-way. The remaining 467 acres were divided into 82 lots varying in size from 2.7 acres to 22.33 acres, resulting in an arithmetical \u201caverage lot size\u201d of about five acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Specifically, plaintiffs plan created 39 lots of under five acres each; two of these lots were under three acres each. The plan also created 27 lots with a width of less than 300 feet at the front setback line and three lots with a width of less than 275 feet. It created 21 lots with an inscribed circle having a diameter of less than 300 feet tangent to the front setback line, and two lots with an inscribed circle of less than 275 feet in diameter. The plan also required some variances from the zoning ordinance\u2019s side yard and rear yard requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">This is the procedural background. On May 18, 1987 plaintiff filed its application which was certified as complete as of July 27,1987. The Board held public hearings in 1987 on August 25, September 8, October 13, November 10 and on December 8, when plaintiff finished its evidentiary presentation. The Board asked for an extension until January 12, 1988, which plaintiff refused. The Board then voted to deny the application \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On January 12, 1988 the Board described the relief sought by plaintiff as \u201cmassive in scope\u201d and adopted a written resolution memorializing its December 8, 1987 decision. The Board noted that at the end of the December 8 meeting it had asked plaintiff to consent to an \u201cextension of time until January 12, 1988 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>permit members of the public to be heard, there not having been sufficient time for this purpose on December 8.\u201d The Board felt that its extension request was \u201cmodest and reasonable\u201d and that it did not constitute \u201cundue delay.\u201d It also felt that plaintiffs refusal to grant the extension was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and that because of that refusal, the Board \u201clack[ed] sufficient information upon which to make an informed decision concerning the merit of this application.\u201d The Board denied the application without prejudice, because \u201cfurther delay would result in an approval by default, by operation of law, which would be contrary to the intent of the Municipal Land Use Law and local ordinances enacted thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Plaintiff then filed a timely complaint and amended complaint in the Law Division and the Board answered. On June 7, 1988 the matter was argued and the judge rendered an oral decision granting automatic approval of the application pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-61. However, he gave the Board additional time to submit proposed \u201cstandard conditions\u201d to be \u201cattached to the approval\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cthe standard kind of conditions that you always have in these ... major subdivision approvals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">On June 26, 1988 the judge entered a final judgment declaring the application \u201capproved, including the granting of all requested and necessary variances therefor.\u201d He dismissed all other claims asserted by plaintiff. On June 30, 1988 the judge held a hearing to discuss the standard conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">On July 28, 1988 the Board held a public meeting. It voted not to appeal the June 16, 1988 judgment and to execute a stipulation of settlement to \u201cfully and finally conclude this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On July 29,1988 appellants and objectors, Augustus and Jane Knight, who owned property within 200 feet of plaintiffs parcel, filed their intervention motion. They sought merely to \u201cintervene and appeal.\u201d That is, they sought intervention not to \u201cstart the process from the beginning,\u201d but only to \u201ccontinue the legal process by use of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The judge denied their motion, because the \u201cbasic adjudication\u201d was finished, and there was \u201cnothing left to be done in the trial court.\u201d He concluded that the motion was \u201csimply too late.\u201d On August 4, 1988, the day the motion was argued, the judge rendered an oral decision and entered an order denying it. On August 5, 1988 the objectors filed their notice of appeal from the August 4, 1988 order. On the same date objectors, by way of amended appeal, appealed the June 26, 1988 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On September 22, 1988 objectors filed a motion in this court for an order \u201cpermitting intervention on appeal.\u201d On October 28, 1988 plaintiff filed a motion for an order dismissing objectors\u2019 appeal of the June 26, 1988 judgment. On November 2, 1988 plaintiff and the Planning Board filed their stipulation of settlement which incorporated their agreed-upon approval conditions. On December 22, 1988 we denied plaintiff\u2019s motion and reserved ruling on the objectors\u2019 motion \u201cpending consideration on the merits of the controversy.\u201d We now grant that motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> Objectors contend that they should have been allowed to intervene as of right pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:33-1. We agree. Intervention after final judgment is allowed, if necessary, to preserve some right which cannot otherwise be protected. <em>Tp. of Hanover v. Town of Morristown, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 142 (Ch.Div.), aff\u2019d 121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 538 (App.Div.1972), certif. den. 62 <em>N.J. </em>427 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Rule </em>4:33-1 sets out four criteria for determining intervention as of right. The applicant must (1) claim \u201can interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action,\u201d (2) show he is \u201cso situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest,\u201d (3) demonstrate that the \u201capplicant\u2019s interest\u201d is not \u201cadequately represented by existing parties,\u201d and (4) make a \u201ctimely\u201d application to intervene. Intervention as of right under <em>R. </em>4:33-1 is \u201cnot discretionary.\u201d <em>Vicendese v. J-Fad, Inc., </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 379 (Ch.Div.1978). If all criteria are met, an application for intervention as of right \u201cmust be approved by the court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Because objectors do not have an interest \u201cin\u201d plaintiff\u2019s property, plaintiff claims they have no interest \u201crelating to\u201d the property or transaction which is the subject of this action. That is, plaintiff concedes that objectors \u201cdesire to intervene ... only to protect their own property interest ... as property owners located within 200 feet of plaintiff\u2019s property,\u201d but contends that protecting \u201ctheir own independent property interest does not permit intervention as of right under <em>R. </em>4:33-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The Law Division Judge disagreed. He said that, as people \u201cwho own property adjacent to the 500-plus-acre tract which was the object of the subdivision application,\u201d objectors were \u201cparties who would have had a right to intervene [under <em>R. </em>4:33-1] had they asserted it timely.\u201d He also said \u201cit is in fact common for neighboring property owners in these zoning or subdivision matters to participate in prerogative writ trials\u201d and \u201cI always, always, always grant a neighboring property owner the right to intervene if he or she seeks to do so in timely fashion.\u201d The judge was correct in this respect. <em>See Monroe Realty C. v. Middletown Properties, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>659, 662 (Law Div.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Once the Board decided on July 28, 1988 not to appeal the June 16, 1988 final judgment, the Board no longer \u201cadequately represented\u201d objectors\u2019 interest; it left them so situated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201cdisposition of the action\u201d would impair their ability to protect their interest. When the Board decided not to appeal the judgment, objectors\u2019 interest could not otherwise be protected without intervention; there was no one available to protect their interest through an appeal. <em>See Dillon Companies, Inc. v. City of Boulder, </em>183 <em>Colo. </em>117, 515 P.2d 627, 629 (1973); <em>Hukle v. City of Kansas City, </em>212 <em>Kan. </em>627, 512 <em>P. </em>2d 457, 463 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Finally, in concluding that objectors\u2019 July 29, 1988 intervention motion was \u201csimply too late\u201d because there was \u201cnothing left to be done in the trial court,\u201d the judge did not consider the purpose of the intervention motion in relation to the stage in the action when the motion was made. <em>See Clarke v. Brown, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 410-411 (Law Div.1968). <em>See also, United States v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., </em>642 F.2d 1285, 1294 (D.C.Cir.1980). On the issue of timeliness, the court must consider the purpose for which intervention is sought. For example, if intervention is sought only for the limited purpose of taking an appeal, the only \u201cprejudice to those already parties in the case\u201d from granting intervention is the inherent \u201cdelay\u201d necessarily involved in opposing the intervenor\u2019s appeal. 642 <em>F. </em>2d at 1294-1295. When an intervenor seeks intervention \u201cafter the final judgment\u201d and only \u201cfor the purpose of appealing,\u201d the critical inquiry is simply \u201cwhether in view of all the circumstances the intervenor acted promptly after the entry of final judgment.\u201d <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>385, 387, 395-396, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2464, 53 L.Ed.2d 423, 427, 433 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiff claims that, \u201cif objectors are permitted to intervene and plaintiff is then forced to engage in a lengthy appeal process,\u201d there \u201cwill be a very practical, meaningful and extensive delay to plaintiff if ... it is forced to defend an appeal.\u201d While this contention is true, it is also legally irrelevant. Delay is inherent in any successful post-judgment application for intervention solely for the purpose of appealing the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>It cannot alone form the prejudice necessary to defeat the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Intervenors-objectors here filed their intervention motion immediately after learning of the Board\u2019s decision not to file an appeal. Because they sought intervention solely to appeal the judgment, their motion was timely. They met all criteria in <em>R. </em>4:33-1. They were entitled to intervention as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We do not consider the intervenor-appellants\u2019 contention that the Law Division judge erred in ruling that the application should receive automatic approval pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-61 because \u201cthe Board failed to grant or deny the application on the merits\u201d within the prescribed period. The evil that the automatic approval mechanism was \u201cdesigned to remedy was municipal inaction and inattention.\u201d <em>Allied Realty v. Upper Saddle River, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 418 (App.Div.1987), certif. den. 110 <em>N.J. </em>304 (1988); <em>see Manalapan Holding Co. v. Hamilton Tp. Plan. Bd., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>466, 473-474 (1983). Here we conclude that the Planning Board had no initial jurisdiction to act upon the application because of its scope and dimension. Municipal inaction and inattention is not in issue. Since the application, in effect, called for a rezoning, we conclude that it was not an appropriate subject for a flexible c(2) variance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c(2). Because the Board had no power to grant the application in any event, we need not entertain the appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201cautomatic approval\u201d was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The crucial issue is one which the Law Division judge found \u201cvery troublesome.\u201d That is, whether the Board had the authority to entertain a \u201clot averaging\u201d application where there was no local lot averaging ordinance. This was important because, as the judge observed, \u201cbefore one can say that an application is time-approved [under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-61] one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>should, as a threshold matter, be able to say that it was appropriate for the Board ... to be dealing with the application in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Law Division judge noted that the Board and its attorney had serious reservations about the propriety of the application from the outset \u2014 whether it is \u201ctoo big in terms of its methodological departure and in terms of the sheer number of variances which it involves.\u201d The record discloses that the Board\u2019s attorney had communicated these basic jurisdictional concerns to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney since early in the application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Resolution of the issue of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over the application involves three considerations. First is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-40b of the MLUL, which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">An ordinance requiring subdivision approval by the planning board pursuant to this article may also include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">b. Standards encouraging and promoting flexibility, economy and environmental soundness in layout and design in accordance with which the planning board may approve the varying, within a conventional subdivision, of lot areas and dimensions, and yards and setbacks otherwise required by municipal development regulations in such a way that the <em>average lot areas </em>and <em>dimensions, yards and setbacks within the subdivision conform to the conventional norms of the municipal development regulations; </em>provided that such standards shall be appropriate to the type of development permitted. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">As noted, the Township of Chester\u2019s ordinance had no such \u201caveraging\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Second is the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition in <em>Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1987), of the Legislature\u2019s \u201capparent objective\u201d and \u201cstrong legislative policy\u201d of \u201cencouraging municipalities to make zoning decisions by ordinance rather than by variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 23-24. That is, the MLUL\u2019s legislative scheme emphasizes the role of planning in land use regulation and zoning, not <em>ad hoc </em>decision-making. <em>See Kaufmann v. Planning Bd. for Warren Tp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>551, 557 (1988); <em>Riggs v. Long Beach Tp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>601, 619-622 (1988) (Handler, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Third is the observation in <em>AMG Associates v. Tp. of Springfield, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>101 (1974), that where a variance application \u201cinvolves or affects a large tract or a substantial area comprising several tracts,\u201d the situation may be \u201cbeyond the intended scope of the variance procedure and the power of the local administrative agencies,\u201d and may \u201cindicate the need for rezoning by the municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110 n. 3. Judge Pressler noted this observation and expanded upon it in <em>Tp. of Dover v. Bd. of Adj. of Tp. of Dover, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Judge Pressler indicated that among the \u201cdispositive considerations\u201d which underlie the \u201cstatutory allocation of function\u201d between the municipal governing body and its administrative zoning agencies was the governing body\u2019s \u201cultimate responsibility to establish, by the adoption of its zoning ordinances and amendments thereto, the essential land use character of the municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. It does this \u201cby the geographical delineation of its districts and, uniformly within each district, the delineation of the uses permitted therein and the limitation schedules applicable thereto in terms of lot size, lot coverage, height restrictions and the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-412. On the other hand, the \u201cvariance power\u201d reposed in municipal zoning agencies is intended only to \u201caccommodate individual situations which, for a statutorily stated reason, require relief from the restrictions and regulations otherwise uniformly applicable to the district as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. That is, the agencies\u2019 variance power is expressly limited to a \u201cspecific piece of property,\u201d and is so confined to \u201cavoid the potential\u201d which this variance power \u201cmight otherwise have for substantially affecting the essential land use scheme of the entire district itself and perhaps of the entire municipality as well.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Given this, the basic inquiry in each case must be \u201cwhether the impact of the requested variance will be to substantially alter the character of the district as that character has been prescribed by the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-413. This inquiry \u201crequires analysis and evaluation of such factors as the size of the tract itself; the size of the tract in relationship to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the size and character both of the district in which it is located and the municipality as a whole; the number of parcels into which it is anticipated that the tract will be subdivided if subdivision is part of the plan, and the nature, degree and extent of the variation from district regulations which is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. The test for determining whether the municipal zoning agency engaged in \u201cproscribed legislation\u201d is ultimately \u201cone of both geographic and functional substantiality vis-a-vis the plan and the scheme of the municipality\u2019s zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Turning specifically to the \u201cauthority vested in zoning and planning boards\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c(2) to grant \u201cdimensional variances without a showing of hardship,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Kcmfmann </em>noted that this authority is limited to a \u201cvery narrow band of cases,\u201d and that planning boards may exercise it only in applications \u201cproperly before them.\u201d 110 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, 560-561. The Court also described the amendment providing for \u201cflexible c(2) variances,\u201d L.1984, <em>c. </em>20, \u00a7 12, as a redefinition of \u201cthe qualifications for a very limited class of nonhardship variances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. <em>See Loscalzo v. Pini, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291, 302-303 (App.Div.1988); <em>WaWa Food Market v. Planning Bd., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 38-40 (App.Div.1987); <em>see also Morris Cty. F. Housing v. Boonton Tp., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 355 (App.Div.1989). Moreover, every grant of a c(2) variance \u201cmust be rooted in the purposes of zoning and planning itself and must advance the purposes of the MLUL.\u201d <em>Kaufman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Thus, by definition, no c(2) variance \u201cshould be granted when merely the purposes of the owner will be advanced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. By the same token, a planning board is not free to grant c(2) variances from \u201cexisting requirements just because it disagrees with those requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In sum, while the Legislature \u201cintended through the c(2) variance to vest a larger measure of discretion in local boards in a limited area of cases,\u201d it also \u201cconfined the discretion\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>such boards. <em>Id. </em>at 564-566. These boards \u201ccannot require [zoning] ordinances to suit the owner or their own idea of what municipal development regulations should be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564. Rather, they must \u201cseek ... to effectuate the goals of the community as expressed through its zoning and planning ordinances,\u201d and should grant a c(2) variance only if the proposed development \u201cwould put the land more in conformity with the community\u2019s development plans and thereby would advance the purposes of zoning.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The Law Division judge recognized the merit to the objections to the application. He acknowledged that the plaintiff\u2019s 570-acre parcel was a \u201cvery substantial piece of real estate even in a relatively undeveloped municipality such as Chester Township.\u201d The judge was concerned by the \u201csheer number of lots\u201d that required variances, which he felt were a \u201cbig\u201d departure from the requirements of the R-5 zoning district. He observed that plaintiff wanted to depart from these requirements \u201con a very large scale.\u201d He also felt that, \u201cin terms of methodology,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s application was \u201copen to a serious challenge that it\u2019s simply setting aside the legislative scheme.\u201d The judge found it \u201cvery troublesome\u201d that, based on the undisputed facts, the conclusion \u201cmight well be drawn that we\u2019re not dealing with the granting of a variance at all, we\u2019re dealing with the creation of a new zoning district with dimensional regulations markedly, and in a widespread way, at variance with what the legislative scheme calls for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Township here had not enacted an optional, averaging, subdivision ordinance as authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-40b. If it had done so, the ordinance presumably would have included some standards encouraging and promoting flexibility, economy and environmental soundness in layout and design, \u201cin accordance with which\u201d the planning board may approve the \u201cvarying ... of lot areas and dimensions, and yards and setbacks otherwise required by municipal development regulations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because there was no optional, averaging ordinance, the judge\u2019s conclusion that under plaintiff\u2019s lot averaging plan the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Township ended up with the \u201ckind\u201d of development and with the \u201ckinds\u201d of individual lots and standards \u201ccontemplated by the [nonexistent] ordinance,\u201d was purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On the record before us there is much merit to the comments in appellants\u2019 reply brief, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">The developer incorrectly claims that its \u201clot averaging plan\u201d furthers the intention of the MLUL and thereby fosters the goals of the community. In reality, the developer\u2019s proposal does nothing more than leave vacant that property which could not be developed under any circumstances and attempts to cluster homes on undersized lots adjacent to existing residential areas. The developer\u2019s proposal further provides ingress and egress to the new homes via local roads which, if their present character is to be maintained, are not designed to accommodate the increased traffic which would be generated by the developer\u2019s proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Without the use of lot averaging, the developer would not be able to build 82 homes on the subject property because that property which the developer has dedicated to \u201cenvironmental purposes\u201d could not be developed under any circumstances. Therefore, under the guise of lot averaging the developer is really attempting to protect against its own hardship in having to conform to the zone requirements of the Township and thereby develop less [sic] homes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Forcing the Objectors to live beside a suburban development in an otherwise rural area, clearly does not foster the Municipal Land Use Law or the overall zoning plans of the Township. The developer is attempting to use the e(2) ordinance to its own advantage to develop homes on undersized lots while leaving the land, unsuitable to development under any circumstances, vacant. This is clearly not what the legislature intended in enacting the e(2) ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">Accordingly, although there may be instances where deviating from the zoning ordinance in a community will enhance the development of that community, that situation does not exist where, as here, the variance is sought simply to permit the developer to build more lots on a given parcel than would otherwise be permitted under applicable zoning law. The developer is attempting to develop its property in a manner which benefits the developer to the detriment of the neighboring property owners. \u201c[N]o c(2) variance should be granted when merely the purposes of the owner will be advanced.\u201d 110 <em>N.J. </em>at 563.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We conclude that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c(2), and the interpretation of that statute advanced in <em>Kaufmann v. Planning Bd. for Warren Tp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>551 (1988), the Board had no jurisdiction to grant plaintiffs application on this substantially sized tract. The c(2) \u201cflexible\u201d variance power is not a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>to undertake piecemeal, project-by-project rezoning of substantial tracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The Planning Board has not filed a brief. In a statement in lieu of brief it states:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">[T]he general public interest does not require the Board\u2019s adversarial participation in the appeal. Plaintiff and Appellant-Objectors may reasonably be expected to present all relevant issues to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:6-4(c) and (d), the Board hereby submits the foregoing statement in lieu of brief. Public funds should not be expended when the issues in question are clearly raised by the parties directly concerned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
