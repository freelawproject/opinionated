S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(l), and sexual assault upon a mentally defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>person, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(2). He was acquitted of the first three charges and convicted of the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The count of the indictment under which defendant was convicted charged that he had performed vaginal intercourse upon M.R., \u201cwhen he knew or should have known that [M.R.] was ... mentally defective.\u201d Defendant challenges his conviction on the ground that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He asserts that the evidence fails to support the conclusion that he knew or should have known that M.R. was mentally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In its previous form <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1h defined the phrase \u201cmentally defective\u201d to mean a mental condition which rendered one incapable of \u201cappraising\u201d the nature of his or her conduct. By <em>L. </em>1983, c. 249, 1103, the legislature substituted the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d for \u201cappraising.\u201d According to CANNEL, CRIMINAL CODE ANNOTATED, <em>Comment N.J.S. </em>2C:14-1h,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">[t]he concern was that without this change the addition to 2C:14-2c(2) of a provision criminalizing sexual contact with mentally defective persons, made by the same statute, might have been construed to include even mildly retarded persons and therefore criminalize consensual sexual activity involving such persons. Senate Committee Statement to A-1844 (1983). The definition now makes it clear that persons are mentally defective within the meaning of this chapter only if incapable of <em>understanding </em>the nature of their conduct, i.e., that they are engaged in sexual activity. Previously they were included if unable to <em>appraise </em>that conduct, i.e., as being either morally right or wrong, [emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Whether cast in terms of \u201cappraising\u201d or \u201cunderstanding,\u201d the definition of \u201cmentally defective\u201d does not lend itself to easy application. The difficulty lies with ascertaining what is meant by the \u201cnature\u201d of the victim\u2019s conduct. We conclude that the term is used in the statute in its broad meaning as referring to \u201cthe essential character or constitution of something.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED 1507 (G. &amp; C. Merriam Company 1971). So understood, it involves an inquiry into whether or not the complainant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>appreciate the inviolability of her person and that others could not, without her consent, invade her person for carnal gratification. This was discussed in <em>Commentary to the New Jersey Penal Code, Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>194-195 (October, 1971) in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The difficult problem is to define the degree of mental deficiency or impairment which shall bring the statute into play. The Code limits criminality to situations of known mental disease or defect so serious as to render the woman \u201cincapable of appraising the nature of her own conduct.\u201d Conditions affecting only the woman\u2019s capacity to \u201ccontrol\u201d herself sexually will not involve criminal liability. Also, by specifying that the woman must lack capacity to appraise \u201cthe nature\u201d of her conduct, <em>we make it dear that we are not talking about appraisals involving value judgments or consideration of remote consequences of the immediate acts. The typical case that remains within the revised clause would be the case of intercourse with a woman known to the defendant to be manifestly and seriously deranged. </em>(MPC P.O.D., p. 144 (1962)). [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We conclude from the foregoing that success of a prosecution under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(2) depends upon proof of direct or circumstantial facts, unique to each case, which show that the complainant was mentally defective and either that defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the complainant\u2019s mental defect or that the disability was so conspicuous that it could not be overlooked. In holding a defendant accountable for what he \u201cknew or should have known,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(2) expects him to know what is evident to a person of ordinary perception, learning, insight and sensitivity. With these standards, we turn to the relevant and material evidence to determine whether it supports a judgment that M.R. was mentally defective as defined by statute and, if so, whether this was something of which defendant knew or should have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">At the time of the alleged offense M.R. was 16 years old. She was classified as educable mentally retarded and attended a special education class in Passaic High School. According to her mother and her aunt, with whom she has a close relationship, M.R. \u201cforgets everything,\u201d and is \u201cslow.\u201d She assists her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>mother in keeping up the home by sweeping the floors and washing dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">M.R. was examined by two school psychologists. The substance of their testimony was that M.R. has a verbal I.Q. of 60 and a performance I.Q. of 65. They found her to be \u201cmoderately retarded,\u201d describing her as \u201cvery naive and socially inept. She didn\u2019t seem to do very much without supervision; seemed rather passive; never worked; never baby sat.\u201d When she was specifically asked on direct examination whether she had an opinion \u201cas to whether or not ... [M.R.] is unable to understand the nature of her conduct\u201d one psychologist gave the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">I believe she\u2019s mentally defective and unable to understand the ripple effects or the consequences of her behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The foregoing fairly recapitulates the testimony relating to M.R.\u2019s mental deficit. That deficit is an essential element of the offense and the test to be applied is whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Q\">viewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>[State v. Beyes, </em>50 <em>NJ. </em>454, 459 (1967)] [citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Although there can be no question as to M.R.\u2019s intellectual disability, the proofs do not support a conclusion that it prevented her from understanding the nature of her encounter with defendant. What emerges, certainly, is the picture of a slow-thinking, poorly-functioning individual, but not one without the capacity to understand that she had a right to refuse defendant her favors and that defendant was using her to gratify his own sexual desires. The State\u2019s own testimony even suggests the contrary. For example, according to M.R.\u2019s aunt, M.R. told her that \u201che rape her.\u201d This statement alone implies a grasp of the distinction between permissible and impermissible sex and that her body was wrongfully used by defendant. Moreover, she testified in her own concrete vernacular as to how the sexual organs were joined during intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>We have considered carefully the import of the psychologist\u2019s direct testimony that M.R. was \u201cunable to understand the ripple effects or the consequences of her behavior.\u201d The question to which this responded called for an opinion as to whether M.R. was capable of \u201cunderstanding the nature of her conduct.\u201d The answer did not directly address this question. As the Criminal Law Revision Commission stated in its final report, <em>supra, </em>the concern of the statute is with the victim\u2019s ability to understand the \u201cimmediate acts\u201d of sexual congress, not their \u201cremote consequences.\u201d The foregoing opinion does not describe the condition contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We conclude that the State failed to produce evidence that M. R. was mentally defective within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1h. As part of that determination, and independently thereof, we find no evidence that defendant \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that M.R. was mentally defective as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(2). <em>See Burks v. United States, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>1, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2141, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1 (1978); <em>State v. Boratto, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>506, 517 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
