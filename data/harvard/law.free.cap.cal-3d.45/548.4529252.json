J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_D\">Defendant Jaturun Siripongs was convicted of murdering Packovan \u201cPat\u201d Wattanapom and Quach Nguyen (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), robbery <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 211), and burglary <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 459). (All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.) The jury found he used a knife (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) during the commission of Quach\u2019s murder, as well as the robbery and burglary, but did not find that he used a knife when he murdered Pat. It further found true the special circumstances of felony-murder-robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and multiple murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), and sentenced defendant to death. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">A. <em>The Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The prosecution\u2019s case rested mainly on circumstantial evidence. Accordingly, we set forth the facts in detail:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In December 1981, Surachai \u201cJack\u201d Wattanapom operated a wholesale import-export business from a warehouse in Garden Grove, California. He also owned a small retail store in Garden Grove, the Pantai Market. Jack\u2019s wife, Pat, managed the store; Quach Nguyen was a store employee. Because Pat also bought and sold expensive jewelry on the side (often while working at the store) she frequently wore several pieces of jewelry to work and kept additional pieces in her purse. Defendant knew this because he had occasionally worked at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Defendant was primarily employed as an optical grinder and polisher working on a 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift. After work, he usually visited his girlfriend, Sainampeung \u201cPeung\u201d Vecharungspri, who lived in Cerritos. Defendant typically arrived at her house between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and stayed until about 9 p.m. During his visit on Monday, December 14, defendant asked Peung\u2019s sister, Netnapa (Noon), to telephone his supervisor the following morning and report that he was sick and would not be coming to work. Noon placed the call about 6:30 a.m. the following morning. Defendant did not report for work on December 15 or 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">About 10 a.m. on December 15, Pat met with Suwat Pansanguan, one of Jack\u2019s warehouse employees. Jack had been on a business trip and was scheduled to return that morning. Pat gave Suwat the keys to her car and asked him to meet Jack at the airport. Suwat noticed Pat was wearing a string of pearls, a brooch, a gold pendant, two diamond rings and a gold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Rolex watch. Suwat left the store about 10:30 a.m., and Quach arrived at the store around noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">At 12:15 p.m., Pat\u2019s 13-year-old son, Vitoon, tried to call her from school. He telephoned the market; a woman answered the phone and spoke in a Southeast Asian language. Because the language was not Thai, Vitoon was unable to communicate with the woman. After a few seconds the woman dropped the receiver but did not hang up. Vitoon remained on the line for about two minutes, listening to the sound of cars driving by the Pantai Market and occasionally calling into the phone in the hope of getting a response. He finally hung up. Further attempts to phone the store received only a busy signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">About 1:30 p.m., Deborah Patton, Suwat\u2019s wife, entered the Pantai Market. She had been experiencing car trouble and wished to telephone her husband at the warehouse. When Deborah entered the store she found a woman, standing at the counter holding groceries, who said she had been waiting for at least 30 minutes for a store employee to assist her. Deborah called for Pat but received no answer. She found the telephone receiver lying on the floor near the cash register; she picked it up and called the warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">A search for Pat and Quach ensued. Jack arrived at the store around 2 p.m. with Suwat and telephoned the police while Suwat walked through the store. Suwat entered the dark storeroom in the back of the store. As he tried to turn on the light switch he stepped on something, reached down, felt human hair, and screamed. Thereafter Jack walked into the storeroom and turned on the light.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Blood splatters covered the room. Pat was lying face down on the floor; she had been strangled to death with ligature. Quach was found in a still-wet pool of blood; he had suffered multiple stab wounds to his head and neck, and defensive wounds were found on his hands and right arm. He had been stabbed or slashed at least 10 times; in light of the jagged condition of the skin, the wounds could have been inflicted by a serrated knife. The time of death for both victims was estimated to be 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The police arrived shortly after 2:30 p.m. and began investigating. Bloodstains were found everywhere: near the cash register, on the produce scale, in the aisle leading from the storeroom, on two of the storeroom walls, on a water heater and trash can in the storeroom and in the storeroom sink, on the floor leading to the bathroom and in the bathroom sink. Blood samples were taken for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The police also found a piece of cord tied around Quach\u2019s right arm and a piece of paper near Quach\u2019s body. The paper was a letter to Noon from one of her friends. (Noon had placed the letter in her jacket, which was one of the items of clothing that she had kept at defendant\u2019s house;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the last time she had seen the jacket was on Thanksgiving.) Jack informed one of the investigating officers (Detective McLean of the Garden Grove Police Department) that defendant had a criminal record in Thailand and that he might have been responsible for the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Defendant arrived at Peung\u2019s house about 3 p.m. the afternoon of the murders, an hour earlier than usual. His fingers were bandaged and bleeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claimed he cut himself at work trying to catch a piece of glass, and asked Peung\u2019s brother, Wongwej (Deng), to wash the floormats in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Later that afternoon, defendant telephoned his friend Chusit Petsuksomvilai, whom he owed $1,000. He told Chusit that a female friend of his named Sang had been arrested by the immigration authorities and was without money to return to Thailand. Defendant said that Sang needed to leave for Thailand in a week and had given him jewelry which she wished to sell to raise money for the trip. Defendant and Chusit arranged to meet at 6 p.m. that evening, at which time defendant handed Chusit a bag containing nine pieces of jewelry: a gold bracelet, two gold chains, three religious pendants, and three rings, one of which held a two-carat diamond. Defendant asked Chusit to sell the jewelry and estimated that it should bring about $4,000. He also told Chusit that because Sang promised to pay him a commission on any jewelry sold, he would be able to give Chusit some of the money he owed him. All of the jewelry, except for one of the gold chains, was later positively identified as belonging to Pat.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The following morning (Wednesday, December 16) Pat\u2019s purse was found in a dumpster behind a shop in Cerritos. The dumpster was a short distance from Peung\u2019s house and was located in a shopping complex which housed the laundromat used by defendant. An exhaustive search of the dumpster followed; every item in it was removed and examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In addition to Pat\u2019s bag, purse and wallet (which still contained eight bank cards), the police discovered Noon\u2019s green jacket which had contained the letter found at the Pantai Market; a bloodstained shirt; a pair of bloodstained pants; a pair of bloodstained shoes later found to be defendant\u2019s size; a pair of socks; a twelve-and-one-half inch bloodstained Robinson serrated blade kitchen knife with a broken tip; a seven-and-one-half inch Konekut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>knife; a wadded bandana containing an adhesive bandage wrapper and a bloodstained paper towel; two pieces of cord, forty-eight inches and forty-nine inches in length; three 9-inch envelopes bearing the name Pantai Market; and a bank deposit slip also from the Pantai Market. The physical dimensions, strand count, color and chemical make-up of the cord found in the dumpster and the cord found wrapped around Quach\u2019s right arm were identical. Hair was discovered on the shoes, the shirt, the bandana, and the serrated knife. Some of the hair found was consistent with Pat\u2019s hair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Defendant reported to work Thursday, December 17, at which time he was questioned about the injury to his hands. He told his supervisor that his girlfriend\u2019s sister had tried to commit suicide following a fight with her lover and that defendant cut his hands trying to take a knife away from her. Noon contradicted this at trial; when asked specifically whether she had attempted to commit suicide on December 15 or 16, and whether defendant cut his hand while trying to take a knife away from her, she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">On the afternoon of the 17th, defendant attempted to make a purchase at a department store using one of the Wattanapoms\u2019 credit cards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the store\u2019s credit card list indicated the card had been lost or stolen, the clerk asked defendant for identification. Defendant looked through his wallet and then told the clerk that his identification was in his car; he left, and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Later the same afternoon, about 4:30 p.m., defendant attempted to make a purchase at a Sears store with a credit card issued in the name of Surachai Wattanapom. The clerk telephoned a credit clearing house that maintains credit history and data, including stolen card reports. She was instmcted to ask for a driver\u2019s license. Defendant told the clerk that he had no identification, and she asked him to wait. The store security manager then spoke with the credit clearing house and was informed that the credit card in question had been stolen the day before, during a double homicide. The security manager, accompanied by two security guards, approached defendant and asked if the card belonged to him. When defendant admitted it did not, they placed defendant under \u201carrest\u201d for possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Defendant was handcuffed and taken to the security office to await arrival of police. En route defendant complained that the handcuffs were too tight. He was informed that the credit card he was using had been taken during a double murder and that the handcuffs would be adjusted once they reached the security office.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Once inside the security office defendant was handcuffed to a chair; because each hand was cuffed separately to the chair, defendant had a fair degree of mobility in his hands. When asked his name and address defendant said his name was \u201cJay Siri\u201d and that he lived in Costa Mesa.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the security guards then asked defendant if he had any identification so that he (the guard) could fill out a report for Sears. Defendant reached into his back pocket, removed his wallet, and handed the guard a piece of paper from inside the wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Westminster Police Department Officer Upstill arrived a few minutes later, placed defendant under arrest for possession of a stolen credit card, and replaced the security guard\u2019s handcuffs with his own. Upstill asked defendant his name, and its spelling. Defendant responded that his name was written on a card in his wallet arid that it would be simpler to copy it from that card; he then reached into his pocket and, with Upstill\u2019s assistance, retrieved his wallet. Upstill opened the wallet without objection and flipped through it in search of the card; defendant pointed it out to him when he reached it. Defendant also asked Upstill to remove a gold chain from the wallet and place it around defendant\u2019s neck. Upstill found the chain but refused the request, leaving it in defendant\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">About 5:15 p.m., Detective McLean of the Garden Grove police arrived at the store and was told defendant was under arrest for receiving stolen property. He was shown defendant\u2019s wallet, the necklace, and some credit cards. Defendant complained of pain in his hands and McLean noticed that his fingers were bandaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Before placing him in the police car, Upstill explained to defendant that he would be taken to jail and his car would be left unattended. Upstill told defendant to inform him if he wanted anything removed from his car or if he wanted to make sure the car was locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Defendant told Upstill he wished to retrieve his girlfriend\u2019s picture from his car. He led the police to his car, and Upstill found a photograph of Peung on the dashboard and placed it with defendant\u2019s personal belongings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>McLean then ordered defendant\u2019s car sealed and impounded until a search warrant could be obtained. No search for evidence was made. Defendant was driven to the Westminster police station and Detective McLean followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">McLean obtained custody of defendant on the murder charges about 6:30 p.m. In addition to defendant\u2019s personal property, the Westminster police turned over to McLean the Sears credit card that defendant had attempted to use, defendant\u2019s wallet, and the four credit cards found inside it. McLean then drove defendant to the Garden Grove police station, and placed him in an interview room. Blood and hair samples were thereafter taken from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">While being escorted to another room, defendant told McLean he wished to speak to an attorney. McLean thereafter did not question defendant, nor did he advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Later that evening, about 11 p.m., defendant was told he would be allowed two telephone calls, and Detective Shave was instructed to tape record the conversations. Shave hid a small tape recorder in the pocket of his sport coat and then escorted defendant to a telephone located in a hallway of the station. Detective Shave asked defendant for the telephone number he wished to call. Shave noted the number, dialed it, and then stood about three feet away from defendant and tape recorded him while he conversed. A television camera was pointed toward the telephone and several police officers were nearby throughout the conversation. Shave could hear defendant\u2019s voice clearly, but was unable to understand what was being said because defendant spoke in Thai. When defendant finished, Shave offered to place a second call for him to an attorney or another friend, but defendant declined, stating he could not remember the telephone number of the other person with whom he wished to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">It was later learned that defendant had telephoned Peung. He told her he was in jail because he had borrowed someone\u2019s credit card. Defendant asked Peung to go to his house and remove some presents, Buddha amulets and a camera. Defendant then asked to speak with Noon. He told her he was in jail because he had borrowed someone\u2019s credit card and asked her to go to his house and remove a camera, a Buddha, a sugar jar, Christmas gifts which he had purchased for her family, a document, and his car keys. He told Noon where the objects were located and then instructed her to get money from Chusit. When defendant hung up, Noon and Peung requested their mother\u2019s permission to drive to defendant\u2019s house. Their mother refused to let them go because it was nearly midnight and very foggy.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The police obtained search warrants for defendant\u2019s car and residence shortly before 4 a.m. on the morning of December 18. The warrant for defendant\u2019s residence authorized nighttime service. The search of the residence was executed about 5 a.m. Also at that time, Jack and Suwat arrived at the Garden Grove police station to translate the recording made by Detective Shave. During the search, the police discovered several Christmas presents wrapped in department store boxes. A Robinson knife set, consistent with the serrated knife found in the dumpster, was discovered at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In the midst of the search, the officers were informed that the tape recording of defendant\u2019s telephone conversation had been translated, and they were instructed to search specifically for a glass jar on the kitchen stove, a camera case and a Buddha. Those items were seized and found to contain dozens of pieces of jewelry matching Jack\u2019s descriptions of Pat\u2019s jewelry. Several items\u2014including a gold watch, a jade disk, a green stone, a set of beads, two brooches, three necklaces, three rings, four gold chains, five bracelets, and five pairs of earrings\u2014were later positively identified as belonging to the Wattanapoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In a box in defendant\u2019s bedroom, the police discovered eight department store receipts for some of the Christmas gifts. The receipts bore Pat\u2019s name, and were dated after her death. A piece of paper on which someone had practiced signing Pat\u2019s name was also found.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The search warrant for defendant\u2019s car was executed later that morning. Several samples of dried blood were collected. The police found a bag containing Pantai Market bank books, credit card receipts, and a gold watch that belonged to Pat.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Later that afternoon, defendant telephoned Chusit from jail. He told Chusit he had been arrested for using a credit card and that he had been charged with the Pantai Market murders. Chusit asked defendant whether the jewelry purportedly belonging to Sang had been stolen, and defendant assured him it was not. Chusit then asked defendant how he should return the jewelry to Sang. Defendant instructed him to contact Noon because she knew Sang and could contact her. Immediately thereafter, Chusit telephoned Noon, and asked how he could reach Sang. Noon replied that she did not know anyone named Sang.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Analysis of defendant\u2019s blood sample revealed that several of the bloodstains found at the murder scene, and bloodstains on four of the items of clothing found in the dumpster, were consistent with defendant\u2019s blood type. The bloodstains on the pieces of cord from the dumpster\u2014which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>matched the cord tied around Quach\u2019s arm\u2014were also consistent with defendant\u2019s blood. The bloodstains on the shoes found in the dumpster were consistent with Quach\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The defense presented no evidence at trial, choosing instead to challenge the sufficiency of the People\u2019s evidence. During closing argument, defense counsel stressed that there was no direct evidence placing defendant at the murder scene. He insisted that the People\u2019s case was based on mere suspicion, and argued that suspicion, no matter how strong, did not rise to \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d He contended there was no motive for defendant to kill Pat and Quach, and he reminded the jury of the testimony that defendant was once a Buddhist monk in Thailand and that he had a history of nonviolence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The jury deliberated for one day, and returned the verdicts described above. Additionally, it specially found that defendant \u201cintentionally killed\u201d both Quach and Pat,</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">B. <em>The Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The People presented no further evidence at the penalty trial. The defense argued that defendant was a competent and cooperative employee who had a \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ccaring\u201d attitude about his job; that he was once the victim of an armed robbery and that he had been \u201chelpful [and] very cooperative\u201d during the police investigation of that crime; that he was a \u201cgood inmate\u201d and, in the words of a cellmate, a \u201cmodel prisoner\u201d who did not cause trouble and who volunteered for work assignments; and that he was a religious man. The jury deliberated for one day before returning a verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">II. Guilt Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">A. <em>The Tape Recording</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Defendant asserts the tape recording of his telephone conversation following his arrest constituted an unlawful wiretap, in violation of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520), and violated his right to counsel and his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">1. Illegal Wiretap</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Defendant insists it was illegal for Officer Shave secretly to record his telephone conversation \u201cin the absence of a valid court order.\u201d We question whether this claim is properly before us because, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>defendant raised it in his motion for new trial, it was not presented to the trial court at the suppression hearing. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In any event, we reject defendant\u2019s claim on its merits. First, Officer Shave did not \u201cintercept\u201d the conversation \u201cthrough the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device,\u201d as prohibited by 18 United States Code section 2510(4). Rather, he heard the conversation with his normal hearing faculties and the tape recording merely memorialized what he heard. Accordingly, no interception of a wire communication occurred. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(D.C. 1971) 332 F.Supp. 1299, 1301 [\u201c[T]he overhearing and recording of one end of a telephone conversation without the actual interception of a communication passing through the wires, was not intended to be included within the definition of the term \u2018wire communication\u2019 but under the statute is simply another form of oral communication].\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Nor did the recording constitute an unlawful interception of an oral communication because, on these facts, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Suttle </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 572 [153 Cal.Rptr. 409].) The federal wiretap law prohibits only interception of communications \u201cuttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2).) Defendant could not have justifiably expected his conversation was not being intercepted, because he could clearly see that at least one police officer could hear every word he said. As we explain below, he had no reasonable expectation the officer could not understand Thai, or that his speech was not being recorded by that officer for later translation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">2. Right to Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Defendant\u2019s right to counsel claim is similarly meritless. Because adversary proceedings had not yet been formally initiated against him, his right to counsel under the federal Constitution had not attached at the time of the telephone call. (See <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 682, 688-689 [32 L.Ed.2d 411, 416-418, 92 S.Ct. 1877]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88, 95 [177 Cal.Rptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 180, 187-188 [81 L.Ed.2d 146, 153-154, 104 S.Ct. 2292].) Nor was this a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings sufficient to trigger his right to counsel under our state Constitution. <em>(Bustamante, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 99; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Houston </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 595, 609, 610, fn. 15 [230 Cal.Rptr. 141, 724 P.2d 1166].) Defendant was offered the opportunity to place a telephone call in part so that, if he wished, he could contact an attorney. He cites no authority to suggest that such a situation amounts to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201ccritical stage\u201d which triggers his right to counsel under the state Constitution. It would be unreasonable to hold that such an event amounts to a critical stage of the proceedings, and it would be anomalous to hold a defendant may not place such a call without waiving counsel\u2019s presence or having an attorney present.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">3. Self-incrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Defendant claims the tape recording violated his right against self-incrimination. His statements, however, were not the result of custodial interrogation or its equivalent. Defendant was not questioned by the police; he was simply allowed to make a telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Defendant also asserts Officer Shave illegally \u201ceavesdropped\u201d on his conversation. As noted above, however, Shave was standing in plain view near defendant, and could obviously overhear defendant\u2019s side of the conversation. By speaking in Thai, defendant showed he realized Shave could hear what he said, but hoped that the officer could not understand Thai. By tape recording the conversation, Shave accomplished nothing more than would have been achieved by stationing an officer fluent in Thai at the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">A similar situation arose in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bazaure </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 21, 34 [44 Cal.Rptr. 831], in which two defendants suspected of murder held a conversation in Spanish, unaware that nearby officers were fluent in that language. In rejecting a claimed violation of their right to privacy, the Court of Appeal held: \u201cNeither [defendant] nor any of the other parties were induced to talk. Possibly feeling a false sense of security because they spoke in a foreign tongue, the two defendants talked freely and attempted to concoct a story. No element of trickery by the officers was involved. Defendants sought to trick the officers. . . . The officers did not set out to outwit defendants. Defendants outsmarted themselves. When the officers listened to the conversations no right of privacy was invaded.\u201d (235 Cal.App.2d at p. 34.) As the court held here, defendant was not reasonably entitled to believe that the officer could not also understand Thai.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">4. Use of the Telephone Number</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Defendant also asserts the police were not entitled to obtain and use the telephone number that defendant called. Because defendant failed to raise this objection below, the claim is not properly before us. \u201c \u2018[T]he general rule [is] that questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Privitera </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 697, 710 [153 Cal.Rptr. 431, 591 P.2d 919, 5 A.L.R.4th 178].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In any event, defendant\u2019s claim is meritless because public safety concerns justified the police conduct here.  A defendant might use his telephone call to instruct another to kill or threaten a witness, to destroy evidence, or to otherwise hamper a police investigation. In view of these considerations, the police may require a defendant first to disclose the telephone number of the person to whom the call is being placed, and may then place the call and (consistently with \u00a7 851.5, subd. (b)(1)), overtly listen to the defendant\u2019s side of any non-attorney-client conversation without invading his right to privacy and without implicating his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">B. <em>Seizure of Defendant\u2019s Wallet</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">As noted above, when Officer Upstill arrived at the Sears store, he asked defendant for his name, and its spelling. Defendant replied there was a card in his wallet which bore his name and that it would be simpler if Upstill copied it from that card. Defendant then tried to extract his wallet from his back pocket. By this time, however, defendant\u2019s hands had been handcuffed together behind his back, making it difficult for him to remove his wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Upstill helped remove the wallet, and opened it in front of defendant. Defendant did not object. Upstill then flipped through the cards, looking for the one that bore defendant\u2019s name. He noticed various department store cards, all bearing the name Wattanapom and a bank card in the name of an unknown third person. When Upstill reached the card bearing defendant\u2019s name, defendant pointed it out to him. Upstill then kept the wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Defendant moved to suppress the wallet and the credit cards discovered therein, claiming the seizure of his wallet constituted an unlawful search incident to arrest and that, even assuming defendant had consented to the search, Upstill exceeded the scope of the consent. The People asserted there was no search, but if there was a search it was consensual, and that in any event the contents of the wallet would have been inevitably discovered in the course of a booking search of defendant. The court found defendant had consented to Officer Upstill\u2019s act.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">\u201cOur role in reviewing the resolution of this issue is limited. The question of the voluntariness of the consent is to be determined in the first instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>by the trier of fact; and in that stage of the process, \u2018The power to judge credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, weigh evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court. On appeal all presumptions favor proper exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings\u2014 whether express or implied\u2014must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 99, 107 [137 Cal.Rptr. 447, 561 P.2d 1135].)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, substantial evidence does support the court\u2019s finding. The record shows Upstill simply followed defendant\u2019s suggestion that he copy defendant\u2019s name from a card contained in his wallet. At no time did defendant object to Upstill\u2019s act; on the contrary, defendant pointed out the card for Upstill when he got to it. If defendant did not intend Upstill to look through his wallet he had ample opportunity to make that known. We believe the record sufficiently supports the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We also believe Upstill stayed within the scope of defendant\u2019s consent. The record discloses that Upstill. came across the cards bearing the name Wattanapom before he reached the card bearing defendant\u2019s name. It would be anomalous to find that, had Upstill opened the wallet and found the card with defendant\u2019s name first, the search would have been within the scope of consent, but that because Upstill first noticed cards bearing the name Wattanapom, the search exceeded the scope of the consent. The officer was not required to close his eyes to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In any event, the contents of the wallet would inevitably have been discovered. The booking search performed by the Garden Grove Police Department would have included defendant\u2019s wallet had Upstill not previously itemized its contents. Defendant observes that accelerated booking searches are no longer allowed. (See <em>Pepple </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 728 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278].) At the time of the search here, however, they were permissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Longwill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 943, 948 [123 Cal.Rptr. 297, 538 P.2d 753, overruled in Laiwa.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Finally, even assuming the evidence should have been suppressed, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) In light of the other incriminating evidence in this case, the absence of the evidence that defendant was carrying three additional credit cards with him bearing the Wattanapom name would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">C. <em>Discovery of the Car</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">As noted above, Upstill discovered the existence and location of defendant\u2019s car by informing him that, if he wished to lock his vehicle or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>take anything out of it, he should make the request before he was transported to the police station. Defendant directed Upstill to his car and, on defendant\u2019s request, Upstill retrieved a photograph from it. The vehicle was impounded and later searched pursuant to a warrant. The search uncovered a gold watch identified as belonging to Pat, sales slips bearing the name Wattanapom, and dried blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Defendant argued below that Upstill\u2019s remark was designed to elicit an incriminating response and thus violated his right to remain silent. The People insisted that no interrogation took place, and claimed Upstill was \u201cmerely providing [defendant] a chance to secure his automobile and any valuables which might be contained therein.\u201d The court concluded defendant voluntarily revealed the location of his car to the police by requesting that a photograph be retrieved from it. In so ruling, the court explained that it \u201cspecifically [found] the officer\u2019s conduct was not a subterfuge designed to elicit statements from the defendant and further [found] the defendant\u2019s statements [were] freely, voluntarily and spontaneously made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We see no reason to disagree with the court\u2019s determination. First, the record discloses that Upstill did not know defendant owned a car, but that he made the statement to defendant only because it was his policy to extend this offer to anyone arrested in a shopping mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In addition, Upstill\u2019s statement warned defendant of a legitimate concern: Defendant\u2019s car, if he had one, would be left unattended for some time, and if the car was unlocked, or if it contained items of value which defendant did not want exposed to the risk of theft, defendant should make his request before he was booked at the police station and it became more difficult to locate and secure the car. We therefore conclude the court did not err in admitting the evidence discovered during the search of defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">D. <em>Drawing of the Blood Sample</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The blood sample drawn from defendant was found to be consistent with six of the blood stains discovered at the murder scene. Defendant claims the sample was drawn in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The People assert the sample was drawn and analyzed for the presence of drugs or alcohol in the event defendant made any statements, and that it was unnecessary that a warrant first be obtained before the sample was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 284 [145 Cal.Rptr. 876, 578 F.2d 123], we held, \u201c[a] warrantless invasion of the body must be incident to a valid arrest [citation] and may occur only under a limited range of exigent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>circumstances. These circumstances include the need to prevent loss or destruction of evidence, or the existence of a medical emergency. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 291-292.) Although \u201cblood tests for alcohol, performed under medical conditions, have been consistently upheld as routine, minor, and highly reliable\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 292), the decision to draw a blood sample \u201cmust be founded on a \u2018clear indication\u2019 that such evidence will be found.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Here, the purported justification for the invasion of defendant\u2019s body was to test for the existence of drugs or alcohol <em>in light of the possibility that defendant might make some statements. </em>The police observed no indication that defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, nor did they have reason to suspect he might decide to talk. We therefore disagree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the blood was lawfully drawn. Nonetheless, we find the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">At the time the blood was drawn, defendant was the prime suspect in the Pantai Market double murder. A blood sample would inevitably have been drawn and would have disclosed the identical information used against him at trial. As the People observe, even had the court ruled the blood sample unlawfully drawn, it could have later ordered a new blood sample to be drawn. Defendant is thus unable to demonstrate prejudice; the blood sample would have provided the same information whether drawn at the station or after the suppression hearing. Hence, the court\u2019s error in finding the blood lawfully drawn was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at p. 711].)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">E. <em>Authorization for Nighttime Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">When the police sought search warrants for defendant\u2019s residence and vehicle, they also requested authorization for nighttime service. Detective McLean telephoned an Orange County Superior Court judge about 3:15 a.m. to obtain the warrant and informed him: \u201cI request that nighttime service of this warrant be granted. The stolen property is easily transported and/or sold. [Defendant] was allowed to make the one phone call he requested. He made that call to a location in Cerritos. He spoke to the answering party in Thai only. I believe he did this to prevent us from overhearing instructions to dispose of whatever contraband or evidence is still in his residence.\u201d The judge authorized nighttime service for the residence but not for the vehicle. The warrant for the residence was executed around 5 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Defendant attacks the nighttime service authorization on two grounds. First, he claims McLean purposely omitted material facts when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>failed to inform the judge that defendant\u2019s residence was under police surveillance and that police observed no movement within the house. Second, he claims his conversation in Thai was insufficient to support McLean\u2019s belief that he was attempting to dispose of the stolen property. We find both contentions meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">First, we reject the premise that the omissions were \u201cmaterial.\u201d We have held that \u201cfacts are \u2018material\u2019 and hence must be disclosed if their omission would make the affidavit <em>substantially </em>misleading.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurland </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 376, 385 [168 Cal.Rptr. 667, 618 P.2d 213], italics in original.) The failure to inform the judge that the residence was under police surveillance did not render McLean\u2019s information substantially misleading. Nor do we find it substantially misleading that McLean failed to inform the judge that no movement within the residence had been observed: The fact that the officers could not <em>see </em>any movement did not mean that in fact no one was inside. The police were not required to wait until their fears were realized before seeking authorization for nighttime service. We therefore believe the omissions did not render the affidavit substantially misleading and that the judge would not have refused nighttime authorization had he known these additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Second, we find McLean\u2019s belief that defendant was attempting to dispose of incriminating evidence to be a reasonable and logical inference from defendant\u2019s conduct. Whether the judge should have authorized nighttime service on the basis of this belief is a question left to his sound discretion. (\u00a7 1533.) Under the facts here, we do not find he abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We therefore agree with the court\u2019s finding that the information given the judge provided a sufficient basis for authorizing nighttime service. Accordingly, we find no error in the admission of the evidence seized from defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">F. <em>Juror Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Six days after the jury returned its guilt verdict, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention a matter of \u201cpotential juror misconduct.\u201d The information provided was sketchy. An attorney had contacted defense counsel and informed him that one of his clients, a Mrs. Meyers, had called to tell him that her daughter was a juror in the Siripongs case and that her daughter wanted to know what it meant when the defense rested. Defense counsel informed the court that he had not yet investigated, but that he suspected Juror Pitts was the juror in question. Counsel also told the court, \u201cI\u2019m in no position at this time to make a motion for mistrial.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>requested that inquiry be made of the suspected juror to determine the nature of any contact concerning the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The court replied that it did not want to interview the wrong person. It asked defense counsel whether the attorney would be available to appear before the court on February 22; counsel said yes. The court indicated that Juror Pitts would be questioned after the attorney convinced the court his information concerned both the correct case and the correct juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On February 22, the attorney failed to appear. Defense counsel then suggested \u201cthat an in camera hearing take place between the court and [Juror] Pitts to determine whether or not any misconduct of any kind has occurred and to determine the nature of the communication . . . [between] [Juror] Pitts and Mrs. Meyers, [fl] The proceedings we ask for, I think, are of a commonsense nature. They certainly would under most circumstances reveal whether or not a communication took place that involved this trial.\u201d In addition, defendant requested a continuance until he could secure the missing attorney\u2019s presence. The People agreed that \u201c[o]ut of caution,\u201d an inquiry should take place. The court then ruled that it would conduct a hearing outside the presence of counsel and the jury, as requested, but it denied defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, without prejudice to a second motion if the facts warranted a continuance. No objection was made to the court\u2019s stated in camera procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">At the in camera hearing, Juror Pitts revealed that she had asked her mother, \u201cWhat happens when the [defense counsel\u2019s] table is cleared off?\u201d\u2014an apparent reference to the defense resting its case. The juror\u2019s mother relayed the question to her own lawyer, and he eventually responded that it probably meant the case was almost finished. The juror\u2019s mother then relayed that message to Juror Pitts. When questioned further, the juror maintained the exchange had not influenced her determination of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and she promised to strictly abide by the court\u2019s admonitions for the rest of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Defendant now complains that the in camera hearing was inadequate. He claims the procedure violated his rights to due process and to be present at all critical stages of trial, as well as his right to assistance of counsel. He insists that on these facts, Juror Pitts committed \u201cmisconduct\u201d amounting to reversible error, and that he should have been allowed to question her.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The short answer to these procedural claims is that defendant got what he asked for\u2014an in camera hearing \u201cbetween the court and [Juror] Pitts\u201d\u2014 and hence he waived any objection to the procedure used. We also note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>an identical procedure was used, with apparent approval, in a similar situation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 504, 511-512 [218 P.2d 981].</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Nor can we agree with defendant\u2019s assertions of procedural error. Defendant cites nothing to convince us that the in camera procedure violated his due process rights, nor does he convince us that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance on the facts before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We have recently reiterated the general rule that \u201cthe accused is not entitled to be personally present during proceedings which bear no reasonable, substantial relation to his opportunity to defend the charges against him, and \u2018[t]he burden is upon the defendant to demonstrate that his absence prejudiced his case or denied him a fair and impartial trial.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 573-574 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776].) Although defendant insists his presence might have served \u201cas a vivid and perceptible reminder to juror Pitts that [defendant\u2019s] life and liberty depended upon the deliberations of twelve impartial jurors, basing their verdicts on the evidence alone,\u201d he fails to recognize that the central issues were whether the juror communicated with her mother and, if so, whether the communication constituted misconduct. As explained below, both of these questions were adequately addressed and resolved by the court. The in camera hearing did not impair defendant\u2019s ability to \u201cdefend the charges against him\u201d; nor did his absence render the trial unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Nor does defendant persuade us that the procedure employed violated his right to assistance of counsel. As the People concede, the general rule forbids ex parte communications between a court and jurors. This rule protects, among other things, a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 82, 88 [206 Cal.Rptr. 468].) That purpose, however, does not appear to be implicated here. Defendant, through his counsel, suggested and authorized the communication, and even set the agenda for the proceeding. Furthermore, the inquiry was reported and transcripts were provided to the defense. Had defendant been disturbed about the nature and scope of the meeting he could have objected in a motion for a new trial. His failure to do so suggests this authorized communication between the juror and the court was consistent with counsel\u2019s expectations, and certainly not prejudicial. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim that the procedure used violated his right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Finally, even assuming that any of defendant\u2019s procedural claims has merit, or assuming the court erred in concluding the juror\u2019s action did not amount to \u201cmisconduct,\u201d we perceive no prejudicial error. The transcript of the in camera hearing discloses that the juror asked her mother only what it meant when defense counsel\u2019s table is \u201cclean\u201d or \u201ccleared off.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The answer given through the juror\u2019s mother\u2019s attorney was that the case was probably almost completed. The communication dealt with nothing substantive and, as the juror stated to the court, did not affect her decision on the verdict. At most, it merely confirmed her belief that the trial was almost at an end. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 504, 511-512 [in camera discussion between judge and juror concerning definition of a hung jury could not have prejudiced defendant and therefore did not require reversal]; <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain </em>(1983) 464 U.S. 114, 121 [78 L.Ed.2d 267, 275, 104 S.Ct. 453] [ex parte communication between judge and juror concerning association with a violent crime and with the Black Panthers \u201cwas innocuous\u201d and therefore did not affect juror\u2019s impartiality].) Thus, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at p. 711]; <em>Rushen, supra, </em>464 U.S. at pp. 117-121 [78 L.Ed.2d at pp. 272-275].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">G. <em>Playing of the Tape Recording</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Before the close of their case-in-chief, the People sought to admit the tape recording made of defendant\u2019s telephone conversation, as well as a translated transcript of the recording. They proposed to admit the tape to convey to the jury the commanding tone of defendant\u2019s voice, and wished to admit the transcript to establish that defendant requested Peung and Noon to remove incriminating evidence from his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Defendant objected to admission of the tape, claiming it contained too many pauses, deletions, and gaps to make \u201cthe content of the tape as a whole\u201d admissible. He urged the court to find that, in light of the gaps and unintelligible section, the probative value of the tape was outweighed by its prejudicial effect and therefore should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The court was provided with two transcripts of the tape: one translated by the court interpreter and one translated by defendant\u2019s interpreter. There were insignificant differences between the two transcripts. Both interpretations clearly established that defendant was instructing his listeners to go to his house immediately and retrieve the sugar jar on the stove, the camera case, something from a Buddha, the Christmas gifts and the sales receipts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>from the box in his bedroom. He also instructed them to find the keys to his car and retrieve his car, and to get some money from Chusit.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The court ruled the tape admissible, stating: \u201cThe court finds that the conversation that the defendant conducted on the phone is highly relevant and indeed a valuable piece of evidence for the prosecution because it\u2019s obvious from the transcript [both the one prepared by the court interpreter and the one prepared by defendant\u2019s interpreter], that the defendant was, in fact, attempting to conceal fruits of his crime and the means he used to [commit] the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A finding as to admissibility of evidence under Evidence Code section 352 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed unless it manifestly constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 123, 127 [169 Cal.Rptr. 149].) As defendant concedes, a tape recording may be admissible even if substantial portions of it are unintelligible. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 126.) Here, in spite of unintelligible portions, the tape clearly demonstrated defendant\u2019s efforts to remove incriminating evidence from his home. Comprehensive transcripts of the tape manifesting his attempt to destroy relevant evidence were made by both interpreters. Under these facts, we cannot find an abuse of discretion in admitting the tape recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Nor do we share defendant\u2019s concern that the unintelligible portions of the tape left the jury to speculate that the tapes contained \u201cfurther evidence of culpability.\u201d The portions of the tape that were understandable established defendant\u2019s attempt to have <em>every </em>incriminating piece of evidence removed from his residence. We decline to indulge in speculation as to what \u201cfurther evidence of culpability\u201d the jury could have possibly imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">H. <em>Admission of Defendant's Statements to Officer Upstill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">After Upstill obtained from defendant\u2019s wallet the card bearing defendant\u2019s name, the officer began an inventory of the wallet\u2019s contents. He sat in a chair next to defendant, placed a notebook on his lap, and went through the five credit cards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He explained, \u201cas I was taking the cards I was writing them down so I could inventory them [and] later I could put them [in my] . . . report . . . .\u201d When Upstill reached a First Interstate Bank card bearing the name Behrooz Nikkou, defendant spontaneously denied he had stolen the card, and claimed it had come in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Defense counsel sought to exclude this statement on the ground that it was obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. The court, however, \u201cspecifically [found] the officer\u2019s conduct was not a subterfuge designed to elicit statements from the defendant and further [found] the defendant\u2019s statements [were] freely, voluntarily and spontaneously made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Defendant renews his contention on appeal. He views Upstill\u2019s conduct as \u201c[a] tactic of confronting [defendant] with evidence against him\u201d and claims, \u201cthe only possible purpose in showing [defendant] the card with someone else\u2019s name on it was to see if he would respond.\u201d There is nothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s interpretation of the events. Indeed, the record indicates that Upstill did not show defendant the credit cards as he was conducting his inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201c \u2018[T]he trial court\u2019s ruling on a <em>Miranda </em>[v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436] issue may not be set aside by us unless it is <em>\u201cpalpably </em>erroneous.\u201d A ruling palpably erroneous is one lacking support of substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 527 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549], italics added in <em>Eric </em>J) We believe the record demonstrates that Upstill\u2019s conduct was neither a custodial interrogation nor its functional equivalent, and that defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary. The record supports the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In any event, any error was clearly harmless. <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24.) As set out above, there was ample additional evidence, apart from his brief statement to Upstill, proving defendant had murdered Pat and Quach and stolen Pat\u2019s jewelry and credit.cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">I. <em>References to Defendant\u2019s Failure to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Defendant asserts the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to testify. We have examined the record, especially the three pages cited by counsel, and have found no improper comment. Accordingly, we find the claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">III. Special Circumstances Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Defendant makes two related claims of error. First, he asserts that by instructing the jury pursuant to a modified version of CALJIC No. 2.50 on the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence presented during the guilt trial, the jury was somehow \u201cmisdirected ... on the crucial issues of intent to kill.\u201d Second, he claims that, despite its express special finding on that point, the jury did not actually find he intentionally killed Pat and Quach. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Defendant\u2019s premise\u2014that a jury finding of intent to kill was required in this case <em>(Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862])\u2014is no longer valid. As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1138-1148 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], intervening decisions of the United States Supreme Court led us to reconsider and overrule <em>Carlos. </em>Therefore, even assuming, as defendant insists, the jury was for some reason misdirected on its \u201cintent to kill\u201d inquiry, the special circumstance findings are not thereby affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">IV. Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">A. <em>Defendant's Criminal Record From Thailand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Defendant claims the court erred in refusing to make a preliminary ruling excluding evidence concerning his criminal record in Thailand. He maintains, \u201cthe trial court ruled that if [defendant] called his mother and some of his close friends as witnesses in mitigation <em>and if the testimony of these witnesses was not restricted to the issue of whether or not </em>[defendant] <em>had a propensity for violence, </em>then the court would not \u2018unduly restrict\u2019 the prosecution from asking witnesses if they were aware that [defendant] had been convicted of a felony [in Thailand].\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant asserts this perceived limitation on his right to present evidence without impeachment resulted in his counsel\u2019s decision not to call to the stand some of his planned witnesses in mitigation. As a consequence, defendant claims, he suffered prejudicial error. Our review of the record reveals that defendant has mischaracterized the court\u2019s ruling, and that in any event no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The People informed the court that they had evidence of two prior \u201crobbery\u201d convictions that defendant suffered in Thailand (one of which resulted in a two-and-one-half year prison term), and that they wished to use this information to cross-examine defense witnesses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The foundation for the People\u2019s information was a certified copy of defendant\u2019s Thai \u201crap sheet.\u201d Defense counsel requested a preliminary ruling on the admissibility of the priors. The court postponed ruling on the issue until the court interpreter confirmed that the Thai convictions involved force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At the next hearing, the People informed the court that Bangkok police had authenticated the rap sheet as belonging to defendant. The literal translation of the offenses defendant committed read, in pertinent part, \u201can offense involving dishonesty, the taking away of the property of another person or persons.\u201d Because the definition did not contain the element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>force or fear, the court refused to allow the prosecution to inquire into defendant\u2019s Thai convictions to rebut testimony that defendant was not violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">At the same time, however, the court refused to give a preliminary ruling as to whether the People would be allowed to inquire into the convictions if the defense introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s honesty and veracity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defense counsel, still unsatisfied, summed up his request as follows: \u201cI want the testimony of my witnesses . . . not to be attacked or to be circumvented by the prosecution\u2019s asking of questions relating to the character of [defendant] as to past misconduct or evidence of misdeeds.\u201d The court reiterated, \u201cThe court fails to, or chooses not to, give you a preliminary ruling until I hear the evidence. I\u2019ve already given you one commitment that the court feels is in accordance with the law; I\u2019ve precluded the prosecution from going into the area of force and violence. <em>That\u2019s as far as the court will go on the issue.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the court did not restrict the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses to his propensity for nonviolence but instead restricted the <em>prosecution </em>from inquiring into defendant\u2019s criminal record to show defendant was violent. The court simply refused to rule blindly on whether it would permit the prosecution to inquire of defendant\u2019s witnesses, \u201cHave you heard that defendant has suffered a conviction for a crime involving dishonesty?\u201d without first knowing the extent of the evidence brought out on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling. Moreover, even assuming the ruling could be seen as tantamount to a preliminary determination to allow impeachment limited to the issue of truthfulness or veracity, we perceive no error.  It is well established that, \u201c[w]hen a defense witness, other than the defendant himself, has testified to the reputation of the accused, the prosecution may inquire of the witness whether he has heard of acts or conduct by the defendant inconsistent with the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wagner </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 612, 619 [119 Cal.Rptr. 457, 532 P.2d 105].) So long as the People have a good faith belief that the acts or conduct about which they wish to inquire actually took place, they may so inquire. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Clearly the authenticated rap sheet formed a sufficient basis to support such a good faith belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim that cross-examination under Evidence Code section 1102 is impermissible at the penalty phase whenever character testimony is introduced in mitigation rather than to show conformity with a particular character trait. A defendant has no right to mislead the jury through one-sided character testimony during either the guilt or penalty trial. We do not believe that defendant was entitled to elicit testimony suggesting that he was honest, and at the same time to preclude the People from introducing contrary evidence. Defendant provides us with no authority for his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Defendant also asserts he should have been allowed to introduce testimony to the effect that he was \u201ca devout Buddhist and a good son\u201d without fearing inquiry into his Thai convictions. Defendant was in no way prohibited or restricted from introducing evidence that he was a \u201cgood son.\u201d As long as he did not introduce testimony showing that one of the characteristics of a \u201cdevout Buddhist\u201d was truth or honesty, he was free to introduce this evidence as well without fear of impeachment by the Thai priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We also fail to see how defendant was prejudiced. As noted, defendant\u2019s mother could have testified that defendant was a \u201cgood son\u201d without opening the door to inquiry into his Thai convictions, unless she further stated that he was truthful or honest. Moreover, defendant <em>did </em>introduce evidence that he was \u201ca devout Buddhist.\u201d During the guilt phase, defendant elicited from prosecution witnesses that he had been a Buddhist monk in Thailand and that he continued to pray to Buddha every day. Defense counsel reminded the jury of these facts during closing argument at the penalty trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">B. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">During the penalty trial, defendant moved for a mistrial on the basis of alleged prosecutorial intimidation of defense witnesses. He sought to call a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>witness to support the claim. The court requested an offer of proof, and defense counsel told the court that defendant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s father would testify that during a recent discussion in the hallway, \u201cthe District Attorney may have stated to the [defense] witnesses, that is, Bea and Noon, that they know more than they are telling,\u201d and that this was \u201can implied threat to the two witnesses . . . .\u201d The court responded that it \u201cbelieve[d] they know more than they are telling, too,. . .\u201d and denied both the motion to call the witness and the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We agree with the court that the statement, \u201cyou know more than you are telling\u201d does not constitute intimidation. The cases finding prosecutorial intimidation uniformly contain actual threats; here, there was no threat. Moreover, such assumed misconduct does not warrant reversal unless the defendant has shown prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 214 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].) Here, there is no evidence that the witnesses refused to testify. In fact, immediately after the court denied this motion for mistrial, defense counsel asked to be allowed to put on Noon and Bea free from possible cross-examination concerning defendant\u2019s misdeeds and past conduct. It was only when the court denied this second motion, discussed <em>ante, </em>pages 576-579, that defense counsel opted not to present further testimony. We therefore fail to see any possible prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">C. <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Reference to the Victims\u2019 Families</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">During closing argument, the prosecutor stated; \u201cNow you saw the wife of the deceased Vietnamese man, and you heard her testify and you heard her talk about her family. In considering circumstances of the crime, I don\u2019t think we have to be blinded by the impact of these types of horrendous offenses on those who are left behind. It is not just the enormity of taking one\u2019s life that is involved, but it is the impact that is left on those who survive, the near and dear. And I think that is a factor that certainly at least you might give some thought ifo, both as far as the Wattanapom family is concerned and as far as the Quach family is concerned, [fl] Victims have rights to be recognized and to be listened to and to be addressed by jurors, and jurors must have the courage, if the evidence warrants it, to impose a death penalty if that\u2019s what the law is and that\u2019s what the evidence directs. And we are satisfied that in our system that concept does prevail, [fl] The circumstances of this crime are enormously aggravating . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">At this point defendant moved for a mistrial, claiming the prosecution was \u201cappealing to the prejudices and the biases of this jury by making mention of the families.\u201d The court denied the motion, but instructed the prosecutor not to refer to the families further.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>We recently reviewed this issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250], in which the prosecutor made a very similar argument to the jury. We noted that the United States Supreme Court has held formal <em>evidence </em>on the impact of a crime on the victim\u2019s family to be inadmissible and improper <em>(Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496, 502-509 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 448-452, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 2532-2536]), but that mere <em>argument, without instructions </em>on that subject, may not be prohibited by <em>Booth. </em>(43 Cal.3d at p. 771; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 112-113 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127] <em>[Booth </em>is \u201cpatently distinguishable\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Here, as in <em>Ghent </em>and <em>Miranda, </em>we believe <em>Booth </em>is distinguishable. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were \u201cbrief and mild\u201d; no evidence was introduced by the prosecution, or highlighted at closing argument, to substantiate the impact of the crimes on the victims\u2019 families; and the jury was not instructed to consider the impact of the crimes on the victims\u2019 families in reaching its penalty decision. We perceive no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">D. <em>Instructions on Mitigating Evidence (former CALJIC No. 8.84.1) and Sentencing Discretion (former CALJIC No. 8.84.2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">1. Former CALJIC No. 8.84.1\u2014Factor (k)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The jury was instructed in the terms of former CALJIC No. 8.84.1, factor (k) on the scope of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 878, fn. 10 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813].) As we have held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 544 [220 Cal.Rptr. 637, 709 P.2d 440], footnote 17, we will review all <em>pre-Easley </em>cases to determine whether, on the basis of the whole record, the jury was adequately informed of its duty to consider all of the defendant\u2019s relevant mitigating evidence, whether or not it related to the capital offense. Having done so here, we conclude there was no \u201cfactor (k)\u201d error.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">First, the prosecutor said nothing to suggest the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence was improperly limited by the former instruction. To the contrary, he told the jury to consider \u201call\u201d of the evidence\u2014including defendant\u2019s penalty phase evidence of \u201cnonviolence\u201d\u2014 \u201cfor what it is and give it the weight which you think it is due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Defense counsel argued similarly. He told the jury it was to view defendant as \u201ca [whole] person, to consider his background and capabilities, and the contributions he might be able to make to society if allowed to live,\u201d and that \u201cthese are matters that you may consider as a mitigating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Finally, the court\u2019s instructions reinforced this message. The court told the jury it could \u201cconsider pity, sympathy, and mercy for the defendant in deciding the appropriate penalty.\u201d It further instructed, \u201c[the] testimony showing defendant\u2019s present capabilities and his good conduct . . . are matters that you may consider as a mitigating factor\u201d and \u201cyou should not limit your consideration of mitigating circumstances to the specific factors^] You may also consider any other circumstances relating to the case or to the defendant, ... as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Viewing the record as a whole, we find the jury was adequately instructed and that no factor (k) error occurred.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">2. Former CALJIC No. <em>8.84.2\u2014Brown</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The jury was also instructed in the unadorned language of former CALJIC No. 8.84.2. As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512, 536-544, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1276-1277 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115], this instruction might under certain circumstances tend to mislead a reasonable jury into believing (i) its sentencing responsibility is to be discharged by a mere \u201ccounting\u201d of aggravating and mitigating factors, or (ii) that it was permitted to arrive at its sentencing decision without having to exercise its moral discretion and decide whether death is the <em>appropriate </em>penalty for this offense and offender. <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 1276-1277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Neither counsel misled the jury on the first aspect of <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512. The prosecutor told the jury, \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t count up the number of aggravating or mitigating factors; the weight that you give to a particular factor is your own determination, you know, how important or how much weight a particular factor is entitled to. And it is the ultimate weighing process that we are concerned with.\u201d Similarly, defense counsel told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>jury to weigh, not count, and that any one \u201cmitigating factor standing alone is sufficient to support a decision that life without possibility of parole is the preferred and appropriate punishment in this case.\u201d Finally, the court illuminated the weighing process by twice instructing, \u201c[a]ny [mitigating factor] may be sufficient, standing alone, to support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\u201d Further, the court instructed, \u201c[i]t is the combined weight of the aggravating circumstances, measured against the combined weight of the mitigating circumstances which is determinative. You are not to merely count up the number of circumstances on either side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">As to the second consideration, we note the prosecutor told the jury its job was to decide \u201cwhich of two penalties <em>should </em>be imposed.\u201d (Italics added.) He stated, \u201cyou are called upon to make that determination [i.e., whether \u201cthe appropriate penalty is death\u201d] by weighing the factors of aggravation and mitigation as you see them to exist, based on the evidence in the case\u201d and \u201c[y]ou are to use discretion in making such an important and ultimate decision.\u201d Finally, he told the jury it would be asked to \u201cmake a finding as to which you deem the appropriate penalty to be[,] based on the evidence,\u201d and concluded by stating, \u201c[i]f the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, <em>you're asked </em>to return a verdict of death.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s comments followed this approach. For example, he emphasized that each individual juror was personally responsible for the jury\u2019s decision, and that it was up to the jury, and the jury alone, to make the \u201cimportant and ultimate decision\u201d about whether defendant should live or die.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Finally, the court\u2019s special instructions echoed this proper theme. In addition to the above-quoted instructions, the jury was told to consider defendant\u2019s sympathetic and mitigating evidence \u201cin deciding the appropriate penalty.\u201d The court also instructed: \u201cYou are not to consider only what a person may deserve to receive as a punishment, because it can be argued that anyone who is responsible for another\u2019s death may be said to deserve to die. Rather, you are to use discretion in making such an important and ultimate decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">On this record, we cannot imagine that a reasonable jury would have been misled about its moral discretion and sole responsibility to decide whether death is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">E. <em>Argument Contrary to Davenport</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Defendant claims that at one point in his argument the prosecutor asserted that the fact that defendant was <em>not </em>an accomplice to the crime, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>was instead the principal actor, constituted an aggravating factor. Addressing sentencing factor (j) (\u00a7 190.3, factor (j)), the prosecutor said, \u201chis participation in the commission of this offense was not relatively minor at all. Clearly a factor of enormous aggravation based on the evidence.\u201d As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 289, 290 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861], the absence of a mitigating factor may not be considered as an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Reversal is not warranted, however. The prosecutor\u2019s comment was brief, and referred to only one of the various factors. Moreover, in context, the prosecutor\u2019s argument might reasonably have been interpreted as merely emphasizing the nonexistence of a mitigating factor, and as returning the jury\u2019s attention to factor (a) (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)), the circumstances of the crime. In any event, we note that defense counsel responded in his argument that the absence of a mitigating factor was a neutral consideration which did not amount to aggravation. In addition, the court delivered the standard instruction telling the jury to consider the various factors only \u201cif applicable,\u201d and as noted above, the record shows the jury was not misled about its consideration of mitigating evidence and its exercise of sentencing discretion. On these facts, we conclude there is no reasonable possibility the prosecutor\u2019s argument affected the jury\u2019s sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">F. <em>\u201cDouble </em>Counting\u201d <em>of Former Section 190.3, factors (a) and (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 504-506 [244 Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803], we held the jury should not be told that the \u201ccircumstances of the present crime\u201d can be considered as aggravating factors under both factors (a) (which establishes as a sentencing factor \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found true . . .\u201d) <em>and </em>(b) (which establishes as a sentencing factor \u201cthe presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence\u201d). (\u00a7 190.3, factors (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Here, the prosecutor did not tell the jury to consider the circumstances of the capital crime under both factors (a) <em>and </em>(b).  Defendant, however, suggests the court had a sua sponte duty to tell the jury that it should not, on its own, consider the facts of the present crime as aggravating factors under both factors. We cannot agree such an instruction was required; in the absence of misleading prosecutorial argument to the contrary, and in view of the instruction as a whole, we believe a reasonable jury would have interpreted factor (b) as encompassing only violent criminal activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>other </em>than the capital offense. <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 105-106.) Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">G. <em>\u201cSpillover </em>\u201d <em>Effect From Asserted Guilt Phase Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Defendant repeats his claim that various evidentiary errors occurred at the guilt phase, and alleges such \u201cerrors,\u201d even if deemed harmless at the guilt phase, require reversal of the penalty judgment. As we have explained above, however, for the most part we discern no such error. In any event, in view of the character of the properly admitted evidence tending toward aggravation, we cannot agree that the asserted erroneously introduced evidence\u2014inter alia, the tape recording showing the \u201ccold manner\u201d of defendant\u2019s speech, and the dried blood found in defendant\u2019s car\u2014improperly prejudiced the jury\u2019s sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">H. <em>Constitutional Attack</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Defendant claims it was unconstitutional for the jury to fix his sentence at death without first finding \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances and that death was the appropriate penalty.\u201d We have previously rejected this argument. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-778 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113].) Similarly, we have also rejected his claim that the statute itself (\u00a7 190 et seq.) is unconstitutional. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 777-779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In a related claim, defendant urges he was entitled to an instruction that any fact underlying an aggravating circumstance must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the jury may consider it. A defendant is entitled to a reasonable doubt instruction \u201conly when evidence of other crimes is introduced or referred to as an aggravating factor pursuant to former Penal Code section 190.3, subdivision (b).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 60 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279] [conc. opn. by Broussard, J.]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 730, 790-792.) Here, no such evidence was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">I. <em>Comparative Sentence Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Defendant claims he is entitled to \u201ccomparative sentence review\u201d under the state Constitution. As we have explained in <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>page 1285, and <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 777-779, the claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Defendant also suggests his sentence cannot stand under <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 477-482 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697], and <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 423-429 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921]. As we explained in <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1222, \u201cthere [is no] merit in any assertion that the punishment prescribed for the offense in question [here, burglary-robbery-double murder] is more severe than that prescribed for less serious crimes, or that the death penalty for defendant\u2019s crime is disproportionate to the punishment prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1286.) Nor, in light of the facts of this case (set out <em>ante, </em>pp. 556-563), can defendant credibly assert the punishment imposed is disproportionate to his individual culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">J. <em>Statutory Modification Ruling Under Section 190.4, Subdivision (e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Defendant claims the court committed two errors in its section 190.4, subdivision (e), ruling. First, he asserts the court held an erroneously narrow view of the scope of mitigating evidence under \u201cfactor (k).\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (k).) The record, however, does not support this claim. Although the court did state, \u201cthere are no circumstances which extenuate the gravity of the crime, even though it not be deemed a legal excuse . . . ,\u201d it is clear from the record that the court did fully <em>consider </em>all of defendant\u2019s penalty phase evidence. The court recounted each witness\u2019s testimony (e.g., defendant was cooperative at work and at the jail, and had been a cooperative witness for the police in a prior criminal proceeding), and concluded each piece of testimony was \u201cmitigating, but of minimal value . . .,\u201d or \u201cof very minimal mitigating value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Second, defendant asserts the court committed error under <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pages 289-290, by treating the absence of evidence showing statutory mitigating factors as aggravating factors. Our review of the record, however, reveals that the court merely commented that various presumably mitigating factors were not proved by the evidence. It did not, as did the prosecutor in <em>Davenport, </em>expressly treat the absence of a mitigating factor as an aggravating factor.  We discern no error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>K. <em>Alleged Error at the In Camera Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is that error occurred at a February 17, 1983, ex parte in camera hearing, attended by only defendant, his attorney and the trial judge. Defendant does not tell us what error occurred, nor does he explain why he believes the error was prejudicial. In any event, we have read the transcript of that hearing and fail to find either error or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">L. <em>Enmund Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In view of this record, we believe the jury\u2019s guilt phase verdicts imply a finding that defendant actually killed, or that he intended to kill, his two victims. After reviewing the record, we conclude this implied finding is amply supported and adopt it as our own, thus satisfying the requirement of <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 782, 788-801 [73 L.Ed.2d 1140, 1145-1154, 102 S.Ct. 3368] (see <em>Cabana </em>v. <em>Bullock </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 376, 390-391 [88 L.Ed.2d 704, 719-720, 106 S.Ct. 689, 699-700]).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Panelli, J., Arguelles, J., Eagleson, J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> Noon had lived with defendant from late September until early November. She still had clothes at defendant\u2019s house during December.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> An examination of defendant\u2019s hands after his arrest revealed cuts on six fingers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> The police also found five empty ring boxes; one empty jewelry box; a gold box top to a jewelry box, a small cloth purse for carrying rings; two key rings containing sixteen keys; a piece of paper with numbers written on it as well as some writing in a foreign language; and a department store \u201ccourtesy card\u201d made out in the name of Surachai Wattanapom. A brown vinyl purse was also recovered. The purse contained, among other things, two key rings holding eleven keys, one empty ring purse, and one plastic bag containing a strand of pearls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"> On December 16, purchases were illegally made at two stores by a person using one of the Wattanapoms\u2019 credit cards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> Defendant once lived in Costa Mesa but was no longer living there at the time of his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b594-11\">We reject as meritless defendant\u2019s claim that the telephone number constituted a confession or an admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Defendant claims for the first time on appeal that there is no \u201cshowing that voice tones in the Thai language convey similar emotional affects to voice tones in English,\u201d and hence the tape could not show that defendant spoke in a commanding voice. This assertion, however, was not raised below and is therefore not properly before us. In any event, those who listened to the tape\u2014the court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney\u2014apparently did not share appellate counsel\u2019s concern. We see no reason to speculate that the tape did not, in fact, demonstrate what the prosecution proposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> Defendant\u2019s claim that this constituted an unreasonable search and seizure is addressed, <em>ante, </em>at pages 566-567.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> The evidence was never offered (nor was it admitted in any form) for purposes of establishing an \u201caggravating factor\u201d under section 190.3, factor (b) or (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Thereafter defense counsel explained, \u201cI anticipate that we will not be discussing the aspects of truth and veracity. However, we will be examining into areas such as [defendant\u2019s] religious commitment and concern, the fact that he does practice the Buddhist faith. Is the court then going to interpret the fact that these.\". . religious beliefs are a character trait for truth and veracity?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about the Buddhist religion to be able to make a determination at this point whether that will open the door or not. In the event there is an explanation of what the tenets of Buddhism are, and among those tenets it\u2019s explained to the jury that there is a devout appreciation for the aspect of honesty, that if one of the teachings and one of the things that all Buddhists follow are issues of truth and veracity, if that comes into evidence, then you risk the possibility of the court considering the inquiry [into defendant\u2019s convictions involving dishonesty]. [][] Now I want to make the record absolutely and perfectly clear, because it appears that you have some feeling that I have a desire or intent in my ruling ... to restrict your examination of your witnesses, and that is absolutely not true. You have total, unfettered discretion with absolutely no restrictions by this court on whatever testimony you wish to elicit from all of your witnesses. . . . The only thing that the court has endeavored to do is give you a preliminary ruling, which I have done. The People are preeluded from using the inquiry of the prior charges which appear to the court\u2019s mind at this point to be theft as opposed to a true robbery. They appear to be somewhat lacking in element factor with the necessary aspects of violence and force and fear so that [they] would properly and lawfully allow the People to impeach a witness that has a character appreciation of the defendant\u2019s lack of those categories of conduct. <em>That is the only issue that the court will restrict the prosecution on at this point, for the reason I have no idea how far you will go in your examination.\" </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> In a related argument, defendant claims the court erred in refusing to delete the assertedly \u201cinapplicable\u201d mitigating factors from CALJIC No. 8.84.1. We have rejected this claim in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 776-777 (1977 law), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 104-105 (1978 law).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Similarly, defendant asserts the court erred in denying his request to instruct that his murder conviction \u201cwas not in and of. itself an aggravating circumstance\u201d under CALJIC No. 8.84.1, factor (a). Factor (a) provides that the jury may consider \u201cthe circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true.\u201d The jury was not instructed that it could consider the crime itself in determining the sentence. We agree that the jury could not impose the death penalty simply because defendant had committed a murder. The trial court, however, properly instructed the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 8.84.1, which does not authorize the jury to consider the bare <em>fact </em>that defendant has suffered a murder conviction, but instead the <em>circumstances </em>surrounding it. We therefore fail to see, and decline to speculate on, how the jury could have been misled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\"> Although defendant does not raise the point, the record reveals that the court, immediately <em>after </em>its denial of the statutory modification motion, asked, \u201cis there any legal cause why sentence should not now be pronounced?\u201d The prosecutor informed the court that the victims relatives were in the courtroom, and that they had a \u201cright\u201d to make a statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Thereafter two relatives delivered brief statements in which they expressed their grief, and asked the court to sentence defendant to death. The court listened to the statements, and told the second witness, \u201cthe court is about to commit the defendant to the death sentence. . . .\u201d The court then did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">We discern no reversible error under <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529], <em>Booth </em>emphasizes the potential prejudicial effect of such evidence on a <em>jury, </em>it seems doubtful that the court\u2019s analysis was intended to apply to trial judges, who are presumably capable of retaining objectivity despite exposure to such materials. In any event, on the face of the record it appears that the relatives\u2019 statements did not in any way affect the court\u2019s statutory modification ruling; indeed, the court had denied the motion before it learned there were relatives present to make statements. Nor does it appear the court might have noticed some \u201clegal cause why sentence should not now be pronounced\u201d in the absence of the two statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b614-10\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYo\">I concur in the judgment, but must comment on one questionable aspect of the opinion that may cause prosecutors in future cases to err.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>In his closing penalty argument, the prosecutor discussed the \u201cimpact that is left on those who survive, the near and dear. And I think <em>that is a factor </em>that certainly at least you <em>might give some thought to.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) This was error: impact on survivors is not one of the enumerated factors in Penal Code section 190.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Referring to <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250], the majority attempt to draw a distinction between evidence describing the effect on the surviving family and mere argument on the subject. While in <em>Ghent </em>there was argument and no testimony, this court did not indicate its approval. Indeed, the majority referred to \u201cthe <em>prejudicial effect </em>of the prosecutor\u2019s comments\u201d <em>(id. </em>p.772, italics added), but found it \u201cminimal or nonexistent.\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 113 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127].) There is, of course, a significant difference between affirmative approval of a proceeding and finding it to be error but nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">As I discussed in my concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 586 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776], the Supreme Court case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529], is the latest word on the subject of injecting surviving family concerns in a criminal case. While there was evidence admitted in <em>Booth </em>concerning the devastating effect on family, Justice Powell\u2019s opinion for the court was not limited to the impropriety of evidence as distinguished from argument. He declared: \u201cWe thus reject the contention that the presence or absence of emotional distress of the victim\u2019s family, or the victim\u2019s personal characteristics, are proper sentencing considerations in a capital case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 507 [96 L.Ed.2d 451, 107 S.Ct. at p. 2535].) He continued by warning that the <em>\u201cpresentation of this information by the State </em>can serve no other purpose than <em>to inflame the jury </em>and divert it from deciding the case on relevant evidence concerning the crime and the defendant.\u201d (Italics added.) (Id. at p. 508 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 452, 107 S.Ct. at p. 2536].) He did not distinguish between the state\u2019s presentation by means of evidence or argument. Obviously the purpose would be identical: \u201cto inflame the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">California preceded <em>Booth </em>with <em>People </em>v. <em>Levitt </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 500, 516 [203 Cal.Rptr. 276], in which the court emphasized that the bereavement of the victim\u2019s family could not be considered by the sentencing agency. If consideration is improper, a fortiori argument on the subject is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>In my concurring opinion in <em>Hovey, </em>I expressed the hope that counsel in future cases will be guided by <em>Booth </em>and <em>Levitt </em>and will avoid presentation of such extraneous matters by either testimony or argument.
