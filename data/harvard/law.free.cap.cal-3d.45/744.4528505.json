Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and burglary in the second degree. (\u00a7\u00a7 459-460.) The jury returned special findings that he personally committed the killing, and that the murder was intentional, wilful, deliberate, premeditated, and the result of the commission or attempted commission of the burglary. A special circumstance allegation under the 1978 death penalty law was found true: that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of a burglary. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(vii).) The jury made additional special findings that defendant was the actual killer and had acted with specific intent to kill. The jury fixed the penalty at death; this appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">For the reasons set forth hereafter, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">I. Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">\n<em>Prosecution Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">On Sunday, March 15, 1981, the parents of 19-year-old Steacy McConnell found her beaten unconscious on the floor of her residence in Victor, several feet from the unlocked front door. She had telephoned them that same morning to advise that several people, including Domingo Vasquez, had been threatening her.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">McConnell died a short while later from cerebral hemorrhaging due to 15 to 20 gaping wounds to her head which cracked her skull. The pathologist testified there would have been sounds \u201clike a cracked pot\u201d associated with the blows which fractured the skull, and blood would have splattered in a manner consistent with the blood patterns found on the door jambs next to where she was found. A single contusion on McConnell\u2019s right temple was caused by blunt trauma of lesser force and did not lacerate the skin. It alone would not have caused death and\u2014if it had been the first blow\u2014would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>likely have caused unconsciousness. Numerous defensive bruises and contusions on her arms, hands, legs and feet evidenced a struggle. All wounds were consistent with having been made by the metal dumbbell bar in evidence at trial. McConnell\u2019s stereo components were missing. The lock on the rear bedroom door was broken in. The master bedroom was ransacked; traces of blood were found splattered on the walls, door jambs and a chest of drawers in that room.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Defendant was spending the weekend with Bobby Solanos in Lodi.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both knew Domingo Vasquez, who was acquainted with McConnell. During the week preceding the murder, Vasquez, Solanos and others had \u201cpartied\u201d at McConnell\u2019s house. Vasquez \u201cripped off\u201d a quantity of amphetamine pills from her; the party ended with McConnell throwing Vasquez and his friends out of her house two days prior to the murder. The group subsequently discussed their general dislike of McConnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Solanos, who pled guilty to burglary and received immunity from prosecution for the murder, testified for the People. On Sunday morning, he and defendant drove to Vasquez\u2019s residence in Bolanos\u2019s vintage black Chevy. Vasquez, who was talking on the telephone with McConnell when they arrived, shortly hung up and informed them that McConnell\u2019s parents were picking her up and she would not be home that day. Defendant was short of funds, having unsuccessfully tried to pawn a ring the previous week. Solanos, a seasonal farmworker, was out of work. Vasquez was unemployed. The three men agreed to burglarize McConnell\u2019s residence, steal her stereo and \u201cclean house.\u201d Defendant was wearing a baseball cap with its bill flipped up, Vasquez wore a stocking cap or beanie, Solanos wore a checkered Pendleton shirt-jacket. Vasquez\u2019s girlfriend, Carrie Lynn Rogers, was present; she testified that as the men departed defendant picked up a steel dumbbell bar which he carried out with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Solanos was the \u201cwheel man\u201d and never entered McConnell\u2019s residence; a role confirmed by defendant. En route to Victor, defendant suggested that he alone would approach the house on foot, using the metal bar if needed to force entry. Solanos pulled over a short distance from the house; defendant left his wristwatch behind, concealed the bar under his jacket and walked to the residence. In accord with the plan, Solanos and Vasquez waited several minutes, then drove up and backed into McConnell\u2019s driveway. Vasquez could not find the key to the trunk. As Solanos got out of the vehicle to assist Vasquez, he heard repeated knocking or banging noises coming from within the house. They thought defendant was having trouble with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>stereo. Vasquez entered to assist him. Bolanos remained in the car, still hearing the rhythmic thumping sounds as Vasquez walked up to the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Shortly, defendant and Vasquez emerged from the house carrying stereo components. Defendant alone was covered with blood sprinkled on his face, pants and shoes. Vasquez \u201clooked like he had seen a ghost.\u201d Defendant informed Bolanos he had to \u201ctake out a witness\u201d because she was home. He explained that McConnell heard Vasquez and Bolanos drive up, and that he hit her with the bar when she looked away from him, and continued to hit her approximately 15 more times.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Lucy Flores, McConnell\u2019s neighbor, observed a black Chevy with distinctive, wide taillights back into McConnell\u2019s driveway on the morning of her murder. A dark-complected man wearing a stocking cap got out of the passenger side and tried to unlock the trunk. He appeared to have difficulty with the lock, whereupon the driver, a male of Mexican or Italian ancestry, wearing a brown checkered shirt-jacket, got out of the car and unlocked the trunk. The driver got back in; the passenger walked towards the front of McConnell\u2019s house and met a third man. Flores did not see where the third man had come from. A short while later, she observed the two men hurriedly exiting from the back door of McConnell\u2019s house. The man in the stocking cap was carrying stereo speakers, the third man followed close behind carrying a stereo amplifier. They put the items in the trunk, got in the car and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Bolanos testified that en route to the nearby city of Galt to fence the stereo, defendant, who was wearing gloves, wiped blood off of the metal bar and his shoes. Defendant threw the bar out of the car window as they crossed a bridge over the Mokelumne river (Bolanos later led police to the location on the river bank from which the bar was recovered). The group went to the home of Manuel Vasquez, Domingo\u2019s brother, where defendant changed into a pair of clean pants. One Raul Barron was contacted; he met the three men at the home of Irma Vasquez, Domingo\u2019s sister, and purchased McConnell\u2019s stereo components for $100. The stereo components were recovered and introduced into evidence; Barron testified he paid $100 for them to the man wearing the baseball cap who did most of the talking.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Later that afternoon Bolanos gave his-girlfriend, Teresa Cobarrubio, $15 from his share of the proceeds from the sale of the stereo. Acting scared, he informed her that he, defendant and Vasquez had burglarized McConnell\u2019s residence. The following day Bolanos and Cobarrubio read a newspaper account of McConnell\u2019s murder. Cobarrubio testified that at that point Bolanos related further details of the crime, informing her that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>remained in his car outside of McConnell\u2019s house, and that defendant had exited from the house with blood all over his clothes, stating he had to \u201ctake a witness out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">On Monday, March 16, Vasquez called Bolanos in a panic to advise he had been questioned by police and did not want to \u201ctake the rap\u201d for defendant. Bolanos and defendant went to Vasquez\u2019s house where the three sat in the living room discussing the murder. Carrie Lynn Rogers, Vasquez\u2019s girlfriend (who subsequently married him in jail\u2014and who was a distant cousin to Bolanos) testified that from the kitchen she overheard the men discussing their sortie to McConnell\u2019s house, and heard defendant describe how he had first entered alone and hit McConnell several times with the bar, after which Vasquez had joined him in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">After the meeting, defendant telephoned his girlfriend, Barbara Murillo. Murillo testified that during the conversation defendant informed her he was \u201cin trouble,\u201d relating that he had gotten into an argument with McConnell at her house, become angered and hit her, and that she fell and \u201cwent to sleep,\u201d although he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for her to go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Belmontes fled to Southern California where he was arrested by Ontario police six days after the murder. Blood found on the tongue of one of his shoes was tested and found to be \u201ctype O\u201d\u2014McConnell\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Defendant furnished three tape-recorded statements to investigators shortly after his arrest. In the first statement he denied any complicity in the crime, but inquired whether Bolanos or Vasquez had been taken into custody. In his second statement he admitted involvement; claiming the incident was planned as a \u201cstupid little burglary.\u201d He had approached McConnell\u2019s house alone on foot; when she answered the door he entered and they just talked. He was not carrying the metal bar. When Bolanos drove up, defendant thought they would all talk a bit and leave. Instead, Vasquez came to the door and hit McConnell \u201ctwo or three\u201d times. They grabbed the stereo and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">In his third statement, defendant admitted he was armed with the dumbbell bar when he entered McConnell\u2019s house. After speaking with her for a few minutes, Vasquez arrived and pushed the front door open. McConnell immediately recognized Vasquez, who ordered defendant to \u201chit her.\u201d Defendant complied, hitting McConnell once in the head with the bar, knocking her to the floor. He proceeded to break down the rear bedroom door, search the closet, and remove the stereo components from the front of the house to Bolanos\u2019s car. He was not paying attention to Vasquez\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>during this period, and did not observe how the victim came to have suffered 15 to 20 fatal blows to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The prosecution proceeded on actual malice-deliberation, vicarious liability (conspiracy) and felony-murder theories. Belmontes\u2019s defense was that he abandoned all intent to go through with the burglary once he knocked on the door and discovered McConnell at home. He only entered the house to \u201cplay it out.\u201d Although he struck McConnell the one blow with the bar, it was only at Vasquez\u2019s direction; he did not intend to kill her. Vasquez must have dealt the additional fatal blows to McConnell while defendant was breaking into and searching the back rooms of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. On Sunday morning, March 15, he and Bolanos went to Vasquez\u2019s house. Defendant had $7 remaining from his last paycheck and would not be paid again until April. Vasquez suggested they steal McConnell\u2019s stereo because she was a \u201csnitch.\u201d Defendant had been to McConnell\u2019s house twice in the previous month. She was not a friend, however, and it meant nothing to him to \u201crip her off.\u201d He testified: \u201cIt was just something that came up. Everybody agreed on it, it happened. You can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going to happen from one day to the next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">They drove to Victor and parked a half block away from McConnell\u2019s house. The plan was for defendant to go to the door first, since McConnell would not let Vasquez or Bolanos inside but was unaware defendant knew them. Defendant, however, did not anticipate that McConnell would be home. Vasquez gave him the dumbbell bar to use to break a window. Defendant concealed it up his sleeve. Vasquez and Bolanos stayed in the car; defendant walked to McConnell\u2019s front door, knocked, and she answered. He told her he was hitchhiking and was stopping by because it was raining. McConnell invited him in. She noticed a bulge in his sleeve and asked what it was. Defendant showed her the bar, explaining he had it because he was hitchhiking; thereafter displaying it openly. He used McConnell\u2019s bathroom and then stood by the table and talked while she ironed clothes. She related that she was having problems with some people and asked him if he knew Domingo Vasquez. Defendant said he had met Domingo before.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Five minutes after defendant entered the house, Bolanos and Vasquez pulled into the driveway. McConnell started walking toward the front door. Defendant followed behind her and was placing the bar back up his sleeve when Vasquez rapped loudly on the door. According to defendant, the sequence of events was such that after pulling up Vasquez must have come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>directly to the front door; he would not have had time to go to the trunk of Bolanos\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Vasquez pushed the door open, saw McConnell and ordered defendant to \u201chit her.\u201d Defendant followed Vasquez\u2019s directive and hit McConnell in the side of the head with the bar, using as much force as he could with a backhanded sweeping motion. She fell to the floor. Defendant dropped the bar, ran to the back bedroom, broke down the door, searched that room and the kitchen, and returned to the living room, all within a matter of several seconds. He did not enter or ransack the master bedroom, testifying it must have been Vasquez. Upon returning to the front of the house, defendant observed Vasquez standing in the same spot holding the metal bar. He had not seen Vasquez hit McConnell nor heard any blows landing, because he was not paying attention. He could not explain the presence of defensive bruises and contusions on McConnell\u2019s hands and feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Defendant testified he was \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d because Vasquez was just \u201cstanding there like a fool\u201d not doing anything while he was running around the house \u201clooking for something to take.\u201d Defendant told Vasquez to grab something; Vasquez picked up a speaker. Defendant ripped out the stereo wires and antenna, put the second speaker on top of the stereo unit, and told Vasquez to run. Vasquez ran out the back door; defendant followed close behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">They loaded the stereo components into the trunk. Vasquez got in the back seat, defendant rode \u201cshotgun side,\u201d and Bolanos drove. En route to Galt, Vasquez handed defendant the steel bar which had flesh and hair residue on it, stating he had to take out a witness. Defendant, still wearing his gloves, wiped blood off the bar and set it down on the floorboard. He was uncertain whether there was blood on his pants when he left McConnell\u2019s house; some might have come off the bar when he placed it on the floorboard. He denied having wiped any blood off of his shoes. Bolanos and Vasquez told him to throw the bar out his window into the river; he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The three drove to Vasquez\u2019s brother Manuel\u2019s house. Defendant changed into a pair of Manuel\u2019s pants. Manuel contacted Raul Barron, whom they met at Vasquez\u2019s sister Irma\u2019s house. Defendant backed the car into her garage and plugged in the stereo; Barron bought it for $100. Bolanos, Vasquez and defendant drove to Lodi, divided the money, bought some beer, then drove to the home of an acquaintance to purchase narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Barbara Murillo, was questioned as a hostile witness by the defense. She and defendant were living together in Lodi shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>before the murder; at that time she had a two-year-old daughter by him and was pregnant with his second child. Six months after the murder she ran into Cobarrubio at the Grape Festival. Murillo believed defendant was the murderer. But when she asked Cobarrubio for further details about the crime, the latter claimed defendant had been \u201cset up\u201d because he had no backup in the area, while Vasquez had a network of local friends,</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Cobarrubio was questioned on the matter. She recalled running into Murillo at the Grape Festival and being asked if defendant had committed the murder. She responded affirmatively. Murillo then asked Cobarrubio if she thought defendant \u201cmight have been set up.\u201d She replied: \u201cWell, he might have.\u201d Cobarrubio testified further that in fact she had no information from any source that defendant had been set up. She had answered Murillo\u2019s inquiry to that effect because she knew defendant was protesting his innocence and felt sorry for Murillo, who seemed to still care about defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">B. Guilt Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Defendant raises a number of contentions relating to the issue of guilt. None, as we shall show, warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">1. <em>Validity of the Arrest Warrant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Defendant asserts the invalidity of his arrest warrant on two grounds: (1) that it was facially invalid because it was based solely on the uncorroborated accusation of accomplice Robert Solanos (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Campa </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 870 [206 Cal.Rptr. 114, 686 P.2d 634]); and (2) that material facts tending to negate the reliability of Bolanos\u2019s information were omitted from the affidavit in support of the warrant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurland </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 376 [168 Cal.Rptr. 667, 618 P.2d 213].) He argues that his bloodstained shoes and extrajudicial statements should have been suppressed as the fruits of his illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The arrest warrant was not challenged on these grounds in the trial court.  \u201c[(Questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on appeal [citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 542, 548 [146 Cal.Rptr. 732, 579 P.2d 1048]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 869 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 353.) The contrary rule would deprive the People of the opportunity to make their record on the matter and cure the defect at trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 548, and cases cited.) \u201cBecause of [his] failure to make a timely and specific objection on this ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>. . . the point must be deemed waived.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 22 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">While acknowledging trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the arrest warrant, defendant urges us to reach the merits of his claim on the ground that failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.  In order to establish such inadequacy, he must demonstrate that counsel failed to perform with reasonable competence, and that it is reasonably probable a determination more favorable to the defendant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 583-584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].) Defendant has failed to meet his burden. Our review is limited to consideration of the facts established by the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">a. Reliability of Accomplice-informant Bolanos\u2019s Hearsay Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 870, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s arrest was illegal because the affidavit in support of his arrest warrant failed to establish probable cause. There, a van had pulled alongside a car and, after a brief exchange of words between a passenger in the van and the driver of the car, the van passenger fired several shots into the car, wounding the driver and killing the passenger. Subsequent investigation led to one Richard Martinez, whose parents owned the van. Placed under arrest for murder and interrogated, Martinez admitted his participation in the incident, but stated Campa had done the actual shooting. A warrant was procured for Campa\u2019s arrest based upon Martinez\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Since Campa\u2019s crime occurred prior to the adoption of Proposition 8, we applied principles of California constitutional law theretofore unimpacted by that initiative measure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 262 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149].) We relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 176 [77 Cal.Rptr. 785, 454 P.2d 681], wherein we stated that \u201cfor an affidavit based on an informant\u2019s hearsay statement to be legally sufficient to support the issuance of a . . . warrant, two requirements must be met: (1) the affidavit must allege the informant\u2019s statement in language that is factual rather than conclusionary and must establish that the informant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained in such statement; and (2) the affidavit must contain some underlying factual information from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>which the magistrate issuing the warrant can reasonably conclude that the informant was credible or his information reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 179-180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In <em>Campa </em>we concluded that accomplice Martinez\u2019s affidavit contained no factual information relative to his credibility\u2014the second <em>Aguilar </em>prong, <em>supra, </em>378 U.S. 108\u2014other than that he was himself in custody on a murder charge and had admitted his participation in the crime. We explained further: \u201cThis is not to say that in all such cases the statement of a coparticipant implicating a suspect in criminal activity should be disregarded in finding probable cause for issuance of a warrant. Admissions may be made under circumstances in which their credibility is enhanced. Other \u2018indicia of reliability,\u2019 such as . . . corroborative evidence obtained independently may buttress the credibility of an arrestee\u2019s statement.\u201d <em>(Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 883-884; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 332, 337-338 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Although the magistrate and parties below did not have the benefit of a reading of <em>Campa, </em>reasonably competent counsel at that time would have been familiar with the principles reiterated in this court\u2019s earlier cases which applied the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. Here, the circumstances of the crime and evidence found at the crime scene\u2014as summarized in the affidavit\u2014corroborated Bolanos\u2019s statement. Bolanos asserted the murder was committed in the course of a burglary during which McConnell\u2019s stereo was stolen and later fenced\u2014the affiant, Detective Holman, declared that the victim\u2019s house had been found ransacked. Bolanos stated defendant had beaten the victim with an iron bar causing defendant to become splattered with blood\u2014such was consistent with the nature of the victim\u2019s injury (\u201cblunt trauma to the head\u201d) noted in the autopsy results incorporated into the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Moreover, although defendant stresses that Bolanos had a self-serving interest in \u201cpegging\u201d him as the actual killer, all three participants in the burglary (defendant, Vasquez and Bolanos) shared felony-murder liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>for McConnell\u2019s murder. In his statement, Solanos confessed to his own role in the planning, participation and aftermath of the burglary; nothing therein suggested he had withdrawn from the criminal conspiracy at any time. Nor does defendant attempt to challenge the sufficiency of the affidavit to support his arrest under the warrant for <em>burglary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Mindful of the preference to be accorded warrants in doubtful or marginal cases (see <em>Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 884, and cases cited), trial counsel could reasonably have concluded that the affidavit contained sufficient corroboration of Bolanos\u2019s hearsay statement; that the arrest warrant thus issued on probable cause; and that a de novo motion to quash the warrant would have proved futile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant has not met his burden of showing that failure to challenge the warrant on this ground amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">b. Omission of Material Facts From the Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Defendant argues there were four material omissions from the affidavit in support of the arrest warrant: (1) Deputy Holman had never heard the name Fernando Belmontes prior to Bolanos\u2019s statement, although Vasquez was on the police list of people recently in contact with the victim; (2) the black Chevy described by Lucy Flores, McConnell\u2019s neighbor, was traced to Bolanos and impounded before he furnished his statement; (3) Solanos had initially reacted to police questioning by lying and denying any knowledge of the crime; and (4) his eventual inculpatory statement was prompted not by good citizenship, remorse or a guilty conscience, but rather by the police confronting him with his girlfriend\u2019s incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Recognizing that the record is incomplete because this claim was not litigated in the trial court to determine whether the omissions were intentional, reckless or negligent, defendant nevertheless urges us to reach the merits of his claim because the omissions were negligent \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d For reasons already noted, the point has been waived on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Nor was trial counsel incompetent in failing to attack the arrest warrant on this ground. Prior to the effective date of Proposition 8, <em>Kurland </em>applied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurland, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 376; see <em>In re Lance W. </em>(1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>37 Cal.3d 873, 896 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; compare <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 154, 155-156 [57 L.Ed.2d 667, 672, 98 S.Ct. 674].) Although <em>Kurland </em>speaks to search warrants, the test is equally applicable to omissions from arrest warrants. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1161, 1164 [197 Cal.Rptr. 413]; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Sesslin </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 418, 424 [67 Cal.Rptr. 409, 439 P.2d 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Counsel could competently have concluded that the omitted facts were either immaterial, or their omission reasonable.  In either situation no sanction is imposed and, assuming the affidavit otherwise supports probable cause, the warrant usually stands. <em>(Kurland, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 387-388.) Omissions are \u201cmaterial\u201d only if they rendered the affidavit substantially misleading, i.e., if there was \u201ca substantial possibility [the omitted facts] would have altered a reasonable magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination.\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">It is difficult to see how the officer-declarant\u2019s unfamiliarity with defendant would have borne upon <em>Bolanos\u2019s </em>reliability\u2014the precise matter at hand. Nor did omission of the fact that Bolanos\u2019s Chevy was impounded shortly before he furnished his statement diminish its reliability. If anything, inclusion of the fact that his vehicle had been identified would have corroborated his claim that he drove the participants to the crime scene. Nor would Bolanos\u2019s truthful statement\u2014furnished after he learned his girlfriend had incriminated him\u2014necessarily have been more reliable had it been shown to be motivated by \u201cgood citizenship\u201d or \u201cremorse.\u201d Inclusion in the affidavit of the circumstance that Bolanos\u2019s statement conformed to his girlfriend\u2019s report to police of what he had told her about the crimes would also have further enhanced its reliability. Lastly, although Bolanos may have initially denied knowledge of or involvement in the crime, it was his own incriminating admissions in his statement, together with other corroborative facts in the affidavit, upon which the magistrate could justifiably rely in assessing the reliability of Bolanos\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Defendant has failed to show a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that inclusion of these facts in the affidavit would have altered the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. He has thus not met his burden of demonstrating that failure to attack the warrant on this ground constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">2. <em>Admission of Defendant\u2019s Extrajudicial Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Defendant contends that his pretrial statements, in which he made inculpatory admissions of involvement in McConnell\u2019s murder, should have been suppressed as the involuntary products of threats and/or promises of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>leniency by the homicide investigators. Specifically, he condemns the officers\u2019 use of the \u201ctechnique of invoking the threat of the death penalty and then offering the hope of leniency through the means of confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Six days after the murder, San Joaquin Detectives Elbert Holman and Lyle Cooper, armed with the arrest warrant, traveled to San Bernardino County and took defendant into custody at his mother\u2019s home in Ontario. He was taken to the Ontario Police Department for questioning and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 649,86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]). Defendant acknowledged he understood his rights, waived them, and indicated his desire to speak with the officers. The waiver of rights and ensuing statement were tape-recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In his first statement, defendant admitted knowing Bolanos, Vasquez and McConnell. He admitted having been to McConnell\u2019s house twice in January and February of that year. He had spent the previous weekend with Bolanos in Lodi. At first he claimed he had not been to Vasquez\u2019s house on the Sunday of the murder; thereafter he admitted having gone there. He claimed he had come to Ontario to be with his girlfriend. He denied having discussed burglarizing McConnell\u2019s residence while at Vasquez\u2019s house; being with Bolanos or Vasquez in Galt on Sunday morning; parking around the comer and walking to McConnell\u2019s house to break in; hitting her with the dumbbell bar as Bolanos and Vasquez were heard driving up; taking the stereo; attempting to throw the bar into the Mokelumne river; or selling the stereo in Lodi. When given an opportunity to ask questions, defendant wanted to know if Bolanos and Vasquez were already in custody, and was told they were in jail in Stockton charged with the murder. The interview was concluded and the tape recorder turned off.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Deputy Holman testified that after turning off the machine defendant was told they would be going back to Stockton. Holman stated to defendant: \u201cThanks for lying to me.\u201d When defendant expressed surprise, Holman added: \u201cWhy do you think we came down here and got you by name if we didn\u2019t know the story prior to coming down here?\u201d Defendant asked for a minute to think about it, then indicated he wanted to \u201ctell [Holman] what had happened.\u201d Holman advised defendant he would not continue taking the statement unless the tape recorder was turned back on, and this was done. Less than three minutes had elapsed since the conclusion of the first statement. Holman testified he did not recall either he or Deputy Cooper ever mentioning to defendant, in the two or three minutes that the tape recorder was turned off, that \u201cthis was a death penalty case.\u201d He recalled Deputy Cooper telling defendant that \u201cthe whole case was lying on him\u201d; which Holman felt accurately characterized the status of the investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>up to that point. Holman never told defendant they had him \u201cdead to rights\u201d; it was defendant who had first used that expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Deputy Cooper testified that during the break between statements, Holman told defendant he would be going back to Stockton to stand trial, that it was \u201ca homicide case,\u201d that \u201che would have a long time to think about it,\u201d \u201cand he may have even been told it was a\u2014in our estimation a death penalty case. I don\u2019t recall if we told him that, ffl] I believe he was told there was no bail, again. That\u2019s about the extent of it. It was a very short conversation.\u201d Cooper testified that if the term \u201cdeath penalty\u201d was mentioned, it was not intended to scare defendant. Finally, his comment to defendant that \u201cyou want to clear it up so that its not all laying <em>[sic] </em>on you\u201d was merely a reference in context to defendant\u2019s own earlier exclamation to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The transcript of the second tape-recorded statement supports the officers\u2019 testimony. Defendant indicates therein that Holman had not coerced him into making a second statement by use of the term \u201cdead to rights\u201d; that he had not been threatened or promised anything to make a second statement; that less than three minutes had elapsed since the tape recorder had been turned off; and that he had volunteered during the break that he had not been truthful in the first statement and now desired to level with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In his second statement\u2014which defendant testified he furnished \u201cbecause only three people knew what had happened, yet the deputies seemed to know everything\u201d\u2014defendant claimed the incident was planned as a \u201cstupid little burglary.\u201d He approached McConnell\u2019s house alone on foot; when he knocked and found her home he entered and they talked. He was not carrying the metal bar. When Bolanos drove up, he thought they would all talk some more and leave. Instead, Vasquez came to the door and hit McConnell \u201ctwo or three\u201d times. They grabbed the stereo and ran. The rear bedroom was never ransacked. Bolanos and Vasquez told him to throw the bar out the car window. He got some blood on his pants but thought Vasquez did too.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Defendant\u2019s third tape-recorded statement was taken on the following day in the San Joaquin County jail. He was again <em>Mirandized, </em>waived his rights, and does not here challenge the voluntariness of that statement on separate grounds. He admitted therein to being armed with the dumbbell bar upon entering McConnell\u2019s house. After speaking with her for a few minutes, Vasquez arrived and pushed the front door open, McConnell immediately recognized him, Vasquez ordered defendant to \u201chit her,\u201d and defendant complied. He claimed he hit McConnell only once in the head with the bar, knocking her to the floor. He proceeded to break down the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>bedroom door, search the closet, then remove the stereo components from the front of the house to Bolanos\u2019s waiting Chevy. Defendant stated he did not pay attention to Vasquez\u2019s actions during this period, nor did he directly observe how McConnell came to have suffered the 15 to 20 fatal blows to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The burden is on the prosecution to prove the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 753 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jimenez </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 595, 608 [147 Cal Rptr. 172, 580 P.2d 672].) That requirement applies equally to a defendant\u2019s incriminating admissions. <em>(Murtishaw, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p.753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">It is well settled that \u201cmere advice or exhortation by the police that it would be better for the accused to tell the truth when unaccompanied by either a threat or a promise does not render a subsequent confession involuntary.\u201d <em>(Jimenez, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 611.) As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 536 [58 Cal.Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908], the distinction between permissible and impermissible police conduct \u201cdoes not depend upon the bare language of inducement but rather upon the nature of the benefit to be derived by the defendant if he speaks the truth as represented by the police.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 549.) In terms of assessing inducements assertedly offered to a suspect, \u201c \u2018[w]hen the benefit pointed out by the police ... is merely that which flows naturally from a truthful and honcit course of conduct,\u2019 the subsequent statement will not be considered involuntarily made [citation].\u201d (Jimenez, <em>supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 611-612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Our role as a reviewing court is \u201c \u2018 \u201cto examine the uncontradicted facts to determine independently whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion of voluntariness was properly found . . . .\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McClary </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 218, 227 [142 Cal.Rptr. 163, 571 P.2d 620].) If there is \u201cconflicting testimony, the court must \u2018accept that version of events which is most favorable to the People, to the extent that it is supported by the record.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 815, 835 [183 Cal.Rptr. 817, 647 P.2d 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Our independent review convinces us that no improper threats or promise of leniency were made to defendant. Deputy Holman testified that he did not, as defendant contends, \u201cthreaten him with the death penalty.\u201d Deputy Cooper\u2019s best recollection was that the term \u201cdeath penalty\u201d <em>may </em>have been mentioned at some point, but that if it was, it was not done so with intent to scare or coerce defendant into confessing. To the extent their testimony conflicted on whether the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d was ever mentioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>we must accept that version most favorable to the People. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p.835.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s own responses at the beginning of his second tape-recorded statement support the officers\u2019 testimony that he was not \u201cthreatened\u201d with the death penalty, nor were any promises of benefit or leniency offered as inducement for his statements. Belmontes acknowledged he lied in all three of his statements to police. He testified his intent during the first statement was to deny everything: \u201cI was holding my mug.\u201d His intention in his second statement was to tell enough of the truth so that he would be believed, but no more than necessary. Defendant\u2019s own behavior and testimony virtually precludes a conclusion that his free will was overborne by the substance or manner of the interrogation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Johns </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 281, 292-293 [193 Cal.Rptr. 182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Nor does the record support defendant\u2019s further assertion that the officers unduly coerced his statements by falsely suggesting that Vasquez and Bola-nos were claiming he was the lone murderer because he was not a \u201chome boy.\u201d At the time of defendant\u2019s questioning, Bolanos and Vasquez were in custody for the murder, and Bolanos had related that defendant went into the house first and thereafter came out with blood on him. Based upon the information they had at that point, it was reasonable for the officers to suspect defendant as the actual killer. Defendant acknowledged that it was the factual detail revealed in the officers\u2019 questions which led him to conclude that Vasquez and Bolanos had \u201csnitched him off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Applying the applicable standards to the facts, we conclude that the trial court properly ruled the statements admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">3. <em>Defense Counsel\u2019s Potential Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">One week after the filing of the information and prior to severance, the public defender, representing codefendant Vasquez, filed a motion to recuse defendant\u2019s trial counsel, John Schick, on grounds of an alleged conflict of interest stemming from Schick\u2019s \u201cprior representation\u201d of Vasquez. Schick was a named partner in the law firm which prior to 1980 had been under contract as the conflict public defender for San Joaquin County. Two years earlier, another attorney in Schick\u2019s law firm had represented Vasquez on another murder charge. That case never went to trial; the charge against Vasquez was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">In opposing his recusal, Schick filed a declaration in which he stated (1) that he was not in possession of any information relating to this case obtained through any confidential communication with Vasquez; (2) that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>had made no personal appearances on behalf of Vasquez; and (3) that the office file on Vasquez\u2019s 1979 case had been destroyed over eight months earlier. At the hearing on the motion, Schick further represented that the attorney who had represented Vasquez in 1979 was no longer employed in his firm and was in private practice in Manteca. Vasquez\u2019s counsel conceded that \u201c[c]ertainly if there were to be a severance granted, then that would go a long way towards clearing up those [potential conflict of interest] kinds of problems. But at this point as the District Attorney indicated, that is not necessarily the case. So I feel the problems are still there.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The court denied the motion to recuse Schick, concluding that under the circumstances there was no conflict of interest nor the potential for one to arise. Defendant was present and heard counsel\u2019s representations and arguments at the hearing. At its conclusion, defendant was asked: \u201cDo you wish and is that still your desire to have [Schick] represent you?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Defendant argues that reversal is required due to a conflict or potential conflict of interest arising from Schick\u2019s law firm\u2019s prior representation of Vasquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\u201cIt has long been established that \u2018the \u201cassistance of counsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled and unimpaired by a court order requiring that one lawyer shall simultaneously represent conflicting interests.\u2019 <em>(Glasser </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 60, 70 [86 L.Ed. 680, 699, 62 S.Ct. 457]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 765, 774 [73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106, 34 A.L.R.3d 454].)\u201d <em>(Leversen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 530, 536-537 [194 Cal.Rptr. 448, 668 P.2d 755].) Although the classic conflict situation involves joint representation of codefendants in the same action, \u201c[t]he same principles apply when counsel represents clients whose interests may be adverse even when they are not codefendants in the same trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mroczko </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 86, 105 [197 Cal.Rptr. 52, 672 P.2d 835].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201cWhen a trial court undertakes to appoint counsel for indigent codefendants (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>[1968] 69 Cal.2d 765 [73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106, 34 A.L.R.3d 454]), it must assume the burden of assuring that its appointment does not result in a denial of effective counsel because of some possible conflict.

Where the evidence conflicts \u201cconcerning the nature and extent of the past and present attorney-client relationship, the trial court\u2019s findings based upon such conflicting evidence are conclusive on appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yorn </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 669, 674 [153 Cal.Rptr. 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We have held that \u201ceven a potential conflict may require reversal if the record supports \u2018an informed speculation\u2019 that appellant\u2019s right to effective representation was prejudicially affected.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mroczko, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 105.) But \u201c[permissible speculation giving rise to a conflict of interest may be deemed an informed speculation . . . only when such is grounded on a factual basis which can be found in the record.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at pp. 670-671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Here the record does not establish an actual or potential conflict of interest. Attorney Schick, an officer of the court, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[was] in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when a conflict of interest exists or will probably develop in the course of a trial.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mroczko, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 112.) He represented to the court that he personally had no prior contact with Vasquez. The attorney from Schick\u2019s firm who had handled Vasquez\u2019s earlier case was now in private practice in another locale; the file in that case had long since been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Alternatively, defendant urges that Schick\u2019s ethical obligations to his firm\u2019s former client precluded him\u2014perhaps subliminally\u2014from fully exploiting Vasquez\u2019s prior criminal record in the presentation of Belmontes\u2019s defense. At oral argument appellate counsel suggested that Schick might have \u201cself-censored himself\u2019 as a result of the conflict; at another point counsel took an opposite tack, suggesting Schick, \u201cdidn\u2019t see the potential for conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Trial counsel\u2019s performance, however, lends little support to the argument. Throughout the guilt and penalty phases Schick characterized Vasquez as the \u201cringleader\u201d of the planned crime, emphasizing that Vasquez was older than defendant, and urging the jury to consider Vasquez\u2019s reputation in the local community; his infidelity and mistreatment of Carrie Rogers who was supporting him; his former relationship with the victim; his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>threats to her right up through the morning of the murder; and his motive\u2014consistent with defendant\u2019s claims\u2014to do harm to McConnell, who had thrown him out of her house after he \u201cripped her off\u201d several days prior to the murder. Further evidence of Vasquez\u2019s prior \u201cspecific instances of violent conduct,\u201d especially an earlier <em>charge (the 1979 </em>murder charge) <em>which had been dismissed, </em>would have been inadmissible to prove his conduct in the instant criminal episode. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a); Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 324, p. 287.) Moreover, given that the prosecution was proceeding on felony murder and conspiracy theories of vicarious liability, trial counsel had to weigh the tactical disadvantages of having the defense strengthen the case against Vasquez, thereby enhancing defendant\u2019s vicarious liability for Vasquez\u2019s criminal acts in the jurors\u2019 eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The record affords no informed basis for concluding that a conflict of interest existed or affected trial counsel\u2019s performance to defendant\u2019s detriment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">4. <em>Admissibility of Bolano\u2019s and Cobarrubio\u2019s Prior Consistent Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Defendant contends that evidence of prior consistent statements of Bolanos and his girlfriend, Teresa Cobarrubio, were erroneously admitted without meeting the foundational requirements of Evidence Code sections 791 and 1236.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Bolanos testified that he told Cobarrubio on the day after the murder defendant was the one who had killed McConnell during the burglary. No timely objection having been made to this testimony; the point has been waived on appeal. <em>(People v. Cannady </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 379, 388 [105 Cal.Rptr. 129, 503 P.2d 585]; <em>People v. Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 22.) Defendant\u2019s purported citation to an objection on this point is unavailing. The \u201cobjection\u201d he notes in the record went to Bolanos\u2019s testimony on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>different matter (his initial false statement regarding the disposal of McConnell\u2019s stereo); was made on a nonhearsay ground; and was raised well beyond the point at which Bolanos gave the testimony here challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Cobarrubio\u2019s testimony confirmed that Bolanos told her defendant had killed McConnell. This time there was an objection; to which the prosecutor responded: \u201cWe\u2019re offering it as a prior statement of Mr. Bolanos, given at a time when the motive imputed to him for why he should want to lie didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">One motive for fabrication or bias in Bolanos\u2019s testimony, explored at length during his cross-examination, was his favorable immunity agreement obtained in exchange for his testimony at defendant\u2019s trial. Defendant himself recognizes: \u201cOf course Bolanos also had a strong motive to shift as much legal and moral culpability away from himself and on to the others [Belmontes and Vasquez] as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Bolanos had not yet been granted immunity from prosecution for the murder at the time he related the prior statement\u2014consistent with his trial testimony\u2014to Cobarrubio. An immunity agreement has been recognized as a motive for bias within the meaning of Evidence Code section 791. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pic\u2019l </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 824, 862-863 [171 Cal.Rptr. 106].) \u201cThat there may always have existed another motive for fabricating did not deprive the prosecution of its right to show that a motive shown by the evidence did not affect the witness\u2019 testimony [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cannady, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 388.) Bolanos\u2019s prior consistent statement to Cobarrubio was thus admissible under Evidence Code section 791, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Lastly, Deputy Gary Coffey testified about the statement he took from Cobarrubio prior to Bolanos\u2019s questioning and arrest. There was a hearsay objection; the prosecutor responded that evidence of Cobarrubio\u2019s prior statement was \u201cbeing offered to rehabilitate her, after counsel suggested she was lying on the stand. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Counsel impeached Cobarrubio on cross-examination with her statement to defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Barbara Murillo, made several months after the crime, to the effect that she might have agreed with Murillo that defendant could have been \u201cset up.\u201d This statement was inconsistent with Cobarrubio\u2019s trial testimony. Evidence of her earlier statement to Deputy Coffey was inconsistent with her statement to Murillo\u2014consistent with her trial testimony\u2014and thus admissible as a prior consistent statement. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 791, subd. (a) &amp; 1236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>5. <em>Curtailment of Impeachment of Prosecution Witness Carrie Lynn Rogers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Defendant argues that the court improperly restricted his cross-examination of prosecution witness Carrie Lynn Rogers regarding her motive for bias and fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">On the date of the offense, Domingo Vasquez was living with Rogers, their daughter, and a friend, Laura Hernandez. Rogers subsequently married Vasquez in jail three months after his arrest for McConnell\u2019s murder. Vasquez\u2019s motion to dismiss the felony-murder-burglary special circumstance as to him was granted. He ultimately pled guilty to second degree murder and second degree burglary and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Rogers did not come forward to implicate defendant as the actual killer until shortly before the start of his trial. On direct examination, she testified that after the crime Vasquez refused to tell her why he had been picked up for questioning by the police. On the night following the murder, while in her kitchen, she overheard defendant discussing the murder with Vasquez and Bolanos in the living room, and heard defendant review how he had first entered McConnell\u2019s house alone and hit her several times with the bar, after which Vasquez had joined him in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Prior to Rogers\u2019s cross-examination, defense counsel moved for permission to question her about the disposition of Vasquez\u2019s case. The theory of relevance was that Rogers\u2019s belated claim that defendant was the killer was motivated by her desire to promote her husband\u2019s chances for early release on parole. Defendant asserts that \u201c[t]he indeterminate sentence disposition of Domingo Vasquez\u2019s case and the wide range of potential prison confinement provided Carrie Rogers Vasquez with a powerful motive to portray [defendant] as the ringleader and killer. An early release\u2014or indeed any release\u2014of Vasquez depends in large measure upon his involvement in the offense and his level of culpability. Mrs. Vasquez could well be expected to so understand, believe or hope. The jury was deprived of powerful impeachment evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">The prosecutor countered that there was undue potential for prejudice and misuse of the information,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that counsel\u2019s theory of relevance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>impeachment was highly speculative. The court prohibited cross-examination in this vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We recognize that \u201c \u2018[w]hile the trial judge has broad discretion to control the ultimate scope of cross-examination designed to test the credibility or recollection of a witness <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 328, 343 [11 Cal.Rptr. 65, 359 P.2d 433]) . . <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 867, 877 [59 Cal.Rptr. 440, 428 P.2d 304]), \u201cwide latitude\u201d should be given to cross-examination designed to test the credibility of a prosecution witness in a criminal case. <em>(Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 707, 715 [87 Cal.Rptr. 361, 470 P.2d 345].)  Nevertheless, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that the ruling was so unduly restrictive as to violate his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673, 680 [89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431], the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201ca criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \u2018to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u2019 <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>[(1974) 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105], at 318.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">\u201cBut <em>Van Arsdall </em>emphasized that a trial judge has broad latitude in restricting cross-examination which is repetitive or only marginally relevant. <em>(Id. </em>[475 U.S. 673, 679-680].) There is no Sixth Amendment violation at all unless the prohibited cross-examination might reasonably have produced \u2018a significantly different impression of [the witness\u2019s] credibility. . . .\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>[475 U.S. 673, 680].) If cross-examination was improperly restricted, the prejudicial effect of the error on the trial as a whole depends on a multitude of factors, including the cumulative nature of the lost information, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, the degree of evidence corroborating the witness, and the overall strength of the prosecution case. <em>(Id. </em>[475 U.S. 673, 684].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 751, fn. 2 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Here the jury learned Rogers had been with Vasquez for eight years and had married him shortly after his arrest for McConnell\u2019s murder; that they had a daughter together; that she was seeing Vasquez on a weekly basis at the time of trial; that she had been living with Vasquez and supporting him on the date of the murder; that she knew Vasquez was keeping company with other women at that time and nonetheless \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything about it\u201d; and that she did not come forward to report her information inculpating defendant as the killer until the eve of his trial. Nor did the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>in his closing argument make any attempt to clothe Rogers with a false aura of veracity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We conclude the trial judge was within his discretion in ruling that the proffered line of cross-examination was potentially prejudicial and would not reasonably have produced \u201ca significantly different impression of [Rogers\u2019s] credibility. . . .\u201d <em>(Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 680 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 684].) Even were we to assume error of constitutional magnitude, given the totality of circumstances under which Rogers\u2019s testimony was presented\u2014particularly defendant\u2019s own testimony that he struck McConnell at least the one blow with the bar\u2014no prejudice warranting reversal would be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">6. <em>Conflicting Instructions on Evaluation of Accomplice Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> Defendant acknowledges that the court gave the full panoply of standardized instructions advising the jury that Solanos was an accomplice as a matter of law (CALJIC No. 3.16); defining \u201caccomplice\u201d (CALJIC No. 3.10); and advising that his testimony had to be viewed with distrust (CALJIC No. 3.18) and needed corroboration (CALJIC Nos. 3.11 and 3.12). Defendant claims, however, that the purpose of these instructions was undermined to his prejudice by the giving of CALJIC No. 2.27, which allows the jury to find any fact on the testimony of one witness, and CALJIC No. 2.11.5, which cautions the jury against speculation as to the prosecution or nonprosecution of accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">a. CALJIC No. 2.27</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">CALJIC No. 2.27 was requested <em>by defendant. </em>Trial counsel never proposed that it conflicted with the accomplice testimony corroboration requirement. Nevertheless, since the corroboration requirement of section 1111 is a \u201csubstantial right\u201d we shall address the claim. (\u00a7 1259; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 823, 830 [218 Cal.Rptr. 49, 705 P.2d 372].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>In <em>Chavez, supra, </em>we held that the giving of CALJIC 2.27 in conjunction with accomplice instructions was not error per se, but we agreed with the suggestion of the Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 967, 975 [193 Cal.Rptr. 799], that it should contain an explicit reference to testimony requiring corroboration. <em>(Chavez, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">As in <em>Chavez, </em>here, looking to the instructions as a whole we find no error. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 830-831.) Both the prosecution and the defense proceeded on the premise that corroboration was needed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 831.) The prosecutor reiterated in his closing argument that Bolanos\u2019s testimony needed to be corroborated, cautioned that it must be viewed with distrust, and summarized the evidence which he believed would support defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts independent of Bolanos\u2019s testimony. Bolanos himself conceded that he was testifying because: \u201cI\u2019m ordered here or else that murder case would be up on me again if I\u2019m not here,\u201d and acknowledged that he was more concerned about his own fate than that of defendant or Vasquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Moreover, the record belies defendant\u2019s assertion that Bolanos\u2019s testimony \u201cwent almost completely uncorroborated.\u201d It was corroborated by the testimony of Lucy Flores, Carrie Rogers, defendant\u2019s girlfriend Barbara Murillo, and crucially, by defendant himself. He admitted, both in his extrajudicial statements and trial testimony, that he first entered McConnell\u2019s house alone; dealt her the first blow with the iron bar; implored Vasquez to grab the stereo components and run; exited with blood on his clothes; wiped blood off the bar; and threw it in the river. He confirmed Bolanos was the \u201cwheel man\u201d and never entered the house. The murder weapon, recovered with Bolanos\u2019s assistance; defendant\u2019s bloodstained shoe; the number and severity of McConnell\u2019s head wounds; and the autopsy physician\u2019s testimony (that infliction of the blows would have made sounds like \u201ca cracked pot\u201d); all further corroborated Bolanos\u2019s account of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We conclude there was no prejudicial error from the giving of unadorned CALJIC No. 2.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">b. CALJIC No. 2.11.5</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">CALJIC No. 2.11.5 instructs: \u201cThere has been evidence in this case indicating that a person other than defendant was or may have been involved in the crime for which defendant is on trial, [fl] You must not discuss or give any consideration as to why the other person is not being prosecuted in this trial or whether he has been or will be prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>There is no merit to defendant\u2019s claim that, so charged, the jury might have believed it was prohibited from considering the \u201cnonprosecution\u201d of Bolanos. The instruction was patently directed at Vasquez. The jury knew Bolanos had pled guilty to burglary, was awaiting imposition of sentence therefor, and had been granted immunity from prosecution for McConnell\u2019s murder. Defendant\u2019s suggestion that the jury might have understood CALJIC No. 2.11.5 as applying to Bolanos, thereby precluding them from weighing the existence or nonexistence of bias, interest or other motive in assessing his credibility (see CALJIC No. 2.20), is implausible. It would require us to find that the jury rejected nearly all of the accomplice testimony instructions and disregarded as irrelevant counsel\u2019s considerable efforts to impeach Bolanos in his cross-examination and closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Defendant further argues that the instruction \u201cmight have misled the jury into believing that Vasquez was not being prosecuted, although they could not consider why.\u201d He hinges this contention on the predicate in the instruction: \u201cYou must not discuss or give any consideration as to why [a possible accomplice] is not being prosecuted in this trial. . . .\u201d In doing so he ignores the concluding clause of the instruction, which states: \u201cor whether he has been or will be prosecuted.\u201d The instruction in its entirety itself defeats his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">7. <em>Instruction on Defendant's Failure to Deny or Explain Certain Evidence (CALJIC No. </em>2.62)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The jury was instructed with CALJIC No. 2.62 (1980 rev.), which pertains to the inferences that might be drawn from defendant\u2019s failure to explain or deny prosecution evidence of facts within his personal knowledge. \u201cIt correctly explained that defendant has a constitutional right to decline to testify, but that his failure to deny or explain facts within his personal knowledge may be considered as supporting the prosecution evidence at issue. It also correctly advised that such failure to deny or explain does not create any presumption or warrant any inference of guilt, or relieve the prosecution of its proof burden.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 763 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].) There was no objection to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Defendant contends that \u201c[t]he instruction in conjunction with the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted prejudicial error because (1) the record discloses that [defendant] did <em>not </em>fail to explain or deny any prosecution evidence; and (2) the purported failures to explain or deny argued by the prosecution were tangential, collateral and of little importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">We disagree on both counts. Defendant testified he heard Bolanos and Vasquez drive up, and that Vasquez came right to the front door and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>not have had time to open Bolanos\u2019s trunk. But as the prosecutor argued, defendant failed to explain Bolanos\u2019s conflicting testimony, corroborated by the testimony of a disinterested neighbor (Lucy Flores), that Vasquez <em>did </em>first attempt to open the trunk before entering the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Defendant testified he struck McConnell the one blow to the head with the bar, and that she fell to the ground but was \u201cstill breathing.\u201d But he failed to explain the autopsy surgeon\u2019s conflicting conclusion that the injury resulting therefrom in probability would not have rendered McConnell unconscious, nor how the victim would come to have suffered the many defensive wounds\u2014clearly evidencing her struggle for life as she was being beaten\u2014if his version was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Defendant testified that he ran through the rear of the house looking for things to steal, returning within seconds to find Vasquez standing over McConnell holding the bar. He denied ransacking the front master bedroom, testifying it \u201c[m]ust have been [Vasquez].\u201d But as the prosecutor fairly argued, defendant failed to explain how Vasquez could have beaten the victim so extensively <em>and </em>ransacked the master bedroom; all in a matter of \u201cseconds.\u201d Defendant also claimed he neither saw nor heard Vasquez beating McConnell because he was not \u201cpaying attention,\u201d but he failed to explain how he could not have heard the 15 to 20 blows to the victim\u2019s head, which Bolanos heard from outside the house, and which, according to the autopsy surgeon, in all probability would have sounded \u201clike a cracked pot\u201d as they landed, cracking the victim\u2019s skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">There were other crucial points of conflict between defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements and trial testimony on the one hand, and the physical evidence and testimony of witnesses on the other. Without belaboring the point, our review of the record indicates that these and other such conflicts were hardly \u201ctangential, collateral and of little importance.\u201d  \u201c[I]f the defendant tenders an explanation which, while superficially accounting for his activities, nevertheless seems bizarre or implausible, the inquiry whether he reasonably should have known about circumstances claimed to be outside his knowledge is a credibility question for resolution by the jury [citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mask </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 450, 455 [233 Cal.Rptr. 181].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">8. <em>Doyle - Massiah Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed <em>Doyle </em>error <em>(Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 96 S.Ct. 2240]) when he cross-examined defendant regarding his postarrest silence. He further asserts that those same questions violated his right to counsel. <em>(Massiah </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199].) We conclude that under the circumstances the prosecutor\u2019s questions had the potential to, but did not, ripen into <em>Doyle </em>error. Nor did they infringe upon defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The offending colloquy went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor ]: Q. Mr. Belmontes, from the time you talked to Deputy Holman and Deputy Cooper at the San Joaquin County Jail on March 22nd, 1981, until today in this very courtroom you have never spoken to law enforcement concerning what happened on March 15th, 1981?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201c[Defendant ]: A.

The question, ladies and gentlemen, is somewhat misdirected in the sense that Mr. Belmontes does not have to talk to anybody.

Without the presence of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">\u201c[Prosecutor ]: Q. All right.

Just told him that I didn\u2019t do it. Told him that I was serious about when I said I hit the girl one time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The petitioners in <em>Doyle </em>were arrested on narcotics charges. They were given <em>Miranda </em>warnings <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436), made no postarrest statements about their involvement in the crime, and for the first time at trial contended they had been framed by a government informant. During cross-examination the prosecutor repeatedly sought to impeach their exculpatory story by asking them why they had failed to assert the \u201cframe-up\u201d defense earlier. The trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s timely objections to this line of inquiry, and permitted the prosecutor to argue petitioners\u2019 postarrest silence to the jury. <em>(Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610 at pp. 613-615, and fn. 5 [49 L.Ed.2d 91 at pp. 95-96].) The high court reversed the convictions, holding that <em>Miranda </em>prohibited such questioning and argument as a proper means of impeachment. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 617 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 97].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Here, the prosecutor did not ground his case on the theory that defendant had refused to talk to the police. Defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and furnished three statements. He testified that he voluntarily spoke with the officers about the crime en route from Southern California back to Stockton. In short, there were no <em>facts </em>supportive of an inference of \u201cpostarrest silence\u201d placed before the jury. Indeed the defense itself urged that defendant\u2019s trial testimony was essentially consistent with his jailhouse statement made over a year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The Attorney General argues that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were merely designed to point out the inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements and trial testimony\u2014a permissible avenue of impeachment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 321, 329-330 [156 Cal.Rptr. 407]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farris </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 376, 390 [136 Cal.Rptr. 45]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 928, 934 [142 Cal.Rptr. 532].) Perhaps that is where they were intended to lead. As worded, however, they just as readily could have elicited defendant\u2019s testimony that he made no statements about the crime <em>between </em>his third jailhouse statement and trial, and thus technically ran afoul of <em>Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">But upon counsel\u2019s objection to the questions, the trial judge immediately admonished the jury that \u201cMr. Belmontes does, not have to talk to anybody\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s admonished by his counsel . . . not to talk to anybody.\u201d (See <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 756, _ [97 L.Ed.2d 618, 630-631, 107 S.Ct. 3102] [similar curative admonition].) \u201cUnlike the prosecutor in <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecutor in this case was not \u2018allowed to undertake impeachment on,\u2019 or \u2018permit[ted] ... to call attention to,\u2019 [defendant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>silence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. _ [97 L.Ed.2d at pp. 630-631], quoting <em>Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. at p. 619, &amp; fn. 10 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 98].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Any error was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Greer </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>483 U.S. at p. _ [97 L.Ed.2d at p. 630]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 305 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149].) The prosecutor\u2019s questions were brief and unaccompanied by any suggestion that an inference of guilt should be drawn therefrom. Belmontes presented virtually no defense to the overwhelming evidence that a felony murder had occurred, namely, a murder committed in the course of a burglary. (\u00a7 189.) The evidence further supported the jury\u2019s findings that he personally, intentionally, and wilfully administered the fatal beating to McConnell. When asked on direct examination: \u201cDid you contribute to her death?\u201d defendant replied: \u201cYes.\u201d When asked \u201cHow?\u201d he acknowledged: \u201cI was involved. I hit her. . . .\u201d Although he claimed he struck McConnell only the one blow across her temple, that wound was apparently of insufficient force to lacerate the victim\u2019s skin\u2014a circumstance wholly inconsistent with his own admission that he was covered with blood and that he alone had to change his pants at Manuel Vasquez\u2019s house after the crime. The nature of McConnell\u2019s gaping head wounds; the blood splattered about defendant\u2019s face, clothing, and the walls and door jambs next to where she was found; and the many defensive bruises on her arms, hands, legs and feet all evidenced a desperate struggle for life as defendant bludgeoned her with the iron bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">We likewise reject defendant\u2019s related claim under <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>377 U.S. 201. There is no showing that the officers in this case at any stage of their investigation transgressed defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Having concluded that defendant\u2019s \u201cpostarrest silence\u201d was neither shown by the evidence nor urged before the jury, we decline his further invitation to speculate that the prosecutor\u2019s complained-of questions \u201cattribut[ed] a consciousness of guilt to the defendant for following his lawyer\u2019s advice . . .\u201d and remaining silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">9. <em>Uncharged Conspiracy Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Both defendant and Bolanos revealed in their pretrial statements that they met with Vasquez at the latter\u2019s house on the morning of the murder and specifically agreed and conspired to burglarize McConnell\u2019s house. Defendant admitted in his statement that overt acts were carried out in furtherance of the planned crime prior to the point at which he knocked on McConnell\u2019s door and found her home. He had armed himself with the bar and split up from his cohorts who, according to predesigned plan, were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>meet him at the house at a given time and assist in loading the stolen items into the trunk of Bolanos\u2019s Chevy.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">However, defendant\u2019s claim that he personally abandoned any intent to steal when McConnell bid him entry, and his further assertion that shortly thereafter Vasquez had forced entry into the home and commanded him to strike the victim, were also reflected in his statement. Anticipating what would likely be the gist of Belmontes\u2019s defense in light of his pretrial statements, the prosecutor elected to proceed on an alternative uncharged conspiracy theory of vicarious liability in addition to the actual malice-premeditation and felony-murder theories of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Defendant acknowledges that the People proceeded on these three distinct theories of guilt. In his briefs he criticizes but \u201cdoes not at this point challenge the validity of conspiracy theory in general to establish guilt of a substantive crime. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, he asserts error in (1) the failure to instruct that the existence of a conspiracy must be found beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) the giving of CALJIC No. 6.20 which, he claims, improperly shifted the burden of proving withdrawal from the conspiracy onto him.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">a. Appropriateness of Uncharged Conspiracy Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Although not raised as a separate challenge to the verdicts of guilt, defendant cites law review commentary to \u201cemphasize the illegitimacy\u201d of permitting the prosecution to proceed on an alternate theory of uncharged conspiracy liability. He asserts such is more appropriately reserved for \u201ccombatting complex criminal organizations\u201d or \u201cproviding a preemptive social defense against a dangerous design prior to the flash point when it becomes an attempt or completed crime.\u201d (See Note, <em>The Conspiracy Dilemma: Prosecution of Group Crime or Protection of Individual Defendants </em>(1948) 62 Harv. L.Rev. 276, 284-286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">It is long and firmly established that an uncharged conspiracy may properly be used to prove criminal liability for acts of a coconspirator. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 223, 250 [32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16] [uncharged conspiracy to commit burglaries admissible to prove identity of murderer]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pike </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 70, 88 [22 Cal.Rptr. 664, 372 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>P.2d 656] [uncharged conspiracy to commit robberies admissible to prove armed robbery culminating in murder].) \u201cFailure to charge conspiracy as a separate offense does not preclude the People from proving that those substantive offenses which are charged were committed in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy [citation]; nor, it follows, does it preclude the giving of jury instructions based on a conspiracy theory <em>(People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1174 [81 Cal.Rptr. 5, 459 P.2d 259, 39 A.L.R.3d 541]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ditson </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 415, 447 [20 Cal.Rptr. 165, 369 P.2d 714]).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Remiro </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 809, 842 [153 Cal.Rptr. 89, 2 A.L.R.4th 1135].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The evidence here showed that defendant, Vasquez and Bolanos met, specifically intended to agree or conspire, specifically intended to commit the planned burglary, and carried out overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy\u2014completing the intended crime. There being evidence supportive of all the elements of a conspiracy, the People were entitled to proceed on that alternative theory of liability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Horn </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 290, 296 [115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">b. Failure to Instruct on Existence of Uncharged Conspiracy Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The jury was charged with nine standardized instructions which fully defined all relevant principles underlying the People\u2019s alternative uncharged conspiracy theory of liability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defendant complains, however, that it was reversible error not to further instruct the jury that the <em>existence </em>of a conspiracy at the time of the killing must be proved <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>as a prerequisite for vicarious liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">A similar contention was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jourdain </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 396 [168 Cal.Rptr. 702]. Jourdain, like defendant here, argued he was denied due process of law because the standard conspiracy instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>tions permitted the jury to connect him to the illegal uncharged conspiracy and thereby convict him upon a standard lower than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In rejecting claimed error in the refusal to give defendant\u2019s preferred \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d instruction, the <em>Jourdain </em>court reasoned: \u201cThat argument misses the point. The People had not charged appellant with, nor were they trying to convict him of, conspiracy. . . . [fl] The admission of [evidence of conspiracy] was not affected by the fact the information had not charged a conspiracy <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>([1968]) 263 Cal.App.2d 368 [69 Cal.Rptr. 402]), and once there had been proof of the existence of the conspiracy there was no error in instructing the jury on the law of conspiracy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Remiro </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 809, 842; <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1174.) In so charging the jury the court was not in any way indicating that appellant was being tried for the crime of conspiracy. Rather, the court was merely instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1093.). . . . ffi]. . . There was only one instruction on the burden of proof given to the jury. That instruction told the jury in terms of Penal Code section 1096 that it could not find appellant guilty until his guilt had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (CALJIC No. 2.90.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jourdain, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 403-404.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">As instructed, the jury here was not told it could find defendant guilty on an uncharged conspiracy theory upon less than reasonable doubt. CALJIC No. 2.90 was given. Moreover, the jury\u2019s verdicts and special findings reflect that they found defendant\u2019s guilt of McConnell\u2019s murder beyond a reasonable doubt both on actual malice-premeditation and felony-murder-burglary theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">c. Impermissible Shifting of Burden of Proving Withdrawal From the Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">We further reject defendant\u2019s argument that instructing the jury in accordance with CALJIC No. 6.20 (that only an affirmative and bona fide rejection or repudiation of the conspiracy communicated to the coconspirators will effectuate withdrawal from the conspiracy) impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>shifted the burden of proof on such matter to him.  As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Crosby </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 713, 731 [25 Cal.Rptr. 847, 375 P.2d 839]: \u201cIt is not part of the People\u2019s prima facie case to negate the possibility of such a withdrawal. Once the defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy is shown, it will be presumed to continue unless he is able to prove\u2014as a matter of defense\u2014that he effectively withdrew from the conspiracy. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Under CALJIC No. 6.20 the burden is upon the defendant to go forward with evidence of his withdrawal from the conspiracy. His burden is one of production\u2014not persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of his non-membership in the conspiracy. Here, defendant made no attempt whatsoever to suggest how he had affirmatively withdrawn from or repudiated his role in the conspiracy to burglarize McConnell\u2019s house, much less communicated the same to Vasquez.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor under these facts could he readily have done <em>so\u2014by his own testimony </em>he felled McConnell with a blow to her head with the iron bar, immediately went about ransacking the rear rooms of her house, ripped out the wires and grabbed a stereo component, then had to urge Vasquez to assist in carrying out the booty as the two fled from the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The People properly proceeded on the alternative uncharged conspiracy theory of liability. No prejudice from the giving of the standardized conspiracy instructions is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">10. <em>Special Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The special findings made by the jury in connection with the verdict of guilt of first degree murder were as follows: (1) \u201cWe further find that the murder was wilful, deliberate and premeditated\u201d; (2) \u201cWe further find that the murder was intentional\u201d; (3) \u201cWe further find that the defendant Fernando Belmontes, Jr., personally committed the killing\u201d; and (4) \u201cWe further find that the killing occurred as a result of the commission or attempted commission of the crime of burglary.\u201d Two additional special findings were found true in connection with special circumstance: \u201cWe further find that the defendant, Fernando Belmontes, Jr., is the actual killer,\u201d and \u201cWe further find that the defendant, Fernando Belmontes, Jr., in the commission of the special circumstance had the specific intent that death occur.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Defendant argues that these findings were unauthorized \u201cspecial verdicts\u201d within the meaning of section 1150 and thus violative of his due process rights.  We have recently rejected identical arguments and approved the use of \u201cspecial findings\u201d at the guilt phase such as were made here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 89-90 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 536-538 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 247, 273-275 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 59 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423].)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, in contrast to <em>Burgener, </em>here the jury was <em>explicitly </em>instructed in connection with the special findings that they could only be found true unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Nor is there any merit to defendant\u2019s claim that the special finding of premeditation and deliberation is factually unsupported. Defendant\u2019s admitted acts of arming himself with the iron bar, following McConnell to the front door when Bolanos and Vasquez were heard driving up, and striking her in the head with the bar with as much force as he could muster in a \u201cback-handed sweeping motion,\u201d alone support the jury\u2019s finding of premeditation and deliberation beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Lastly, we reject out of hand defendant\u2019s further arguments that the special findings were \u201cunreliable, ambiguous, and meaningless surplusage,\u201d and that defense counsel had no \u201cnotice of\u2019 their \u201cpotential legal significance\u201d or \u201copportunity to contest their factual basis.\u201d The charges and special circumstance alleged in the information, as well as the record of proceedings on pretrial motions and the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, all belie these assertions. Defendant\u2019s own extrajudicial admissions that he armed himself before entering McConnell\u2019s residence, personally felled her with a blow from the iron bar, and completed the burglary and fencing of the stereo, surely put counsel on notice of the independent viability of the People\u2019s premeditated-murder <em>and </em>felony-murder theories of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>11. <em>Refusal to Instruct on Lesser-related Offenses and Aider-abettor Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In reliance on our opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055], defendant contends it was error to refuse his requested instructions on the <em>lesser-related </em>offenses of assault with a deadly weapon, battery, and simple theft. Recognizing that we expressly declared the rule in <em>Geiger </em>to be prospective only <em>(id., </em>at p. 532, fn. 13), he nevertheless urges \u201cthat a narrow exception of retroactivity should be carved for capital appellants.\u201d We decline the invitation. We explained in <em>Geiger </em>that \u201cthe purpose of instructing on related offenses is primarily prophylactic . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, these facts do not support the possibility that the jury would have convicted defendant of the lesser-related offenses under the refused instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We further reject defendant\u2019s claim that it was prejudicial error to refuse his requested instructions on aider-abettor liability. (CALJIC Nos. 3.00-3.02.) The court refused to so instruct the jury because the People had elected to proceed on an uncharged conspiracy theory of vicarious liability. Belmontes\u2019s hollow defense would have fared no better under aider-abettor instructions. Under conspiracy law the People had a higher burden of proof; having to establish specific intent to conspire <em>and </em>commit the burglary, as well as completion of overt acts in furtherance thereof. Moreover, in order to withdraw from the planned burglary as an aider-abettor, defendant would have had to have notified his accomplices <em>and further </em>done everything in his power to prevent commission of the crime. (CALJIC No. 3.02.) In contrast, to withdraw from a conspiracy, one need only make an affirmative repudiation communicated to his coconspirators. (CALJIC No. 6.20.) Defendant preferred no facts suggestive of his \u201cwithdrawal\u201d under either theory. In any case, given the evidence and special findings made by the jury, any error in refusing the requested aider-abettor instructions was necessarily harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">C. Special Circumstance Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">1. <em>Carlos Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Defendant urges that we strike the special circumstance under authority of <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], wherein we held that intent to kill is an element of the felony-murder special circumstance of the 1978 death penalty law, whether applied to accomplices or to actual killers. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 153-154.) His contention must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has made clear that felony murderers who <em>personally </em>killed may properly be subject to the death penalty in conformance with the Eighth Amendment\u2014after proper consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\u2014even where no intent to kill is shown. <em>(Cabana </em>v. <em>Bullock </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 376, 386-387 [88 L.Ed.2d 704, 716-717, 106 S.Ct. 689, 697]; see <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 137, 152 [95 L.Ed.2d 127, 141, 107 S.Ct. 1676, 1685].) Subsequently, \u201c[i]n <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>[(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1147 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306]], we held that with respect to the actual killer, the court need not instruct on intent to kill in connection with felony-murder special circumstances. Such an instruction is required only when there is evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant was an accomplice rather than the actual killer.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1193 [240 Cal.Rptr. 666, 743 P.2d 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Here the jury made express findings that defendant <em>personally </em>committed an intentional, wilful, deliberate, premeditated murder; that the killing was the result of the commission or attempted commission of the burglary; and that defendant was the <em>actual killer </em>and had harbored specific intent to kill. We have rejected the several grounds upon which defendant urges that these special findings were procedurally defective. <em>(Ante, </em>at pp. 793-794.) The evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant <em>personally </em>and <em>intentionally </em>killed McConnell\u2014and its rejection of his claim that Vasquez was in the house at the time and \u201cmust have\u201d killed her while he (defendant) was busy ransacking the house.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">2. <em>Construing the Felony-murder Special Circumstance as Limited to Premeditated and Deliberate Murders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Defendant urges us to construe the felony-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) as limited to <em>premeditated </em>and <em>deliberate </em>intentional murders. Such was the requirement under the former 1977 death penalty legislation. <em>(Carlos, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 138-143.) In <em>Carlos </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he 1978 initiative repealed provisions of the 1977 act requiring physical presence and a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing before the jury could find a felony-murder special circumstance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 143.) The United States Supreme Court has since made it clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>that the Eighth Amendment too does not compel such limitations upon death-qualifying felony murders. <em>(Cabana </em>v. <em>Bullock, supra, </em>474 U.S. at pp. 386-387 [88 L.Ed.2d at pp. 716-717, 106 S.Ct. at p. 697]; see <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 152 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 141, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1685].)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">3. <em>Corroboration of Accomplice Testimony to Prove Special Circumstance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Defendant renews his assertion that the only evidence of his intent to kill came from the uncorroborated accomplice testimony of Bolanos. He argues such as a separate ground for reversal of the special circumstance finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Section 190.4, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part that: \u201cWherever a special circumstance requires proof of the commission or attempted commission of a crime, such crime shall be charged and proved pursuant to the general law applying to the trial and conviction of the crime.\u201d We have already rejected defendant\u2019s claims that Bolanos\u2019s testimony was the sole source of evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to kill, and that Bolanos\u2019s testimony in this regard went uncorroborated. (Ante, at p. 782.) By parity of reasoning we find the instant claim to be without merit. (Cf. <em>People v. McDonald </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 351, 378 [208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709, 46 A.L.R.4th 1011] [construing \u00a7 190.4 in the context of double jeopardy principles]; <em>People v.

Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">\n<em>Evidence in Aggravation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">At the penalty phase the prosecutor introduced evidence of (1) defendant\u2019s acquisition of a handgun in early 1979; (2) defendant\u2019s carrying the gun for protection during the same time period; (3) his April 1979 conviction as an accessory to voluntary manslaughter; (4) a domestic aggravated assault and battery during the month preceding McConnell\u2019s murder; (5) an altercation occurring while defendant was a ward in a county youth facility; and (6) autopsy photographs depicting the nature and extent of McConnell\u2019s fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\n<em>Acquisition of the Handgun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In early 1979, William Cartwright managed a motel in Ontario, California, and was casually acquainted with defendant. He testified regarding an occasion when one \u201cRudy\u201d met defendant at the motel and attempted to sell him a .32 caliber automatic handgun which he had acquired in a burglary. Rudy handed the loaded weapon to defendant and asked if he wanted to buy it. Defendant cocked the trigger, pointed it at Rudy and replied; \u201cI\u2019ve got it now. Why buy it?\u201d Rudy left the premises and defendant retained the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\n<em>Evidence of Defendant's Carrying the Gun for Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Steven Cartwright testified he was acquainted with defendant in February 1979. He recalled a discussion with defendant who alluded to the fact that some people were \u201cupset\u201d with him. As defendant said this he indicated he had a gun in his belt, slapped his side, and stated he was not concerned as he had all the protection he needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\n<em>Prior Conviction as an Accessory to Voluntary Manslaughter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The prosecution and defense stipulated that on April 16, 1979, in San Bernardino County Municipal Court, defendant entered a plea of no contest to a charge of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter (\u00a7\u00a7 32, 192, subd. (1)), a felony, and was thereafter sentenced after preparation of a probation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">\n<em>Altercation in Youth Facility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In May 1979, defendant was a ward under the supervision of group counselor Ron Cutler. Cutler testified regarding an incident when defendant was observed swinging a chair and about to hit another ward. Cutler was able to knock the chair out of defendant\u2019s hands in mid-air before he could strike the other youth with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">\n<em>Domestic Aggravated Assault and Battery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">In February 1981, defendant, Barbara Murillo (then four months pregnant with defendant\u2019s second child), and their two-year-old daughter were living in an apartment in Lodi rented for them by Murillo\u2019s parents. Murillo testified for the People regarding an incident that occurred when Bolanos, Cobarrubio, and others were visiting at the apartment. Murillo and defendant got into an argument which escalated into an altercation. Murillo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>grabbed a \u201cfile\u201d for protection and attempted to phone the police. Defendant cut the telephone cord with his knife. Murillo tried to get out of the apartment. Defendant pushed her and hit her on the head; at one point causing her to drop their infant daughter. He shoved Murillo to the ground and choked her; others present managed to temporarily thwart the attack. Murillo broke out a window and tried to escape through it. Defendant, with the assistance of another male, caught up with and dragged or carried her back into the apartment. A neighbor finally summoned the police who arrived as defendant was leaving the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>Evidence in Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Defendant was one month shy of age 20 at the time of McConnell\u2019s murder. His mother testified that her marriage to his father was an unhappy one. He was an alcoholic prone to violence and would beat her; breaking her arm on one occasion, stabbing her in another incident. Defendant was 10 years old when the marriage broke up. Mrs. Belmontes remarried; she testified defendant\u2019s stepfather was strict and defendant became difficult to control when the second marriage ended after five years. Defendant had not lived with his mother since being committed to the California Youth Authority in 1979. At the time of trial defendant had a younger brother and sister. Ms. Belmontes characterized defendant\u2019s relationship with his sister as \u201cvery close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Defendant\u2019s grandfather testified that he and his wife were close to defendant, who attended his grandmother\u2019s funeral in 1978. He confirmed that defendant\u2019s natural father drank to excess and beat his daughter (defendant\u2019s mother). The grandfather had no contact with defendant after his release from the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Robert Martinez, age 24, testified on defendant\u2019s behalf. They were close friends during their early teens and usually spent their time working on Martinez\u2019s \u201clow rider\u201d automobile, smoking marijuana and drinking beer, and \u201changing around\u201d a car club. Defendant was \u201cbest man\u201d at Martinez\u2019s wedding. Martinez felt defendant was not a violent person. He and his wife had no contact with defendant after his one visit with them shortly after his release from the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Martinez\u2019s wife Darlene testified she considered defendant a close friend. She was a born-again Christian; when defendant visited with them after his release from the Youth Authority he had advised her that he too was a born-again Christian. He also mentioned his struggling relationship with Murillo and expressed concern that she was not a Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Reverend Dale Barrett, chaplain at the California Youth Authority\u2019s Pine Grove Facility, knew defendant from his participation in the \u201cM-2\u201d program, under which a member-family of a local church would be matched with a ward, who in turn would be permitted to visit with the family at specified times. Defendant was matched with Beverly and Fred Haro and participated in the program for about a year. Defendant was baptized during his stay in the Youth Authority. Reverend Barrett felt that unlike the many wards who stayed in the program only to get out of camp and manipulate favors from the sponsoring families, defendant had not \u201cconned\u201d them. He testified that although he personally believed in the death penalty as a deterrent to premeditated murders, he did not feel defendant deserved to die because he was a salvageable person with extenuating circumstances in his life. Although his knowledge of defendant\u2019s crimes was concededly limited, it was his understanding that they had not been conclusively determined as premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The Haros testified they were members of Reverend Barrett\u2019s church. Through participation in the \u201cM-2\u201d program defendant had spent Wednesday evenings and weekends with them over a period of time. The Haros also sponsored other wards whom they treated as their own sons. They felt they had a good relationship with defendant, who on occasion had attended church with them. They felt defendant had been a good influence on their own teenage son. Fred Haro testified he was \u201cstrongly for the death penalty\u201d but believed defendant was innocent of the charges and thus did not deserve to die. Beverly Haro felt Barbara Murillo was the primary negative factor in defendant\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Don Miller, assistant chaplain at the Youth Authority\u2019s Preston Facility and director of the \u201cM-2\u201d program, helped place defendant in a halfway house in Oakland upon his release from the Youth Authority. He was aware that defendant stayed in that facility only two weeks before moving to the Lodi area to take a job with the forest service. Defendant returned to Preston on a few occasions after his release and spoke to wards about what life was like \u201con the outside.\u201d Reverend Miller believed defendant would be good at talking with other prisoners if he were committed to prison for a life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He had a poor relationship with his father who would come home drunk and hit his mother. He did not like school and stopped attending in the ninth grade. Although his youth was \u201cpretty hard,\u201d defendant twice stressed he did not want to \u201cuse it as a crutch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Defendant was in the custody of the Youth Authority from early 1979 through his release in November 1980. He worked on the fire crew at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Pine Grove Camp for one year. He admitted he initially entered the \u201cM-2\u201d program as a way to get out of camp. Thereafter, he studied the Bible with the Haros and in time started serving the Lord. He was paroled from the Youth Authority after serving his maximum sentence. He stayed at the halfway house in Oakland for two weeks and then went to Southern California for a short period, returning with Murillo to the Lodi area to take a job with the forest service. Things did not go well for defendant while he was living with Murillo. He \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal with\u201d his religious commitment and \u201cstarted going back to [his] old ways,\u201d in part due to \u201cpressure on the streets.\u201d At the time of trial, defendant had not abandoned his religious beliefs but felt he was no longer \u201cdedicated one hundred percent\u201d to his religious commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary stage, the court permitted defendant to personally address the jury in his own behalf during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">B. Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">1. <em>Use of Peremptory Challenges to Exclude Prospective Jurors Expressing Reservations About the Death Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly exercised peremptory challenges to excuse four prospective jurors who\u2014although not excusable for cause under <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770]\u2014nevertheless expressed some reservations about the death penalty. We have rejected the argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669], wherein we found \u201cno . . . constitutional infirmity in permitting peremptory challenges by both sides on the basis of specific juror attitudes on the death penalty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">2. <em>Instructions on Sympathy and General Character and Background Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Defendant argues that the jury was misinstructed on the proper role of sympathy and general character and background evidence in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 759 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741], we explained: \u201cWe previously reversed several death judgments where (1) a \u2018no-sympathy\u2019 instruction was given <em>at the penalty phase, </em>(2) the jury also received, without elaboration, an instruction (the \u2018unadorned factor (k) instruction\u2019) to consider mitigating evidence which \u2018extenuates the <em>gravity of the </em>[capital] crime\u2019 (\u00a7 190.3, subd. (k); former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (j); CALJIC, former No. 8.84.1, subd. (k), italics added), and (3) defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>introduced substantial evidence about his <em>general character and background. </em>In such cases, we reasoned, there was intolerable ambiguity about whether the jury understood its power and duty under the Eighth Amendment to consider <em>all </em>\u2018sympathetic\u2019 evidence defendant proffered on behalf of a penalty less than death. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 537-538 [220 Cal.Rptr. 637, 709 P.2d 440]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 163, 166-169 [203 Cal.Rptr. 122, 680 P.2d 1081]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 878-879 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813]; see <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 104, 117 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 12, 102 S.Ct. 869], and conc. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J., at p. 119.)[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512, to consider the constitutional effect of a \u2018no-sympathy\u2019 admonition on penalty deliberations in a capital case. The court has concluded that a warning to ignore \u2018mere\u2019 sympathy does not offend the Eighth Amendment in and of itself. However, where the jury was cautioned against sympathy and also received an unadorned factor (k) instruction, the penalty-phase instructions and arguments must be examined as a whole to determine whether the jury was \u2018adequately informed ... of its responsibility to consider all of the mitigating evidence introduced by the [defendant] . . . .\u2019 <em>(California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538, 546 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 943, 107 S.Ct. 837] [conc. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We conclude the jury here was adequately informed of the full nature of its responsibility to consider sympathy and general character and background evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">First, the standardized \u201cno-sympathy\u201d instruction was not given in this case. At the People\u2019s request, a modified version of CALJIC No. 1.00 was given. The words \u201csympathy\u201d and \u201cpassion\u201d were omitted from the first sentence of the instruction, which as modified read: \u201cYou are instructed that as jurors you must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, [ ] . . . prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling.\u201d (Contrast CALJIC No. 1.00.) The following charge was then read after the first modified sentence: \u201cAlso, you must not be influenced by sympathy or passion except as those feelings properly arise out of your consideration of the proven factors in aggravation and mitigation.\u201d Thus the trial judge and prosecutor here presciently fashioned an instruction which satisfies the directives announced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the United States Supreme Court nearly five years later in <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837].<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Next, although the jury did receive an instruction in the literal terms of factor (k), it was also instructed that only <em>statutory </em>aggravating factors could be properly considered (\u00a7 190.3), immediately followed by a special instruction which stated: \u201cthe mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you <em>merely as examples </em>of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death sentence upon Mr. Belmontes. You should pay careful attention to each of these factors. Any one of them, standing alone, may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case [italics added].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument reinforces our conclusion that, as instructed, the jury must have fully understood its obligation to weigh all of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence. He told the jurors: \u201cWith respect to the instructions ... in this listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances which you are to weigh one against the other, there is a proper place for sympathy and passion, ffl] . . . At this stage of the proceedings you are not only the judges of the facts, you decide how much they weigh. And in weighing them, it is proper to take into account factors that impinge upon anger and sympathy and so forth.\u201d He went on to explain: \u201cLet me tell you what that doesn\u2019t mean, if I may. Your regard for Steacy McConnell\u2019s family, mean no one [s/c], no one can deny sympathy for them, no one. But that is not the kind of sympathy the instruction tells you to consider. It says as sympathy or passion. naturally arises or properly arises from the factors in aggravation and mitigation. ... [^] ... it is different from the guilt phase when sympathy was to play no part at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">In discussing the scope of \u201cfactor (k)\u201d evidence in his argument, the prosecutor did at first express some doubt as to whether evidence of defendant\u2019s prior religious experience \u201creally fits in there.\u201d However, he quickly concluded: \u201cI think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\u201d He then argued his position that defendant\u2019s religious experience <em>prior to the murder </em>was not a strong mitigating factor under all the circumstances. He suggested the jury should \u201cweigh\u201d defendant\u2019s \u201creligious awakening\u201d as \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>basis for determining penalty,\u201d particularly in the context of Reverend Miller\u2019s opinion that, if given a life term, defendant would be good at talking and working with other prisoners. The prosecutor concluded in this vein: \u201cI think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There\u2019s something to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Finally, in summing up all the penalty phase evidence, the prosecutor candidly stated: \u201cThe prior criminal activity has been described to you on the stand isn\u2019t great, you know. [][] All right. So these things, they really, they don\u2019t show that the defendant is such a horrible person that the ultimate penalty must be imposed.\u201d The prosecutor went so far as to suggest that the aggravating factors\u2014other than those circumstances directly related to the murder\u2014came to a \u201cdraw.\u201d The thrust of his penalty phase argument was that the aggravated circumstances of the crime itself were the major factors outweighing the mitigating evidence and militating in favor of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Viewing the instructions and arguments as a whole, we conclude there exists \u201cno legitimate basis\u201d for believing the jury was misled regarding its sentencing responsibilities. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 546 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 943, 107 S.Ct. at p. 842] [conc. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">3. <em>\u201cMandatory\u201d Nature of 1978 Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Defendant attacks the instruction which charged the jury that it \u201cshall\u201d impose death if it finds that aggravating \u201coutweigh\u201d mitigating circumstances. (CALJIC, former No. 8.84.2; see \u00a7 190.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">We recently summarized the relevant principles in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pages 1203-1204 as follows: \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 538-545 (revd. on other grounds <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837]), we concluded that the directive of section 190.3 that the trier of fact \u2018shall impose a sentence of death\u2019 if it \u2018concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances,\u2019 did not impermissibly restrict the jury\u2019s constitutional sentencing discretion. We rejected the defendant\u2019s proffered mechanistic construction of the words \u2018outweigh\u2019 and \u2018shall\u2019 in favor of one which directed the jury to weigh the various factors and determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is appropriate in a particular case. We noted, however, that the statutory language\u2014particularly the words \u2018shall impose\u2019\u2014left room for some confusion about the jury\u2019s role and therefore directed courts in the future to instruct on the scope of the jury\u2019s discretion. We further stated that each prior case \u2018must be examined on its own merits to determine whether, in context, the sentencer may have been misled to defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>prejudice about the scope of its sentencing discretion under the 1978 law.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 544, fn. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\u201cOur concerns in <em>Brown </em>were essentially two: The first was that the jury might be confused about the nature of the weighing process, that it is not a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale but rather a mental balancing process. Our second concern was that use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 might mislead the jury as to the substance of the ultimate determination it was called upon to make. In <em>Brown, </em>we concluded that the statutory language \u2018should not be understood to require any juror to vote for the death penalty unless, upon completion of the \u201cweighing\u201d process, he decides that death is the appropriate penalty under all the circumstances. Thus the jury, by weighing the various factors, simply determines under the relevant evidence which penalty is appropriate in the particular case.\u2019 (40 Cal.3d at p. 541.)\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1276-1277 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We have examined the instructions and arguments in this regard and determine that, overall, the jury was adequately informed of the full nature of its sentencing responsibility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 544, fn. 17.) While it heard the \u201cshall/outweigh\u201d instruction, the jury also received additional instructions further defining its proper sentencing function. It was told that aggravating factors were strictly limited by statute and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As already noted, it was further told that the mitigating factors enumerated in the statute were merely \u201cexamples\u201d of mitigating circumstances which could be considered, and that any one mitigating circumstance <em>standing alone </em>could support a decision that death is not the appropriate penalty in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Regarding counsel\u2019s arguments, here, as in <em>Allen, </em>\u201cthe prosecutor not once suggested the weighing process was a mechanical function. Indeed, he effectively told the jury just the opposite, and attempted to give guidelines that could be applied by each individual juror to first value and then weigh the respective factors.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1277.) He told the jury they must \u201cweigh\u201d aggravating against mitigating drum-stances in determining penalty, and explained: \u201c[Y]ou decide how much they weigh.\u201d He used the terms \u201cweigh,\u201d \u201csimple weighing,\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d several times in his discussions of each of the individual aggravating and mitigating circumstances. He urged the jury to assess defendant\u2019s prior religious experience and attempt to determine \u201chow much does that weigh.\u201d He stated that defendant\u2019s potential value to the community or prison population should he be sentenced to life imprisonment was \u201csomething you have to weigh in.\u201d He stressed to the jurors that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>obvious intelligence was \u201ca factor to be weighed,\u201d as was any lingering doubt about his guilt of McConnell\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">As already noted, the prosecutor suggested that the aggravating circumstances\u2014exclusive of those directly related to the brutal murder\u2014did not in and of themselves warrant the death penalty. Our review of the instructions and arguments as a whole compels rejection of defendant\u2019s assertion that the giving of the \u201cshall/weigh\u201d instruction \u201cmisled the jury into abandoning its role as conscience of the community and assuming a role more akin to that of a penological account,\u201d \u201cgoverned by the type of \u2018arithmetical formula\u2019 condemned in <em>[Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Lastly, defendant refers us specifically to one juror\u2019s (Juror Hearn\u2019s) inquiry about \u201cthe listing\u201d of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. She asked, \u201cThat was the listing, right?\u201d and then inquired: \u201cOf those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?\u201d The court responded: \u201cThat is right. It is a balancing process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">At oral argument, appellate counsel asserted that these inquiries reflect that \u201cMrs. Hearn was seeking judicial confirmation of her restrictive view of the scope of factors which should go into the penalty phase deliberations.\u201d We cannot agree with counsel\u2019s conclusion that the juror\u2019s mere reference to the statutory \u201clisting\u201d of aggravating and mitigating factors\u2014 as a predicate to her question about the balancing process\u2014reflected, her \u201crestrictive\u201d view of factor (k) evidence. Nor can we agree that \u201cthe court compounded the error in its response, \u2018That was the listing, yes.\u2019 \u201d Counsel suggests that the \u201cconstitutionally correct\u201d answer would have been: \u201cThat list is exhausting [s/c] as to aggravating factors, but it is only illustrative as to mitigating factors.\u201d That is precisely what the court\u2019s modified instructions on mitigating evidence conveyed. <em>(Ante, </em>at pp. 800-801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Defendant also infers from Juror Hearn\u2019s use of the term \u201cbalance the sheet\u201d in her inquiry that she was following the type of \u201carithmetical formula\u201d which this court condemned in <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512. But viewed in the overall context of the instructions and arguments, neither the juror\u2019s question nor the court\u2019s response supports an inference of reversible <em>Brown </em>error. Defendant misreads our statement in Brown\u2014to the effect that in weighing mitigating against aggravating circumstances \u201cthe balance is not between good and bad but between life and death\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 542, fn. 13)\u2014as a blanket condemnation of use of the term \u201cbalancing\u201d to describe the \u201cweighing\u201d process. Elsewhere in <em>Brown </em>we characterized the term \u201cweighing\u201d as \u201cconnot[ing] a mental balancing process. ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 541.) There is nothing inherently misleading in use of the term \u201cbalancing\u201d to describe the weighing process\u2014where the instructions and argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>merits taken as a whole fully and properly define the scope and nature of the jury\u2019s sentencing responsibilities.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">4. <em>Requiring Appropriateness of Death Penally to Be Shown Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Defendant asserts that the 1978 death penalty law is unconstitutional in that it fails to require the jury to find <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>(1) that the aggravating factors outweigh those in mitigation, and (2) that death is the appropriate penalty. We have recently rejected these identical arguments. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 762-763; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-779 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">5. <em>Specific Findings on Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances at the Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Defendant argues that the court erred in denying defense counsel\u2019s request that the jury be required to make specific findings regarding any aggravating or mitigating factors found to be true. We have recently rejected this argument; written findings disclosing the precise reasons for the jury\u2019s penalty verdict are not required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 777-779; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1285; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 178-180 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587] [1977 death penalty law]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Pulley </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 692 F.2d 1189, 1195-1196, vacated and remanded on other grounds, <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 37 [79 L.Ed.2d 29, 104 S.Ct. 871].)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">6. <em>Age as an Aggravating Factor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">One of the factors to be considered by the penalty phase jury \u201cif relevant\u201d is \u201c[t]he age of the defendant at the time of the crime.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (i).)  The prosecutor here told the jury it was for them to determine whether defendant\u2019s age was a factor in aggravation or mitigation. He went on to argue: \u201cThe defendant may well say I was only 19 when this happened or the attorney may say he was only 19 and when you\u2019re young you sometimes you make mistakes, mistakes that you would never make if you were 29 or 39. And that sort of thing must be taken into account. When you are young, your judgment isn\u2019t right or isn\u2019t mature or developed, [fl] On the other hand, however, it\u2019s common experience that when you\u2019re young peo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>pie are idealistic, altruistic, they believe that anything is possible, that people love one another or that everything is good or all is good for them and that as they age, a cynicism creeps in. Maybe that\u2019s too strong a word. A hardening, maybe. And that it doesn\u2019t always necessarily mean that you\u2019re a better person when you get older, fl[] Going the other way around, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a better person when you\u2019re younger, either, [fi] All I\u2019m saying is that I think the age of the defendant goes both ways, really.\u201d In further commenting on defendant\u2019s own testimony that he was not relying on his difficult childhood to justify his criminal acts, the prosecutor stated: \u201cBut he\u2019s old enough that he has to take responsibility for his own actions, and he told you that. He can\u2019t use that as a crutch. I give him credit for recognizing that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Defendant asserts that this was improper argument on age as an aggravating factor. Initially, we note that defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments or to request an appropriate admonition. Accordingly, to the extent he is arguing \u201cmisconduct,\u201d he has waived the objection on this ground on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 788; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 1283-1284; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We recently stated that \u201cmere chronological age, a factor over which one can exercise no control, should not of itself be deemed an <em>aggravating </em>factor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 789.) On the other hand, \u201cmere chronological age of itself should not be deemed a mitigating factor. Age alone is plainly \u2018a factor over which one can exercise no control.\u2019 (Rodriguez, <em>supra, </em>at p. 789) .... [^] In our view, the word \u2018age\u2019 in statutory sentencing factor (i) is used as a metonym for any age-related matter suggested by the evidence or by common experience or morality that might reasonably inform the choice of penalty. Accordingly, either counsel may argue any such age-related inference in every case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucky </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Here the prosecutor in essence argued that defendant\u2019s age was a \u201cneutral\u201d factor: \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that I think the age of the defendant goes both ways, really.\u201d He did not declare affirmatively that defendant\u2019s \u201cmere chronological age\u201d of almost 20 years weighed in favor of the death penalty. (Rodriguez, <em>supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 789.) He remarked that defendant was \u201cold enough that he has to take responsibility for his own actions.\u201d Such comment \u201creasonably may be viewed as merely arguing the inapplicability of a mitigating factor, rather than seeking to penalize defendant by reason of his age.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>7. <em>Lack of Remorse as an Aggravating Factor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor impermissibly argued lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. The prosecutor told the jury: \u201c[Defendant] can\u2019t suggest to you he feels remorse, because ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that is the one thing that we have never heard, that he is sorry. As a matter of fact, the only emotion, the only genuine emotion that I saw, and I think you saw, came during his cross-examination on the guilt phase when he expressed anger at Domingo Vasquez for standing and staring in shock instead of picking up the stereo. So there is no remorse. No thought of Steacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">It is clear that the People may not present evidence in aggravation unless it is relevant to an aggravating circumstance expressly listed in section 190.3 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 771-776 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on remorse. Nor did he request a curative admonition. To the extent he is claiming it was \u201cmisconduct\u201d to affirmatively argue lack of remorse as an aggravating factor, he has waived the objection on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 788; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 1283-1284; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\u201c[W]e have held that, under a prior death penalty law, the presence or absence of remorse is a factor relevant to the jury\u2019s penalty decision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>[(1969)] 71 Cal.2d [1159,] at p. 1168 [80 Cal.Rptr. 920, 459 P.2d 248].) The concept of remorse for past offenses as a mitigating factor sometimes warranting less severe punishment or condemnation is universal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Although in <em>Davenport </em>we held that \u201cin the future\u201d prosecutors should refrain from arguing the mere absence of a mitigating factor as itself constituting an aggravating circumstance (41 Cal.3d at p. 289), here the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, \u201cas in his comments on age . . . did no more than suggest the <em>inapplicability </em>of a <em>mitigating </em>factor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 790; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 771.) It was part-and-parcel of his overall argument that each category of defendant\u2019s penalty phase evidence (e.g., defendant\u2019s \u201creligious beliefs\u201d within the \u201ccatchall provision\u201d of factor (k)) was worthy of assignment of only marginal mitigating \u201cweight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Lastly, even were we to read the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument as affirmatively advancing defendant\u2019s lack of remorse as an aggravating cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>cumstance, our review of the record convinces us that such remarks could not have affected the jury\u2019s penalty verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 775-776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">8. <em>Evidence of Other Criminal Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Defendant argues that the admission of prior <em>unadjudicated </em>criminal conduct at the penalty phase violated his state and federal due process rights. The claim lacks merit. Section 190.3 constitutionally permits introduction at the penalty phase of evidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct as relevant to and bearing upon the character and record of the individual offender. \u201cAs the plurality opinion in <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 280, 304 [49 L.Ed.2d 944, 961, 96 S.Ct. 2978], emphasized: \u2018 . . . [I]n capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment [citation] <em>requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender </em>and the circumstances of the particular offense <em>as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics added.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 58 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279], first italics added; see <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>455 U.S. 104, 111-112 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 8-9]; <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 604-605 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 989-990, 98 S.Ct. 2954] (plur. opn.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Defendant further contends that none of his prior instances of unadjudicated criminal conduct constituted a cognizable criminal offense involving force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Insofar as section 190.3 contemplates consideration of defendant\u2019s criminal history (see factors (b), (c)), such evidence \u201cmust be limited to . . . conduct that demonstrates the commission of an actual crime, specifically, the violation of a penal statute. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72; see also <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 776-778.) We have also made clear the distinction between \u201ccriminal activity\u201d and \u201cconvictions\u201d for purposes of section 190.3. \u201cThe plain meaning of [factors] (b) and (c) of section 190.3 is that the jury must consider any <em>violent </em>criminal activity by the defendant, <em>whether or not it led to prosecution and conviction </em>[fn. omitted], <em>and </em>any \u2018prior <em>felony </em>conviction\u2019 (italics added), whether the underlying offense was violent or nonviolent. (See . . . <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 774, 776.) . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 201 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480], second italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The prosecutor was entitled to present testimonial evidence of violent \u201ccriminal activity\u201d with which defendant had never been charged. <em>(Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 201, 205; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 53.) Defendant\u2019s domestic altercation with Murillo; his pointing a loaded gun at \u201cRudy\u201d in order to appropriate the weapon; and his apparently unprovoked act of swinging a chair at another ward at a youth facility, were all violent criminal offenses (aggravated assault, battery, assault with a deadly weapon, and simple assault) and thus properly argued as aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">It was error, however, to admit evidence that defendant, while in the presence of an acquaintance, once slapped his side indicating he had a handgun in his waistband, while stating he had \u201call the protection he needed.\u201d Although such is arguably an \u201cexpress or implied threat to use force or violence\u201d (\u00a7 190.3), it was not directed at a particular victim or victims, and did not amount to criminal conduct in violation of a penal statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 72.) The Attorney General concedes as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We find the error nonprejudicial. This case was tried before <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 29, and <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 144, were decided. The jury was instructed on the requirement that \u201cother crimes\u201d be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 55.) The properly admitted aggravating evidence in this case\u2014in particular, the circumstances of the crime (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a))\u2014was simply overwhelming. It would require capricious speculation for us to conclude that the erroneous admission of evidence of the \u201cgun slapping\u201d incident affected the penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Lastly, defendant argues that evidence of his 1979 felony conviction upon a plea of \u201cno contest\u201d to being an accessory to voluntary manslaughter should have been excluded. He asserts that such a plea \u201cdemonstrates only that a defendant is willing to accept the punishment prescribed for a particular offense,\u201d and \u201cdoes not establish the truth of the facts implied or contained in the charge.\u201d The claim is specious. Section 1016 provides, in pertinent part, that: \u201cThe legal effect of [a nolo contendere] plea, to a crime punishable as a felony, shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty for all purposes.\u201d Moreover, defendant <em>stipulated </em>to introduction of this evidence. Evidence of the prior felony conviction was properly admitted. (\u00a7 190.3, factor (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">9. <em>Juror Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">During a break in the penalty phase, defense counsel advised the court that he had observed a juror, Mr. Meyers, talking to Mr. McConnell, a member of the victim\u2019s family. Counsel had also seen one of the four alternate jurors, Ms. Romans, conversing with the victim\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>A hearing was conducted in chambers on the matter. Juror Meyers explained that he was \u201cdiscussing motorcycles\u201d with Mr. McConnell. The conversation was \u201cpurely social;\u201d nothing had been said about defendant or the trial proceedings. Defense counsel asked Meyers: \u201c[D]o you think there is anything about the fact that you have had a chance to be exposed to Mr. McConnell in this social vein or whatever you would have some rapport or feeling with him that would prejudice or be a concern to me or Mr. Belmontes?\u201d Meyers responded, \u201cNo.\u201d He expressed a clear understanding of the court\u2019s concerns. When asked, \u201cSupposing you were to make a decision he [Mr. McConnell] didn\u2019t agree with, mainly life in prison, do you feel you could look him in the eye?\u201d Meyers responded, \u201cSure.\u201d He then apologized for causing a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Alternate Juror Romans was similarly questioned. She revealed she had talked briefly with the victim\u2019s grandmother, who was hard of hearing, on a \u201cpersonal\u201d level; \u201cjust wondering how she was, you know, holding up or something like that.\u201d Since Romans ultimately never sat on defendant\u2019s jury, there is no concern that her contact was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The prosecutor informed the court that he had instructed the members of the victim\u2019s family \u201cnot to talk to the prospective jurors, although that was some time ago.\u201d He advised the court that he would do so again. The court denied counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial, stating on the record that having made the relevant inquiries it found \u201cno taint.\u201d Back in the full jury\u2019s presence, the court admonished the jurors not to talk to any members of the victim\u2019s family, adding: \u201cAnd I would admonish the McConnell family and the Steacy family also, please, whether you want to talk about the stars or the tulips or the roses, I don\u2019t even want you to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Defendant argues that a mistrial should have been granted\u2014or in the alternative\u2014Juror Meyers replaced with an alternate juror other than Ms. Romans.  We have held that jury misconduct raises a presumption of prejudice; unless the prosecution rebuts that presumption by proof that no prejudice actually resulted, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 207 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Honeycutt </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 150, 156 [141 Cal.Rptr. 698, 570 P.2d 1050].)  Our review of the record satisfies us that the presumption was rebutted and no prejudice actually resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">.10. <em>Admissibility of </em>Codefendants\u2019 <em>Plea Dispositions as Mitigating Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the pleas and negotiated dispositions of his accomplices at the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>phase.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree. Evidence of Bolanos\u2019s and Vasquez\u2019s negotiated plea <em>dispositions\u2014separate and apart from evidence of their complicity and degree of involvement in the instant </em>offenses\u2014bore no relevance to the jury\u2019s properly guided function at the penalty phase. \u201c\u2018[I]n capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment. . . requires consideration of <em>the character and record of the individual offender </em>and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death (italics added).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 604 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 989.], quoting <em>Woodson, supra, </em>428 U.S. 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Lockett </em>stated: \u201cWe recognize that, in noncapital cases, the established practice of individualized sentences rests not on constitutional commands, but on public policy enacted into statutes. The considerations that account for the wide acceptance of individualization of sentences in noncapital cases surely cannot be thought less important in capital cases. Given that the imposition of death by public authority is so profoundly different from all other penalties, we cannot avoid the conclusion that an individualized decision is essential in capital cases. <em>The need for treating each defendant in a capital case with that degree of respect due the uniqueness of the individual is far more important than in noncapital cases. </em>A variety of flexible techniques\u2014probation, parole, work furloughs, to name a few\u2014and various post-conviction remedies may be available to modify an initial sentence of confinement in noncapital cases. The nonavailability of corrective or modifying mechanisms with respect to an executed capital sentence underscores the need for individualized consideration as a constitutional requirement in imposing the death sentence [fn. omitted, italics added].\u201d <em>(Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. at pp. 604-605 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 990], italics added; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 1286-1287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In <em>Coulter </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ala.Crim.App. 1982) 438 So.2d 336, 345-346, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, \u201c[a]pplying the principles of <em>Lockett, </em>in light of <em>Eddings [Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 104 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 102 S.Ct. 869]] and <em>Enmund [Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 782 [73 L.Ed.2d 1140, 102 S.Ct. 3368]] . . .,\u201d reasoned that \u201can alleged accomplice\u2019s sentence is a product of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances applicable to the alleged accomplice. <em>In the sentencing phase of the trial, the fact that an alleged accomplice did not receive the death </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>penalty is no more relevant as a mitigating factor for the defendant than the fact that an alleged accomplice did receive the death penalty would be as an aggravating circumstance against him.

In rejecting the contention, the North Carolina Supreme Court wrote: \u201cThe fact that the defendant\u2019s accomplices received a lesser sentence is not an extenuating circumstance. It does not reduce the moral culpability of the killing nor make it less deserving of the penalty of death than other first-degree murders. [Citation.] The accomplices\u2019 punishment is not an aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record nor a mitigating circumstance of the particular offense. (See <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>[, <em>supra,] </em>438 U.S. 586.) It bears no relevance to these factors, and thus there was no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to submit it to the jury.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 261-262.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has likewise rejected the identical contention, concluding that nothing in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Skipper </em>v. <em>South Carolina </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 1 [90 L.Ed.2d 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669], or <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Dugger </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 393 [95 L.Ed.2d 347, 107 S.Ct. 1821], lends any support to the argument that a codefendant\u2019s sentence disposition is relevant to a capital defendant\u2019s character, record, or the circumstances of his offense, as <em>relevancy </em>is defined in <em>Lockett, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586. <em>(Brodgon </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(5th Cir. 1987) 824 F.2d 338, 343; <em>Brogdon </em>v. <em>Blackburn </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 1164, 1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Although we recognize that several Florida decisions have reached a contrary conclusion (see, e.g., <em>Brookings </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1986) 495 So.2d 135, 143; <em>Messer </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1976) 330 So.2d 137, 141-142), we find the rationale of <em>Coulter </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>438 So.2d 336, <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams supra, </em>292 S.E.2d 243, and the <em>Brogdon </em>decisions persuasive and conclude that their holdings should be applied here.  At the guilt phase, defendant\u2019s jury was fully apprised of the roles and degree of participation Solanos and Vasquez each had in the burglary and murder. The jury\u2019s verdicts and special findings, supported by the weight of evidence, establish that defendant was found beyond a reasonable doubt to have personally, intentionally killed McConnell prior to Vasquez\u2019s entry into the victim\u2019s house. Bolanos never entered the house. As a factual matter, defendant\u2019s accomplices clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ly did not share his level of involvement and participation in the murder. On these facts, the holdings of <em>Woodson, supra, </em>428 U.S. 280, <em>Lockett, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586, <em>Eddings, supra, </em>455 U.S. 104, and <em>Enmund, supra, </em>458 U.S. 782 compel the conclusion that Bolanos\u2019s and Vasquez\u2019s <em>individually negotiated dispositions </em>were not \u201cconstitutionally relevant\u201d to defendant\u2019s penalty determination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1287; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">11. <em>Juror Inquiries During Penalty Phase Deliberations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">After less than three hours of deliberation, the jury foreman presented the court with a note inquiring (1) \u201cwhat happens if we can\u2019t agree?\u201d (2) \u201ccan the majority rule on life imprisonment?\u201d and (3) \u201chow long do we deliberate today and what happens if we don\u2019t reach a decision by then?\u201d The court responded by rereading CALJIC No. 8.84.2\u2014as modified at defense counsel\u2019s request\u2014which in essence told the jury they had to choose between life imprisonment without parole and death, and that any verdict had to be unanimous. The concluding sentence of the modified instruction read: \u201cIn order to make a determination as to penalty, all twelve jurors must agree, <em>if you can.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">At this point a juror asked: \u201cIf we can\u2019t, Judge, what happens?\u201d The trial judge replied that he knew what would happen but could not elaborate upon it. Defense counsel requested the court to inquire of the jury whether it would be able to reach a verdict, and the inquiry was posited. One juror responded: \u201cNot the way it is going.\u201d The foreman replied: \u201cThat is tough, yes.\u201d The court then asked the foreman: \u201cDo you think if I allow you to continue to discuss the matter and for you to go over the instructions again with one another, that the possibility of making a decision is there?\u201d The foreman replied: \u201cI believe there is a possibility.\u201d Another juror added: \u201cWe did need more time.\u201d Finally, a different juror asked: \u201c[Wjould this be an either/or situation? . . .\u201d\u2014to which the court replied: \u201cIt is not that. ... If you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Under the 1977 death penalty legislation (former \u00a7 190.4, subd. (b)), if a jury was unable to agree on penalty the court would impose a sentence of life without parole. Under the current death penalty law applicable here, if the jury is unable to agree on penalty the court must impanel a new jury; if the second jury becomes deadlocked, the court in its discretion may impanel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>a third jury or impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to \u201cforthrightly\u201d answer the juror\u2019s inquiry was error. He contends that the only \u201cforthright\u201d reply would have been an instruction in the full-blown language of section 190.4, subdivision (b); i.e., informing the jury of the statutorily mandated procedures and possibility of subsequent retrials in the event of a deadlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We conclude that such an instruction under the 1978 death penalty law would have the potential for unduly confusing and misguiding the jury in their proper role and function in the penalty determination process. Penalty phase juries are presently instructed that their proper task is to decide between a sentence of death and life without the possibility of parole. Any further instruction along the lines suggested herein could well serve to lessen or diminish that obligation in the jurors\u2019 eyes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 511-516 [244 Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803] [1977 death penalty law]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Gainer </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 835, 852 [139 Cal.Rptr. 861, 566 P.2d 997, 97 A.L.R.3d 73] [wherein we held erroneous any instruction which states or implies that a jury\u2019s failure to reach a verdict will necessarily require retrial].)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In any case, the trial judge here responded to the jurors\u2019 questions in a commendably forthright fashion. When initially faced with the inquiries, he sought to avoid any confusion or unseen prejudice by rereading the pertinent CALJIC instruction. But thereafter, when one juror asked the very pointed question: \u201cIs it either/or?\u201d [i.e., automatic imposition of one or the other penalty in the event of a deadlock]\u2014the court prudently avoided misinforming and misleading the jury by stating: \u201cIf you can make that either/or decision. If you cannot, then I will discharge you.\u201d Defendant can claim no prejudice from such a limited disclosure. It bore no resemblance to the often criticized \u201cAllen-type instruction\u201d designed to extract a verdict from a deadlocked jury by admonishing the minority jurors to rethink their positions in light of the majority\u2019s views. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1896) 164 U.S. 492, 501 [41 L.Ed. 528, 530-531, 17 S.Ct. 154].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The jurors deliberated an additional one and a half days after receiving reinstruction and the court\u2019s responses to their inquiries before reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>their penalty verdict. There was no objection to the rereading of CALJ1C No. 8.84.2, nor did trial counsel propose or request any further instructions. No further instructions were required; no prejudice from the court\u2019s replies to the jurors\u2019 inquiries is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">12. <em>Automatic Motion for Modification of the Death Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In every case in which a death penalty is returned, the judge must \u201creview the evidence, consider, take into account, and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances . . . and shall make a determination as to whether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented. The judge shall state on the record the reason for his findings.\u201d (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Defendant urges three grounds of error in the court\u2019s ruling on the automatic motion for modification of sentence. First, he contends that the content of a letter which the trial judge sent to the jurors\u2014after they were discharged but prior to the hearing on the motion\u2014reveals that the court had prejudged the merits of the motion, and could not thereafter render a fair and impartial decision. Second, he argues that the court\u2019s \u201cverbatim\u201d adoption of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by the prosecutor reflects a failure to exercise independent judgment in ruling on the motion. Finally, he contends the court improperly found lack of remorse as an aggravating factor in its findings on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">a. The Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Several days after the jury returned its penalty verdict and was discharged, the trial judge sent the 12 jurors and 4 alternates a letter in which he praised the manner in which they had approached their task and obligations. He indicated his feeling that they were \u201ca credit to the criminal justice system,\u201d and explained: \u201cIt was extremely difficult for me to express these thoughts to you upon your discharge. It was an emotional moment; we had spent many hours together and I now feel I must express my gratitude to you.\u201d He added: <em>\u201cYour decision is acceptable and shall be followed </em>(italics added).\u201d It is this passage which, defendant urges, reveals that the court had prejudged the merits of the automatic motion for modification of his death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel expressed concern \u201cthat what was said in that letter would indicate in any way that the Court had made a decision prior to fully reviewing and hearing everything that was going to be said.\u201d The court responded: \u201cThank you. The statement, [\u2018jyour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>decision is acceptable and shall be followed, [\u2019] is not indicative of the Court having made up its mind nor is it a statement that would forebear any statements, evidence, testimony that would be offered on behalf of Mr. Belmontes. [j[] / <em>think the statement was made for therapeutic purpose more than a legal purpose </em>(italics added).\u201d Counsel did not request the trial judge to recuse himself from hearing the motion. At the conclusion of the hearing the court reaffirmed that it had made an \u201cindependent finding\u201d in affirming the jury\u2019s verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Subsequent to a jury\u2019s discharge, it is not improper to thank or praise the jurors for having dutifully served on the jury and conscientiously performed their functions. In a long and complex capital trial such as this was, it is understandable that the court might want to express gratitude to the jurors along these lines. The trial judge\u2019s communication to the jurors by letter here was plainly intended to convey such sentiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">However, at the time the court sent the letter, it had not yet fully performed its own functions and obligations under the mandate of section 190.4, subdivision (e). Judgment and sentence had yet to be imposed. The court\u2019s remark in the letter: \u201cYour decision is acceptable and shall be followed,\u201d was patently improper. The court must refrain from making any comment indicating that it cannot, or will not, perform its remaining obligations fairly and impartially under the law. Since the jury had performed its functions and properly been discharged, our concern here is not with the fact that the communication was made to the jurors, but with whether the remark establishes an inference that the court <em>in fact </em>had prejudged the merits of the motion, and therefore could not fairly and impartially perform its statutory obligations in ruling thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201cIt is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.)  \u201c \u2018[I]n the absence of any contrary evidence, we are entitled to presume that the trial court . . . properly followed established law.\u2019 [Citation].\u201d <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913 [141 Cal.Rptr. 133, 569 P.2d 727].)  Considering the improper remark in the context of the letter in which it was made, together with the court\u2019s credible explanation that it \u201cwas made for therapeutic purpose more than a legal purpose,\u201d we conclude defendant has not established that the trial judge ultimately failed to make the \u201cindependent determination\u201d respecting the appropriateness of the penalty verdict, as he was obliged to do under section 190.4, subdivision (e). The court\u2019s thorough and detailed findings entered in the record reinforce our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">b. The Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Prior to the hearing on the automatic motion, the prosecutor requested permission to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>law in opposition to modification of the death sentence. Defense counsel stated: \u201cI have no problem with it,\u201d but requested that he too be permitted to do the same. The prosecutor thereafter filed lengthy and detailed proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law. Defense counsel elected to file points and authorities in support of automatic modification of the death sentence. We find nothing improper in affording both defendant and the People the opportunity to file respective supporting and opposition memoranda in connection with the proceeding. Thoughtfully prepared documents of this type are of great assistance to a trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">It is clear from the record that the court relied extensively on the prosecutor\u2019s proposed written findings, incorporating whole portions of them almost verbatim into its own findings in the record. The record likewise reflects that the court did not \u201crubber stamp\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s proposed findings of fact, refusing to subscribe to many of his overly conclusory proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">For example, the prosecutor proposed that the court adopt the following findings: \u201cThe defendant, while waiting in the victim\u2019s home and while talking to her, considered the alternatives available and decided to go through with the burglary, even though the victim was at home. By disabling the victim, he reasoned, the burglary could be completed unimpeded and by killing her, he decided, he would avoid identification as the perpetrator. The defendant knew from his conversations with Vasquez and the victim, that only Vasquez would be suspected. He knew that no one had seen him arrive at the home. He also knew he could hide out in Stockton or Southern California. Therefore, he concluded, the death of Steacy McConnell would eliminate the only person who could link him to the crime, except for his partners in the criminal enterprise, whom he counted on to maintain silence.\u201d These proposed \u201cfindings of fact\u201d were riddled with <em>conclusory </em>inferences of defendant\u2019s state of mind; the court quite properly rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The prosecutor proposed a finding that, upon alighting from the Chevy, Bolanos and Vasquez \u201cwere able to hear the beating taking place inside.\u201d Although such was a fair inference to be drawn from the evidence, the court took pains to more accurately paraphrase the trial testimony, finding: \u201cAs they were outside they were able to hear the sound of thumping taking place inside, according to Ba\u00edlanos\u2019 [sic] testimony.\u201d The prosecutor also proposed that the court make a finding that after the crime, while in the car, \u201c[defendant] then stated that he had killed her to silence a witness.\u201d The court more accurately found that: \u201cHe then stated he had to take out a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Our review of the court\u2019s detailed findings in the record convinces us that it fulfilled its statutory obligation to independently review the jury\u2019s verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">c. Lack of Remorse</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Defendant argues that the court improperly made a finding that his lack of remorse was an aggravating factor. The prosecutor proposed that the court find: \u201c[T]he defendant expressed no remorse of even the slightest degree pretrial, in his guilt phase testimony, in his penalty phase testimony, nor during his closing remarks to the jury at the penalty phase.\u201d The court instead made a finding that: \u201cThe defendant did not express any remorse in the guilt phase of his testimony. In his penalty phase, however, he did indicate to some slight degree his concern for the victim.\u201d This finding was included in that portion of the overall findings discussing mitigating circumstances. For reasons already explained, we find that both the prosector, in his argument to the jury, and the trial court, in its own findings on the automatic motion for modification of sentence, did no more than suggest the <em>inapplicability </em>or insubstantial evidence of remorse as a <em>mitigating </em>factor. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">13. <em>Proportionality Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Defendant urges that we conduct \u201cintercase\u201d proportionality review\u2014i.e., an examination of whether imposition of the death penalty in his case is disproportionate to the penalties imposed on other persons who have committed similar offenses. It is settled that the Eighth Amendment requires no such comparison. <em>(Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>465 U.S. at pp. 51-54 [79 L.Ed.2d at pp. 41-43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Defendant urges that principles of <em>equal protection </em>require that he\u2014as a capitally sentenced defendant\u2014be afforded comparative sentence review equivalent to that provided for determinately sentenced felons under the \u201cdisparate sentence\u201d statute. (\u00a7 1170, subd. (f).) We have recently rejected the identical argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 1286-1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Defendant argues that state and federal proscriptions against \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d require that we conduct \u201cintracase\u201d proportionality review\u2014i.e., an examination of whether defendant\u2019s death sentence is proportionate to his <em>individual </em>culpability, irrespective of the punishment imposed on others. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 477-482 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 423-424 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Defendant was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutality. He bludgeoned McConnell to death with an iron dumbbell bar; the force of the 15 to 20 some-odd blows leaving her with gaping wounds and a cracked skull. Her defensive wounds plainly evidenced a desperate struggle for life at defendant\u2019s hands. The murder occurred in the course of a calculated plan to burglarize the victim\u2019s home, to which defendant had gained entry on false pretenses. After the murder, defendant and his accomplices callously fenced the victim\u2019s stereo components for $100\u2014purchasing beer with a portion of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In the penalty phase the jury was fully apprised of all the factors properly bearing upon whether defendant was eligible for, and deserved, the death penalty. There was, of course, defendant\u2019s relative youth, evidence that he had a difficult childhood, and evidence that prior to the murder he had to some degree embraced religion and impressed others with his sincerity in this regard. However, \u201cnothing in prior decisions of this court, or of the federal courts, suggests that his punishment is constitutionally disproportionate to \u2018the offense\u2019 or \u2018the offender.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">We find no prejudicial error, whether viewed singly or cumulatively, at either the guilt or penalty phases of defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Lucas, C. J., Mosk, J., Broussard, J., Panelli, J., Arguelles, J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied August 18, 1988, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\"> On the date of the crime, defendant was on parole from the California Youth Authority and living in a halfway house in Stockton.

However, we deemed the <em>Aguilar </em>test \u201ca convenient shorthand articulation of previously established principles of California law in the area of hearsay affidavits.\u201d <em>(Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 880.) In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 213 [76 L.Ed.2d 527, 103 S.Ct. 2317], the Supreme Court abandoned the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>\u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d and substituted a \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d analysis. Since McConnell was murdered prior to the effective date of Proposition 8 (June 9, 1982), we have no occasion to consider the effect, if any, of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates </em>upon the facts of this case. <em>(Campa, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 885, fn. 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-10\">We note that counsel did move to suppress the \u201cfruits of defendant\u2019s arrest\u2019\u2019 on other grounds.

The United States Supreme Court has implicitly recognized that a penalty phase juror need not \u201cignore emotional responses\u201d which are \u201crooted in the aggravating and mitigating evidence introduced during the penalty phase.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538, 542 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 940, 107 S.Ct. 837].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b833-13\"> The verb \u201cbalance\u201d is defined thusly: \u201c1.

Evidence of Vasquez\u2019s guilty plea to second degree murder was not admitted at the guilt phase. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 9, at p. 779.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\"> Of course the People may elect to forego a second or third penalty phase retrial and assent to imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Defendant speculates that without such instruction, a juror may believe that deadlock at the penalty phase will nullify the guilty verdicts returned in the guilt phase. However, in light of the instructions which explain the bifurcated nature of capital trials and the jury\u2019s function at the penalty phase, the possibility of such a mistaken inference being drawn is unlikely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
