Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">Real party in interest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s former landlord, sued in small claims court for money due on the rental contract between it and defendant, and for damages for injury to the property rented to defendant. Possession of the property was not in issue; defendant had previously vacated the premises. After trial, the small claims court awarded real party $1,500 plus costs. Defendant appealed to the respondent superior court, to have the action \u201ctried anew.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 117.10; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.) He demanded a jury trial, which the superior court denied. Defendant then unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to compel the superior court to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>him a jury trial. We granted review and retransferred the matter to the Court of Appeal, citing <em>Maldonado </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 1259. The Court of Appeal again denied defendant\u2019s petition for writ of mandate, holding that defendant had no right to trial by jury in his de novo appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">A. <em>Small Claims Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Each justice and municipal court in the state includes a small claims division (\u00a7 116, subd. (a)), which has jurisdiction over claims for the recovery of money when the amount of the demand does not exceed $1,500. (\u00a7 116.2, subd. (a).) The Legislature created small claims courts to provide an accessible judicial forum for the resolution of disputes involving small amounts of money in \u201can expeditious, inexpensive, and fair manner.\u201d (\u00a7 116.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">The statutory scheme governing small claims court provides for simplified, informal procedures. (\u00a7\u00a7 116-117.41.) \u201cThe chief characteristics of [small claims court] proceedings are that there are no attorneys, no pleadings and no legal rules of evidence; there are no juries, and no formal findings are made on the issues presented. At the hearings the presentation of evidence may be sharply curtailed, and the proceedings are often terminated in a short space of time. The awards\u2014although made in accordance with substantive law\u2014are often based on the application of common sense; and the spirit of compromise and conciliation attends the proceedings.\u201d <em>(Sanderson </em>v. <em>Niemann </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 563, 573 [110 P.2d 1025].) Attorneys are prohibited from representing litigants in small claims court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 117.4.) The small claims court judge may permit the parties to offer evidence by witnesses outside of the hearing, and may \u201cconsult witnesses informally and otherwise investigate the controversy.\u201d (\u00a7 117, subd. (a).) The judge is authorized to \u201cgive judgment and make such orders\u201d as he \u201cdeems to be just and equitable for disposition of the controversy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">The plaintiff in a small claims action has no right to appeal. (\u00a7 117.8, subd. (a).) The defendant may appeal to the superior court (\u00a7 117.8., subd. (b)) for a trial de novo. (\u00a7 117.10.) This right is limited in that \u201cif the defendant seeks any affirmative relief by way of a claim in the small claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>court, he shall not have the right to appeal from the judgment on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 117.8, subd. (b).) The superior court judgment is not appealable. (\u00a7 117.12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Section 117.10 directs the Judicial Council to \u201cprescribe by rule the practice and procedure\u201d to be followed in appeals to the superior court in small claims cases. The Judicial Council has accordingly promulgated California Rules of Court, rules 151-158, governing small claims appeals. Under these rules, the trial de novo \u201cshall be conducted informally as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 117 except that attorneys may participate. No tentative decision or statement of decision shall be required.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">B. <em>Right to Jury in Trial De Novo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">1. <em>Small Claims Statute Does Not Provide for Jury Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">The Legislature\u2019s emphasis on informal and expeditious proceedings makes it clear that it did not contemplate a jury trial in small claims court itself. Indeed, defendant does not dispute this point. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 1170, fn. 1.) As to the procedure on appeal, no provision of the applicable statute or court rules makes any reference to a jury in the superior court trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">Amici curiae in support of real party in interest and respondent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> argue that the Legislature intended that jury trials should not be held in small claims appeals. We conclude that they are correct. The governing statutes and rules do not appear to contemplate a jury trial on appeal. First, as stated, the Legislature has never expressly provided for a jury trial in the small claims appeal, although it has the power and ability to do so. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1141.20, subd. (b), providing that after judicial <em>arbitration, </em>\u201c[a]ny party may elect to have a de novo trial, <em>by court or jury, </em>both as to law and facts.\u201d [Italics added.])</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">Second, a jury trial would be manifestly inconsistent with the informal procedures required to be observed on appeal, such as the provision that \u201c[t]he judge may consult witnesses informally and otherwise investigate the controversy,\u201d (\u00a7 117, subd. (a)), and the inapplicability of the formal rules of evidence. Section 904.5, within the title governing civil appeals, explicitly states: \u201cAppeals from the small claims court of a municipal court and of a justice court shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 5A (commencing with Section 116), Title 1, Part 1 of this code.\u201d This section thus refers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>back to the Small Claims Court statute, including section 117.10, which gives authority to the Judicial Council to prescribe by rule the procedure in small claims appeals. As mentioned above, rule 155 of the California Rules of Court states that section 117 (providing for informal hearing and disposition of small claims actions, allowing the judge to investigate claims independently, etc.) applies to appeals to superior court in small claims cases, in sum, it is apparent that the scheme created by statute and rules requires the superior court trial de novo to be conducted pursuant to the same summary procedures as govern the small claims court itself (except that attorneys may participate). It follows that there is no right to a jury trial at any point in a small claims proceeding under the small claims statute and rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">2. <em>There Is No Statutory or Constitutional Right to Jury Trial on Appeal From Small Claims Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Defendant argues that regardless of the legislative intent underlying the small claims statute, the state Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 16)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and section 592 (generally guaranteeing a trial by jury in legal actions), afford him the right to a jury trial in his appeal. The Court of Appeal concluded defendant has no right to a jury in the trial de novo under either section 592 or the state Constitution. Upon careful consideration of the issue, we conclude that the Court of Appeal was correct. Accordingly, we adopt the following portion of Justice Agliano\u2019s opinion for the Court of Appeal in this case, with modifications as indicated:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Article I, section 16, of the California Constitution provides in pertinent part that \u201c[tjrial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all . . . .\u201d This constitutional right to jury trial \u201cis the right as it existed at common law in 1850, when the Constitution was first adopted, \u2018and what that right is, is a purely historical question, a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social, political or legal fact.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (C <em>&amp; K Engineering Contractors </em>v. <em>Amber Steel Co. </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 1, 8-9 [151 Cal.Rptr. 323, 587 P.2d 1136]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe </em>(1951) 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>Cal.2d 283, 286-287 [231 P.2d 832].) \u201cThe common law at the time the Constitution was adopted includes not only the <em>lex non scripta </em>but also the written statutes enacted by Parliament.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 287.) \u201cAs a general proposition, \u2018[T]he jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law, but not in equity.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(C &amp; K Engineering Contractors </em>v. <em>Amber Steel Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 1, 8.) But if a proceeding otherwise identifiable in some sense as a \u201ccivil action at law\u201d did not entail a right to jury trial under the common law of 1850, then the modem California counterpart of that proceeding will not entail a <em>constitutional </em>right to trial by jury. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d 283, 298; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frangadakis </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 540, 545-546 [7 Cal.Rptr. 776].) And of course there will be no <em>constitutional </em>right to jury trial in special proceedings unknown to the common law of 1850. <em>(Perry Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 448, 464-465 [150 Cal.Rptr. 495]; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 135, 139-140 [116 Cal.Rptr. 602].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The statute on which [defendant] relies is Code of Civil Procedure section 592, which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n actions for the recovery of specific, real, or personal property, with or without damages, or for money claimed as due upon contract, or as damages for breach of contract, or for injuries, an issue of fact must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or a reference is ordered, as provided in this code. ... In other cases, issues of fact must be tried by the Court\u201d with provisos not relevant here. The 1873-74 amendment by which section 592 was put into its present form \u201cwas evidently framed with a view of adopting the principle . . . that the constitutional guaranty of the right to jury trial . . . applies only to common law actions and that it does not confer such right with respect to any action as to which it did not previously exist.\u201d <em>(Vallejo etc. R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Reed Orchard Co. </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 545, 556 [147 P. 238].) [Thus, section 592, like the constitutional provision, is historically based, and does not expand the jury trial right beyond its common law scope. (See <em>C &amp; K Engineering, supra, 23 </em>Cal.3d at p. 9 [citing \u00a7 592 and finding no right to jury trial under historical test]; see also, <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 46, 70 [243 P. 657] [\u201cthe rule is well established in this state that it is not error to deny a jury in any cases where such right was not granted at common law\u201d]; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 135, 139-140.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">[Defendant]\u2019s argument is straightforward. He contends that [real party\u2019s] action is for money claimed due upon the rental contract and for injuries to property, and thus that it comes within the plain language of section 592, and that in any event these claims were historically the subjects of actions at law to which the constitutional guaranty would directly apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>[]</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">[The right to jury trial in the de novo appeal in a small claims action does not turn on the <em>legal </em>nature of the claim. Instead, our analysis under both section 592 and the constitutional guarantee in this case must turn on a more basic historical analysis.  Our state Constitution essentially <em>preserves </em>the right to a jury in those actions in which there was a right to a jury trial at common law at the time the Constitution was first adopted. <em>(C &amp; K Engineering, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 8-9.) Thus, the scope of the constitutional right to jury trial depends on the provisions for jury trial at common law. The historical analysis of the common law right to jury often relies on the traditional distinction between courts at law, in which a jury sat, and courts of equity, in which there was no jury. When analyzing whether there is a constitutional entitlement to a jury in a small claims case, however, we must look beyond the legal/equitable dichotomy, because that distinction was irrelevant, at common law, to the provision of a jury for a small monetary claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">[Historical inquiry reveals that there were various special juryless small claims tribunals in England and the American colonies, territories, and states, many of them well established before the adoption of our state Constitution. (See Pound, Organization of Courts (1940) pp. 150-156, 245-246.) Significantly, in the years preceding 1850, a litigant in a special small claims proceeding was not necessarily entitled to a jury even if the claim at issue was legal and could alternatively have been brought in a common law court and heard by a jury. (See Barrett, <em>The Constitutional Right to Jury Trial: A Historical Exception for Small Monetary Claims </em>(1987) 39 Hastings L.J. 125, 154.) Under the English system, \u201cwhen remedies were available simultaneously in both tribunals [i.e., the common law court and a special small claims tribunal], th\u00e9 prevailing practice not only permitted summary relief in the juryless small claims tribunals but strongly encouraged it: in some jurisdictions there were laws expressly penalizing the litigant who persisted in seeking the common law procedure for a small monetary claim. The very purpose of small claims courts was to provide the kind of relief the common law courts provided\u2014money judgments\u2014through a procedure simplified to accommodate the small amount-in-controversy.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">[Thus,] [t]he small claims court concept is by no means new: A concern that access to courts of general jurisdiction was beyond the means of poor plaintiffs with small claims can be tracked back in English legal history at least to the fifteenth century. (Cf. 1 Holdsworth, A History of English Law (7th ed. 1956) pp. 186-187.) \u201cThe establishment of small claims courts was intended to provide speedy, inexpensive, and informal disposition of small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>actions through simple proceedings conducted with an eye toward compromise and conciliation. The court was to be designed particularly to help the \u2018poor\u2019 litigant. An informal court procedure was thought to reduce expense and delay \u2018in cases involving small amounts and often no real issue of law.\u2019 Further, it was believed that by securing justice to ordinary citizens in small cases, the integrity of our judicial system would be meaningfully demonstrated. [1J] The small claims movement led to the statutory creation of a small debt court in London in 1606. In 1846, the new county courts were created in England to provide speedy and informal disposition of small causes.\u201d ([Comment], <em>The California Small Claims Court, supra, </em>52 Cal.L.Rev. 876, 876-877 [fns. omitted].) In the new county courts as they existed in 1850 by virtue of the Act of 1846, there was no right to trial by jury if the amount at issue was five pounds or less, and there appears to have been no right of appeal at all. (Cf. 1 Holdsworth, <em>supra, </em>p. 192.) [] [(See also Barrett, <em>supra, </em>39 Hastings L.J. at p. 143 [\u201cNor was there any right to a jury on appeal from the new county courts, since there was no appeal in any case involving less than twenty pounds.\u201d (fn. omitted)]; Pound, <em>supra, </em>at p. 269 [Noting that \u201c[a]t one time or another legislation has forbidden any appeal where the sum or property in controversy did not exceed some small fixed amount or value,\u201d and suggesting that the preferable solution with regard to review of small claims court judgments is \u201cto provide an appeal as simple, speedy, and inexpensive as the original proceeding . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">[As summarized by Professor Barrett, \u201c[D]uring the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries an understanding existed both in England and in many of the American colonies and territories that special provisions could and should be made to resolve small monetary claims without the right to a jury at any stage of the proceedings. These provisions were needed to provide practical, useful remedies for persons with very small claims. Under the historical test for the extent of the state constitutional right to jury, this early practice of resolving small claims without a jury would justify comparable juryless procedures today.\u201d (Barrett, <em>supra, </em>at p. 151.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">[The Iowa Supreme Court recently relied on this common law exception to the right to jury trial for small monetary claims to hold that its state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>constitutional jury trial guaranty did not require a jury in small claims proceedings. <em>(Iowa Nat. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1981) 305 N.W.2d 724.) The Iowa court cited the \u201cseldom-noted distinction at common law related to the amount of the claim: \u2018[^] It had been a well established practice in England, and in our colonial times, that actions for small demands were triable before certain officers having a limited jurisdiction, without a jury .... The sum of forty shillings was fixed upon, then and for many years subsequently, as the dividing line between what was petty and insignificant, and what was of importance in point of value.\u2019 J. Proffatt, <em>A Treatise on Trial By Jury </em>\u00a7 99, at 142 (1877).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 727.) The court concluded, \u201cIf the basic Iowa law is rooted in English common law, then the constitutional direction that \u2018the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate\u2019 carries with it the <em>common-law concept that minor claims may be adjudicated without a jury.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">The principle established by the English common law as it existed in 1850 was that small claims, as legislatively defined within limits reasonably related to the value of money and the cost of litigation in the contemporary economy, were to be resolved expeditiously, without a jury and without recourse to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">We do not attempt to determine whether five British pounds of 1850 are the equivalent of $1,500 in today\u2019s economy. [] In any event, the amount in controversy is not the issue here. [Defendant\u2019s contention is the same whether the small claims jurisdictional sum is $1 or $1,500.  [We note, however, that the Legislature\u2019s power to raise the small claims court jurisdictional amount is limited by constitutional parameters, and any attempt to raise the small claims limit to a level which could no longer be considered a very small monetary amount, would probably necessitate a reevaluation of whether a jury trial is constitutionally required for the de novo appeal. (See James &amp; Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 8.2, p. 417.) We find the current small claims ceiling to be a reasonable legislative enactment to allow claimants with small monetary demands to resolve their cases expeditiously, while preserving the defendant\u2019s right to jury trial, as historically defined. The $1,500 limit falls comfortably within the constitutional guidelines.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">[Finally, defendant] argues that it is not clear that the Act of 1846 should be considered in defining the common law right to trial by jury as it existed in 1850, and that \u201c[i]f there are any decisions of [our court] which hold that English statutes enacted just prior to adoption of our Constitution in 1849 were incorporated into the jury trial guarantee, those decisions should not be followed. Recent acts of a legislature on the other side of the world were surely known to neither the framers of our Constitution nor the people who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>voted for ratification.\u201d  His arguments are not so persuasive as to warrant a departure from our [ ] unqualified and long-accepted rule that the common law of 1850 includes \u201cthe written statutes enacted by Parliament.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d 283, 287[, citing <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Purse Seine Net </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 835, 838 [118 P.2d 1] (\u201cIt is well established in California that the common law of England includes not only the <em>lex non scripta </em>but also the written statutes enacted by Parliament.\u201d)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">[We emphasize also that the small claims exception to the right to jury trial did not originate with the 1846 statute. The parliamentary act of 1846, rather than establishing a new concept, simply \u201ccontinue[d] the tradition of denying a jury in suits for very small amounts.\u201d (Barrett, <em>supra, </em>39 Hastings L.J. at p. 142.) Thus, \u201cthroughout the period relevant to our present inquiry, England had a system of small claims courts to resolve small monetary disputes without recourse to a jury at any point in the proceedings.\u201d (Id., at p. 144.) (See also <em>Leuschen </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court </em>(1923) 191 Cal. 133, 134-136 [215 P. 391] [tracing the history of the small claims court movement from English statutes of the 17th and 18th centuries].)]</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">[]</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Finding neither a right to jury trial in comparable proceedings under English common law in 1850, nor express statutory provision for jury trial on appeal from a California small claims judgment, we conclude that [defendant] has neither a constitutional nor a statutory right to jury trial in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">[3. <em>Previous Court of Appeal Opinions Are </em>Distinguishable.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">[Defendant] relies on two published [] Court of Appeal decisions which have held a small claims defendant entitled to a jury trial on de novo appeal. Respondent [superior] court apparently concluded that the authority of the earlier of the two <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 977, 979 [156 Cal.Rptr. 149]) had been vitiated by a subsequent amendment to rule 155, California Rules of Court. The later of the two is <em>Maldonado </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 1259, decided after respondent court ruled [].</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">Rule 155, on which <em>Smith </em>appears to have turned, is predicated on the provision of [ ] section 117.10 that \u201c[t]he Judicial Council shall prescribe by rule the practice and procedure on appeal . . . .\u201d Between 1977 and January 1, 1983, rule 155 provided that trial de novo \u201cshall be conducted pursuant to law and rules in all respects as other trials in the superior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>except that no written findings of fact or conclusions of law shall be required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\"><em>Smith </em>was decided in 1979. It was a small claims action brought by the Department of Transportation against motorist Smith for damage Smith had allegedly done to a road sign. The Department of Transportation won; Smith appealed and demanded a jury; his request was denied. Smith sought a writ and the Court of Appeal granted it, citing both the California Constitution (cf. also <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Harn </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 465, 469 [184 Cal.Rptr. 83]) and [] section 592, but apparently relying primarily on the language of rule 155: \u201cThe Judicial Council rule provides that a trial on an appeal from a small claims court \u2018. . . shall be conducted pursuant to law and rules in all respects as other trials in the superior court . . . .\u2019 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 155.) Such rule provides for a jury in \u2018other trials\u2019 involving the subject matter of the case before us. It follows that petitioner is entitled to a jury.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 977, 979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">In support of the conclusion reached in <em>Smith </em>it might be assumed that section 117.10 effected a valid delegation of legislative power to declare a right to jury trial and that rule 155, as it then read, constituted such a declaration. But as of January 1, 1983, rule 155 was amended to provide that trials de novo \u201cshall be conducted informally as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 117 except that attorneys may participate. No tentative decision or statement of decision shall be required.\u201d The patent intent of the Judicial Council was to rescind any implicit declaration of similarity between de novo appeals and ordinary superior court trials. [Thus, to the extent that the <em>Smith </em>opinion was based on the former California Rules of Court, rule 155, it is no longer viable. To the extent that <em>Smith </em>is otherwise inconsistent with our opinion herein, it is hereby disapproved.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\"><em>Maldonado, [supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 1259,] was decided at the end of 1984. Maldonado was the defendant in an unlawful detainer action in small claims court. ([]\u00a7 116.2, subd. (c).) The plaintiff prevailed in the small claims court; Maldonado appealed. On trial de novo Maldonado demanded a jury trial which was denied. The Court of Appeal granted Maldonado\u2019s writ petition \u201con statutory grounds limited to new trials on appeal from an unlawful detainer small claims action.\u201d <em>(Maldonado, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. 1262.) The Court of Appeal expressed \u201cno opinion whether the same right is required in trials de novo on appeal in general.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1268, fn. 13.) The superior court had concluded (as respondent court in this action apparently has) that <em>Smith </em>was vitiated by the change in rule 155. <em>[(Id., </em>at p. 1265.)] The <em>[Maldonado </em>court] did not consider itself bound by changes in the language of the rule. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1265-1266.) [It] concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Maldonado\u2019s constitutional argument need not be reached, because her argument that she was entitled to a jury by virtue of [] sections 1171 (unlawful detainer) and 592 \u201cis dispositive herein.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 1266.) In the [.Maldonado] court\u2019s view both sections plainly established an unlawful detainer defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial on de novo appeal from an adverse small claims judgment. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1266-1268.) Responding to the superior court\u2019s \u201csomewhat heuristic concerns respecting the burden jury trials may place upon the court system and upon small claims plaintiffs . . .\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 1268), the <em>[Maldonado </em>court] concluded that \u201c[w]hile it may prove burdensome for some claimants, the plaintiff\u2019s interest in an expeditious disposition cannot outweigh the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury in a proceeding to evict her from her home.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">On the facts before us we have no occasion to question the validity of the <em>Maldonado </em>court\u2019s conclusion that sections 1171 and 592 entitle a small claims defendant to a jury trial on appeal from an unlawful detainer judgment. [ ] [W]e agree with the <em>Maldonado </em>court that its holding should be strictly limited to the fact situation to which it was addressed. Finding no constitutional or statutory basis for a similar holding in the circumstances before us, we conclude that petitioner is not entitled to a jury trial [in his appeal in superior court.] [End of Court of Appeal opinion.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeal that defendant has no right to jury trial, on appeal to the superior court from the judgment of the small claims court, under either the state Constitution or state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal denying the writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., Arguelles, J., Eagleson, J., Kaufman, J. and Racanelli (John T.), J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">On September 1, 1988, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">Petitioner (hereafter defendant) does not assert he had a right to a jury in the original small claims court hearing. It has been assumed that there is no right to a jury in the original hearing, and that \u201cto the extent a right to trial by jury exists, it is satisfied by a two-tiered procedure which affords a jury trial in the de novo proceeding in superior court.\u201d <em>(Maldonado </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1259, 1266, fn. 9 [209 Cal.Rptr. 199]; see <em>Capital Traction Co. </em>v.
