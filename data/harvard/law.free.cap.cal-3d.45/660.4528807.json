Code, \u00a7 187),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> robbery (\u00a7 211) and attempted rape (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 261, subds. (2), (3)) of Leah Schendel and the burglary of Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment (\u00a7 459), and of the robbery (\u00a7 211) and attempted rape (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 261, subds. (2), (3)) of Mavis W. The jury found the murder to have occurred in the course of burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(vii)), robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i)) and rape (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii)), found defendant sane, and in the Schendel case imposed the sentence of death. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We have consolidated defendant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">As will appear, we affirm the judgment and deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Defendant did not dispute that he committed the charged offenses, but in both the Schendel and the W. cases he asserted the defenses of diminished capacity and unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">A. <em>The Schendel Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Leah Schendel lived in the Sacramento Manor, a senior citizen\u2019s complex located on North Manor Drive in Sacramento. On the evening of December 18, 1980, she dined out with relatives and returned to her apartment about 11 p.m. That same evening, Vernon McMaster, her next door neighbor, went to bed at his usual time between 10:30 and 11 p.m. He awoke sometime between 2 and 4 a.m. While lying in bed he heard a noise like a \u201cthud or a thump\u201d in Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment. After that he did not hear anything. He then heard the television go on. McMaster lay awake in response to the noises for about an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">The next morning, December .19, Edna Smith, Leah Schendel\u2019s neighbor on the other side, checked on Ms. Schendel at McMaster\u2019s urging. The screen door to Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment had been cut or broken and the main door was open. The television was on, but the sound was turned down. Receiving no response when she called Ms. Schendel\u2019s name, Ms. Smith called John Balvin, the resident manager of the complex. Ms. Smith had been up until 2 a.m. the previous night and had heard nothing except Ms. Schendel arriving home from dinner about 11 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>When Balvin entered Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment, he found the furniture in disarray. Ms. Schendel\u2019s body was on the bedroom floor, covered from the waist up with a mattress or box springs. After determining that Ms. Schendel was dead, Balvin called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The police arrived and secured the apartment. The apartment screen door had been ripped near the latch, apparently by a sharp instrument rather than a hand or finger. The apartment appeared to have been ransacked. The television set was turned on to channel 40, but there was no sound. Playing cards, broken dentures, and some pieces of glass were on the living room floor. A purse was on the floor. A knife was beside the television set. There was blood on the living room and kitchen floors, on the inside portion of the screen door, and on the doorway of the bedroom. Drawers and other items were scattered all over the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">When the mattress was removed from Ms. Schendel\u2019s body, it was noted that she was nude from the waist down. Her nightgown and pajama top were pulled above her breast area. A tea kettle was sitting on top of her pubic area, a leather strap was tied to her left ankle, an electrical cord lay across the lower part of her legs. A pillow by her head was heavily soaked with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">According to the pathologist, Leah Schendel died from a heart attack brought on by a severe beating and possible suffocation. She also showed signs of possible rape. Her body had suffered numerous lacerations and abrasions. Had Ms. Schendel not suffered from coronary disease, and had she not experienced physical and psychological stress caused by fright, the struggle, and pain from her wounds, the physical blows she received would not of themselves have proved fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Defendant\u2019s fingerprints and palmprints were found on the handle of the tea kettle and on other items strewn about the apartment. Articles missing from the apartment were subsequently found among defendant\u2019s belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">B. <em>The Mavis W Assault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">About 10:30 or 11 p.m. on December 19, 1980, Mavis W. was returning to her home on 63d Avenue in Sacramento in her new Volkswagen Dasher automobile. As she approached her driveway she noticed defendant walking slowly by her house. When she turned into her driveway, defendant stopped, turned around, and looked at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">As Mrs. W. alighted from her car, defendant grabbed her from behind. He demanded her car, but Mrs. W. threw the keys up the driveway. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Defendant dragged Mrs. W. behind some bushes and struck her until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, she was lying on her back and defendant was attempting to pull off her pants. Mrs. W. again lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Julie W., Mavis W.\u2019s daughter, was visiting her mother\u2019s house the evening of December 19th, as was George Iwamura. When George left the house to go home he saw defendant running across the neighbors\u2019 lawn. He also saw Mrs. W. lying on the lawn near the neighbors\u2019 house. George ran back to Mrs. W.\u2019s house, told Julie, and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Julie found her mother lying unconscious on the grass, blood on her face and her clothing. Mrs. W. was nude from the waist down. Her purse was on the ground, its contents strewn about the yard. Taken from Mrs. W. were a silver pendant, money, a silver ring, and a gold watch with a gold band.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">C. <em>The Defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Defendant did not testify. Sacramento Police Detective Terry Brown testified that in a tape-recorded interview after his arrest, defendant denied any memory of the Schendel attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In a videotaped interview with defense psychiatrist Dr. David Axelrad, defendant related that he spent most of Thursday, December 18, 1980, the day preceding the early morning Schendel attack, with a woman whom he had met that morning. The pair spent most of the day at the Stix Bar, where they consumed some liquor and beer and smoked marijuana. That evening about 9 p.m. the woman left in a taxi. Defendant smoked more marijuana with some men who had parked nearby in a van. He then walked to 21st Street where he sat down on the ground and passed out. When he came to, there was a cigar box next to him with \u201cstuff\u201d in it. He denied any memory of the attack on Ms. Schendel.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Gerald Kato testified that on December 19, the day of the Mrs. W. attack, he met defendant at the Stix Bar. The two went out to Kato\u2019s truck about 9 or 10 p.m. and smoked marijuana. Kato stated that defendant appeared to act and talk normally.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Defendant\u2019s psychiatric defense of diminished capacity and unconsciousness was presented primarily through the testimony of his brother William and other family members, his common law wife Theresa, and Dr. Joan Blunt, a clinical psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The defense advanced three theories: (1) That as the result of childhood brain damage caused by a bicycle accident and a service-related injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>received in Vietnam, defendant\u2019s ability to think and function under stress was impaired; (2) that as a result of his combat service in Vietnam defendant manifested symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and (3) that defendant possibly suffered from psychomotor epilepsy, which condition would have rendered him unconscious of acts committed during a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">D. <em>Rebuttal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor put on psychiatrist Dr. Lee Coleman. Dr. Coleman\u2019s testimony is discussed in detail below in connection with defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct. In essence, Dr. Coleman testified that psychiatrists and psychologists are no better equipped than lay persons to infer what a defendant\u2019s mental state was at the time of an alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">II. Guilt and Sanity Phases</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">As error during the guilt and sanity phases, defendant assigns the exclusion for cause of potential jurors opposed to the death penalty, the exclusion of certain evidence concerning his mental state at the time of the crimes, the court\u2019s instruction on the \u201cpresumption of consciousness\u201d (CALJIC No. 4.31), prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">A. <em>Denial of Representative and Impartial Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Defendant contends that the exclusion of some potential jurors for cause in accord with <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770] (exclusion of jurors unalterably opposed to the death penalty) denied him a jury representative of a fair cross-section of the community and denied him an impartial jury on the issue of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">We rejected the first contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 342-353 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680] (plur. opn.), 374 (conc. opn. of Kaus, J.), and the second in <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 68 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 58, 60 [210 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>694 P.2d 1149]. The United States Supreme Court recently rejected the identical contentions in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 162 [90 L.Ed.2d 137, 106 S.Ct. 1758].</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">B. <em>Evidentiary Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Defendant contends that through a combination of erroneous rulings excluding evidence concerning his mental state at the time of the crimes, the trial court prevented him from effectively presenting his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The excluded evidentiary items are: (1) Testimony concerning the content of movies shown on channel 40 the night of Leah Schendel\u2019s murder; (2) combat records of defendant\u2019s Vietnam Marine company; (3) hospital records concerning defendant\u2019s head injuries suffered in a childhood bicycle accident; and (4) testimony concerning defendant\u2019s negative response to stimuli that reminded him of Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">1. <em>Channel 40 Movies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABE\">a. <em>Guilt Phase.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">One of the mental disorders defendant sought to prove in support of his defenses of diminished capacity and insanity was \u201cPTSD.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Psychologist Dr. Joan Blunt testified that, based on her psychological testing of defendant, her review of Tobey Hospital records of a head injury he received from a bicycle accident at age 12, and his behavioral history, she believed that defendant has both functional and organic brain damage. As a result of brain damage, defendant would have decreased stress tolerance, making it difficult for him to function in an environment that did not take his impairment into account. With this personality, defendant was at a higher than usual risk of developing pathology as a result of exposure to severe combat in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">While in Vietnam, Dr. Blunt related, defendant sustained additional head trauma. In order to cope with the stress, he began taking more drugs and alcohol, which compounded his stress. On his return from Vietnam, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>defendant reportedly manifested symptoms characteristic of the PTSD suffered by the returning Vietnam War veteran. These included increased use of drugs and alcohol, a personality shift, hostility, explosive behavior, bar fights, suicide attempts, sleep disorder, a hyperalert state, a strong tendency to dissociate, and an upset reaction to symbols of Vietnam, such as green garbage bags, which reminded him of body bags, and certain music or words on the radio that reminded him of Vietnam. An individual suffering PTSD, Dr. Blunt stated, typically would seek avoidance of ideas or symbols that would trigger memory of the traumatic event. According to the report of Theresa Babbitt, defendant\u2019s former \u201ccommon law\u201d wife, defendant manifested symbol avoidance behavior in that he was upset by the sight of any kind of green garbage bag, and when he heard music on the radio that reminded him of Vietnam, he would get up and turn it off.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The evidence showed that Leah Schendel\u2019s apartment was on the way of one route from the Stix Bar to defendant\u2019s home and that because of her emphysema Ms. Schendel often kept the regular door of her apartment open, leaving only the screen door closed and locked. Relying on Dr. Blunt\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s likely adverse reaction to symbols of Vietnam, and evidence that when Ms. Schendel\u2019s body was found her television set was turned on to channel 40, with the sound off, defense counsel sought to introduce evidence of the movies shown on channel 40 the night of Ms. Schendel\u2019s murder in an effort to prove that the movies, containing sounds of gunfire and \u201cAsian appearing people in evil roles,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may have drawn defendant to Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment and triggered his violent attack. The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s relevance objection. Defendant argues that this ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Except as otherwise provided by statute, no evidence is admissible except relevant evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 350.) Relevant evidence is evidence \u201chaving any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact ....\u2019\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 210.)  The trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the relevance of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 19 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) The court, however, has no discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 321 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669].) \u201cSpeculative inferences that are derived from evidence cannot be deemed to be relevant to establish the speculatively inferred fact in light of Evidence Code section 210, which requires that evidence offered to prove or disprove a disputed fact must have a tendency in reason for such purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>De La Plane </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>223, 244 [151 Cal.Rptr. 843], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 39, fn. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In the instant case the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence of the violent movies shown on channel 40 the night of Leah Schendel\u2019s murder. There is no evidence that the television set was turned on before defendant attacked Ms. Schendel, or that defendant heard or saw either of the movies before he cut open Ms. Schendel\u2019s screen door and entered her apartment. The evidence is to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the program content of channel 40 would have no tendency in reason to prove or disprove defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offenses.  \u201cThe inference which defendant sought to have drawn from the [proffered evidence] is clearly speculative, and evidence which produces only <em>speculative </em>inferences is <em>irrelevant </em>evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>De La Plane, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.3d at p.242, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99] for the proposition that the evidence was admissible notwithstanding the absence of any proof that he actually heard or saw the television before he forcibly entered Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment or before he attacked her. The cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In <em>Burgener, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 505, we upheld the trial court\u2019s admission, over defendant\u2019s objection, of evidence that a substance on his shoes tested positive for blood (although it could have been some other substance), stating that the evidence \u201ccertainly has <em>some </em>tendency in reason to prove that [defendant] might have been present at the scene of a bloody shooting . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527, italics in original; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.) The case is merely consistent with the principle that the trial court has broad discretion to determine the relevance of evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 19), a discretion patently not abused under the facts. In <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, we rejected the principle that third-party-culpability evidence is admissible only on a preliminary showing of a \u201c \u2018substantial probability\u2019 \u201d of third-party guilt and reaffirmed the admissibility of \u201cany relevant evidence that raises a reasonable doubt as to a defendant\u2019s guilt. . . .\u201d (41 Cal.3d at p. 829.) Rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that his constitutional right to present a defense precludes any application of Evidence Code section 352 to third-party-culpability evidence because even remote evidence of motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>could raise a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d of guilt, this court stated: \u201cAs a general matter, the ordinary rules of evidence do not impermissibly infringe on the accused\u2019s right to present a defense. Courts retain, moreover, a traditional and intrinsic power to exercise discretion to control the admission of evidence in the interests of orderly procedure and the avoidance of prejudice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 834.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In the instant case the excluded channel 40 program schedule would at most have provided a link in an incomplete chain of speculative inferences. Exclusion of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">b. <em>Sanity Phase.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">During the sanity phase of trial, defendant again sought to prove the contents of the channel 40 films and to demonstrate their potential connection with his actions. Defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof was made by way of cross-examination of Dr. Elmer F. Galioni, the court-appointed psychiatrist. The trial court ruled the evidence inadmissible pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. Defendant maintains that this ruling was an abuse of discretion and a violation of his due process right to present relevant defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">On direct examination by the prosecutor, Dr. Galioni testified that his diagnosis of defendant was that he had a passive-aggressive personality disorder. He described the condition as a character disorder where an individual rebels against society\u2019s expectations, and \u201cwhen confronted with the need to maintain responsibility,\u201d he becomes aggressive and \u201cmay lash out openly aggressively.\u201d In Dr. Galioni\u2019s opinion, defendant\u2019s asserted amnesia about the offenses was either a \u201cfunctional amnesia\u201d that was developed after the fact to eliminate or blot out unpleasant memories, or a \u201cfeigned amnesia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">On cross-examination by defense counsel, Dr. Galioni testified that although some of defendant\u2019 reported behavior was consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, he did not make that diagnosis because some elements did not fit, particularly the fact that defendant\u2019s behavior was not always avoidant. When an individual who suffers from PTSD encounters a stimulus that reminds him of the traumatic event, his natural reaction and instinct is to try to get away from it rather than going towards it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Defense counsel then sought to examine Dr. Galioni about defense exhibit T, a certified copy of the channel 40 program log. At a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Dr. Galioni testified that without further information\u2014how defendant got to Ms. Schendel\u2019s apartment, the circumstances of his entry, whether he heard the television, more evidence about defendant\u2019s disorder\u2014it would be \u201cspeculative\u201d for him to attach any significance to the program content of channel 40 in evaluating defendant\u2019s behavior the night of the Schendel offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The trial court ruled that the consumption of time required for proof of the channel 40 program content and its connection to defendant\u2019s behavior outweighed the probative value of the evidence, \u201cespecially in view of [Dr. Galioni\u2019s] ultimate position in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">This ruling was not error. In his offer of proof, defendant was unable to demonstrate that the inference concerning his state of mind sought to be drawn from the channel 40 program log was anything more than speculative. As previously stated, exclusion of evidence that produces only speculative inferences is not an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>De La Plane, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.3d at p. 242; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 321; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Relying on <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 14 [18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 87 S.Ct. 1920] and its progeny, defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s authority under Evidence Code section 352 to exclude relevant evidence must yield to his constitutional right to present a defense. The principle applies, however, only to \u201crelevant and material\u201d evidence. <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at p. 23 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1025]; see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284, 302 [18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 87 S.Ct. 1920] [\u201ccritical\u201d evidence].)  As the court correctly stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeder </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 543 [147 Cal.Rptr. 275]: \u201cEvidence Code section 352 must bow to the due process right of a defendant to a fair trial and to his right to present all relevant evidence of <em>significant </em>probative value to his defense. In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi [supra, </em>410 U.S. 284], it was held that the exclusion of evidence, vital to a defendant\u2019s defense, constituted a denial of a fair trial in violation of constitutional due process requirements. [1j] We do not mean to imply, however, that a defendant has a constitutional right to present all relevant evidence in his favor, no matter how limited in probative value such evidence will be so as to preclude the trial court from using Evidence Code section 352.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553, italics in original; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, 834; see also <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 683, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>689 [90 L.Ed.2d 636, 644, 106 S.Ct. 2142] [recognizing trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018wide latitude\u2019\u201d in making ordinary evidentiary rulings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Here, because defendant\u2019s evidence failed to meet the threshold requirement of relevance, its exclusion pursuant to section 352 did not implicate any due process concerns. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 576, 588 [217 Cal.Rptr. 212, 703 P.2d 1106].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">2. <em>Combat Records of Defendant\u2019s Vietnam Marine Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Defendant complains that the court erred in excluding from evidence as not properly authenticated the four-volume combat history of his Vietnam Marine company obtained at defense counsel\u2019s request from the United States Marine Corps. Relying on Evidence Code section 1420,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant maintains that the cover letter bearing the signature of an appropriate United States Marine Corps official, and received in response to defense counsel\u2019s letter requesting the records, was sufficient to authenticate the records. Evidence Code section 1420, however, serves to authenticate only the cover letter, not the documents themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Defendant also contends for the first time on appeal that the records were properly authenticated under Evidence Code section 1421.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record does not show, however, nor was any argument made below that the contents of the records were known only to the author, as required by section 1421.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Moreover, any error in excluding the records was nonprejudicial. The record shows that defense counsel, acceding to the prosecutor\u2019s relevance objection to the four-volume history, ultimately sought to introduce only one page, a page showing that defendant had been wounded in Vietnam. There was a plethora of other evidence that defendant had suffered a head injury in Vietnam and the prosecutor conceded the point. The excluded page thus would merely have corroborated an undisputed fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">3. <em>Hospital Records Concerning Defendant\u2019s Childhood Head Injury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">In addition to his diminished-capacity theory of PTSD, defendant also contended that his ability to form the requisite criminal intent was curtailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>by organic brain damage and psychomotor epilepsy. Dr. Blunt testified that psychological tests administered to defendant indicated that he suffered from damage in the area of \u201cthe right temporal and the left parietal occipital region\u201d of his brain, and that defendant might also suffer from psycho-motor epilepsy, a condition in which one may perform apparently purposive acts while in an unconscious state. She attributed the postulated epilepsy to the presence of temporal lobe damage, possibly caused by head injuries defendant suffered from a bicycle accident when he was 12 years old. Defense counsel then asked Dr. Blunt, \u201c[Wjould an injury to the right temporal region . . . and the left parietal at the age of. . . twelve years old be consistent with the development and results of various testing that you did with regard to the Luria-Nebraska test as it applies to Manuel P. Babbitt?\u201d The court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s lack-of-foundation objection, stating that although there was evidence that defendant suffered some sort of head injury at age 12, there was no evidence that the injury involved the right temporal and left parietal occipital areas of the brain. Defense counsel conceded that because the pertinent medical records showing the precise nature of the injury had not yet been introduced into evidence, the question was premature. Counsel asserted that the records of Tobey Hospital in Massachusetts would show \u201cwhere the damage was.\u201d When defendant subsequently sought to introduce the Tobey Hospital records, the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s relevancy objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Defendant contends that the court\u2019s ruling excluding the records substantially impaired his ability to convince the jury that he suffered from brain damage. He maintains that if in fact there were objectionable items in the records, limiting instructions pursuant to Evidence Code section 355 or the deletion of the offending portions would have met the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We first observe that the record does not disclose that the Tobey Hospital records would in fact have substantiated his theory of brain damage. The evidence is to the contrary. Dr. Blunt, who reviewed the records during trial, testified only that the records indicated that defendant suffered a \u201chead injury primarily to the posterior portion of the head\u201d and that the site of the swelling was \u201cconsistent\u201d with one of the areas of the brain that she believed was damaged. In the sanity phase, moreover, Dr. Galioni, the court-appointed psychiatrist, testified that the Tobey Hospital records did <em>not </em>indicate damage to any specific area of the brain. Contrary to defense counsel\u2019s expectation, therefore, the records would not have shown \u201cwhere the damage was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Defendant, as proponent of the medical records, had the burden of demonstrating their relevance. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 403.) In the absence of an offer of proof of the records\u2019 relevance, or an offer to delete any offending portions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding the records was not error. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.) Evidence Code section 355, relied on by defendant, is inapplicable. Section 355 provides for limiting instructions when evidence is admissible as to one party or for one purpose, but inadmissible as to another party or for another purpose. The section has no bearing on the admission of wholly irrelevant evidence, nor did defendant request a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Finally, any error in excluding the hospital records was nonprejudicial. That defendant received a head injury when he was 12 years old was mentioned several times and was not disputed. The jury thus was fully aware of the injury to which the records pertained. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">4. <em>Other Evidence Supportive of Defendant's PTSD Defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Defendant\u2019s brother, William Babbitt, testified at length concerning changes he observed in defendant since his return from Vietnam. He and Theresa Babbitt, defendant\u2019s former \u201ccommon law\u201d wife, both testified to a number of incidents that indicated that defendant was mentally ill. When, however, defense counsel proposed to have Theresa testify to remarks made by defendant demonstrating his adverse reaction to symbols of Vietnam, e.g., green trash bags, Vietnamese people, and certain songs played on the radio, the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection that the evidence was self-serving hearsay. Defense counsel then formulated the question so as to call for Theresa\u2019s personal observations, whereupon the trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s Evidence Code section 352 objection that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its undue consumption of time and prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Defendant maintains that evidence of his remarks was admissible under the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1250, subd. (a)). This exception was not advanced below and therefore need not be considered on review. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.) Moreover, defendant cites nothing in the record to support the argument that his state of mind at the time he made the asserted remarks to Theresa Babbitt had any bearing on his state of mind at the time he attacked the two victims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Defendant also contends that exclusion of the evidence under Evidence Code section 352 was an abuse of discretion. However, in the absence of any evidence supportive of a connection between defendant\u2019s reaction to symbols of Vietnam and his attacks on Leah Schendel and Mavis W., the trial court\u2019s ruling was not error. As the court observed, \u201cI really don\u2019t see the relevance of that [defendant\u2019s reaction to Vietnamese people who had settled near him] in view of the fact that neither of the victims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Vietnamese.\u201d Nor was there evidence that defendant encountered any Vietnamese or any other , symbol of Vietnam before the attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">As we reiterated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>\u201cSection 352 directs \u2018the trial judge to strike a careful balance between the probative value of the evidence and the danger of prejudice, confusion and undue time consumption. That section requires that the danger of these evils substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. This balance is particularly delicate and critical where what is at stake is a criminal defendant\u2019s liberty. Nonetheless, it cannot be said that the trial judge\u2019s ruling on this evidence, of which the probative value was slight and the chance of prejudice and confusion substantial, struck an improper balance and thereby constituted an abuse of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (39 Cal.3d at p. 588.)  Here the probative value of the proffered evidence was de minimis and the chance of confusion substantial. Exclusion of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Furthermore, except for defendant\u2019s reaction to Vietnamese people, the other items of evidence excluded from Theresa Babbitt\u2019s testimony, and more, were elicited from other witnesses. The jury heard evidence that defendant turned off music that reminded him of Vietnam; that he had difficulty sleeping; that he heard voices; he giggled; he had headaches and pain; he was upset by green garbage bags; he practiced yoga and took long walks; and he changed for the worse, becoming more violent, after being in Vietnam. Thus, any error in precluding Theresa Babbitt from answering certain questions about defendant was nonprejudicial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">5. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Defendant argues that in assessing error in the exclusion of the above cited evidence the <em>Chapman </em>standard <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]) applies, both because the error violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and due process and because this is a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Because we have determined that exclusion of the evidence was not error, we need not address the standard-of-review issue. Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that there was error, pursuant to our decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 505, 528, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, 836, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at page 586, the applicable standard is <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818. As indicated, exclusion of the evidence, if error, was nonprejudicial under the <em>Watson </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Defendant asserts alternatively that the evidence is extremely close, thus requiring application of the so-called \u201crefinement\u201d of the <em>Watson </em>test articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 482, 493-494 [58 Cal.Rptr. 361, 426 P.2d 929] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Briggs </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 385, 407 [24 Cal.Rptr. 417, 374 P.2d 257], viz., \u201cWhere the evidence, though sufficient to sustain the verdict, is extremely close, \u2018any substantial error tending to discredit the defense, or to corroborate the prosecution, must be considered as prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra; People </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra.) </em>Without determining whether <em>Gonzales </em>and <em>Briggs </em>in fact modify the <em>Watson </em>test, we reject defendant\u2019s premise that this was a close case. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 32, 56 [59 Cal.Rptr. 817, 429 P.2d 137] [distinguishing Gonzales].) In the trial court\u2019s view, the verdicts of guilt were supported \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt under any or all of the theories advanced by the prosecution,\u201d and the evidence \u201cestablished the defendant\u2019s sanity beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">C. <em>Instruction on \u201cPresumption of Consciousness. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">One of the defense theories presented at trial was that of unconsciousness based on psychomotor epilepsy. Dr. Blunt, testifying for the defense, described a psychomotor epileptic condition as one \u201cthat results from problems in one or both of the temporal lobes of the brain where a person loses control or essentially is unconscious, but they are able to motivate and do things. And what actually occurs is that the outer cortex of the brain is essentially not functioning during those episodes .... They don\u2019t reason, they don\u2019t think, but. . . they can act, they can perform well-learned kinds of things like walking and eating and those kinds of things . . . things that we have so thoroughly learned . . . that they are almost automatic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Dr. Blunt arrived at her diagnosis of psychomotor epilepsy after reading a transcript of Theresa Babbitt\u2019s testimony, \u201cwhere [Theresa] described the starry [szc], glassy-eyed effect [szc] that [defendant] had during the episodes of violence that he had displayed with her, and also her understanding\u2014her memory of him having no memory [of the events].\u201d This testimony, Dr. Blunt stated, together with the previously described psychological testing of defendant, was \u201cvery consistent\u201d with a diagnosis of psychomotor epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Dr. Lee Coleman, testifying for the prosecution in rebuttal, stated that Theresa Babbitt\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d look during violent episodes with her was insufficient to support a diagnosis of psychomotor epilepsy, in that in each instance defendant had been drinking, which could account for his behavior, and, moreover, he would become violent, and \u201ca person who\u2019s having these temporal lobe seizures,... is not capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of a coordinated, purposeful, directed violent attack because . . . the nature of the seizure itself would prevent such a thing.\u201d Defendant\u2019s claim of having no memory of the incidents was not in and of itself evidence of a seizure because he may or may not have been speaking the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Persons experiencing a psychomotor seizure, Dr. Coleman stated, \u201cmay appear to be awake, but in fact, they are in a true altered state of consciousness because they cannot relate to you in any kind of normal way, they could not talk to you, . . . and what you see are . . . repetitive stereotype movements. ... If what they are doing involved a coordinated thing . . . engaging in an activity that involves coordinated muscular complicated movement, they would not be able to continue that.\u201d They would be incapable, the doctor testified, of using or continuing to use a cutting instrument to cut a hole in a screen door, or of repeatedly inflicting purposeful traumatic injuries on another, or of removing drawers from dressers, dumping the contents out on a surface, and looking for things of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Dr. Globus, testifying in surrebuttal, indicated that defendant\u2019s conduct on the nights in question was not inconsistent with a theory of unconsciousness based on psychomotor epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial court instructed the jury in terms of CALJIC No. 4.30<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and No. 4.31.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 510 [61 L.Ed.2d 39, 99 S.Ct. 2450], <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 307 [85 L.Ed.2d 344, 105 S.Ct. 1965], <em>People </em>v. <em>Roder </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 491 [189 Cal.Rptr. 501, 658 P.2d 1302], and related cases, defendant contends that it was constitutional error for the court to instruct the jury on the CALJIC No. 4.31 so-called \u201cpresumption of consciousness\u201d in that the instruction creates a mandatory, rebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>presumption that the jury would have understood as shifting to defendant the burden of proving unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Sandstrom, Franklin, </em>and <em>Roder, supra, </em>stand for the principle that it is a violation of due process to reduce the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Sandstrom </em>and <em>Franklin, </em>both murder cases, the challenged instructions lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving the element of intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra, </em>442 U.S. at pp. 523-524 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 39]; <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 307 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 360].) <em>In Roder, </em>which involved the charge of a secondhand dealer receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subds. 1, 2), the challenged instruction lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving the element of knowledge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (33 Cal.3d at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Defendant argues that because unconsciousness completely negates the intent element of the charged crimes, proof of consciousness is a fact necessary to proof of intent. CALJIC No. 4.31, in creating a presumption of consciousness, therefore impermissibly lightened the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proving intent or, stated conversely, impermissibly shifted to defendant the burden of negating an element of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The Attorney General responds that consciousness is not an element of the offenses, but rather, is an affirmative defense, and that placing on the defendant the burden of proving an affirmative defense does not violate due process. Section 26, he observes, provides that all persons are capable of committing crimes, except for certain specific classes including those \u201cwho committed the act charged without being conscious thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute, he maintains, thus defines unconsciousness as an affirmative defense. Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>when there is evidence tending to show that the defendant was unconscious is the prosecution required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was conscious. In these circumstances, the Attorney General concludes, to permit the prosecution to rely on the rebuttable presumption of consciousness is not a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In support of their respective arguments, both parties cite <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 197 [53 L.Ed.2d 281, 97 S.Ct. 2319]. In <em>Patterson </em>the defendant was charged with second degree murder. Under New York law extreme emotional distress is a defense to the charge, but the burden is on the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Rejecting the contention that this scheme impermissibly shifts the burden of persuasion from the prosecutor to defendant in violation of due process, the high court noted that the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance \u201cdoes not serve to negative any facts of the crime which the State is to prove in order to convict of murder. It constitutes a separate issue on which the defendant is required to carry the burden of persuasion; and unless we are to overturn <em>Leland[</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark>] and <em>Rivera, </em>[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] New York has not violated the Due Process Clause, and Patterson\u2019s conviction must be sustained. fl[] We are unwilling,\u201d the court stated, \u201cto reconsider <em>Leland </em>and <em>Rivera. </em>But even if we were to hold that a State must prove sanity to convict once that fact is put in issue, it would not necessarily follow that a State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact, the existence or nonexistence of which it is willing to recognize as an exculpatory or mitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of the punishment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 206-207 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 290].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Concluding, the court stated; \u201cWe thus decline to adopt as a constitutional imperative, operative countrywide, that a State must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact constituting any and all affirmative defenses related to the culpability of an accused. Traditionally, due process has required that only the most basic procedural safeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society\u2019s interests against those of the accused have been left to the legislative branch. We therefore will not disturb the balance struck in previous cases holding that the Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the offense of which the defendant is charged. Proof of the non-existence of all affirmative defenses has never been constitutionally required; . . .\u201d (432 U.S. at p.210 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 292].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement that the defense of extreme emotional disturbance \u201cdoes not serve to negative any facts of the crime which the State is to prove in order to convict\u201d (432 U.S. at p. 207 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 290]), defendant asserts that where, as here, the defense negatives an element of the offense\u2014to wit, <em>intent\u2014Sandstrom, supra, </em>442 U.S. 510, <em>Franklin, supra, </em>471 U.S. 307, and <em>Roder, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 491 require the prosecution to prove the absence of the asserted defense beyond a reasonable doubt and without the assistance of a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The Attorney General, by contrast, cites <em>Patterson, supra, </em>432 U.S. 197, for the proposition that due process does not require the state to prove the nonexistence of an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 107 [71 L.Ed.2d 783, 102 S.Ct. 1558], the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s constitutional duty to negate affirmative defenses may depend, at least in part, on the manner in which the State defines the charged crime. ... A State may want to assume the burden of disproving an affirmative defense without also designating absence of the defense an element of the crime. [Fn. omitted.] The Due Process Clause does not mandate that when a State treats absence of an affirmative defense as an \u2018element\u2019 of the crime for one purpose, it must do so for all purposes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 797-796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Pursuant to our statutory scheme, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. (\u00a7\u00a7 187-189.) The death, the causation, and the malice are the facts the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt if the defendant is to be convicted of murder. (\u00a7\u00a7 1096, 1105, subd. (a).) Unconsciousness is a defense. (\u00a7 26.)  Although the state, once the defendant raises the issue, has assumed the burden of disproving unconsciousness, this fact of itself does not transform absence of the defense\u2014consciousness\u2014into an element of murder for purposes of due process analysis. This is true even though unconsciousness negates the elements of voluntariness and intent, and when not voluntarily induced is a complete defense to a criminal charge (\u00a7 26, subd. Four; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 717 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]). (See <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, supra, </em>456 U.S. at p. 120 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 795-796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In sum, because consciousness is not an element of the offense of murder (nor of any offense), CALJIC No. 4.31 does not impermissibly shift to the defendant the burden of negating an element, nor does the instruction violate due process by impermissibly lightening the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>constitutional impediment to the state\u2019s use of a rebuttable presumption in meeting its assumed burden\u2014once the issue has been raised\u2014to prove consciousness beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, supra, </em>456 U.S. at p. 120 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 795-796]; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>432 U.S. at p. 210 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 292]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyes </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 812 [197 Cal.Rptr. 105] [upholding former version of CALJIC No. 4.31].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Defendant\u2019s effort to distinguish this case from <em>Patterson </em>on grounds that the unconsciousness defense negatives an element of the crime is unavailing. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s concern in <em>Patterson </em>that the defense of extreme emotional disturbance did not negative any facts of the crime that the state was required to prove related not to whether absence of the defense was an element (which the state would then be required to prove), but rather, to the nature of the defendant\u2019s burden of proof.  The rule is that \u201cwhen there is placed upon an accused the burden of interjecting a factual contention which, if established would tend to overcome or negate proof of any element of the crime charged as otherwise established by the People, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt as to the existence or nonexistence of the fact in issue.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953, 963 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335].) When, however, the defense raises \u201cfactual issues collateral to the question of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence [which] do not bear directly on any link in the chain of proof of any element of the crime\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 964), there is no constitutional impediment to requiring the accused to prove the collateral facts by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(id. </em>at pp. 964-965). (See generally Jeffries &amp; Stephan, <em>Defenses, Presumptions and Burden of Proof in the Criminal Law </em>(1979) 88 Yale L.J. 1325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In <em>Patterson, </em>because the emotional-distress defense raised factual issues collateral to the question of guilt and did not serve to negative any element of the crime charged, the state could constitutionally require the defendant to carry the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. (432 U.S. at pp. 200, 206-207 [53 L.Ed.2d at pp. 286, 289-290]; see also <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 228 [94 L.Ed.2d 267, 107 S.Ct. 1098].)  In the instant case, by contrast, defendant\u2019s burden was only to raise a reasonable doubt that he was conscious, and then only if the prosecution\u2019s proof did not of itself raise such a doubt. (Cf. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 233 [94 L.Ed.2d at p. 274] [to convict, jury had to be convinced that none of the evidence, whether offered by state or defendant, raised a reasonable doubt]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Loggins </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 597, 601-602 [100 Cal.Rptr. 528] [construing \u00a7 1105 concerning defendant\u2019s duty to come forward with evidence].)  Hence, it is immaterial for present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>purposes that the unconsciousness defense served to negative an element of the crime.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">CALJIC No. 4.31, moreover, cannot be read in a vacuum.  As the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cAnalysis must focus initially on the specific language challenged, but the inquiry does not end there. If a specific portion of the jury charge, considered in isolation, could reasonably have been understood as creating a presumption that relieves the State of its burden of persuasion on an element of an offense, the potentially offending words must be considered in the context of the charge as a whole. Other instructions might explain the particular infirm language to the extent that a reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption. [Citation.] This analysis \u2018requires careful attention to the words actually spoken to the jury . . ., for whether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 315 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 354]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 538-539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Here, in addition to standard instructions on the presumption of innocence, the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, and the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove intent or mental state,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the jury was instructed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>unconsciousness was a complete defense, that evidence <em>had been received </em>which tended to show that defendant was unconscious, and that if it had a reasonable doubt that defendant was conscious, it <em>must </em>find him not guilty. (CALJIC No. 4.30, <em>supra, </em>fn. 8.) Placed in context, therefore, CALJIC No. 4.31 did little more than guide the jury as to how to evaluate evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s consciousness and apply it to the issue, an issue that is capable of proof only by circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct. (Cf. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 106 S.Ct. 3101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We conclude, therefore, that given the entirety of the charge a reasonable juror could not have believed that defendant was required to persuade it that he was unconscious. Rather, the instructions taken as a whole clearly indicate the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only that defendant appeared to be conscious, but also that he in fact was conscious. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 540; compare <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 319-320 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 357] with <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 140, 160-161 [60 L.Ed.2d 777, 794-795, 99 S.Ct. 2213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We note, finally, that even were we to assume, contrary to our determination, that CALJIC No. 4.31 implicates due process concerns, any error in giving the instruction would be harmless under the <em>Chapman </em>standard of review <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711]). (See Rose v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>478 U.S. at pp. 582-583 [92 L.Ed.2d at pp. 473-474].) The defense and prosecution experts both testified that an individual experiencing a psychomotor epileptic seizure could perform \u201cwell-learned\u201d or automatic \u201cpreprogrammed\u201d kinds of activity, like walking or eating, but would be incapable of reasoned or coordinated complicated kinds of movement. Defendant\u2019s acts in the Schendel case clearly were purposeful, motivated behavior: Cutting open Ms. Schendel\u2019s screen door; ransacking her apartment and removing items of value; pulling her nightclothing above her breasts; placing a mattress on the trunk of her body and a teapot on her pubic area; tying a leather strap to her ankle; and inflicting repeated severe blows on her person. In the W. case the same is true: Demanding her car; beating her into unconsciousness; removing her lower clothing; and taking her cash and jewelry. The record thus establishes defendant\u2019s consciousness beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>478 U.S. at pp. 580-581 [92 L.Ed.2d at pp. 472-473]; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497, 502-503 [95 L.Ed.2d 439, 446, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 1922].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">D. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In his closing arguments during the guilt and sanity phases of trial, the prosecutor made unflattering remarks about defendant\u2019s expert witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>inveighed against psychiatric defenses and, in the sanity phase, suggested that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity would let defendant \u201coff the hook.\u201d Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Although some of the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were made during closing argument in the guilt phase of trial, most were made during the sanity phase. Because defendant has discussed all the comments together, examining especially their cumulative effect in the sanity phase, we shall do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We first observe that defendant failed to object at trial to any of the asserted instances of misconduct, nor was any admonition requested. Thus, defendant waived his right to raise the issue on appeal unless any harm flowing from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks could not have been cured by timely objection and admonition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 34-35.) However, as we discuss below, defendant contends that counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Because defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim requires that we examine the merits of his prosecutorial misconduct claim, we shall do so notwithstanding his failure to object. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 581 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">1. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s Appeal to the Passions and Prejudices of the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> Defendant asserts that the prosecutor appealed to the passions and prejudices of the jury by impugning the expertise of the defense expert witnesses and by urging the jury to join in a crusade against psychiatric testimony in the courtroom. Defendant cites the following comments during the guilt phase: 1. \u201c[Psychiatrists have this self-anointed capacity to perceive things better than other people. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">2. [In describing defense psychiatrist Dr. Globus]: \u201c[W]hat <em>he </em>perceives <em>himself </em>to be, that is, an expert.\u201d (Italics added by defendant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">3. [In describing defense psychologist Dr. Blunt]: \u201cJust because she\u2019s testified before in six cases does not make her an expert, because you\u2019ve got to look behind the facts and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">4. \u201cWe are letting justice be decided on the basis of how well a psychiatrist can sell their bag of tricks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">5. [Describing psychiatrists]: \u201c. . . because they are so vain as to think that they are capable of all these magical, mystical things that they say they are capable of . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>These comments, defendant complains, improperly urged the jury to disregard the trial court\u2019s judicial determination (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 405, 720) that the defense psychiatrist and psychologist, Dr. Globus and Dr. Blunt, qualified as experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The record discloses that the prosecutor, in making the challenged remarks, repeatedly referred to the testimony of prosecution rebuttal witness Dr. Lee Coleman, who expounded at length on his view that psychiatrists and psychologists have no business in the courtroom. In Dr. Coleman\u2019s opinion, psychiatric diagnosis is very unreliable and what a psychiatrist or psychologist does is an art, not a science. According to Dr. Coleman, there is nothing in the normal training of psychologists or psychiatrists that would allow either to make the inferences they are asked to make in legal proceedings concerning the mental state of defendants at the time of the charged offenses. Discussing what he perceived to be the deficiencies of the clinical interview that forms the basis for an expert\u2019s forensic opinion, Dr. Coleman stated: \u201cWell, the first weakness has to do with the fact that . . . the expectation is there, that the doctor, as a result of this interview, will be able to form an opinion without the kind of guesswork and hunches that ordinary people would have to rely on. . . . In other words, there\u2019s an expectation that the doctor\u2019s doing something special. The truth is that they are not doing anything special, they are basically reading information, listening to a person talk, decid[ing] what you\u2019re going to believe, what you\u2019re not going to believe .... So there\u2019s often a misconception that something special has happened that [hasn\u2019t].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Continuing, Dr. Coleman stated that \u201cthere seems to be a strong bias on the part of mental health professionals to believe what they are told .... I think that comes from the fact that in a normal clinical setting, there\u2019s no reason not to believe what you\u2019re being told because the patient comes to you with a problem and he has nothing to gain by not telling you the truth. But in a legal setting, there may be something to gain, but I think doctors have trouble making that shift and acting as a fact finder. I think they may be not as good as ordinary people in that respect.\u201d A clinical interview, the doctor concluded, is not a reliable and valid technique for coming to a legal conclusion in the forensic context, such as rendering an opinion as to whether or not a person could premeditate or deliberate at a particular point in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The use of the person\u2019s history, going back to childhood, is equally infirm, according to Dr. Coleman. \u201c[A] psychiatrist or psychologist is not able to take that information and reach conclusions from it that an ordinary person couldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Asked on cross-examination if the thrust of his testimony was to say \u201cwait, don\u2019t consider this [psychiatric and psychological testimony] at all because it\u2019s unreliable,\u201d Dr. Coleman replied that that was not the import of his testimony: \u201c[T]hat would be trying to change the law, because the law requires [the jury] to listen to it, to consider it, and in each expert\u2019s case to decide how much weight they want to give it. I am arguing as my opinion based on all the things I\u2019ve said in terms of my background that it does not really\u2014shouldn\u2019t be given any weight, that after being considered, it shouldn\u2019t be given any weight.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Viewed in the context of Dr. Coleman\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor\u2019s comments disparaging the expertise of the defense psychologist and psychiatrist to form an opinion about defendant\u2019s mental state were based on the evidence. The comments went to the weight of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, not its admissibility. The remarks therefore were not improper. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 35; see generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Beivelman </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 60, 76-77 [73 Cal.Rptr. 521, 447 P.2d 913], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>at pp. 33-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">During the sanity phase, defendant complains of the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that \u201cin a sense <em>we have a social cancer in our community now, and it is this very process of allowing psychiatrists to come in and make their moral pronouncements disguised as medical opinion in the hopes of persuading jurors to let people off the hook, </em>so to speak, by saying that this very hard to get at type of thing, that is, the person\u2019s mental state, can be definitively defined by them simply going through their clinical interviews and going through their tests and projecting it to a time in the past. <em>That\u2019s a social cancer.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Continuing, the prosecutor stated: <em>\u201cNow, we\u2019re not like surgeons who can take a scalpel and pull that out and get rid of it. </em>What we have in that sort of thing is men who have courage like Lee Coleman, to walk into the lion\u2019s den in the courtroom, men who have experience, and say we are making a mistake, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this, and let\u2019s not do it, and to stand up against his fellow psychiatrists who say hey, no problem, I can do these things. . . . ffl] <em>That takes a lot of courage, and that\u2019s the kind of thing, the kind of way that social cancers are removed, is like people like Lee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><em>Coleman who had the courage to stand up and be heard, even in what may seem to be an unpopular cause.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">These remarks, defendant complains, constituted an attack not against the specific testimony elicited about defendant, but against the entire process of permitting psychiatrists to testify on a defendant\u2019s behalf, and as such, were a call to the jury \u201cto legislate judicial reform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We are of the view that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks approached misconduct. A prosecutor may vigorously urge his points as long as he does not act unfairly and may use appropriate epithets where warranted by the nature of the case and the evidence adduced. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 18, 36-37 [88 Cal.Rptr. 789]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 805, 809 [48 Cal.Rptr. 371, 409 P.2d 211], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 33-34.)  Here, however, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were directed not to evidence of defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offenses nor to the weight to be given his experts\u2019 testimony, but rather, challenged the entire system of permitting psychiatric testimony on behalf of criminal defendants. The remarks thus went beyond the evidence and beyond any legitimate issue in the case. The law permits a defendant to assert a psychiatric defense and to have expert witnesses testify in his behalf. The courtroom is not the proper forum to challenge the propriety of this system. The prosecutor\u2019s harangue therefore was inappropriate and is not to be condoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In the present case, however, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, although skirting the edge of propriety, were clearly nonprejudicial. The prosecutor did not, as defendant maintains, urge the jury to remove the social cancer from the courtroom, but rather, stated that he and the jury could <em>not </em>do so; the asserted misuse of mental health testimony in the courtroom could be cured only by psychiatrists like Lee Coleman, who have the courage to stand up to their colleagues and say \u201clet\u2019s not make these moral pronouncements disguised as medical opinion.\u201d Dr. Coleman, as indicated, had testified that he was not urging the jury to disregard the psychiatric testimony, because the law requires the jury to consider it. The court, moreover, instructed the jury that the law permitted expert testimony on the issue of defendant\u2019s mental capacity and that the jury should give such testimony the weight to which it found it to be entitled. Finally, defense counsel, as will appear below in our discussion of defendant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, was of the view that the jury was \u201cnot receiving\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cthe way they were sent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>2. <em>Unwarranted Personal Attacks on Defendant\u2019s Expert Witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor also improperly attacked the integrity, motive and character of his expert witnesses by asserting that they testified solely for monetary gain and implying that they manufactured their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">As an implication of manufactured testimony, defendant cites the following guilt phase comment by the prosecutor: \u201cWhen the flatterers come to them and say we have a case for you, we have a case where, you know, you are as good, delve into the fact[s] and pull the facts out and come into court and tell us that this Manuel Babbitt didn\u2019t have any mental states that are required under the law for the crimes that he\u2019s charged with, so won\u2019t you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The thrust of this comment was, again, that psychologists and psychiatrists do not have any special skill that would allow them to tell the jury that an accused is not responsible for his crimes. Drawing by analogy on the story, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d where the tailors through \u201coverwhelming flattery\u201d succeeded in appealing to the Emperor\u2019s vanity, the prosecutor stated that \u201cwe have an emperor in the form of [these] psychologists and psychiatrists who . . . are vain enough to think that they have these capabilities. ...[]]] And so one day, the psychiatrists having [been] flattered to the point <em>of </em>thinking they have something they don\u2019t, come to court, . . . they have a parade and display all these things that they claim they have, which they really don\u2019t have, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">These comments were based on Dr. Coleman\u2019s testimony about the limitations of psychiatric opinion on the issue of an accused\u2019s mental capacity to commit a crime. They did not imply a manufactured defense, but rather, a misconception on the part of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists about their expertise in making legal judgments. As such, the comments were not misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">In other comments the prosecutor, defendant maintains, in effect argued that the psychiatric witnesses were \u201cusing\u201d the criminal justice system to advance their own business interests and that they therefore should not be trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">The evidence showed that Dr. Blunt had been licensed as a psychologist only two years when she was employed by defense counsel, that in this time she had testified in five other cases, and that her efforts on defendant\u2019s behalf had earned her over $14,000. Dr. Globus had been in full-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>private practice less than two years at the time of trial and he spent up to two-thirds of his time doing forensic examinations. He had testified in 75 to 100 civil and criminal cases. Dr. Axelrad originally discussed a fee of $120 an hour, but he agreed to receive $80 an hour for his services. At the time of his testimony he had put 117 hours into defendant\u2019s case, thus earning himself $9,360.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">These facts support an inference of the defense expert witnesses\u2019 economic motive to testify.  It is within the bounds of proper argument to attack the credibility of defense expert witnesses, and the weight to be given their testimony, based on the witnesses\u2019 compensation and the fact of their employment. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 722, subd. (b), 780, subd. (f); <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1061, 1086 [80 Cal.Rptr. 567, 458 P.2d 479], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 33-34.)  The prosecutor\u2019s comments thus were not misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">3. <em>Suggestion That a Finding of Insanity Would Free Defendant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Relying <em>on People </em>v. <em>Criscione </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 275 [177 Cal.Rptr. 899] and related cases, defendant urges that the prosecutor improperly argued that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity would relieve him from punishment for his actions and result in his being set free forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Defendant first cites the guilt phase comment that defendant is \u201csimply a criminal, . . . and don\u2019t be misled by the disguise that has been attempted to be put over him to make him out something that he\u2019s not. . . . fl[] Everyday common criminal. For Dr. Globus to come in here and tell us anything different is the height of intellectual arrogance. His answer simply should have been to the question put to him, hey, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell you. And for him to say that it\u2019s likely that he had diminished capacity, it gives more credence to the things that Lee Coleman was saying, that psychiatrists have this self-anointed capacity to perceive things better than other people, and all they have to do is examine a few facts and <em>they are perfectly willing to come to court and absolve an individual such as Manuel Babbitt of all criminal responsibility </em>on such things as another doctor\u2019s report and a hypothetical question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">This comment was not improper. Dr. Globus, who testified for the defense on surrebuttal, had reviewed Dr. Blunt\u2019s report, but had not himself examined defendant. In response to defense counsel\u2019s hypothetical question concerning the mental capacity of a \u201cthirty-two year old black male who may have suffered a head injury . . .\u201d and whose history paralleled defendant\u2019s history, Dr. Globus offered the opinion that the individual had diminished capacity. Because the purpose and effect of a successful diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>capacity defense is to reduce or absolve the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was a fair comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In the sanity phase, defendant again challenges the prosecutor\u2019s \u201csocial cancer\u201d comment wherein he referred to \u201cthis process of allowing psychiatrists to come in and make their moral pronouncements disguised as medical opinion <em>in the hopes of persuading jurors to let people off the hook, </em>so to speak, by saying that this very hard to get at type of thing, that is the person\u2019s mental state, can be definitively defined by them. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s reference to letting people \u201coff the hook, so to speak\u201d was nothing more than a reiteration of his earlier statement about the willingness of some psychiatrists and psychologists to testify to an individual\u2019s insanity at the time of an offense. An accused who is found to have been insane is absolved of criminal responsibility (\u00a7\u00a7 1016, 1026), and thus, in the colloquial, is \u201clet off the hook.\u201d The comment was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Defendant also complains of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the sanity phase relating to Dr. Axelrad\u2019s diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, as follows: \u201cNow, you know, we can all buy this little business of what diagnosis criteria Mr. Babbitt meets. But let me point out this one about the intermittent explosive disorder. And it\u2019s kind of got a little sex appeal, too. It\u2019s kind of tantalizing. Boy, that would just fit, intermittent explosive disorder. Here\u2019s this guy walking down the street, all of a sudden he gets mad and beats up on somebody. I\u2019m going to find this guy crazy and <em>let him go home. . . . </em>ffl] I want to ask anybody if you lost your temper? You had intermittent explosive disorder. And let\u2019s not try to make anything out of it more than that, because if you do, everytime somebody gets mad, <em>they are free to commit any crime they want, </em>and they can be found not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Dr. Axelrad had defined intermittent explosive disorder as \u201ca mental disorder . . . which would include several discrete episodes of loss of control of aggressive impulses that result in serious assault or destruction of property. For example, with no or little provocation, an individual may suddenly start to hit strangers and throw furniture. . . . There are no signs of generalized impulsivity or aggressiveness between the episodes.\u201d Court-appointed psychiatrist Dr. Elmer Galioni testified with respect to the intermittent explosive disorder diagnosis that \u201cYes, there were some instances where [defendant] reacted explosively to some situations. ... I think at least on one occasion he did abruptly hit his wife, when she, should I say, irritated him.\u201d But some elements of the diagnosis did not fit in that \u201cthere were still some general impulsivity in between the episodes, and his violent behavior was not always in response to a precipitating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Based on the foregoing testimony, the prosecutor in his argument equated the asserted disorder to an individual\u2019s loss of temper and indicated that if the jurors ever had lost their tempers, then under Dr. Axelrad\u2019s analysis they too had intermittent explosive disorder, and hence were insane at the time. In asserting that they thus would be \u201cfree\u201d to commit a crime, the prosecutor was referring not to a freedom from confinement, but to the freedom from criminal responsibility that follows from a finding of insanity. In light of the evidence, the prosecutor committed no impropriety in disparaging the intermittent explosive disorder diagnosis and arguing what he believed its logical extension to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"> In sum, with the exception discussed below, none of the prosecutor\u2019s comments improperly suggested to the jury that if defendant were found to have been not sane at the time of the offenses, he would go free.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The exception is the prosecutor\u2019s statement concerning someone who \u201cgets mad and beats up on somebody,\u201d i.e., \u201cI\u2019m going to find this guy crazy and let him go home.\u201d To the extent the prosecutor was suggesting that when an accused is found insane he is let free, his comment was improper. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Modesto </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 695, 708-709 [59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 427 P.2d 788], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 375, 383, fn. 8 [66 Cal.Rptr. 724, 438 P.2d 372] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 721; <em>People </em>v. <em>Criscione, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d at p. 293; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mallette </em>(1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 294, 299-300 [102 P.2d 1084].) The question is whether the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 51 [108 Cal.Rptr. 698], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wetmore </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 318, 324, footnote 5 [149 Cal.Rptr. 265, 583 P.2d 1308], the court determined that the prosecutor\u2019s implication in summation that \u201ca finding of insanity would result in freeing the criminally insane and dangerous defendant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 71) was not prejudicial per se, but rather was governed by the <em>Watson (supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818) standard of review\u2014i.e., whether there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the misconduct the jury would have returned a finding more favorable to the defendant (33 Cal.App.3d at p. 71). (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Beivelman, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 75; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 36; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 214 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Distinguishing earlier cases finding similar misconduct to be reversible error, the court first reviewed a then-recent empirical study of jury behavior in insanity trials, which determined that\u2014contrary to the expectations of the bench and bar\u2014\u201cjurors are generally aware that a criminally insane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>person will be confined in a mental hospital until an authorized agency declares that he has recovered.\u201d (33 Cal.App.3d at p. 74. But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 540, 544 [211 Cal.Rptr. 856].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The court next observed that \u201c[t]here is an independent reason for holding the misconduct harmless. Penal Code section 1026 permits the bifurcated guilt and insanity trials to be heard by the same or a different jury in the discretion of the court. Defendant\u2019s sanity trial took place before the same jury which had just found him in possession of the mental capacity for premeditated and deliberate killing. The jury was now being asked to decide whether, at the time of his attack on the campers, he had been legally insane .... The array of evidence at the guilt trial had moved the jury to reject the defense of mental illness depriving him of capacity to premeditate; the same evidence supplied a strong impetus for rejection of the insanity plea. It precluded any reasonable probability that the district attorney\u2019s impropriety influenced the jury\u2019s rejection of that plea.\u201d (33 Cal.App.3d at p. 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Rejecting the proposition that in light of the foregoing conclusion a \u201cdefendant\u2019s plea of insanity comes before a biased jury when the same jurors have already rejected his claim of diminished mental capacity,\u201d the court stated that \u201c[i]f indeed the jury is predisposed against a defendant on the insanity issue, its predisposition does not stem from its verdict at the guilt trial but from the <em>evidence </em>it has heard. A well-based verdict of capacity to premeditate does not foreclose a verdict of insanity, but makes it unlikely. [Fn. omitted.] The circumstantial evidence which supported the finding of undiminished capacity would be admissible on the insanity issue were the issues heard by the same or separate juries.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d at p. 75, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Here, as in <em>Smith, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 51, any error in the prosecutor\u2019s single improper remark implying that if found insane defendant would be free to go home, was nonprejudicial. The jury had already rejected defendant\u2019s diminished-capacity defense at the guilt phase. Dr. Coleman\u2019s guilt phase testimony, discrediting the testimony of the defense psychiatrists and psychologists and the ability of such professionals to make accurate judgments about a defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of an offense, applied as well to the testimony produced at the sanity phase. Moreover, court-appointed psychiatrist Dr. Elmer Galioni testified at the sanity phase that in his view defendant suffered from nothing more than \u201cpassive-aggressive personality disorder.\u201d In Dr. Galioni\u2019s opinion, defendant did not at the time of the offenses suffer from a mental disorder that deprived him of the \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate his criminality or to conform his behavior to the requirements of law.\u201d Although at the sanity phase it was defendant\u2019s burden to prove legal insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the trial court\u2019s view, expressed in connection with its ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for modification of the penalty, \u201call of the evidence in fact <em>established the defendant\u2019s sanity </em>beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Additional circumstances further militate against any harm from the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Dr. Coleman, on cross-examination during the guilt phase, stated that when someone is found insane, the procedure is that \u201cthey are said to be not responsible legally, and they are sent to a mental institution for an indefinite period of time,\u201d they are confined until expiration of their maximum penalty, whereupon they are released unless the state can show that they continue to be a danger, in which case they are incarcerated longer. Defense counsel in his sanity-phase argument indicated that defendant would not go free when he analogized the jury\u2019s task to the decision faced by defendant\u2019s brother, William Babbitt, \u201cwhen he turned in his sick brother, so that [he] could get treatment and the community would be safe. He saw that responsibility. He recognized and accepted that responsibility. He sought help and treatment, ... I expect that you will act in no less responsible way than he did.\u201d Further, the court instructed the jury not to consider the subject of penalty or punishment in its deliberations on the sanity issue and that the matter of penalty or punishment must not in any way affect its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In light of these factors, we conclude that there is no \u201creasonable probability that the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety supplied an inducing factor in the jury\u2019s election to find defendant sane.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Criscione, supra, </em>relied on by defendant, is distinguishable. In that case there were four instances of egregious misconduct, each one clearly prejudicial. (See 125 Cal.App.3d at pp. 284-292.) In cross-examination of the defense psychiatrist and in argument to the jury, the prosecutor repeatedly suggested that the criminally insane, \u201chowever violent, are immediately set free to prey upon society.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.292.) Thus, the prosecutor argued: \u201c T hope working hard doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re crazy, because we\u2019ve got to start locking up a lot of people. <em>Of course, we don\u2019t lock them up. We just call them insane.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The reviewing court, moreover, had not long before considered misconduct by the same prosecutor. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on the totality of the circumstances, the court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived the defendant of a fair opportunity to have the jury determine his sanity at the time of the killing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 293.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In the instant case the prosecutor\u2019s comment, although improper, did not deprive defendant of a fair sanity hearing nor did it result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>E. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Defendant asserts that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct denied him the effective assistance of counsel. In light of our previous discussion, we reject defendant\u2019s premise that there were such numerous instances. Rather, we consider defendant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim with respect only to counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questionable \u201csocial cancer\u201d remarks and the improper comment \u201cfind him crazy and let him go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel is on the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].) To establish constitutionally inadequate representation, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient representation subjected the defense to prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s failings the result would have been more favorable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-218 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 584; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra; see Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699, 104 S.Ct. 2052].)  When a defendant makes an ineffectiveness claim on appeal, the appellate court must look to see if the record contains any explanation for the challenged aspects of representation. If the record sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged, \u201cunless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 425-426), the case is affirmed <em>(ibid.). </em>In such cases, the ineffective-assistance claim is more appropriately made in a petition for habeas corpus. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Here the appellate record sheds no light on why counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201csocial cancer\u201d and \u201clet him go home\u201d comments. Even assuming, however, that a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate would have objected, neither comment, as our previous discussion concludes, was prejudicial. Consequently, it is not reasonably probable that a determination more favorable to defendant would have resulted had counsel objected and sought an admonition. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 60 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423].) Defendant, therefore, has not established his ineffectiveness claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">III. Petition for Habeas Corpus</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Defendant has filed in this court a petition for writ of habeas corpus in which he asserts the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>he advances on appeal. We consolidated the petition with the appeal and issued an order to show cause. The Attorney General filed a return, and defendant filed a denial. The factual contentions set forth in the petition are identical to those discussed in the context of the appeal and are uncontradicted. Attached to the petition is trial counsel\u2019s declaration setting forth his reasons for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, because our review of the entire record, as determined above, indicates that counsel\u2019s failure to object was nonprejudicial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 584; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 425; see <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 697 [80 L.Ed.2d at pp. 699-700]), it is unnecessary to explore counsel\u2019s reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The order to show cause must be discharged and the petition for writ of habeas corpus denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">IV. Special Circumstance Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Relying on <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826], defendant contends that the felony-murder special-circumstance findings must be set aside because the court failed to instruct the jury that it could find the special circumstance allegations true only if it found that defendant acted with intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306] we reconsidered our <em>Carlos </em>decision. We concluded that the court need not instruct on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder special circumstance unless there is evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant was an accomplice rather than the actual killer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1147.) In the instant case it is undisputed that defendant was the actual killer of Leah Schendel. Failure to instruct on intent therefore was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>V. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">A. <em>Carryover of Prosecutorial Misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks during the guilt and sanity phases, impugning his mental defenses and the integrity of his expert witnesses, necessitate reversal of the penalty determination because the remarks went to the issue at the core of his penalty defense: i.e., whether his conduct should be considered any less blameworthy because it was, according to the defense, the product of mental disease and Vietnam war trauma. Citing <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 98 S.Ct. 2954] and <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 104 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 102 S.Ct. 869], defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived him of his constitutional right to have the jury consider his mental defense as mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">As indicated previously, most of the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were made during the sanity phase of trial. The comments were directed to persuading the jury to reject defense evidence that at the time of the offenses defendant was legally insane. At the penalty phase, by contrast, the prosecutor in closing argument expressly recognized the existence and potential mitigating effect of defendant\u2019s mental problems. In addition, pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.84.1 the court instructed the jury to consider in determining penalty whether at the time of the offense defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance or was suffering from mental disease or defect and whether there was any other circumstance which extenuated the gravity of the crime. (CALJIC No. 8.84.1 (d), (h), (k); \u00a7 190.3, factors (d), (h), (k).) These instructions in effect directed the jury to consider the evidence of defendant\u2019s mental problems. Consequently, any impropriety in the prosecutor\u2019s asserted broad attack against psychiatric evidence was nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">B. <em>Nonstatutory Aggravating Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Defendant complains that the court instructed the jury that in determining penalty it could consider all of the evidence which had been received during any part of the trial and refused to modify CALJIC No. 8.84.1 to specify that the jury could consider only evidence relevant to the statutory aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782], we held that in determining penalty the jury can consider in aggravation only evidence that bears upon one of the statutory listed factors exclusive of factor (k) <em>(id. </em>at pp. 775-776) and that the prosecutor was not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>introduce in aggravation evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cbackground, character, or conduct which is not probative of any specific listed factor,\u201d exclusive of factor (k) <em>(id. </em>at p. 774). We stated further, however, that once the defense has presented background and character evidence admissible under factor (k), relevant and specific prosecution rebuttal evidence is admissible. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 776; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 790-792 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113].) Once a defendant places his general character in issue, \u201cthe prosecutor [is] entitled to rebut with evidence or argument suggesting a more balanced picture of his personality.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 791.) In <em>Boyd </em>we were concerned not with any perceived ambiguity in CALJIC No. 8.84.1, but with prosecution evidence and argument improperly directed to nonstatutory aggravating factors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 772-779; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 730, 777-779 [upholding 1978 law despite failure to exclude nonstatutory aggravating factors as a basis for the death penalty].)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In the instant case the prosecutor did not introduce nonstatutory aggravating evidence at the penalty phase nor did he argue that specific nonstatutory factors could be considered in aggravation. However, anticipating defense counsel\u2019s closing argument concerning defendant\u2019s background and character evidence, the prosecutor stated: \u201cNow, you may also consider the general background, character, history of Manuel Babbitt. While I\u2019m sure there are a lot of things that Mr. Schenk [defense counsel] will rely on in saying that this [evidence] is a mitigating factor, I only point out to you that you know a little bit about Manuel Babbitt, and a lot of it isn\u2019t nice. <em>And you may consider any of that material concerning his character and background as an aggravating factor in determining what the punishment should be.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Defendant argues that the italicized comment permitted the jury to consider in aggravation such nonstatutory factors shown by evidence at the guilt phase as his theft of his brother\u2019s car, his illicit sexual relations with a woman not his wife, his fathering of two children by Theresa Babbitt without legal marriage, and his post-Vietnam consumption of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Defendant\u2019s failure to object compromises his argument. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 791.) In any event, the point lacks merit. It is apparent that the thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was to rebut defense counsel\u2019s anticipated argument concerning the mitigating effect of defendant\u2019s background and character evidence by reminding the jury of the negative aspects of defendant\u2019s character and history\u2014his prior felony convictions and his numerous acts of violence to strangers and family alike, evidence which could properly be considered in aggravation as well as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>rebuttal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Viewed in light of the entire record, the comment could not have misled the jury. At the outset of the penalty phase the court informed the jury that although it could consider the evidence it had previously heard, it was to view the evidence for the \u201cdifferent purpose\u201d of determining penalty, and in considering the evidence, it was to \u201ctake into account and be guided by\u201d the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors as to which it would be instructed. The prosecutor repeated this admonition, followed by enumeration of the aggravating factors the jury could properly consider. Defense counsel in closing argument also enumerated the aggravating factors the jury could properly consider. Counsel expressly informed the jury that it was not entitled to consider defendant\u2019s nonviolent criminal activity, specifically mentioning defendant\u2019s theft of his brother\u2019s car, and cited defendant\u2019s possible intoxication or use of drugs as a mitigating factor. Thereafter the court properly instructed the jury as to the factors it could consider in determining penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Assuming, therefore, that the <em>Boyd </em>directives <em>(supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 762) apply retroactively\u2014an issue that we have not decided (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 375, 441 [243 Cal.Rptr. 842, 749 P.2d 279])\u2014we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s single nonspecific reference to defendant\u2019s background evidence as aggravating could not reasonably have misled the jury concerning the evidence it could consider in determining penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Furthermore, even were we to assume that the jury may have been misled as to the use of nonstatutory aggravating evidence, under any test of prejudice the error could not have affected the penalty verdict. In light of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument advancing defendant\u2019s possible drug use as a mitigating factor and excluding the theft of his brother\u2019s car as aggravating, the only guilt phase evidence the jury may possibly have improperly considered was the evidence related to defendant\u2019s illicit sexual relationship with a woman not his wife and his fathering of two children without benefit of marriage. Viewed in light of all the aggravating evidence properly presented to the jury\u2014the circumstances of the crime itself, including the defenselessness of the victim, defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, his attack on Mavis W., his violent conduct toward his first wife and Theresa Babbitt and his other violent outbursts\u2014consideration of this evidence clearly was nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>C. <em>Instruction on Mitigation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The court instructed the jury in terms of former CALJIC No. 8.84.1 without clarifying that factor (k) of section 190.3 permits the jury to consider any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record as mitigating evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 878, fn. 10 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813].)  Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his proposed clarifying instruction on mitigation<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> deprived him of the opportunity to have the jury consider all his mitigating evidence as required by <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Pursuant to <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>a defendant is entitled to have the jury consider as a mitigating factor \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d (438 U.S. at p. 604 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 990], fn. omitted.) We have determined that section 190.3, factor (k) satisfies the <em>Lockett </em>directive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 541 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837], revd. on other grounds, <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837], <em>see People </em>v. <em>Easley, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 858, 878.) However, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley, supra, </em>we imposed the prospective requirement that trial courts expressly inform the jury that it may consider character and background evidence as well as mitigating evidence that relates to the crime. (34 Cal.3d at p. 878, fn. 10.) Failure of trial courts prior to <em>Easley </em>to give the clarifying instruction does not necessarily invalidate a death penalty verdict. Rather, our task is to review each such prior case on its own merits to determine whether in context the jury may have been misled concerning the scope of the evidence to be considered in its sentencing determination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 544, fn. 17; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 786-787; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 102-103 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 777-778 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250] [1977 law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In the instant case nothing in the court\u2019s instructions or the prosecutor\u2019s argument suggested to the jury that it should not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence. To the contrary, the prosecutor, as discussed previously, expressly informed the jury that it could consider defendant\u2019s \u201cgeneral background, character, [and] history,\u201d and noted that defense counsel would argue that these considerations were mitigating factors. Implicitly recognizing the potential mitigating effect of the evidence, the prosecutor sought to rebut it. Addressing the testimony of defendant\u2019s family that he was a loving person, the prosecutor asserted that theirs was a distorted picture\u2014defendant had been on his best behavior in his contacts with his family. Addressing defense counsel\u2019s anticipated reference to defendant\u2019s combat service in Vietnam, the prosecutor stated that this would be a way of \u201cdiverting attention, trying to make you feel bad, trying to make you feel responsible for the death of Leah Schendel, . . .\u201d He pointed out that the war happened \u201ca long time ago\u201d and urged the jury to remember that its task was \u201cto assess the criminal responsibility of one Manuel Babbitt, and not his conduct in the Vietnam War.\u201d \u201cIs this the kind of murder where we ought to be sensitive to the needs of the person who committed it?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cIs this the kind of murder where we have to be understanding about the circumstances under which it was committed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In sum, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was premised on the relevance of defendant\u2019s background and character evidence. Defense counsel\u2019s argument reinforced the premise. Factor (k), counsel argued, was \u201cthe most important consideration\u201d in the weighing process. Fulfilling the prosecutor\u2019s expectation, defense counsel cited as factors in mitigation within the ambit of factor (k) that defendant\u2019s family believed him to be a loving, caring person and that starting when he was only 17 years old defendant served two tours of duty in Vietnam, earning several medals and citations. Counsel further argued that defendant is a religious person, that he loves his children and his ex-wife, and that he got Theresa Babbitt off of drugs. On this record, we conclude that there exists \u201c \u2018no legitimate basis\u2019 \u201d for believing that the jury was misled concerning its responsibility to consider all of the mitigating evidence in the case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. <em>777, </em>citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 546 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 943] (conc. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">D. <em>Sentencing Discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The jury was instructed pursuant to former CALJIC No. 8.84.2 that \u201cIf you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of death.\u201d Defendant argues that the mandatory language of this instruction precludes the jury from making the individualized sentencing determination required by <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 280, 304-305 [49 L.Ed.2d 944, 961, 96 S.Ct. 2978] (plur. opn.), <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>[57 L.Ed.2d 973, 989-990], and <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>455 U.S. 104, 110-112 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 8-9].</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at page 544, we upheld the 1978 death penalty statute against a challenge that it withdraws constitutionally compelled sentencing discretion from the jury. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1279, fn. 38 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115].) To forestall any possible confusion we directed trial courts in the future to instruct the jury as to the scope of its discretion and responsibility in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Brown. </em>We stated that whether the jury in a <em>pre-Brown </em>case has been misled so as to prejudice the defendant depends on a case-by-case analysis. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>at p. 544, fn. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The prosecutor in the instant case referred extensively to the jury\u2019s weighing function and the difficulty of its ultimate decision. He first stated that the jury had an \u201cawesome and a grave decision to make, . . . one . . . that will cause you all some emotional turmoil, . . .\u201d However, he stated, \u201cyou can simply retreat to the safe haven of the law and catalog the aggravating factors and consider them, consider what weight they have, and catalog whatever mitigating factors you might find, and consider what weight they have, and then attempt to make a balancing. . . .\u201d Later, after reciting what he believed were the applicable aggravating and mitigating circumstances, he concluded that \u201cwhen you weigh the factors, I think the scale will clearly bottom out in favor of the aggravating factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The prosecutor then discussed at length the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine the appropriate punishment for defendant. For three pages of transcript he emphasized that this difficult responsibility had befallen the jurors, that they must not shirk their duty, that justice is ultimately in the hands of individual citizens who are called upon to be jurors. The issue, he urged, is whether they, the jurors, will have the courage to put aside the emotions of their hearts and to make the necessary decision in this case, the individual and collective good judgment to find the \u201ctrue, just, and appropriate punishment.\u201d They were, he stated, \u201cin effect the conscience of the community.\u201d Their individual consciences would best be served \u201cby making the hard decision that must be made with your head and not your heart.\u201d He urged those of the jury who found their way to the just and necessary decision more readily than others \u201cto have compassion and patience for those of you for whom it will be a more difficult decision, because each of you must struggle within yourselves to find that little corner of yourself that will allow us to do what is the right thing in this case. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Defense counsel similarly emphasized the jury\u2019s weighing function and the individual discretion of each juror to reach a conclusion which he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>thought just. \u201cWhat is the concept of outweigh? Is it a quality or a quantity of outweigh? Is this something you put in a computer . . . ? I don\u2019t think so. [H] Should one mitigating factor outweigh all the aggravating when you\u2019re considering taking a man\u2019s life? I believe it\u2019s a qualitative evaluation. And you are required to consider it in that light. [1J] There is no statement in the law of this State that says death is automatic .... The law does not require it. It gives the decision to you. There is no road that leads directly to death. [U] The oath of a juror does not require you to be a faceless executioner of Manny Babbitt. It does not require. And a unanimous decision is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In light of the arguments of both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the jury could not have been misled by the unadorned instruction about its sole responsibility to determine, based on its individualized weighing discretion, whether death was appropriate in this case. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 1278-1280; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">E. <em>Reference to Inapplicable Statutory Mitigating Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.84.1, at the conclusion of the penalty phase the court instructed the jury that it \u201cshall consider ... if applicable\u201d each of the enumerated statutory aggravating and mitigating factors (\u00a7 190.3). Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure sua sponte to delete reference to inapplicable mitigating factors permitted the jury to treat the absence of such factors as aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We previously have rejected the contention that the trial court is required to delete inapplicable mitigating factors from CALJIC No. 8.84.1. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, at pp. 104-105; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 776-777.) Although the absence of any of the statutory factors should not be considered aggravating <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 288-290 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861]), implicit in our previous decisions is the conclusion that CALJIC No. 8.84.1 does not of itself suggest to the jury that it may consider the absent statutory mitigating factors in aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">In the instant case there was no instruction given nor prosecution argument made that might have led the jury to the improper use of absent mitigating factors. Indeed, the prosecutor made no reference to the absent factors, discussing only the mitigating factors relied on by defendant. Defense counsel, in turn, went through the entire list of factors, informing the jury which of the mitigating factors did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>F. <em>Age as an Aggravating Factor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.84.1, the court instructed the jury that it should consider and take into account the defendant\u2019s age at the time of the crime. (See \u00a7 190.3, factor (i).) Observing that age cannot be deemed an aggravating factor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 789), defendant argues that CALJIC No. 8.84.1 is defective in that it permits the jury to consider a defendant\u2019s age in aggravation, a mistake, he asserts, that the trial judge in this case made. (See <em>post </em>at p. 723.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We decline to find the instruction fatally ambiguous. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 316 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149], in rejecting the claim that a failure to specify which of the factors were aggravating and which mitigating made former section 190.3 invalid, we stated, \u201cWe believe that the aggravating or mitigating nature of these various factors should be self-evident to any reasonable person within the context of each particular case.\u201d We see no reason to conclude otherwise concerning the almost identical provisions of the 1978 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">It is true that \u201cmere chronological age . . . should not of itself be deemed an aggravating factor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 789, italics deleted.) Neither should it be deemed a mitigating factor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucky </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 302 [247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052].) \u201cAge alone is plainly \u2018a factor over which one can exercise no control\u2019 <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 789) and as such is not relevant to the issue of penalty.\u201d <em>(Lucky, supra.) </em>Rather, as we explained in <em>Lucky, supra, </em>\u201cage\u201d as used in statutory sentencing factor (i) is \u201ca metonym for any age-related matter suggested by the evidence or by common experience or morality that might reasonably inform the choice of penalty. Accordingly, either counsel may argue any such age-related inference in every case.\u201d (45 Cal.3d at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Here the prosecutor observed that \u201csometimes it\u2019s kind of hard to determine whether or not a person\u2019s age should be a mitigating factor or aggravating factor.\u201d Continuing, he stated that defendant, 31 years old at the time of the offenses, was not a \u201cyoung person in their early twenties or eighteen, nineteen years old, that you might consider the fact of their relative immaturity. . . . [fl] By the same token, he isn\u2019t so far down the line to an older age where you might want to consider his relatively advanced age. He\u2019s really in that age where he should know better and has no excuse for committing the crimes that he\u2019s committed.\u201d These remarks were not error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucky, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>G. <em>Failure to Clarify Which Guilt Phase Instructions Applied to Penalty Phase.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s failure sua sponte to instruct the jury as to which of the guilt and sanity phase instructions applied in the penalty phase denied him a fair penalty phase trial. He asserts that if the jurors ignored all the guilt and sanity phase instructions in their penalty deliberations, then it left the jury without guidance as to how to assess witness credibility<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and created the possibility of an adverse inference from defendant\u2019s failure to testify. If, on the other hand, the jury believed that the guilt and sanity phase instructions applied at the penalty phase, defendant was denied a fair penalty determination because the jury was instructed at the guilt phase not to be influenced by sympathy for defendant and to disregard the consequences of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">We first observe that in the penalty phase, as in the guilt phase, the trial court has no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 758-759 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741].)  Further, we question defendant\u2019s premise that at the penalty phase the jury either applied or rejected in toto all of the guilt phase instructions. The language of the no-sympathy instruction (CALJIC No. 1.00) refers specifically to deciding a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The instructions on witness credibility (CALJIC No. 2.20)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s failure to testify (CALJIC Nos. 2.60, 2.61),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by contrast, make no reference to the issue of guilt or innocence. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>therefore could reasonably have understood that the former did not apply to the penalty phase, whereas the latter did apply. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1209 [240 Cal.Rptr. 666, 743 P.2d 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The question, in any event, is whether the jury may have been misled into applying the antisympathy guilt phase instruction at the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 785; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 624 [244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 761; cf. <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>471 U.S. at pp. 544-546 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837](conc. opn. by O\u2019Connor, J.).) As discussed earlier, both the prosecutor and defense counsel argued the weight of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence, specifically including evidence relating to his background, character and history. The jury was not told that it could not consider sympathy. Nor is there any indication that it may have been misled into applying the antisympathy guilt phase instruction at the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 786.) We conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to give additional clarifying instructions on the subject of sympathy at the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 624; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 102-103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We similarly reject defendant\u2019s argument that there was a prejudicial carryover effect from the final portion of CALJIC No. 1.00, which read \u201cyou will reach a just verdict regardless of what the consequences of such verdict may be.\u201d As with the guilt phase antisympathy instruction (se <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 785), the potential for confusion from the guilt phase instruction to disregard the consequences is attenuated at the penalty phase. Consequently, the question is whether on review of the record as a whole it appears that an abstract possibility of prejudice may have been realized. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 759-760; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Here both the prosecutor and defense counsel emphasized to the jury the gravity of its decision. Thus, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[Y]ou have an awesome and a grave decision to make, . . . [one] that will cause you all some emotional turmoil.\u201d Defense counsel stated; \u201cYou are going to have to consider the fate of Mr. Babbitt. . . . [Y]our decision, should it be death, is a premeditate[d], deliberate, cruel, calculated killing. All twelve of you can decide to kill someone. . . . fl|] You are going to have to face your decision. . . .\u201d We conclude that the jury could not have been misled as to its responsibility to consider the consequences of its decision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>H. <em>Dual Use of Aggravating Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure sua sponte to modify CALJIC No. 8.84.1 improperly permitted the jury to consider the circumstances of Leah Schendel\u2019s death under both factors (a) and (b) and his 1973 Massachusetts robberies under both factors (b) and (c),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> thereby increasing the likelihood that the jury would find that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating and would therefore return a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">It is settled that factors (b) and (c) of section 190.3 pertain only to criminal activity other than the crimes for which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 105-106; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 764.) We have also determined, however, that section 190.3 contemplates the dual consideration of a prior felony conviction under factors (b) and (c) when the underlying felony involved violence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>at pp. 765-766; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 201 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480] [explaining the difference between factors (b) and (c)J.) This is because factors (b) and (c) are directed to distinct aspects of the defendant\u2019s character: his propensity to violence and his failure to respond to correction. To consider each in aggravation does not artificially inflate the aggravating factors, but, rather, truly reflects the defendant\u2019s \u201cparticularized circumstances\u201d (Ju<em>rek </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 262, 274 [49 L.Ed.2d 929, 939, 96 S.Ct. 2950]). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 765-766.) It <em>cannot </em>seriously be disputed that a defendant whose prior conviction involved violence is more culpable than one whose did not, nor that a defendant whose prior violent activity resulted in conviction is more culpable than one who has not previously been punished by the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In the case at bench, in any event, there could have been no confusion concerning the application of the three factors. The prosecutor in closing argument explained that the \u201ccircumstances of the crime\u201d referred to the nature of the attack on Leah Schendel, \u201cany prior felony convictions\u201d referred to defendant\u2019s two convictions for armed robbery, and \u201cother violent criminal conduct\u201d by defendant referred to the attack on Mavis W. and defendant\u2019s other specified assaultive behavior. Defense counsel covered the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>I. <em>Mental State Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions relating to mental disturbance improperly limited consideration of his mental condition in violation of the principle that the jury must be permitted to give weight to all aspects of a defendant\u2019s character and record and the circumstances of the offense. (See <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 989-990]; <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>455 U.S. 104, 110 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Pursuant to factors (d) and (h) of CALJIC No. 8.84.1, the jury was instructed to consider in determining penalty \u201c(d) whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d and \u201c(h) whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or the effects of intoxication.\u201d Defendant maintains that factor (d), by requiring an \u201cextreme\u201d condition, impermissibly excludes consideration of a lesser mental disturbance. He further maintains that the similarity between factor (h) and the test for legal insanity<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> would mislead the jury, which at the sanity phase of trial had found defendant sane, to believe that it could not consider defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at page 776, we rejected the contention that the provision of the 1977 death penalty law which referred to \u201cextreme\u201d mental or emotional disturbance deprived the defendant of his right to have the jury consider all his mitigating evidence, in light of the further \u201ccatchall\u201d provision of the statute, which directed the jury to consider \u201cany other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\u201d (former \u00a7 190.3, factor (j); see now \u00a7 190.3, factor (k)). We determined that under the latter instruction the jury could take into account a mental condition of the defendant \u201cwhich, though perhaps not deemed \u2018extreme,\u2019 nonetheless mitigates the seriousness of the offense.\u201d (43 Cal.3d at p. 776.) The same is true under the 1978 law. In the instant case, no argument was made that defendant\u2019s mental or emotional disturbance could be considered only if \u201cextreme,\u201d the prosecutor recognized that defendant had \u201cmental problems,\u201d and defense counsel expressly argued that defendant was \u201cunder duress or emotional disturbance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Nor do we agree with defendant that factor (h) suggested to the jury that, having found defendant sane, it could not consider his asserted mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>defects or disease in mitigation. Whereas the insanity instruction requires that a defendant lack \u201csubstantial capacity\u201d to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law, factor (h) requires only that his capacity to do so be \u201cimpaired.\u201d The difference between the two standards is readily apparent. Further, both the prosecutor and defense counsel informed the jury that defendant\u2019s mental condition could properly be considered even though the jury had found him to be legally sane.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, in response to an inquiry from the jury during deliberations as to whether instruction (i)\u2014the age of defendant at the time of the crime\u2014 referred to chronological age or state of mental development, the court instructed the jury that \u201cstate of mental development is provided for under (h) and/or (k).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On the record before us there is nothing to suggest that the jury failed to give full consideration to defendant\u2019s evidence of his mental or emotional state at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">J. <em>Exclusion of Mental Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Defendant maintains that independent of its impact on the guilt and sanity phases, exclusion of certain of his mental-state evidence, discussed <em>ante, </em>requires reversal of his penalty verdict in that it removed from the jury\u2019s consideration factors in mitigation under factors (d), (h), and (k) of CALJIC No. 8.84.1. As indicated, however, exclusion of the cited evidence at the guilt and sanity phases was not error. Defendant did not seek to introduce the evidence at the penalty phase. Moreover, much of the cited evidence\u2014that defendant suffered a head injury in Vietnam, that he received a head injury when he was 12 years old, that he was upset by symbols of Vietnam, and that his behavior changed for the worse on his return from Vietnam\u2014was before the jury in any event, as was abundant other evidence relative to defendant\u2019s asserted mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>K. <em>Motion to Reduce Penalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Defendant alleges that the trial court\u2019s denial of his section 190.4, subdivision (e) motion to reduce the penalty<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> was erroneously based on a misunderstanding of the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, requiring that the penalty judgment be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Defendant first cites the court\u2019s consideration of his two robbery felony convictions under both factors (b) and (c) of section 190.3 (see fn. 27, <em>ante). </em>As previously indicated, however, when a defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions involve violent criminal activity, the convictions may properly be considered under both factors (b) and (c). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>supra, 44 Cal.3d at pp. 765-766.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Defendant next asserts that the court incorrectly assessed his mental state evidence under factors (d) (\u201cextreme\u201d mental or emotional disturbance) and (h) (\u201cimpaired\u201d capacity). The record shows, however, that in weighing and considering the expert testimony, the court rejected the evidence of defendant\u2019s mental problems and accepted as the more credible the testimony of Dr. Coleman that defendant did not suffer from emotional or mental disturbance and that of Dr. Galioni that he did not have impaired mental capacity.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In light of its assessment of the evidence, the court did not err in failing to consider defendant\u2019s mental state as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Defendant asserts additionally that as to factor (h) the court erroneously found his lack of impaired capacity to be a factor in aggravation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>in context, the court\u2019s comment appears to be a reference to the fact that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cpurposeful, and . . . was goal oriented,\u201d which fact the court had found negated any impairment. (See fn. 31, <em>ante.) </em>The purposeful nature of defendant\u2019s conduct could properly be viewed as an aggravating circumstance of the offense under factor (a). In any event, the error, if any, could not have affected the court\u2019s ruling in light of the court\u2019s determination that there were numerous other proper factors in aggravation and no real mitigating factors and the further fact that the court did not engage in a mechanical counting of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Defendant contends that the court erroneously considered his age as an aggravating factor. The record shows that the court determined that defendant\u2019s age could not \u201coperate as a mitigating factor, especially when viewed against [his] prior exposure to the criminal process. . . . [T]he defendant is indeed old enough to have learned from his past behavior and mistakes . . . .\u201d The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s age \u201ccertainly . . . produces no mitigation. If anything, it produces further aggravation . . . .\u201d The court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s age was not error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucky, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Finally, defendant argues that the court erroneously failed to treat his combat duty in Vietnam and its impact on him as mitigating factors under factors (d), (h) or (k) of section 190.3. Defendant asserts that his combat service in Vietnam is \u201cper se a mitigating circumstance,\u201d and that while the trial court could have found that it was outweighed by aggravating factors, the court was not free to determine that the experience was not a mitigating circumstance. Defendant cites the commendations and medals he received, as well as the brutal nature of his combat duty and the devastating effect it had on him, as matters that were not seriously in dispute and that were necessarily of mitigating effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Defendant\u2019s premise that the court failed to consider the mitigating effect of his combat service is faulty. Although the court stated that \u201cto the extent that the label of post-Vietnam stress syndrome or any other label may be applicable to the defendant within the field of psychiatry, . . . that condition simply does not extenuate the gravity of the crime, so the Court finds no mitigation under this factor [(k)],\u201d and that it found that there are no \u201creal mitigating factors,\u201d it further stated that it had given consideration to the matters testified to by defendant\u2019s family (defendant\u2019s attributes and the post-Vietnam changes in him) and to defendant\u2019s expressions suggestive of remorse, \u201c[b]ut to the extent that those may be factors in mitigation, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the extent that they exist, there are in opposition to those factors many, many aggravating circumstances . . . .\u201d The court thus concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and \u201cthat the jury\u2019s verdict is supported certainly beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The trial court\u2019s charge under section 190.4, subdivision (e) is independently to review the evidence and, guided by the factors set forth in section 190.3, to determine \u201cwhether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.\u201d In the instant case, in light of the numerous aggravating factors properly cited by the court\u2014the merciless beating and sexual assault of a \u201cvery frail\u201d 78-year-old woman who had \u201cthe sanctity and privacy of her home violated\u201d and her \u201cphysical person and her physical surroundings . . . totally violated and destroyed, including her dignity as a human being,\u201d the multiple special circumstances that the homicide occurred during the commission of three specified felonies, the brutal attack on Mavis W. who evidently was spared death only by the \u201chappenstance of someone . . . interrupting the attack,\u201d defendant\u2019s history of violent behavior, his prior felony convictions, and the court\u2019s determination of no mitigating factors\u2014it is inconceivable that the trial court, absent the asserted errors, would have ruled differently on defendant\u2019s application for modification of the verdict of death. Any error, therefore, was nonprejudicial. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 883, 971-972 [245 Cal.Rptr. 336, 751 P.2d 395] [1977 law]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 624-625 [no indication court misapplied proper review standard].)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">L. <em>Victim Impact Statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">After denial of the verdict modification application, the court, pursuant to section 1191.1,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> considered the victims, views concerning the crimes and defendant before imposing judgment. Relying on the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529], defendant argues that the court\u2019s consideration of the victims\u2019 views requires that the penalty judgment be vacated and remanded for reconsideration of the verdict-modification application.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>In <em>Booth, supra, </em>the high court held that the admission of a \u201cvictim impact statement\u201d in a capital sentencing procedure violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it focuses attention on a factor not generally known to the defendant and hence not relevant to his or her blameworthiness. In the instant case the trial court considered the victims\u2019 statements only after it ruled on the modification application and only in connection with the sentences to be imposed on defendant\u2019s noncapital offenses. In this context consideration of the victims\u2019 statements was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">M. <em>Constitutionality of Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Defendant asserts that the 1978 statute is unconstitutional under the due process and the cruel and/or unusual punishment clauses of the California and the federal Constitutions (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, subd. (a), 15, 17; U.S. Const., Amends. VIII, XIV) because it does not require as a prerequisite to imposition of the death penalty that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors and that death is the appropriate penalty. We rejected essentially identical constitutional challenges in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 777-779. For the reasons stated therein we conclude the statute is not unconstitutional on the asserted grounds. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">N. <em>Proportionality Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Defendant requests this court to undertake a comparative sentence review (also denoted an \u201cintercase proportionality review\u201d) to determine whether under the California Constitution his death sentence is disproportionate to the penalty imposed on other persons who have committed similar offenses. Defendant acknowledges that comparative review is not required by the federal Constitution. <em>(Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 37, 50-51 [79 L.Ed.2d 29, 40-41, 104 S.Ct. 871].) He asserts, however, that the due process and equal protection clauses and the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment of the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15, 17) authorize and require such review. Further, he maintains that insofar as comparative sentence review is provided to noncapital felons under section 1170, subdivision (f), equal protection requires that it also be afforded capital defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">We have consistently declined to undertake intercase proportionality review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 375, 445 [1978 law]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1285 [1978 statute <em>not </em>unconstitutional for failure to require intercase proportionality review]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 777-779 [same].) In <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>U.S. at pages 51-54 [79 L.Ed.2d at pp. 41-43], the United States Supreme Court determined that our death penalty statute is valid notwithstanding the lack of such proportionality review. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 778.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Defendant\u2019s claim that equal protection requires that we afford capital defendants the comparative sentence review that is provided noncapital defendants by section 1170, subdivision (f),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 1286-1288 (plur. opn.). (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 772.) For the reasons stated therein, we adhere to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Insofar as defendant seeks to assert that his death sentence is disproportionate to his individual culpability within the meaning of <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697], he has failed to offer any analysis of the facts to support this claim and our reading of the record does not support it. (Cf. <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 137 [95 L.Ed.2d 127, 107 S.Ct. 1676] [Eighth Amendment does not prohibit death penalty for a defendant whose \u201cparticipation is major and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference to the value of human life\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">VI.
