Over the course of several months, he used his authority as a police officer to help his drug-dealing friend procure and transport marijuana. In return he received a share of the profits that his friend made when the marijuana was sold. An FBI investigation led to Perez\u2019s arrest, and a jury eventually convicted him of conspiring and attempting to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute. He was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment for his crimes. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Around 1996 or 1997 and before he became a police officer, Perez met Carlos Santurtun Teran and the two men became close friends.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over the course of their friendship, Perez learned that Teran was a convicted felon who was making money as a marijuana dealer. The two men maintained their friendship after Perez became a police officer, and Teran continued to tell Perez about his deals buying and selling marijuana. At some point during their relationship, Perez told Teran that he could \u201ccount on him\u201d to help with \u201cwhatever [Teran] needed him to do\u201d to further his marijuana deals, so long as Perez \u201ccould make some money.\u201d Perez offered to help Teran because he needed money to pay child support. He also needed money to pay for the house where his ex-wife and child lived, as well as the apartment where he lived with his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">A. Perez and Others Steal Ten Pounds of Marijuana from a Drug Dealer</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">In March 2010 Perez, Teran, and two other men \u2014 Wilfredo Gonzalez Arce and Javier Lopez \u2014 devised a plan to steal ten pounds of marijuana from Danny Zequi-era, an acquaintance of Lopez. Teran proposed to the group that they could steal the marijuana by having Perez perform a traffic stop of the car that Zequiera would be traveling in with the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Pursuant to the plan, Lopez told Zequi-era that Arce had a buyer for his marijuana, and Zequiera met Arce at Lopez\u2019s house to bring the drugs to Arce\u2019s buyer. Zequiera placed the marijuana in Arce\u2019s car, and the two of them drove together toward Miami Beach to meet the alleged buyer. On the way to Miami Beach, Arce drove past an intersection where Perez was waiting in an unmarked police car. At that intersection, Arce intentionally r\u00e1n a stop sign and Perez pulled the car over. After Arce and Zequiera gave Perez their drivers\u2019 licenses, Perez asked for Arce\u2019s consent to search the car because he said he smelled \u201ca bad odor\u201d inside the car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Arce consented to the search, and Perez \u201cdiscovered\u201d Zequiera\u2019s marijuana when he opened the trunk of the car. Arce told Perez that the marijuana belonged to him, and Perez allowed Zequiera to leave because Arce had claimed responsibility for the marijuana. Perez cuffed Arce and placed him in his police car. In the meantime, Teran, who was nearby in his car, called for a tow truck to come get Arce\u2019s ear. Perez began driving toward the jail with Arce in case he was being followed, but he soon changed course and drove to Teran\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">After Zequiera, Arce, and Perez left the scene of the traffic stop, Zequiera retrieved his car from Lopez\u2019s house and returned to the scene of the stop. He saw the tow truck taking away the car and he followed the truck, eventually ending up at Teran\u2019s condo. He made his way inside and confronted Arce, Teran, and Perez about the theft. Although Perez \u201cwanted to shoot\u201d Zequiera, Teran defused the tension and convinced Zequiera to come back the next day for his marijuana. But Teran never returned the marijuana, telling Ze-quiera that \u201cthe policeman [did not] want to give it\u201d back. Teran eventually sold the marijuana for $33,000 and split the proceeds between himself, Arce, and Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">More than a month after the conspirators stole Zequiera\u2019s marijuana, Teran and Perez met with Eric Diaz, one of Teran\u2019s associates, to plan a \u201crip\u201d of a woman who was driving from New York to Broward County with a large amount of money to purchase marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Diaz was an FBI informant, and he recorded the conversation he had with Teran and Perez. During the conversation, Teran and Perez told Diaz about how they had ripped off Zequi-era. Teran recounted how Perez \u201cwas going to shoot\u201d Zequiera until Teran \u201cgot in the middle and told him not\u201d to do it. Perez confirmed Teran\u2019s version of events, responding with comments such as \u201c[n]o kidding bro\u201d and \u201cI swear to God, bro.\u201d Perez also said to Diaz: \u201cI\u2019d kill him bro, we needed [the marijuana] so badly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">B. Perez, Teran, and Arce Steal 14 Pounds of Marijuana from Drug Dealers</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">In May 2010 Arce learned that one of his father\u2019s friends was looking to sell 14 pounds of marijuana. He set up a meeting with Teran and Perez, and the three men agreed that Perez would perform another phony traffic stop so they could steal the marijuana from the seller, just as they had done with Zequiera. Following through with the plan, Arce met with the seller on May 24 at a prearranged location and told the seller that he would lead him to the buyer. Perez, who was dressed in his police uniform and waiting nearby in his police car, followed Arce and the seller.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He eventually pulled over the seller\u2019s car and brought 14 pounds of marijuana to Teran\u2019s house after the stop. Teran then sold the drugs and divided the proceeds between himself, Perez, and Arce. Perez\u2019s share was $17,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">C. Teran Transports Marijuana with Perez Serving as an Escort</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">Jesus Mancha Guerra, a marijuana grower, was one of Teran\u2019s suppliers. On July 10, 2010, Teran went to the home of Guerra\u2019s cousin to pick up 35 pounds of marijuana that he had purchased from Guerra. When Teran arrived to pick up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>drugs, he called Perez and asked him to come escort him while he was driving with the marijuana, explaining that he wanted Perez to protect him and his illicit cargo \u201cfrom any person who might try to rip us off or [from] some police officer who might stop us.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Perez came to the house and left with Teran, following his friend\u2019s car until Teran felt safe enough for Perez to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Ten days later, on July 20, 2010, Teran went back to Guerra\u2019s cousin\u2019s house and bought about 40 pounds of marijuana. He called Perez\u2019 and again asked his friend to escort him while he was transporting the marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Perez agreed to help, and he drove to the cousin\u2019s house and followed Teran while he was driving with the drugs in his car. For his assistance on those two occasions, Teran paid Perez about $1,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">D. Teran, Perez, and Others Plan to Steal Marijuana Plants from a Warehouse</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">On July 25, 2010, Guerra spoke over the phone ^with Teran about a \u201chuge\u201d warehouse where he knew marijuana was being grown. - Guerra and Teran discussed robbing the warehouse, but Guerra said that it would be a difficult job because the warehouse doors were \u201cvery strong\u201d and made of metal. He also mentioned that the people inside were armed. Teran proposed that they could overcome those problems with the help of Perez, whom Teran called his \u201cace.\u201d Teran suggested that they could have Perez, acting as a police' officer, knock on the warehouse door, which would cause the occupants to run away. The coconspirators would then be able to safely go into the warehouse and take the marijuana plants and other drugs that were inside. The next day, Teran discussed the planned \u201crip\u201d of the warehouse with Perez, who agreed to participate in the scheme.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">On July 27, Teran and Perez met at a prearranged location and drove together in Perez\u2019s car to the warehouse. Relying on an insider who worked at the warehouse, Teran learned which building contained the marijuana plants and where the plants could be found within the structure. Ter-an and Perez drove past the warehouse two times and a Miami-Dade detective who was monitoring the men observed Perez\u2019s car \u201cin front of [the] warehouse for an extended period of time.\u201d Perez and Teran then drove to a nearby tow truck yard where they met with other people involved in the scheme and spent 15 to 20 minutes discussing \u201chow the plan was going to go to get into the warehouse and steal the marijuana.\u201d At the end of that meeting, the coconspirators agreed to let Perez know when they were ready to execute the plan. Before leaving the area, Perez drove past the warehouse and recorded the license plate number of a truck that was parked in the warehouse yard. He ran the tag number to find out the owner\u2019s name and address, which he passed along to Teran. Teran then gave that information to another coconspirator, who said that he would use it to \u201crob [the owner] at his house\u201d if they could not \u201cget him at the warehouse.\u201d In a phone call that same evening, Guerra asked Teran whether Perez thought their plan could work, and Teran replied that Perez said \u201cit [could] be done.\u201d Teran told Guerra that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>he and his associates were waiting to execute the plan because the warehouse owner had not gone home yet. The men did not attempt to invade the warehouse that night because they felt that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have the final plan yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">On July 28, the FBI, DEA, and Miami-Dade Police Department raided the warehouse pursuant to a search warrant. Based on their surveillance and monitoring of Teran\u2019s calls, the authorities had determined that they did not want to allow the planned theft to proceed because the risk of a violent confrontation was too high. The raid uncovered an extensive marijuana grow operation. In total the authorities recovered 629 marijuana plants, 15.25 kilograms of marijuana that was packaged and ready to be sold, firearms, and a small amount of cocaine. Soon after the raid, one of the coconspirators told Teran that the police had taken the warehouse. Ter-an then called Perez, who confirmed that police had raided the warehouse. Perez assured Teran however that \u201che had nothing to do with\u201d the police operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">E. Perez\u2019s Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">On September 10, 2010, FBI agents arrested Perez. The agents seized Perez\u2019s cell phone, which had Teran\u2019s number stored inside. After receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Perez admitted that he knew Teran but said that his friend had \u201cnot done anything illegal in front of him.\u201d He also admitted that he had driven past the warehouse that the police had raided, but he said that he planned to give information about the warehouse to Luis Ledesma, a DEA informant whom he knew. He told the agents that Teran wanted to steal the marijuana from the warehouse and that he \u201cplayed along.\u201d He claimed that he played along because he considered Teran a valuable source of information, and he did not want to lose his trust. A search of Perez\u2019s police locker and car uncovered several firearms, $2,600 in cash and jewelry, a plastic bag containing marijuana, and a small scale used to weigh drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">F. Perez\u2019s Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">On September 27, 2011, a federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging Perez with one count of conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and one count of attempting to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of the same U.S.Code provisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At his trial, Perez testified in his own defense. He admitted' to the jury that he had a close relationship with Teran, but he asserted that he fostered the friendship to advance his long-term career goals. Perez stated that he wanted \u201cto work with a bigger agency,\u201d like the DEA, because he was interested in \u201cdo[ing] something bigger\u201d than the type of police work he did with the Hialeah Gardens Police Department. He testified that he decided to pursue that goal by working on his own as an \u201cundercover operative\u201d because the Hialeah Gardens Police Department did not handle large drug cases. Perez claimed that he wanted to use his friendship with Teran \u201cto [his] advantage to identify\u201d drug dealers, which would enable him to \u201cstart building ... a case that would get [him] notoriety from a different agency.\u201d Perez asserted that that he did not intend to engage in criminal activity. Instead, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>was merely \u201cplaying along\u201d with Teran to further his own law enforcement career.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The jury convicted Perez on both counts alleged in the indictment. It also entered special verdicts indicating that each count involved 100 or more marijuana plants and a detectable amount of marijuana. The district court sentenced Perez to a concurrent 151-month prison term on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Perez challenges his convictions on three grounds. First, he contends that the government improperly charged him in a duplicitous indictment. Second, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him on the conspiracy and attempt counts. Third, he contends that his convictions should be reversed because of cumulative error that occurred during his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">A. Duplicitous Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Perez asserts that his indictment was duplicitous because each count charged him with \u201ctwo or more separate and distinct offenses.\u201d He contends that the counts were duplicitous because the indictment alleged that he both conspired and attempted to possess \u201c100 or more marijuana plants <em>or </em>a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana.\u201d In Perez\u2019s view, each count charged him with one crime involving marijuana plants and another crime involving a marijuana substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Whether an indictment is duplicitous is a question of law that is ordinarily reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Caldwell, </em>302 F.3d 399, 407 (5th Cir.2002). However, unless he can show good cause, a defendant waives his right to challenge his indictment as duplicitous when he fails to raise the issue before trial. <em>United States v. Seher, </em>562 F.3d 1344, 1358-59 <em>&amp; </em>n. 15 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>77 F.3d 1348, 1352 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">In this case, Perez did not make his duplicity challenge before trial and instead raises it for the first time on appeal. He has therefore waived the issue unless he can show good cause for his failure to raise it before trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) (noting that \u201ca motion alleging a defect in the indictment\u201d must be raised before trial); <em>see also United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2011) (noting that a defendant waives a duplicity challenge not brought before trial unless he can show good cause); <em>Seher, </em>562 F.3d at 1359 (\u201cGenerally, a defendant must object before trial to defects in an indictment, and the failure to do so waives any alleged defects.\u201d). Perez has not explained why he did not raise the duplicity issue before his trial. In any event, we find that he cannot show good cause because he challenges only the indictment\u2019s language, which he had the opportunity to review well before his trial. <em>See Seher, </em>562 F.3d at 1359 n. 15 (\u201cGood cause is not shown where the defendant had all the information necessary to bring a Rule 12(b) motion before the date set for pretrial motions, but failed to file it by that date.\u201d); <em>see also Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1190 (same). Therefore, Perez has waived his challenge to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">Perez argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him on both the conspiracy and attempt charges alleged in the indictment. We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, viewing the evidence and taking all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Fries, </em>725 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2013). But when a defendant challenges the sufficien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>cy of the evidence on a ground that was not raised below, he \u201cmust shoulder a somewhat heavier burden\u201d on appeal because we will reverse his conviction only if doing so is necessary to prevent a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Esquenazi, </em>752 F.3d 912, 935 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cWhere the specific grounds upon which a defendant made his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge at trial differ from those he asserts on appeal, we review under his new theory only for manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d). Under that standard, we will not reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions unless \u201cthe record is devoid of evidence of an essential element of the crime\u201d or \u201cthe evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>Fries, </em>725 F.3d at 1291 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">1. Conspiracy Count</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Perez contends that the government presented insufficient evidence for the jury to find that he knowingly joined any conspiracy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Asserting that many of his codefendants had a motive to give false testimony and claiming that the government presented conflicting testimony at trial, Perez asserts that reasonable doubt exists as to whether he was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">We find Perez\u2019s argument unpersuasive. Testimony from Teran and the other co-conspirators, as well as wiretap recordings played for the jury, overwhelmingly established that Perez knowingly and voluntarily entered into an agreement with others to steal marijuana from various drug dealers during the time period alleged in the indictment. According to the testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses, Perez was an active participant in the conspiracy, helping Teran and others to both plan and carry out the drug thefts that took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Although Perez takes issue with the testimony of his coconspirators, we are bound to credit their testimony unless it was incredible as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>E.g., United States v. Isaacson, </em>752 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cTo the extent that Appellants\u2019 argument depends upon challenges to the credibility of witnesses, the jury has exclusive province over that determination and the court of appeals may not revisit this question.\u201d). Doing so is part of our duty to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Fries, </em>725 F.3d at 1291. In this case, the testimony of Perez\u2019s coconspirators provided the jury with more than enough evidence to find that Perez knowingly participated in the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">In addition, we have said again and again that \u201ca statement by a defendant, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as <em>substantive evidence </em>of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995). As a result, \u201cwhere some corroborative evidence of guilt exists for the charged offense ... and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the defendant takes the stand in his own defense,\u201d his testimony denying guilt may, by itself, establish elements of the charged offense. <em>Id. </em>at 314-15. That principle \u201capplies with special force where the elements to be proved for a conviction include highly subjective elements: for example, the defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In this case, Perez testified in his own defense and the jury did not believe his testimony. Therefore, we may view his testimony as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>See id. </em>at 314. Because there was other corroborative evidence of Perez\u2019s guilt, the jury\u2019s rejection of Perez\u2019s testimony is sufficient to establish that he was a knowing participant in the charged conspiracy, <em>see id. </em>at 314-15, even without the testimony of his coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">2. Attempt Count</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">To convict Perez on the attempt count, the government had to prove that Perez \u201chad the specific intent to engage in criminal conduct and that he took a substantial step toward commission of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1369 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cA substantial step must be more than remote preparation, and must be conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the defendant\u2019s criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1238 n. 8 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). For the first time on appeal, Perez contends that there was insufficient evidence on the attempt charge because the government failed to show that he took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward possessing marijuana plants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He asserts that the evidence showed, at most, that he was merely \u201cplanning and fantasizing about raiding a marijuana grow house\u201d at \u201csome future undetermined time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Perez\u2019s argument is reviewable under the \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d standard because he did not raise it in his Rule 29 motion, but we would find it unconvincing even under <em>de novo </em>review. The evidence at trial showed that Perez participated in discussions on at least two occasions about how he and his coconspira-tors were going to steal the marijuana plants from the warehouse. He also went to the warehouse with Teran, driving past the structure twice to scope it out after Teran received inside information about where the plants could be found in the building. Finally, he recorded the license plate number of a truck that was parked in the warehouse yard and ran the number to find out the owner\u2019s name and address, which he then passed along to Teran so the other conspirators would have more information about the warehouse owner. Taken together, those acts went well beyond \u201cremote preparation\u201d and were \u201cstrongly corroborative of the firmness of [Perez\u2019s] criminal intent.\u201d <em>See Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d at 1238 n. 8; <em>see also United States v. Carothers, </em>121 F.3d 659, 661-62 (11th Cir.1997) (finding sufficient evidence of a substantial step toward possessing cocaine with intent to distribute where (1) the defendant had previously purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>drugs from the seller, (2) the defendant discussed a possible cocaine deal with the seller, (3) the defendant drove to the city where the drug deal was to take place, and (4) the defendant possessed a gun as well as a microscope that could be used to test the cocaine being sold); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>604 F.2d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir. 1979) (finding sufficient evidence that the defendant took a substantial step toward blowing up a building where he \u201cmade a firm agreement\u201d to acquire the explosives he needed to do the deed and dispatched two other men \u201cto reconnoiter and inspect the building in preparation for its destruction\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">C. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"Azvx\">Perez argues that cumulative errors committed during his trial justify reversal of his convictions. He specifically identifies four purported errors in support of his argument. First, he asserts that the district court erroneously directed a verdict on an element when it gave the jury the following instruction: \u201cAs a matter of fact and law, the defendant was not authorized by law enforcement to perform the acts with which he is charged. To work with law enforcement and engage in undercover actions requires special approval which the Defendant did not have.\u201d Second, he contends that the district court should have clarified which statements it was referring to when it instructed the jury that \u201ccertain prior statements of certain witnesses were admitted during the cross-examination of those witnesses for a limited purpose\u201d and could \u201cbe considered [only] for impeachment purposes.\u201d Third, he claims that the government improperly vouched for its witnesses and unfairly disparaged his own testimony when it said the following at closing: \u201cI submit to you there is only one witness who had an interest in the outcome of the case, one of the factors that the Court will tell you, is appropriate for you to consider. One witness who had an interest in the outcome of the case and that is the defendant, Lawrence Perez.\u201d Fourth, he contends that the government improperly disparaged defense counsel when it said at closing that Perez\u2019s lawyer \u201cwould like [the jury] to worry about [whether Teran paid Perez for his services] all day long because he doesn\u2019t want you to pay attention to the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\u201cThe cumulative error doctrine provides that an aggregation of nonreversible errors (i.e., plain errors failing to necessitate reversal and harmless errors) can yield a denial of the constitutional right to a fair trial, which calls for reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1223 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>the cumulative impact of errors at a trial, <em>United States v. Dohan, </em>508 F.3d 989, 993 (11th Cir.2007), but we will not reverse a conviction unless the defendant can show that an aggregation of nonreversible errors affected his substantial rights, <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1299 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">For purposes of our analysis, we must first consider each error individually because a defendant cannot have a valid cumulative error claim if there was no error committed in the first place. <em>Morris v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>677 F.3d 1117, 1132 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cThis Court has made clear that where there is no error in any of the trial court\u2019s rulings, the argument that cumulative trial error requires that this Court reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions is without merit.\u201d) (brackets and quotation marks omitted). Once we have considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>each individual alleged error, we \u201cexam-in[e] any errors that we find in the aggregate and in light of the trial as a whole to determine whether the appellant was afforded a fundamentally fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We exclude from our analysis any alleged errors that were invited by the defendant. <em>United States v. Banks, </em>761 F.3d 1163, 1178 (10th Cir.2014) (holding that \u201ccumulative error cannot be predicated on non-errors, or on invited error\u201d) (brackets, citation, and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1214-16, 1228-29 (observing that the defendant invited an error that was committed at trial and then ignoring that error when analyzing the defendant\u2019s cumulative error claim); <em>United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1282-83 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cIn reviewing for cumulative error, the court must review all errors preserved for appeal and all plain errors.\u201d). To determine whether a defendant was prejudiced by the cumulative effect of nonreversible errors, we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2hj\">the nature and number of the errors committed; their interrelationship, if any, 'and combined effect; how the district court dealt with the errors as they arose (including the efficacy \u2014 or lack of efficacy \u2014 of any remedial efforts); [ ] the strength of the government\u2019s case, and the length of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1223 (alteration in original and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In this case, we will not consider in our cumulative error analysis the first alleged error that Perez asserts (relating to the court\u2019s jury instruction that Perez was not authorized by law enforcement to engage in the charged acts) because Perez invited that purported error. <em>See Banks, </em>761 F.3d at 1201. As Perez concedes in his opening brief, the jury instruction at issue was included in the proposed instructions that he submitted to the district court. In addition, after the district court asked Perez whether he had any objections to the jury instructions, Perez responded that he had no objections. Because he proposed the jury instruction that he now complains about and later told the district court that he did not object to the instruction, Perez invited the alleged error. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>443 F.3d 822, 823-24 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error. Where a party invites error, the Court is precluded from reviewing that error on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">We review the second alleged error with the district court\u2019s jury instructions only for plain error because Perez failed to object to the instruction. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>627 F.3d 1372, 1380 (11th Cir.2010). Under the plain error standard, Perez bears the burden of establishing that \u201c(1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Perez contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on which prior witness statements could be considered only for impeachment purposes. Perez has not shown plain error, however, because he has not established that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s failure to give a more specific jury instruction. The government presented overwhelming evidence against Perez, including many wiretap recordings in which Perez discussed his participation in the alleged crimes. It also presented testimony from numerous witnesses, most of which was admitted as substantive evidence against Perez. In light of the substantial evidence presented by the government, Perez has not shown that the district court\u2019s instruction affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ed his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1382 (noting that satisfying the third prong of the plain error standard \u201calmost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d and that a defendant \u201cmust establish a reasonable probability of a different result but for the error\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). So we do not consider it in our cumulative error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The third purported error that Perez asserts was not an error because the government\u2019s statement at closing that Perez was the \u201conly ... witness who had an interest in the outcome of the case\u201d was not inappropriate. The comment focused on Perez, did not allude to information that had not been presented to the jury, and did not improperly vouch for the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses. <em>See United States v. Epps, </em>613 F.3d 1093, 1100 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cImproper vouching occurs in two different circumstances: (1) if the prosecutor places the prestige of the government behind the witness, by making explicit personal assurances of the witness\u2019 veracity, or (2) if the prosecutor implicitly vouches for the witness\u2019 veracity by indicating that information not presented to the jury supports the testimony.\u201d) (brackets and quotation marks omitted). Nor did the comment unfairly disparage Perez\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Eley, </em>723 F.2d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cDefense counsel in this case attacked the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses and, in response, the prosecutor was entitled to argue fairly to the jury the credibility of the government and defense witnesses.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Poole, </em>735 F.3d 269, 277 (5th Cir.2013) (noting that \u201cwhere the defendant elects to testify and, in so doing, puts his veracity at issue,\u201d the government \u201cdoes not commit error by characterizing the defendant as a liar\u201d); <em>United States v. Iacona, </em>728 F.3d 694, 699-700 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cThe central question in determining whether [prosecutorial comments were improper] is whether the comments reflected reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial rather than an expression of the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion, and whether the comments became so excessive as to impair the jury\u2019s detached search for the truth. If the evidence supports the comments, a prosecutor is at liberty to speak harshly about the defendant.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Finally, we reject Perez\u2019s contention that the government improperly disparaged his attorney in closing arguments. During defense counsel\u2019s closing, he argued that reasonable doubt existed as to whether Perez was guilty because Perez claimed to have a modest lifestyle and the government allegedly did not present much evidence that he was paid for the work he did with Teran. In rebuttal, the government asked the jury to \u201clook closely at [the] jury instructions\u201d because there was \u201cabsolutely no requirement that [Perez receive] any financial benefit\u201d to be guilty of the charged crimes. The government then stated that defense counsel wanted the jury \u201cto worry about money all day long because he [did not] want [the jury] to pay attention to the evidence.\u201d Contrary to Perez\u2019s contention, the government\u2019s comment did not improperly disparage defense counsel and it was permissible given the argument that Perez\u2019s lawyer had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Perez has failed to identify a single preserved error or plain error that occurred at his trial. Therefore, his cumulative error argument fails because \u201c[w]here there is no error or only a single error, there can be no cumulative error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gamory, </em>635 F.3d 480, 497 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also Morris, </em>677 F.3d at 1132; <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">III.

Perez does not argue that his coconspira-tors' testimony was incredible as a matter of law.
