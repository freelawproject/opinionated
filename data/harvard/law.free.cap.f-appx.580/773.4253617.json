We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b799-27\">When he was between the ages of 17 and 25, Shealey was convicted of theft by receiving stolen property, fleeing and eluding, interfering with government property, reckless driving, obstruction, cocaine and marijuana possession, giving false information to a law enforcement officer, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>convicted felon, possession of a firearm while committing a felony, and criminal property damage. In 2008, when he was 26, Shealey pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The district judge sentenced Shealey to 65 months of imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release. Shealey\u2019s supervised-release conditions prohibited him from (1) committing another federal, state, or local crime; and (2) using or possessing controlled substances, except as prescribed by a physician. The conditions of supervision also required Shealey to: (1) submit monthly written reports to his probation officer (\u201cPO\u201d); (2) work regularly at a lawful occupation unless excused by his PO; (3) notify his PO within 72 hours of any change in residence; and (4) submit to periodic drug tests as directed by his PO. Following his incarceration, Shealey began his period of supervision on June 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">On October 1, 2013, Shealey\u2019s PO petitioned to revoke his supervised release. During his revocation hearing, Shealey admitted he had violated the conditions of his release by submitting a late monthly report, using marijuana, failing to report for drug tests, and moving without prior permission from his PO. Shealey also admitted he had been unemployed for some time, although he had found a job approximately two weeks before his arrest in the instant proceeding. In addition, the parties stipulated Shealey had driven a car without a valid license.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Shealey\u2019s counsel explained that he never had received treatment for his marijuana addiction, partly because of an improper state detainer for a case that ultimately had been dismissed. Counsel also noted Shealey\u2019s current employer would allow him to return to work, if he were released. He asked the judge to impose six months in a halfway house with drug treatment and testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The government asked for a 12-month prison sentence. The government stated that two of Shealey\u2019s prior probationary sentences \u2014 one of which was for a drug offense, and another of which was for aggravated assault \u2014 had been revoked. Another prior conviction involved a car chase of up to 100 miles per hour. The government asserted Shealey\u2019s PO had \u201cbent over backwards\u201d to try to work with Shea-ley, but his history indicated he was \u201cunwilling to be supervised.\u201d ROA at 164-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Shealey responded that drug treatment in a halfway house would address all of the government\u2019s concerns. He argued there were substantial differences between his prior convictions, which occurred when he was a teenager and in his early twenties, and his current conduct, which did not involve dealing drugs or possessing guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The district judge sentenced Shealey to 12 months of imprisonment, to be followed by 24 months of supervised release. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">[W]e have ... operating without a driver\u2019s license, failure to submit monthly report[s] as directed, failure to report lawful occupation, some of these, you know, borderline things, but failure to ... notify the probation officer of any change in residence, ... failure to refrain from unlawful use of controlled substance[s], and failure to report for drug testing, some of these are more administrative violations, but some are not. But overall they are consistent with his past conduct, that is[,] he can\u2019t obey the law and he has no respect for the law. Probation is the law he has to deal with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">ROA at 168. Shealey objected to the sentence as \u201cunreasonable under the circumstances of this case.\u201d ROA at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>On appeal, Shealey argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. He contends the district judge erred in relying exclusively on an improper factor, the need, to promote respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We generally review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Arguments not raised in the district court, however, are reviewed on appeal only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>627 F.3d 1372, 1380 (11th Cir.2010). Establishing plain error requires showing (1) an error (2) that was plain, (3) affected one\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>An error is plain if it is obvious and clear under current law. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Upon determining a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, the district judge may revoke the term of supervision and impose a term of imprisonment after considering: (1) the applicable Guidelines range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (4) the applicable Sentencing Commission policy statements; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (6) the need to provide restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). A district judge, however, must revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervision and impose a prison term if the defendant possesses a controlled substance or refuses to comply with drug testing imposed as a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), (3); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2000), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2389, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). The subsection governing mandatory release revocation, \u00a7 3583(g), neither instructs the judge to consider, nor prohibits the judge from considering, any of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242. A district judge need not state specifically he is compelled to revoke supervised release under \u00a7 3583(g) if the conditions implicating the provision are present. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The district judge did not err, plainly or otherwise, when he considered Shealey\u2019s lack of respect for the law in imposing sentence. Because Shealey possessed a controlled substance and failed to comply with drug testing imposed as a condition of his supervision, the judge was required to .revoke his supervised release and impose a prison term under \u00a7 3583(g). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), (3); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241-42. Unlike subsection (e) of \u00a7 3583, subsection (g) does not require consideration of any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors; nor does \u00a7 3583(g) limit the factors a judge may consider in imposing a release-revocation sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), (g); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242. The district judge committed no error when he considered Shealey\u2019s lack of respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Nor did the judge focus exclusively on this factor to the detriment of other considerations. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a sentence of five hours of imprisonment was unreasonable when the district judge focused \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d on the goal of restitution to the detriment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>all other sentencing factors). The judge explicitly discussed Shealey\u2019s criminal history and the circumstances of his instant violations, and the record contains no indication the judge did not also consider the parties\u2019 arguments. Accordingly, we affirm Shealey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
