He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that, on June 27, 2014, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Darby\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion except as to Darby\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately advise him regarding a formal plea offer. The court ordered this claim be held in abeyance pending an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, because the district court has recently acted on Darby\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
