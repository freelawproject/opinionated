Scott opened a credit card account with Bank of America/FIA Card Services, N.A. (\u201cBank of America\u201d) in 2005. It \u201csecuritized\u201d the receivables from Scott\u2019s and other credit card accounts, and sold them to a trust under a so-called Pooling and Servicing Agreement. This move \u2014 a typical one by credit card issuers \u2014 \u201cprovides steady liquidity for card issuers\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u00eds] most downside credit risk on the card[.]\u201d Adam J. Levi-tin, <em>Skinr-inr-the-Game: Risk Retention Lessons from, Credit Card Securitization, </em>81 Geo.Wash. L.Rev. 813 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-25\">Scott\u2019s account became delinquent on June 30, 2009. After the default, Bank of America \u201ccharged-off\u2019 her account <em>(i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>wrote the debt off as \u201cuncollectable\u201d). It then sold Scott\u2019s debt to Cavalry SPV I, LLC (\u201cCavalry\u201d), and Cavalry in turn filed a collection action against Scott seeking $3,986.54 (the amount Scott owed) plus interest. Scott\u2019s counsel notified Cavalry of its belief that Bank of America did not have an interest in Scott\u2019s account to transfer, and Cavalry promptly withdrew its suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Motivated by her apparent victory, Scott filed a class-action complaint against, among others, Bank of America and Cavalry alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>and the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act, 73 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 2270.1 <em>et seq. </em>In an amendment to that complaint, she further alleged violations of the federal RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>and Pennsylvania\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, 73 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 201.1 <em>et seq. </em>Underlying all of Scott\u2019s allegations was her belief that Bank of America had nothing to transfer to Cavalry once it securitized the receivables from Scott\u2019s account. Thus, Cavalry\u2019s attempt to collect the amount Scott owed was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Bank of America and Cavalry moved to dismiss Scott\u2019s Amended Complaint, arguing that the critical premise on which Scott\u2019s claims rely \u2014 that once a credit card company securitizes the receivables of a credit card account, it no longer retains an ownership interest in the account \u2014 is incorrect. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice. Scott appeals that dismissal. We affirm in all respects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Scott renews the argument she advanced before the District Court: because Bank of America lost any interest in Scott\u2019s credit card account once it securi-tized and sold the receivables, it had nothing to transfer to Cavalry. Thus, Cavalry\u2019s attempt to collect on the amount she owed was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Scott misapprehends the effect of securi-tizing a credit card receivable. \u201cCredit card securitization involves the securitization solely of the receivables, not of the accounts themselves.\u201d Levitin, <em>supra </em>at 826; <em>see also </em>J.A. 154-55 (Pooling &amp; Servicing Agr. \u00a7 2.01) (providing that Bank of America was selling only the receivables associated with the credit card accounts, not ownership of the accounts). Thus, even after securitization the card issuer retains an ownership interest in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">The courts that have considered the effect of securitizing credit card receivables are all in agreement that it does not divest the issuer of its ownership interest in the credit card accounts. <em>See, e.g., Tostado v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., </em>No. 09-CV-549, 2010 WL 55976, at *3 (W.D.Tex. Jan. 4, 2010) (assignment of receivables does not prevent a credit card issuer from recovering past-due credit card charges because, as the \u201creal party in interest,\u201d the issuer retains \u201cthe right to enforce its interest on [its] accounts and loans\u201d); <em>Shade v. Bank of America, </em>No. 2:08-cv-1069, 2009 WL 5198176, at *4 (E.D.Cal. Dec.23, 2009) (\u201cplaintiff has provided no binding legal authority for his theory that because Bank of America securitized the account balances, it was no longer the real party in interest and could not assign the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>debt for collection to the other defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In addition, once Scott\u2019s account fell into default, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that ownership of these \u201cIneligible Receivables\u201d automatically reverts to Bank of America. <em>See </em>J.A. 160-61 (Pooling &amp; Servicing Agr. \u00a7 2.04(d)(ii)-(iii)). At that point \u2014 and regardless whether as a general matter ownership of a credit card account can be divorced from ownership of the account\u2019s receivables\u2014 the Pooling and Servicing Agreement placed ownership of the receivables squarely back in Bank of America\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-15\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
