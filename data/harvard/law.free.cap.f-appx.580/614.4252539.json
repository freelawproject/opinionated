Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Luevano failed to establish that it is more likely than not she will be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a government official if she returns to Mexico. <em>See id. </em>at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Lueva-no\u2019s contentions regarding changed circumstances, asylum, and her conviction, because she did not raise them to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (court lacks jurisdiction to consider issues that have not been administratively exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
