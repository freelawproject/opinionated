For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">A. Amendment 744 to the Alabama Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">In the State of Alabama, it is a crime to possess, \u201cwith knowledge of the character thereof,\u201d a \u201cslot machine\u201d or \u201cother gam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>bling device, with the intention that it be used in the advancement of unlawful gambling activity.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-27. The Alabama Constitution, however, provides for the adoption of \u201camendments which affect[ ] or appl[y] to only one county\u201d if approved by, <em>inter </em>alia, a majority vote of the qualified electors in that county. <em>See </em>Ala. Const, amend. 555(a). The voters of Macon County approved local Amendment 744 in 2003. Amendment 744 legalized \u201c[t]he operation of bingo games for prizes or money by nonprofit organizations for charitable, educational, or other lawful purposes\u201d in Macon County. <em>See </em>Ala. Const, amend. 744. It also provides that \u201c[t]he sheriff shall promulgate rules and regulations for the licensing and operation of bingo games within the county\u201d and \u201cshall insure compliance pursuant to any rule or regulation\u201d and certain other specified requirements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">B. Factual Allegations in Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">According to the Complaint, Plaintiff Ford was the state legislator who sponsored the bill proposing Amendment 744 in 2003. He is also currently the mayor of the City of Tuskegee in Macon County. According to the Complaint, Ford and four of the five other individual plaintiffs \u2014 Maxwell, Samuel, Robinson, and Howard \u2014 all voted for Amendment 744 when it was put to a popular referendum in Macon County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of these individuals is also the officer of an organization that received a license to operate bingo games pursuant to Amendment 744.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the caption of the Complaint names each of these individuals only in his or her \u201cindividual and representative capacity],\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the body of the Complaint indicates that they also brought suit in their official capacities as representatives of these organizations. Each of the licensed organizations contracted with a third party, VictoryLand, to operate games in Macon County on the license-holder\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff Patterson is a former VictoryLand employee. VictoryLand is not a party to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Defendant Bentley is the Governor of the State of Alabama. He is a white member of the Republican Party. Defendant Strange is the elected Attorney General of the State of Alabama. Both defendants were sworn into office in January 2011. Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants subsequently used them powers as state officers to have VictoryLand shut down as part of a scheme to disempower black and Democratic voters in Macon County. Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants caused certain equipment at VictoryLand to be seized, removed, or destroyed, including electronic gaming machines that the Macon County sheriff had had certified as \u201clegal bingo games,\u201d in compliance with Amendment 744 and regulations issued thereunder. It is clear that Defendants acted under at least the pretext of a valid law-enforcement action. <em>See Ex parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>State, </em>121 So.3d 337, 340, 355 (Ala.2013) (per curiam) (ordering the lower court to issue a warrant authorizing the search of VictoryLand \u201cas to certain allegedly illegal gambling devices\u201d and stating that the Macon County sheriffs opinion is not binding \u201con all other law-enforcement officers\u201d). Plaintiffs insinuated in the Complaint, however, that Defendants actually shut down VictoryLand because its existence tended to benefit the Democratic Party. Plaintiffs also insinuated that Defendants showed favoritism toward Indian gaming interests (to VictoryLand\u2019s detriment) in exchange for financial and political support. Plaintiffs further alleged that Victo-ryLand\u2019s demise caused its employees\u2014 presumably including Plaintiff Patterson\u2014 to lose their jobs and that it will cause local citizens to lose public services that had previously been funded from Victory-Land\u2019s revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">C. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Claims in the Original Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Plaintiffs brought suit in their individual and official capacities and also sought to be certified as representatives of the class of \u201call residents and qualified voters of Macon County who are injured by the statutory and constitutional violations alleged in this complaint.\u201d In their Complaint, Plaintiffs brought four counts. In Count One, Plaintiffs claimed a violation of their rights under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, on the ground that Defendants had implemented \u201cunprecleared policies and practices affecting voting.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court dismissed this claim <em>sua sponte </em>following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shelby County v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2612, 186 L.Ed.2d 651 (2013), and Plaintiffs have since abandoned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">In Count Two, Plaintiffs claimed a violation of their right to vote under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 theory was apparently that Defendants had infringed their voting rights, and the voting rights of African-Americans in the putative class, by taking actions that undermined Amendment 744 years after those voters had supported it.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">In Count Three, Plaintiffs claimed \u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that Defendants had acted with the racially-discriminatory purpose and effect of denying them, and African-American voters in Macon County more broadly, \u201cthe ability to choose by constitutional amendment the laws and means of their enforcement in their own counties\u201d and \u201cthe ability to exercise home rule in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>respective counties.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants had \u201cabridged and negated the 2008 vote enacting Amendment 744 and [had] devastated and continue to devastate Tuskegee, Macon County, and its citizens.\u201d Plaintiffs explained that, \u201c[b]y the closing of Victory[L]and, a historically poverty stricken area of black citizens will remain so and public services that Victory[L]and\u2019s operating revenue would have funded will be curtailed or eliminated altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In Count Four, Plaintiffs claimed \u201cfundamental unfairness\u201d in violation of their \u201cdue process rights.\u201d Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants had unlawfully caused the invalidation of their rights in their licenses to operate bingo games in Macon County pursuant to Amendment 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint for both lack of standing and also failure to state a claim. After full briefing, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions on both grounds. Plaintiffs appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">D. Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed First Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In the court below, Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. We summarize a subset of the most substantial proposed amendments. First, Plaintiffs proposed to add as plaintiffs the sheriff of Macon County, the Macon County Racing Commission, and the Macon County Water Authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, Plaintiff Patterson proposed to prosecute the lawsuit both on his own behalf and also as a representative of all others who had lost their jobs as a result of VictoryLand\u2019s demise. Third, Plaintiffs specifically alleged that Defendant Strange had \u201cnot operated in an even-handed manner\u201d because, in another lawsuit, he had asserted that the Aabama Poarch Band of Creek Indian Casino Operators (\u201cPoarch Creeks\u201d) were operating gaming machines in violation of state law, but he had not raided, seized equipment from, or otherwise adversely affected the Poarch Creeks\u2019 operations. Fourth, Plaintiffs alleged in greater detail the economic injury that the closing of VictoryLand had caused Macon County, its citizens, and the organizational plaintiffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fifth, Plaintiffs proposed to add three additional counts, which we describe below.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">In the first proposed additional count, Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants conspired to deny them their \u201cconstitutional right to vote without due process of law and as a denial of the equal protection [sic] as guaranteed by the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution in violation of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983]\u201d by \u201cintentionally nullify[ing]\u201d their votes in favor of Amendment 744, its sponsor (then-Representative Ford), and the elected sheriff of Macon County. In the second proposed additional count, Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>claimed that Defendants participated in a racially- or class-motivated conspiracy to deny them their \u201cproperty right to contract, or to own, operate, and maintain a bingo business in Macon County, Alabama[,] without due process of law as guaranteed by the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution in violation of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985]\u201d by usurping the authority vested in the sheriff of Macon County and shutting down Victory-Land, while permitting the Poareh Creeks and another facility in Greene County to use the same or similar machines. In the third proposed additional count, Plaintiffs claimed that Defendants had negligently allowed their rights to be infringed in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">After full briefing, the district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the complaint on the ground that the proposed amendments were futile. Plaintiffs appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">E. Defendant Strange\u2019s Motion for Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Two days after receiving the initial Complaint, Defendant Strange notified Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Donald LaRoche, of his intent to seek sanctions under Rule 11 unless the Complaint was voluntarily dismissed. Plaintiffs did not voluntarily dismiss the Complaint, and Defendant Strange filed a written Motion for Sanctions. Plaintiffs opposed the motion in writing without requesting a hearing or any additional process. The district court granted the motion on the ground that attorney LaRoche should have known that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cobjectively frivolous.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir. 1996); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(2). Plaintiffs appeal that decision. We address each of the three appealed decisions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">II. THE DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">The district court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to bring the claims asserted and, in any event, had failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted. We address the standing question first because it implicates our Court\u2019s and the lower court\u2019s authority to resolve Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the merits. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012-13, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). To the extent necessary, we then address whether Plaintiffs successfully stated any claims upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">A. Whether Plaintiffs Established Article III Standing to Assert Their Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">\u201c[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. at 2136 (alterations, footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 112 S.Ct. at 2136. \u201cThe standing inquiry is both plaintiff-specific and claim-specific. Thus, a reviewing court must determine whether each particular plaintiff is entitled to have a federal court adjudicate each particular claim that he asserts.\u201d <em>Pagan v. Calderon, </em>448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3325, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984), <em>arguably abrogated on other grounds, Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,- &amp; n. 3, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 1386-88 &amp; n. 3, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014) (explaining that the \u201czone of interests\u201d test is not an aspect of \u201cprudential standing\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The district court held that Plaintiffs failed to allege any \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that was sufficient to support Article III standing. Plaintiffs asserted two broad categories of injury in the Complaint: the \u201cnullification\u201d of their votes in favor of Amendment 744, and economic injury caused by VictoryLand\u2019s demise. We address each category of injury in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">1. Purported Injury to the Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 Voting Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">In general, \u201c[wjhere a plaintiffs voting rights are curtailed, the injury is sufficiently concrete to count as an \u2018injury in ,fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Judge v. Quinn, </em>612 F.3d 537, 545 (7th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>13A Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3531.4, at 185 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cElectoral interests are among the abstract interests that support standing in a wide variety of settings.\u201d). As the district court observed, however, Plaintiffs complain of actions that took place years after they supported and voted for Amendment 744. The question is whether they have nevertheless alleged \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to cognizable voting rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The jurisdictional question of whether Plaintiffs have alleged \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to cognizable voting rights is perhaps intertwined with the merits question of what \u201cvoting rights\u201d are protected by the statutory and constitutional provisions invoked. When jurisdictional and merits question are intertwined, federal courts at least sometimes find that jurisdiction exists and then proceed to analyze the merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cWhere the defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction is also a challenge to the existence of a federal cause of action, the. proper course of action ... is to find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits....\u201d);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Massachusetts v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>E.P.A., </em>415 F.3d 50, 55-56 (D.C.Cir.2005) (opinion of Randolph, J.) (assuming Article III standing <em>arguendo </em>where the standing inquiry overlapped with the merits inquiry), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>549 U.S. 497, 516-26, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 1452-58, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007) (finding Article III standing explicitly before proceeding to the merits). <em>But see Cone Corp. v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>921 F.2d 1190, 1204 n. 45 (11th Cir.1991) (ordering dismissal for lack of standing after an \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201climited inquiry into the merits of the plaintiffs claim to determine whether the injury the plaintiff asserts might stem from a violation of [a] constitutional guarantee\u201d). Even in those circumstances, however, dismissal on jurisdictional grounds may be proper if the plaintiffs claims are \u201c \u2018wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 415 (quoting <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946)); <em>cf. Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. at 89, 118 S.Ct. at 1010 (\u201cDismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is \u2018so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of [the Supreme] Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 777, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974))); <em>Donahue v. City of Boston, </em>304 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2002) (\u201cWhere the absence of causation and a relevant injury-in-fact are presented with such clarity, dismissal for lack of subject-matter is justified.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Under either analysis, we affirm the dismissal of Counts Two and Three on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs have not alleged injury to any cognizable \u201cvoting rights\u201d for the simple reason that their \u201casserted basis for standing has nothing to do with voting.\u201d <em>Abortion Rights Mobilization Inc. v. Baker (In re U.S. Catholic Conference), </em>885 F.2d 1020, 1028 (2d Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that Defendants undermined Amendment 744 several years after Plaintiffs had supported it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To the extent that Plaintiffs assert a \u201cvoting right\u201d to the post-enactment enforcement of the laws that they vote for, their claims are \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act protects a right to equal-opportunity participation in the electoral process. <em>See Thornburg v. Gingles, </em>478 U.S. 30, 47, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 2764, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986) (\u201cThe essence of a \u00a7 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.\u201d). We find no authority for the proposition that it purports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to protect a voter\u2019s interest in the post-enactment enforcement of the laws that he supports.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973\u00cd (c)(1) (defining the words \u201cvote\u201d and \u201cvoting\u201d). We consequently affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count Two on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">For similar reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count Three on jurisdictional grounds. In Count Three, Plaintiffs again claimed injury to what can fairly be described as their purported \u201cvoting rights.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the district court observed, however, the connection between Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct and Plaintiffs\u2019 votes \u2014 which were cast years earlier \u2014 is simply too tenuous to establish \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to any voting rights protected by either section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, or Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. There is no dispute that Amendment 744 is the law of Alabama, and Plaintiffs do not allege that their rights to vote for or otherwise support the amendment were violated in 2003. That Plaintiffs supported the amendment does not <em>ipso facto </em>give them a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in its enforcement years later. <em>See Holl-ingsworth v. Perry, </em>- U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 2663, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">2. Alleged Economic Injury to Plaintiff Patterson and the Organizational Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">We conclude, however, that individual plaintiff Patterson and all of the organizational plaintiffs did have standing to bring a claim of \u201cfundamental unfairness\u201d under Count Four.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Individual plaintiff Patterson alleged that he was a Victory-Land employee, and it is reasonable to infer that he would have lost his job as a result of VictoryLand\u2019s demise. The organizational plaintiffs, moreover, claimed that Defendants effectively caused their rights under the licenses to be unlawfully invalidated, and it is reasonable to infer that this would have caused them to suffer a loss of associated gaming revenues. These economic injuries constitute sufficient \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to support standing, and according to the allegations in the Complaint, they were caused by Defendants\u2019 actions and could be redressed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>favorable decision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We consequently proceed to the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Count Four.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">B. Whether Count Four States a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In Count Four, Plaintiffs attempted to state a claim for violation of their constitutional due process rights. To the extent that Plaintiffs invoked the substantive component of the Due Process Clause, they failed to state a claim because their purported rights in the bingo licenses are created and defined by state law. \u201c[N]on-legislative deprivations of state-created rights ... cannot support a substantive due process claim, not even if the plaintiff alleges that the government acted arbitrary [sic] and irrationally.\u201d <em>Greenbriar Vill, L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook, City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). \u201cThe only exception to this rule is when the state-created right is deprived in a manner that implicates a fundamental right, for example, when a state employee is fired in violation of the First Amendment for expressing his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262 n. 3. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim in Count Four did not implicate a fundamental right. Plaintiffs expressly complained that their \u201crights in their [bingo] licenses\u201d had been \u201cimproperly invalidated.\u201d They did not plausibly claim a violation of their voting rights or of any other fundamental right in Count Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">To the extent that Plaintiffs invoked the procedural component of the Due Process Clause, they were required to allege: \u201c(1) deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest; (2) governmental action; (3) and constitutionally inadequate process.\u201d <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>716 F.3d 535, 559 (11th Cir.2013). We question whether Plaintiffs successfully alleged the first element, <em>i.e., </em>the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest. We have said that \u201cno procedural due process claim exists until a sufficiently certain property right under state law is first shown.\u201d <em>Greenbriar Vill., </em>345 F.3d at 1265. In this case, there is at least a \u201creasonable debate\u201d regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 rights in the bingo licenses under Alabama law. <em>Id. </em>at 1266. Indeed, in February 2013, the Supreme Court of Alabama ordered a lower court to issue a warrant authorizing the search of VictoryLand \u201cas to certain allegedly illegal gambling devices.\u201d In an opinion explaining the order, the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Ex parte State, </em>121 So.3d 337, 358 (Ala. 2013) (per cui\u2019iam).

THE DENIAL OF LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint on the ground that the amendments would be futile. \u201cOrdinarily, a party must be given at least one opportunity to amend before the district court dismisses the complaint. The district court, however, need not \u2018allow an amendment ... where amendment would be futile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Bryant v.

The proposed addition of certain plaintiffs and more specific allegations of economic injury would do nothing to cure the defects in the original claim under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Plaintiffs proposed to convert former Count Three, titled \u201cPurposeful Discrimination,\u201d into a claim based on economic injury rather than solely \u201cvoting rights\u201d injury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This claim would nevertheless be subject to dismissal for failure to state a plausible claim of intentional discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion, for reasons discussed below. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Former Count Four, which Plaintiffs proposed to carry over from the original Complaint, would be subject to dismissal for reasons already discussed. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B. The proposed addition of certain plaintiffs and more specific allegations of economic injury would do nothing to cure the defects in the original due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The first proposed additional count is based on injury to purported \u201cvoting rights\u201d and would, consequently, be subject to dismissal on the same jurisdictional grounds as the other \u201cvoting rights\u201d claims. <em>See supra </em>Part II.A.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In order to state a discrimination claim under both former Count Three (\u201cPurposeful Discrimination\u201d) and also Plaintiffs\u2019 second proposed additional count, Plaintiffs were required to allege facts supporting a reasonable inference of intentional discrimination.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass\u2019n v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3150, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982) (\u201c[Section] 1981, like the Equal Protection Clause, can be violated only by purposeful discrimination.\u201d); <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971) (holding that one element of a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is \u201cracial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action\u201d). Plaintiffs failed to do so. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed First Amended Complaint contains no allegations with respect to race other than allegations regarding: the relative racial makeup of the State versus the County and the City; the race of certain Plaintiffs, proposed additional plaintiffs, and Defendants; and historical discrimination against African-Americans in the State of Alabama. These allegations do not support \u201ca reasonable expectation that discovery [would] reveal evidence\u201d that these Defendants acted with racially-discriminatory animus.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Plaintiffs also failed to allege facts sufficient to support a reasonable inference of differential treatment. Indeed, as the district court noted in Part III.B of its Memorandum Opinion and Order denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Leave to File Amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Complaint, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations suggest that Defendant Strange has treated comparable facilities equally, including the Greene County facility referred to in the proposed First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants accorded preferential treatment to the Poarch Creeks\u2019 facility, but Plaintiffs did not plausibly allege that that facility is situated similarly to VictoryLand.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We note, in particular, that gaming on Indian lands is subject to an entirely distinct regulatory regime in which the State may often have a lesser role. <em>See, e.g., </em>Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701-2721.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 third proposed additional count is entirely derivative of their proposed \u00a7 1985(3) claim and would therefore be subject to dismissal alongside it. <em>See Park v. City of Atlanta, </em>120 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.1997) (stating that \u201c \u00a7 1986 requires a violation of \u00a7 1985\u201d and \u201conly provides a cause of action in the existence of a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">IV. THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS AGAINST ATTORNEY LA-ROCHE</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions against attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>LaRoche pursuant to Rule 11. \u201cAn appellate court reviews all aspects of the district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Rule 11 sanctions are proper, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c \u2018when the party files a pleading that is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones v. Int\u2019l Riding Helmets, Ltd., </em>49 F.3d 692, 694 (11th Cir.1995)); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(2), (c). The district court imposed sanctions on this ground. We find no abuse of discretion. We note that, in addition to the claims rejected <em>supra </em>in Part II, Plaintiffs initially claimed a violation of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. This claim had no reasonable chance of success even before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shelby County v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2612, 186 L.Ed.2d 651 (2013), for reasons discussed in Parts IV.B and IV.E of the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Complaint. <em>See Presley v. Etowah Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>502 U.S. 491, 503, 112 S.Ct. 820, 828-29, 117 L.Ed.2d 51 (1992) (construing section 5 to reach only changes that have \u201ca direct relation to voting and the election process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions violated his due process rights because he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond either orally or in writing. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did have such an opportunity. Defendant Strange provided Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel with written notice of his intent to seek sanctions. He later filed a written Motion for Sanctions and served it on Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed a written response in opposition and did not request a hearing or any other additional process. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel does not explain why he was entitled to more.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">V.

These Justices quoted from a Senate Judiciary Committee report that was generated during the 1982 amendment process. S.Rep.

In this regard, Plaintiffs alleged that Alabama is majority white and that Macon County and the City of Tuskegee are majority black.

Plaintiffs also proposed to explicitly name all of the aforementioned organizational plaintiffs in the caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\">.

Plaintiffs also indicated that at least some of the organizational plaintiffs had cut, or would cut, projects or services as a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">.

Our predecessor court explained two reasons for this practice. First, \"[\u00a1Judicial economy is best promoted when the existence of a federal right is directly reached and, where no claim is found to exist, the case is dismissed on the merits.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415 (5th Cir. May 1981). Second, a \"refusal to treat indirect attacks on the merits as Rule 12(b)(1) motions provides ... a greater level of protection to the plaintiff who in truth is facing a challenge to the validity of his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, resolution of \"a Rule 12(b)(1) motion can be based on the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts,\u201d whereas Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 56 motions require the court to assume certain facts in the plaintiff's favor. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\">. In <em>Bonner v.

In <em>In re U.S. Catholic Conference, </em>the relevant plaintiffs were voters committed to supporting \"a woman\u2019s right to obtain a legal abortion.\u201d 885 F.2d at 1021. The injury they asserted was \"arbitrary inequality ... in the political process vis-a-vis the Catholic Churchf] created by the IRS\u2019s grant of tax exemption to the latter.\u201d <em>Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc. v. Regan, </em>603 F.Supp. 970, 973-74 (S.D.N.Y.1985). The plaintiffs brought suit in order \"to force the government to revoke the Catholic Church's tax-exempt status.\u201d 885 F.2d at 1021. The district court held that these plaintiffs had \"voter standing\u201d to sue. 885 F.2d at 1028. The Second Circuit rejected this characterization, noting that the plaintiffs had not alleged \"that their vote has been diluted or that voting district lines have been gerrymandered to favor the Church or that anyone has 'stuffed the ballot box\u2019 with votes for Church-backed candidates or that anyone has been prevented from voting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue under a \u201ccompetitive advocates\u201d theory. <em>Id. </em>at 1028-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">. We offer no opinion about whether Defendants actually undermined Amendment 744.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b736-5\">.

To the extent that Plaintiffs sought to establish standing based on economic injury to \"Tuskegee, Macon County, and its citizens,\u201d they failed. Plaintiff Ford is the mayor of Tuskegee, but he never argued that he sought to remedy injury to the City as a municipality (rather than as the holder of a license to operate bingo games). He also failed to allege any injury to the City <em>qua </em>municipality, such as a loss of tax revenue. <em>See Chiles v.

He, furthermore, never argued that the City sought to bring suit as <em>parens patriae, </em>and we decline to make or entertain this argument today. Macon County, moreover, has never been a party to this suit, and none of the individual plaintiffs purporting to represent the citizens of Macon County alleged any particularized economic injury that was shared by members of the putative class, such as a loss of public services previously received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\">. We AFFIRM the dismissal of this claim on jurisdictional grounds as to all other individual plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">. The district court apparently believed that, in Count Four, Plaintiffs again sought to remedy an injury to purported \"voting rights.\u201d We disagree. In Count Four, we understand Plaintiffs to have sought a remedy for the alleged deprivation of their purported rights in the bingo licenses and the economic injury that allegedly resulted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\">. We note that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar Plaintiffs from bringing this claim in federal court. See <em>generally Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Although Plaintiffs complained that Defendants had violated state law, they sought relief from a purported violation of their federal due process rights. <em>See Brown v. Ga.

We do not imply that such a claim would succeed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">.

To the extent that Plaintiffs also intended to reassert a due process claim in their second proposed additional count, the only deprivation they proposed to allege was of their purported rights in the bingo licenses.

Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 48, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1119, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). \"Class I gaming 'means social games solely for prizes of minimal value or traditional forms of Indian gaming engaged in by individuals as a part of, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations\u2019____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48 n. 1, 116 S.Ct. at 1119 n. 1 (quoting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(6)). \"Class II gaming is more extensively defined to include,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\"bingo\u201d and \"games similar to bingo.\" <em>Id. </em>(citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(7)). \"Class III gaming ... is defined as \u2018all forms of gaming that are not class I gaming or class II gaming' and includes such things as slot machines, casino games, banking card games, dog racing, and lotteries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 116 S.Ct. at 1119 (citation omitted) (quoting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Regulation of class I gaming \"is left by the Act to 'the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian tribes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48 n. 1, 116 S.Ct. at 1119 n. 1 (quoting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(a)(1)). \"Regulation of class II gaming contemplates a federal role, but places primary emphasis on tribal self-regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(c)(3)-(6)). \"[C]lass III gaming is lawful only where it is,\" <em>inter alia, </em>\" 'conducted in conformance with a Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe and the State.\"\" <em>Id. </em>at 48-49, 116 S.Ct. at 1120 (quoting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(d)(1)). According to a leading treatise, it is \"impossible to generalize\u201d about the content of Tribal-State gaming compacts, and many \"have provisions that deal with[, <em>inter alia,] ... </em>tribal and state enforcement of compact provisions; allocation of civil, regulatory, and criminal jurisdiction and law enforcement; ... [and] state inspection, testing, and approval of gaming devices and facilities.\u201d <em>Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law </em>\u00a7 12.05[2] (Nell Jessup Newton ed., 2012). Plaintiffs have not drawn our attention to any Tribal-State compact that governs gaming at the Poarch Creek facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">.
