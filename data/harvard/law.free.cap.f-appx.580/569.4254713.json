We have jurisdiction over this appeal, <em>see Cooper v. Ramos, </em>704 F.3d 772, 776-77 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that we have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action even if the district court also noted that the complaint was dismissed without prejudice), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Raymond failed to allege sufficient injury in fact in his complaint, which challenged the residency requirement for cir-culators of initiatives, referenda, and recall campaigns. <em>See </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 15.45.105, 130, 335, 360, 575, 600 (2013). Despite the more relaxed standard for pre-enforcement First Amendment challenges, a plaintiff must still show \u201can injury or threat of injury that is credible, not \u2018imaginary or speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lopez v. Candaele, </em>630 F.3d 775, 786 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted); <em>see Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, </em>573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 2344, 2347, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (June 16, 2014) (holding that plaintiffs had standing where they \u201cpleaded specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles,\u201d and \u201cthere is a history of past enforcement\u201d). Raymond, however, failed to \u201carticulate a concrete plan to violate the law in question by giving details about [his] future speech such as when, to whom, where, or under what circumstances.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>630 F.3d at 787 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Instead, he alleged only that \u201c[h]e has been active on behalf of Alaska political causes before, and he intends to circulate petitions in Alaska for initiatives, referenda, and recall campaigns if the Alaska laws prohibiting him from doing so were not enforced.\u201d Statements of this abstract nature do not confer Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-7\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACa\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">I have no quarrel with the reasoning of the majority, insofar as it addresses the merits of this case. Rather, my concern is whether we should reach those merits at all. In my view, our court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court dismissed the <em>complaint, </em>rather than the action, <em>without prejudice. </em>Because we do not have jurisdiction, we should dismiss the appeal and remand this case to the district court. Doing so would allow Raymond either to amend his complaint or indicate to the district court that he prefers to stand on his pleadings, at which point the district court could enter a judgment dismissing the action in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The majority cites <em>Cooper v. Ramos, </em>in which we held that we had jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s order, even though the district court had dismissed the complaint, and not the action, without prejudice. 704 F.3d 772, 776-77 (9th Cir.2012). In <em>Cooper, </em>we explained that in the absence of any order regarding leave to amend the complaint, our \u201cprecedent requires an evaluation of the district court\u2019s intent\u201d in dismissing the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 776. We went on to explain that \u201cif it appears that the district court <em>intended </em>the dismissal to dispose of the action [rather than merely the complaint],\u201d then the district court\u2019s order \u201cmay be considered final and appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Here, I believe that the district judge\u2019s intent was clear. He took care to dismiss the <em>complaint </em>without prejudice. Without prejudice to what? In my view, the dismissal was \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to <em>filing </em>a new complaint. He did not dismiss the action. Instead, he clearly intended to give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint. It would not have been impossible to amend the complaint. As the majority suggests, all that would have been required would have been for Raymond to \u201carticulate a concrete plan\u201d by \u201cgiving details\u201d about his \u201cfuture speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Rather than taking this approach, the majority determines that it has jurisdiction over this appeal. It is true that the clerk entered a \u201cjudgment,\u201d but in my view, this was a mistake by the clerk of the district court. The \u201cjudgment\u201d itself does not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>dicate that it is dismissing the action as a whole, but merely states that it is dismissing the complaint. We should interpret the clerk\u2019s mistake as an inadvertent filing, not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">When it comes to jurisdictional matters, there can be no question of the importance of bright-line rules. Lawyers and courts must know where jurisdiction lies. Having bright-line rules in this area permits attorneys to know what action they should take. Such rules also create greater judicial efficiency, as judges do not waste time on cases that are not properly before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In this case, counsel for Appellant should have understood the nature of the order and \u201cjudgment\u201d he received from the district court. This confusion could have been avoided if he had simply filed a motion for clarification or a motion to amend the \u201cjudgment\u201d before the district court. It is also true that the clerk of the district court should have caught this error. Finally, it would have been helpful if the clerk of our court had noticed this error, as it would then have been possible for our court to have filed an order at the outset to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Nonetheless, given the enormous volume of appeals that our court has to deal with every year, it is understandable that a case like this may slip through the cracks. It is less understandable how this could have slipped past counsel for Appellant, who after all has final responsibility for his own appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Again, it is my view that we clearly lack jurisdiction. Our court, and the litigants who appear before us, would be better served if we were to return to bright-line jurisdictional rules, rather than putting ourselves to the task of making excuses for those who have failed to follow our procedural mandates.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
