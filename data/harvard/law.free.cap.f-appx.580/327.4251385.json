The arbitration agreement, assuming it is even valid and enforceable, does not apply to Kay\u2019s claims. We REVERSE the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">In 2011, The Minacs Group fired Robert Kay, who was sixty years old, and hired someone much younger to replace him. Kay sued, alleging age discrimination under the \u25a0 Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and Michigan\u2019s Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act (ELCRA). Kay had originally worked for the Phoenix Group, which hired him in 1995, but in 2001 Minacs purchased Phoenix\u2019s assets; nevertheless, paragraph 10 of Kay\u2019s complaint stated that he \u201cbegan working for <em>defendant </em>in 1995.\u201d Minacs moved to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration pursuant to the \u201cReceipt of Policies and Procedures\u201d issued by Phoenix and signed by Kay in 1995. Minacs did not submit the Policies and Procedures document itself-just the Receipt. The district court construed paragraph 10 as a judicial ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>mission that Phoenix and Minacs were the same employer and concluded that the Receipt was therefore still operative despite the change in ownership. The court found that the Receipt required Kay to arbitrate his age discrimination claim and dismissed the case and compelled arbitration. Kay moved for reconsideration, requesting permission to amend his complaint and offering evidence that he had been fired by Phoenix and then hired by Minacs and also that Minacs\u2019s own employee policies superseded the Receipt. The district court denied Kay\u2019s motion. Kay appealed, arguing that the arbitration provision in the Phoenix Receipt does not cover his claims and that the court erred in construing Paragraph 10 of his complaint as a judicial admission that Phoenix and Minacs were functionally the same entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">This appeal exists largely because of troubling litigation behavior by Minacs. Minacs provided the court with the Phoenix Receipt but not Phoenix\u2019s Policies and Procedures handbook even though the Receipt\u2019s arbitration provision applies <em>only </em>to claims \u201carising out of or relating to these Policies and Procedures.\u201d Due to Minacs\u2019s omission, we have no idea what the Phoenix handbook covers and so have no idea what kind of claims the arbitration clause covers. Minacs, moreover, must have had copies of its own receipt and handbook, which suggests that Minacs would have known that the Phoenix receipt had been superseded by its own and that Kay\u2019s claims were not subject to arbitration. This crucial information should have been a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to compel arbitration de novo, \u201cbut with a thumb\u201d \u2014 or at least a pinkie \u2014 \u201con the scale in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Solvay Pharm., Inc. v. Duramed Pharm., Inc., </em>442 F.3d 471, 478 (6th Cir.2006). The question of whether there was an enforceable agreement to arbitrate is reviewed de novo according to state contract law. <em>Tillman v. Macy\u2019s, Inc., </em>735 F.3d 453, 456 (6th Cir.2013); <em>Floss v. Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc., </em>211 F.3d 306, 314 (6th Cir. 2000). A district court\u2019s decision to treat a party\u2019s statement as a judicial admission is reviewed for abuse of discretion: the decision stands unless the panel is \u201cfirmly convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>MacDonald v. Gen. Motors. Corp., </em>110 F.3d 337, 340 (6th Cir.1997). A denial of a motion to reconsider is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Nat\u2019l Ecological Found, v. Alexander, </em>496 F.3d 466, 476 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">A. Construing the Receipt</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The Federal Arbitration Act directs a court to stay litigation and refer an issue to arbitration once it determines that there is (1) an \u201cagreement in writing for such arbitration\u201d and (2) that the issue in question \u201cis referable to arbitration under such agreement.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. The threshold question, then, is \u201cwhether the dispute is arbitrable, meaning that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of the agreement.\u201d <em>Mazera v. Varsity Ford Mgmt. Servs., LLC, </em>565 F.3d 997, 1001 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Landis v. Pinnacle Eye Care, LLC, </em>537 F.3d 559, 561 (6th Cir.2008)). Both parts of this question \u2014 whether there was an \u201cagreement\u201d to arbitrate and whether an issue falls within the scope of that agreement (\u201cis referable,\u201d to use the Arbitration Act\u2019s wording) \u2014 are primarily governed by state contract law. <em>Hergenreder v. Bickford Senior Living Grp., LLC, </em>656 F.3d 411, 416-17 (6th Cir.2011). We say \u201cprimarily\u201d because the Arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tion Act preempts any state law rule \u201csingling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996), and thus requires courts to \u201cplace arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts and enforce them according to their terms,\u201d <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 1745, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011) (citation omitted). But with that caveat thus made, whether Kay and Phoenix had an \u201cagreement\u201d to arbitrate is really a question of contract formation and whether Kay\u2019s civil rights claims are within the scope of that agreement is a question of contract construction, both of which are governed by Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We assume for argument\u2019s sake that Kay and Phoenix had agreed to arbitrate some disputes; the question is whether they had agreed to arbitrate <em>this </em>kind of dispute \u2014 a civil rights claim. The relevant portion of the Receipt provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">I also acknowledge that any and all controversies or claims arising out of, or relating to these Policies and Procedures shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to arbitration....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Note that \u201cPolicies and Procedures\u201d are capitalized in this sentence, which indicates that the arbitration provision only applies to claims connected to the employee handbook titled \u201cPolicies and Procedures\u201d rather than all of Phoenix\u2019s policies and procedures. In other places, the Receipt mentions \u201cpolicies and procedures\u201d with no capitalization when referring to something other than the handbook itself. The Receipt, moreover, appears to be itself part of the Policies and Procedures handbook. Note the header to the Receipt:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">On its face, then, the scope of the arbitration provision is easy to discern: Kay and Phoenix agreed to arbitrate only those disputes that arise from or relate to whatever is in the Policies and Procedures handbook. Minacs did not put the rest of the handbook into the record, so we have no way of knowing whether civil rights claims are covered by the handbook. Arbitration provisions, like any other provision, must be interpreted in the context of the whole contract. <em>See Huffman v. Hilltop Cos., LLC, </em>747 F.3d 391, 397-98 (6th Cir.2014); <em>see also Heurtebise v. Reliable Bus. Computers, Inc., </em>452 Mich. 405, 550 N.W.2d 243, 246-47 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">Given Minacs\u2019s omission, we construe the provision literally and conclude that the arbitration provision does not cover Kay\u2019s civil rights claims because there is no contract language indicating that his claims arise from or relate to the employee handbook. Further, Kay\u2019s complaint does not allege a \u201cpolicy or procedure,\u201d it alleges age discrimination on the part of Kay\u2019s immediate supervisor. The provision is certainly not \u201cambiguous\u201d as we normally understand the word: \u201cContract language is ambiguous if it \u2018is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person <em>who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement....\u2019\u201d Preferred RX, Inc. v. Am. Prescription Plan, Inc., </em>46 F.3d 535, 543 (6th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Walk </em>\u2014 In <em>Medical Ctrs., Inc. v. Breuer Capital </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Corp., </em>818 F.2d 260, 268 (2d Cir.1987)) (emphasis added). Rather, the provision is \u201cambiguous\u201d because Minacs chose not to provide the court with the portion of the contract that would clear up the \u201cambiguity.\u201d Remarkably, Minacs argues that the presumption of arbitrability compels the court to resolve this \u201cambiguity\u201d in favor of arbitration. Presumptions and canons of construction do not relieve a party of its responsibility to provide the court with the entire contract at issue and do not supplant a lawyer\u2019s duty of candor owed to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">B. The Judicial Admission</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In order to ensure that the case will proceed properly on remand, we pause to address the court\u2019s ruling that Kay had made a judicial admission. Paragraph 10 of Kay\u2019s complaint states: \u201cPlaintiff began working for defendant in 1995 as an assistant controller.\u201d The district court read this sentence to mean that \u201cPlaintiff admits in his Complaint that Phoenix and Defendant [i.e., Minacs] are the same. This is a judicial admission that Phoenix and Defendant have substantial similarities of operation and continuity, thus the arbitration agreement is binding on the parties.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u201c[U]nder federal law, stipulations and admissions in the pleadings are generally binding on the parties and the Court. Not only are such admissions and stipulations binding before the trial court, but they are binding on appeal as well.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., </em>780 F.2d 549, 551 (6th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). \u201cFactual assertions in pleadings ..., unless amended, are considered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who made them.\u201d <em>Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., </em>861 F.2d 224, 226 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>see also Barnes v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>201 F.3d 815, 829 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Lacelaw, </em>861 F.2d at 226). However, a statement must be \u201cdeliberate, clear and unambiguous\u201d and \u201c \u2018expressly concede ... an alleged fact\u2019 \u201d in order to be treated as a judicial admission. <em>MacDonald v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>110 F.3d 337, 340 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Belculfine, </em>527 F.2d 941, 944 (1st Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The requirements for a judicial admission are not satisfied by the record. Even under a deferential standard of review, \u201cPlaintiff began working for Defendant in 1995 as an assistant controller,\u201d is not sufficiently deliberate or clear to qualify as an express concession that \u201cPhoenix and [Minacs] are the same.\u201d The briefing and record before the district court made clear that Kay did not work for Minacs in 1995, that he worked for Phoenix, that Phoenix and Minacs are not \u201cthe same\u201d as a matter of fact, and Kay that did not intend to concede this \u201cfact.\u201d The court abused its discretion when it treated Paragraph 10 of Kay\u2019s complaint as a judicial admission. <em>See MacDonald, </em>110 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Kay\u2019s claims are not arbitrable under the terms of the Receipt and Kay is therefore entitled to pursue his case in federal court. We REVERSE the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration and dismissing the case, and REMAND the case for further proceedings on Kay\u2019s civil rights claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b357-12\">COOK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARn\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings on a single, narrow ground: Minacs fails to show that the Receipt entitles it to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In granting Minacs\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court relied on the Receipt\u2019s seemingly broad language \u2014 \u201cany and all controversies or claims arising out of, or relating to\u201d \u2014 without grappling with the next phrase, \u201cthese Policies and Procedures.\u201d As the majority notes, this phrase limits the scope of the arbitration provision to those disputes arising from or relating to Phoenix\u2019s 1995 Policies and Procedures handbook. And though we have previously construed arbitration clauses to apply broadly to employment disputes, we have done so only when the provisions included broader language than the Receipt\u2019s language here. <em>See, e.g., Morrison v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>317 F.3d 646, 654 (6th Cir.2003) (arbitration provision covering <em>\u201cany legal dispute relating to [employee\u2019s] employment </em>with Circuit City, <em>including all state and federal statutory claims, </em>contract claims, and tort claims (emphasis added))\u201d; <em>EEOC v. Frank\u2019s Nursery &amp; Crafts, Inc., </em>177 F.3d 448, 452 (6th Cir. 1998) (arbitration provision covering \u201cany claim ... <em>relative to [employee\u2019s] employment or termination of employment </em>[including but not limited to any claim for any tort, discrimination, breach of contract, violation of public policy or statutory claim)\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Here, Minacs labeled the Receipt a \u201cstand-alone\u201d document and provided no evidence that Kay\u2019s discrimination claim \u201caris[es] out of or relat[es] to [the Phoenix] Policies and Procedures.\u201d On this record, the district court erred in concluding that Kay\u2019s dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision. I therefore concur with the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
