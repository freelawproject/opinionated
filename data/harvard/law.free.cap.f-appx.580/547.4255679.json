Chouhan claims that he and his family were persecuted in India because of his political activities. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Chouhan\u2019s application on the ground that he lacked credibility, and the BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Jie Cui v. Holder, </em>712 F.3d 1332, 1336 (9th Cir.2013). Chouhan testified before the IJ that he had been severely beaten following his second arrest by police, but he failed to mention in his declaration this \u201cdramatic\u201d and \u201cpivotal\u201d event. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003). He also failed to provide any corroboration for his claim that he was beaten or that he received medical attention afterwards. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). In addition, he misidentified the party of the political candidate for whom he claimed to have campaigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-25\">Chouhan also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by conducting an internet search during his hearing to determine the party affiliation of the candidate whom he allegedly supported. Chouhan stated that he had no objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the search when asked by the IJ. <em>See In re Jimenez-Santillano, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 567, 570 n. 2 (B.I.A.1996) (en banc) (holding that issues not raised before the IJ are waived). Moreover, Chouhan cannot show prejudice. <em>See Pagayon v. Holder, </em>675 F.3d 1182, 1191-92 (9th Cir.2011) (per cu-riam). He also had the opportunity to introduce contrary evidence, but did not do so. Chouhan therefore was not deprived of \u201ca full and fair hearing of his claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Chouhan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
