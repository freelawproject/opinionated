Preska, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b61-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b61-21\">The United States appeals from an order entered on November 8, 2013, by the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Skretny, <em>C.J.) </em>granting Defendant-Appellee Adam Ris-sew\u2019s motion to suppress evidence discovered during a police search of his home. The district court held that although the search at issue was conducted pursuant to a warrant, that warrant was invalid because it was not supported by probable cause. It further held that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply, because the warrant application was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonable officer could not rely on the resulting warrant. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-22\">Where, as here, the relevant facts are undisputed, we review de novo the legal issues of whether a warrant was supported by probable cause and whether the good faith exception applies. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Clark, </em>638 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir.2011). Probable cause for a search warrant requires \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\u201d in the place to be searched. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Where a magistrate finds probable cause and issues a search warrant, \u201cthe task of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 afforded the magistrate \u2018a substantial basis\u2019 for making the requisite probable cause determination.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>638 F.3d at 93 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Moreover, \u201c[w]hen police act under a warrant that is invalid for lack of probable cause, the exclusionary rule does not apply if the police acted \u2018in objectively reasonable reliance\u2019 on the subsequently invalidated search warrant.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 142, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984)). The burden rests on the government to prove that police reliance on a warrant was objectively reasonable. <em>Clark, </em>638 F.3d at 100. Police reliance on a warrant is not objectively reasonable if, inter alia, the warrant application is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Moore, </em>968 F.2d 216, 222 (2d Cir.1992)). That, however, \u201cis a very difficult threshold to meet.\u201d <em>United States v. Falso, </em>544 F.3d 110, 128 n. 24 (2d Cir.2008). It most often applies \u201cwhen affidavits are bare bones, <em>i.e., </em>totally devoid of factual circumstances to support eonclusory allegations.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>638 F.3d at 103. By contrast, where \u201c \u2018thoughtful and competent judges\u2019 might disagree as to whether the facts alleged established probable cause,\u201d the good faith exception should apply to prevent suppression. <em>Id. </em>at 104 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 926, 104 S.Ct. 3405).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We agree with the government that the district court erred in holding that the good faith exception did not apply. The warrant application in this case alleged (among other things) that a confidential informant had told the police eight months earlier that Rissew was growing marijuana in his house; that Rissew\u2019s young son had told a confidential source eleven days earlier that his father was growing \u201cbamboo\u201d in his house and had identified a picture of marijuana as looking like his father\u2019s \u201cbamboo\u201d; and that records from Rissew\u2019s electric company showed that for the past fourteen months, his house had used on average four to five times the electricity of comparable houses, which is indicative of a marijuana growing operation. We are convinced that \u201cthoughtful and competent judges\u201d might believe these allegations were sufficient to demonstrate probable cause. <em>Clark, </em>638 F.3d at 104 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 926, 104 S.Ct. 3405); <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>605 F.3d 300, 308 (6th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Kattaria, </em>553 F.3d 1171, 1176 (8th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Huggins, </em>299 F.3d 1039, 1045 (9th Cir.2002). It was therefore objectively reasonable for the executing officers to rely on the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue a warrant, and the good faith exception applies to prevent suppression of the resulting evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In his suppression motion, Rissew also sought suppression of certain comments he made to the police after he was arrested, claiming that those comments were elicited in violation of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The district court did not reach Rissew\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>argument; instead, it held that his comments should be suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>tree, since (in its opinion) they stemmed from the search of Rissew\u2019s home. Because we hold that the good faith exception applies, we reverse that part of the district court\u2019s decision as well. But as the district court has not yet considered Rissew\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>argument, we express no opinion on its merits, and we do not foreclose Rissew from raising it again on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">For the reasons given above, we REVERSE the decision of the district court granting Rissew\u2019s motion to suppress, and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-5\">. Because the good faith exception will prevent suppression in any case, we need not decide (and do not decide) whether the warrant was in fact supported by probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
