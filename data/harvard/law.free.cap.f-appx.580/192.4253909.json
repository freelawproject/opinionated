Willingham pleaded guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2012), and received a sentence of thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning the reasonableness of the sentence. Willingham was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">We review Willingham\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). After determining whether the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, we must decide whether the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, analyzed the arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Once we have determined that the sentence is free of significant procedural error, we consider its substantive reasonableness, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Where, as here, the sentence is within the appropriate Guidelines range, we presume that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir. 2008). Such a presumption is rebutted only if the defendant demonstrates \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We conclude that the district court committed neither procedural nor substantive error in sentencing Willingham. The court correctly calculated and considered as advisory the applicable Guidelines range. After hearing argument from counsel and providing Willingham the opportunity to allocute, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and Will-ingham\u2019s history and characteristics, and imposed a within-Guidelines sentence of thirty-three months. Counsel does not offer any grounds to rebut the presumption on appeal that Willingham\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable, and our review reveals none. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Willing-ham.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Willingham\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Willingham, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Willingham requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Willingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
