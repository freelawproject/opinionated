The District Court sentenced Sands to consecutive prison sentences: two months on Count One, which was a two-month downward variance from the Guidelines sentence range, and twenty-four months on Count Two, the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She now appeals her sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">In her brief, Sands presents an argument she did not present to the District Court \u2014 that in calculating the Guidelines sentence range for the Count One offense, the court erred by applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B) because her conduct did not meet the ordinary definition of \u201ctrafficking,\u201d as opposed to the definition of that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e). In its response, the Government concedes that application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B) was erroneous because Sands was categorically ineligible for the enhancement pursuant to Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6, but contends that the error did not affect her substantial rights. We agree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>We review all sentences under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable and therefore an abuse of discretion if the court commits a significant procedural error,\u201d such as improperly calculating the guideline range. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir.2009). However, where, as here, the defendant failed to present the same argument to the sentencing court, we review the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1222 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 821 (11th Cir.2014) (holding that \u201c[t]he defendant ... fails to preserve a legal issue for appeal if the factual predicates of an objection are included in the sentencing record, but were presented to the district court under a different legal theory\u201d (alteration in original) (emphasis and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Plain error occurs when there is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1222. If the first three conditions are met, then we \u201cmay exercise discretion to correct a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cPlain is synonymous with clear or, equivalently, obvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotations omitted). For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778. To establish prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability of a different result. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2005). If we would have to speculate whether the result would have been different, the defendant has not met the burden to show that her substantial rights have been affected. <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B), a two-level enhancement is merited if the offense involved the \u201cproduction or trafficking\u201d of any unauthorized access device, counterfeit access device, or authentication feature. The Application Notes to \u00a7 2B1.1 define \u201cproduction\u201d as including manufacture, design, alteration, authentication, duplication, or assembly. <em>Id. </em>comment. (n.l0(A)). Notably, the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 does not include a definition for \u201ctrafficking.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6, which addresses aggravated identity theft, provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for this factor for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). \u201cMeans of identification\u201d has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">A \u201cmeans of identification\u201d includes numbers and access devices. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">In <em>United States v. Charles, </em>757 F.3d 1222, 1223, 1225 (11th Cir.2014), we addressed a similar issue involving a defendant who transferred a stolen debit card to another party. The District Court applied the enhancement in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B) for the trafficking of an unauthorized access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>device to his conspiracy offense, when he was also convicted and consecutively sentenced under \u00a7 1028A. <em>Charles, </em>757 F.3d at 1224-25,. On appeal, we held that Charles\u2019s \u00a7 1028A conviction already accounted for his transfer of a stolen debit card and, therefore, the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B) enhancement was improper as to the.conspiracy count. <em>Id. </em>at 1226-27; <em>see also United States v. Cruz, </em>713 F.3d 600, 605-08 (1 1th Cir.2013) (holding that Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2B1.6 prohibited an enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(A)(i), for the use of device-making equipment, to defendants who were convicted of violating \u00a7 1028A).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Although Sands argues that the District Court erred by applying a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B) because her conduct did not meet the ordinary definition of \u201ctrafficking,\u201d as opposed to the definition of that term in \u00a7 1029(e), we need not address that issue because she was categorically ineligible for that enhancement pursuant to Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2B1.6. The error in applying the enhancement did not affect her substantial rights or seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings because she received a significant downward variance on Count One, and there is no evidence in the record that the court would have reduced her sentence on that count further if the two-level enhancement was not applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-11\">. Under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines- Manual [hereinafter U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 5G 1.2(a), the mandatory two-year term of imprisonment imposed on Count Two had to be imposed consecutively to the Count One sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-19\">. As the following discussion makes clear, Sands is not challenging her mandatory prison sentence on Count Two.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
