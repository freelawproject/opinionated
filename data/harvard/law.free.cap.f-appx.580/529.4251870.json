Substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) conclusion that Ikhtiyor Khamroev did not testify credibly. The IJ identified multiple inconsistencies in Khamroev\u2019s testimony, one of which was particularly significant. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Khamroev was able to obtain a certificate of good behavior in support of his visa application from the president of his state university. The IJ found this fact inconsistent with Khamroev\u2019s other testimony that he was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d under constant surveillance by the police and that university officials had forced his student group off campus because of his political activities. This inconsistency goes to the heart of Khamroev\u2019s claim that he suffered persecution as an enemy of the state under constant surveillance. Khamroev failed to offer a \u201creasonable and plausible\u201d explanation for this inconsistency in his testimony. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">2. Without the benefit of credible testimony, Khamroev has failed to meet his burden for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">3. We lack jurisdiction to review Khamroev\u2019s petition for humanitarian asylum, as he did not raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
