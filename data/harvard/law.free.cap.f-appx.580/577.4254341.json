We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">David Ross contends that his attorney, Alan Richey, had an actual conflict of interest because he was a necessary witness for their defense, and otherwise provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility on the actual conflict argument, but denied a certificate of appealability on three other ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">1. The district court concluded after a two-day evidentiary hearing that Richey did not have an actual conflict, as he never advised the Rosses to undertake illegal activity, and because his testimony would not have supported the defense and would have likely aided the prosecution. Those factual findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Ganceda, </em>592 F.3d 1043, 1045 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-27\">2. Because the Rosses failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d on their other ineffective assistance claims, we decline to address the issues not covered by the certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see Slack v.
