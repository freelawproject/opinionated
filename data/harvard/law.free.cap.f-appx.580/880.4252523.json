The Government\u2019s motion is GRANTED insofar as it concerns Ware\u2019s sentencing claims because he knowingly and voluntarily entered into the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350-51 (11th Cir.1993) (sentence appeal waiver will be enforced if it was made knowingly and voluntarily). The Government\u2019s motion is DENIED insofar as it concerns Ware\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the factual basis underlying his conviction for conspiring to commit money laundering. However, because there was a sufficient factual basis for Ware\u2019s guilty plea, we AFFIRM his conviction for conspiring to commit money laundering. <em>See Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1163 (5th Cir. 1969) (stating that summary disposition is appropriate where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
