Following a jury trial in 2003, Ag\u00fcero and other City of Miami Police Department (\u201cMPD\u201d) officers were convicted of conspiring to obstruct justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1512(b)(3), and obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512. The evidence at trial showed that Ag\u00fcero and his codefendants were involved in several police-related shootings, that they planted guns \u2014 which had been stolen from other crimes scenes and held for future use \u2014 at the scenes of the shootings, and that they made misleading statements to state investigators about the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">At trial and later on direct appeal, Ag\u00fce-ro argued that the evidence was insufficient under <em>United States v. Veal, </em>153 F.3d 1233 (11th Cir.1998), to show a \u201clikelihood\u201d that his misleading conduct would be communicated to federal authorities. We affirmed Aguero\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Ronda, </em>455 F.3d 1273, 1285 (11th Cir.2006). Applying the rationale in <em>Veal, </em>which said that the government need only show that there was a \u201cpossibility\u201d or \u201clikelihood\u201d that communication would be made to federal authorities, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show that Aguero\u2019s misleading conduct was \u201clikely\u201d to be communicated to federal authorities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Ag\u00fcero filed a \u00a7 2255 motion after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fowler v. United States, </em>563 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2045, 179 L.Ed.2d 1099 (2011). <em>Fowler </em>altered the <em>Veal </em>standard. In his motion, Ag\u00fcero argued that his convictions should be vacated because he was convicted under an incorrect legal standard. The district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding that the claim he raised in his motion was procedurally defaulted because (1) he did not attack the <em>Veal </em>standard on direct appeal, and (2) that even if he had preserved his claim, it failed on the merits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>We issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">(1) Whether Ag\u00fcero preserved a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of a federal nexus for his convictions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">Assuming that Aguero\u2019s claim is preserved, whether any error was harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">On appeal, Ag\u00fcero argues that he preserved a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of a federal nexus for his convictions. He further argues that he attacked the <em>Veal </em>standard at trial and on direct appeal. Moreover, given that <em>Veal </em>was binding precedent at the time, he says by objecting to the application of the <em>Veal </em>standard, he preserved a challenge to the standard itself. Ag\u00fcero also contends that the failure to employ the <em>Fowler </em>standard at his trial was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In reviewing a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Rhode v. United States, </em>588 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). The issue of whether a habeas petitioner\u2019s claims are subject to procedural default is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). The scope of review in a \u00a7 2255 appeal is limited to issues specified in the COA, which we construe \u201cin light of the pleadings and other parts of the record.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). We review harmlessness under the standard announced in <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), <em>de novo. Burns v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>720 F.3d 1296, 1305 (11th Cir.2013) (addressing the district court\u2019s harmless-error determination under the <em>Brecht </em>standard in a \u00a7 2254 petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run from the latest of the following four possible events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-11\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from filing by such governmental action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-12\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-13\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). The one-year period under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) begins to run on the date the Supreme Court recognizes a new right. <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 353, 358-59, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 2482, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">The Supreme Court has explained that its decisions \u201cholding that a substantive federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct ... necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 620, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1610, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms generally apply retroactively. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (citing <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 620-21, 118 S.Ct. at 1610). Any court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>determine that a Supreme Court decision applies retroactively for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2004), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>545 U.S. 353, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Under the procedural default rule, a defendant who fails to raise an available challenge to a criminal conviction on direct appeal is barred from raising that claim in a collateral proceeding. <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2011). To preserve an argument for collateral review, a party must \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d raise the issue on direct appeal. <em>Brown v. United States, </em>720 F.3d 1316, 1332 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 24, 2014) (No. 13-8899, 13A607) (concluding that defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim was procedurally defaulted because defendant failed to cite the relevant law and make legal argument on the pertinent issue in his brief on direct appeal). A procedural default may be excused, however, if one of two exceptions applies: (1) cause and actual prejudice, or (2) actual innocence. <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 622, 118 S.Ct. at 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In <em>Brecht, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the appropriate standard for harmlessness of a non-structural constitutional error on collateral review is whether the error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d 507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714. An error is not harmless if the court is \u201cin grave doubt about whether a trial error of federal law had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 994, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We have applied the <em>Brecht </em>harmless-error review standard to non-structural constitutional errors on collateral review. <em>See Ross v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 677, 681-82 (11th Cir.2002). A non-structural constitutional error \u201coccurs during the presentation of the case to the jury\u201d and can be \u201cassessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine the effect it had on the trial.\u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 629, 113 S.Ct. at 1717 (quotation and alteration omitted). A structural error, on the other hand, only occurs in cases where there are \u201cextreme deprivations of constitutional rights, such as denial of counsel, denial of self representation at trial, and denial of a public trial.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>289 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Section 1512(a)(1)(C) of Title 18 provides in relevant part that, \u2018Whoever kills ... another person, with intent to ... prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense ... shall be punished.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C). A person violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) if the person \u201cengages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to ... hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">In <em>Fowler, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C) requires that the defendant have the intent not only to prevent communication to law enforcement officers in general, but to federal officers in particular. <em>See Fowler, </em>563 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2048. Fowler shot and killed a police officer who had approached him and his codefendants in a cemetery where they were preparing to rob a bank. <em>Id. </em>Fowler was later charged under \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C). <em>Id. </em>After Fowler was convicted in the district court, he appealed to our Court, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ing that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had killed the police officer intending to prevent his communication with a federal officer. <em>Id. </em>We applied the <em>Veal </em>\u201cpossibility\u201d standard \u2014 which had addressed convictions under \u00a7 1512(b)(3)\u2014 and affirmed Fowler\u2019s conviction, concluding that a \u201cpossible or potential communication to federal authorities\u201d was sufficient under the statute. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Fowler, </em>603 F.3d 883, 886-87 (11th Cir.2010), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>563 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2045, 179 L.Ed.2d 1099 (2011) (noting that \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C) and \u00a7 1512(b)(3) contain similar wording).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The Supreme Court vacated our decision. The Court concluded that to establish a violation of \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C), the government \u201cmust show that there was a <em>reasonable likelihood </em>that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer.\u201d <em>Fowler, </em>563 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2048 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court rejected the \u201cpossibility\u201d standard, writing that \u201cto allow the Government to show only a mere possibility that a communication would have been with federal officials is to permit the Government to show little more than the possible commission of a federal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2051. The Supreme Court explained that the government was not required to show that the communication, if it occurred, was federal beyond a reasonable doubt, or even more likely than not. <em>Id. </em>at 2052. The government, however, \u201cmust show that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or simply hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Fowler conceded that he did not argue at trial that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d test, the Supreme Court remanded the case for the lower courts to determine how this standard applied to the facts of his case. <em>Id. </em>at 2053.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">As a preliminary matter, the magistrate judge correctly determined that Aguero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 which was filed three years after his conviction became final\u2014 qualified for the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3) exception because <em>Fowler </em>applies retroactively to final criminal convictions, as it narrowed the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms. <em>See Dodd, </em>365 F.3d at 1278 (noting that any court may determine whether a Supreme Court decision is retroactive for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3)); <em>see also Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 351-52, 124 S.Ct. at 2522. Next, although <em>Fowler </em>interpreted the intent element under \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C), we will extend the interpretation to the intent element under \u00a7 1512(b)(3) because the statutory language of those two portions of the statute is nearly identical. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C), <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, the parties agree that Ag\u00fcero preserved a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of a federal nexus for his convictions, at least as far as that challenge rests on the <em>Veal </em>\u201cpossibility\u201d standard. The claim Ag\u00fcero raises in his \u00a7 2255 motion, however, is not merely an evidentiary sufficiency claim, but rather a general claim that he was convicted under an erroneous legal standard. Ag\u00fcero chiefly argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him under the <em>Fowler </em>standard. The government argues that Aguero\u2019s <em>Fowler </em>claim is procedurally defaulted because he did not specifically challenge the <em>Veal </em>\u201cpossibility\u201d standard at trial or on direct appeal. Thus, an issue presented is whether a sufficiency-of-evidence challenge under the then-applicable legal standard on direct appeal preserves for collateral review a challenge that a conviction is invalid based on a later Supreme Court decision that altered that legal standard, making it a higher standard for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>We have not had an occasion to address this precise issue in a published decision. We need not address this issue here either, because as discussed by the district court, Aguero\u2019s <em>Fowler </em>claim fails on the merits. <em>See Loggins v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1204, 1215 (11th Cir.2011) (noting, in the \u00a7 2254 context, that it was not necessary to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s claims were procedurally barred, because the petition failed on the merits); <em>see also Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1238 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the \u00a7 2255 movant established cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, the claim would still fail on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Ag\u00fcero cannot show that the failure to utilize the <em>Fowler </em>standard at his trial \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714; <em>Fowler, </em>563 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 2052. He does not contest that the evidence at trial showed that he planted evidence at police-related shootings and provided misleading sworn statements to investigators. Instead, he argues that no evidence showed a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the transmission of information related to these shootings would be transferred to federal authorities. But ample, to an extent undisputed, evidence showed \u201cthe likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or simply hypothetical.\u201d <em>See Fowler, </em>563 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 2052. Evidence at trial showed a working relationship between the MPD and the federal government, that a massive investigation results each time a police-related shooting occurs, and that standard practice existed of forwarding information from questionable shootings to the FBI. So, we have no significant doubt \u2014 much less have grave doubflthat the jury would have found that \u201cthe likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or simply hypothetical.\u201d <em>See Fowler, </em>563 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2052. The evidence shows that it was \u201creasonably likely\u201d that the misleading information from Ag\u00fcero and his coconspirators would be transferred to federal authorities; thus that the <em>Veal </em>standard governed at the time of Aguero\u2019s trial had no \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Furthermore, that the <em>Veal </em>\u201cpossibility\u201d standard was the legal, applicable standard in our Circuit at the time of Aguero\u2019s trial did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict in fact: neither the government argued to nor the district court instructed the jury per <em>Veal </em>that no more than a mere possibility of a communication to federal officers was required for conviction. Ag\u00fcero and his co-defendants objected at the charge conference to the district court\u2019s suggestion that the jury be instructed that the \u201cmisleading information is likely or possibly to be transferred to a federal law enforcement officer.\u201d The district court ultimately instructed the jury only that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant intended to hinder, delay, or prevent communication of information to a law enforcement officer or Judge of the United States.\u201d This statement tracks the language of the statute, is not' error, and is unchanged by <em>Fowler, </em>which is an elaborating interpretation of the intent language. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3); <em>see also Fowler, </em>563 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2048-52. Thus, no grave doubt exists about the impact of the <em>Veal </em>mere-\u201cpossibility\u201d standard on Ague-ro\u2019s trial; the <em>Veal </em>standard actually played no direct or substantial part in the verdict and was not (could not be) injurious to Ag\u00fcero for the verdict. <em>See Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>Ross, </em>289 F.3d at 683.
