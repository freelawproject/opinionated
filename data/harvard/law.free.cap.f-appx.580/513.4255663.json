On appeal, Williams renews his claims that he suffered health problems as a result of exposure to black mold in the shower and air vents while he was confined at the Crawford County Detention Center, and that he endured cold temperatures and humiliation when he was walked across the street to go to court. Following careful de novo review, we agree with the district court that the alleged presence of black mold was not a constitutional violation because \u201can outside agency ... inspected and found no mold present,\u201d and that Williams\u2019s brief exposure to cold temperatures and the public view while he was made to cross the street to the courthouse did not amount to a constitutional violation. <em>See Mack v. Dillon, </em>594 F.3d 620, 622 (8th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (standard of review); <em>Owens v. Scott Cnty. Jail, </em>328 F.3d 1026, 1027 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (discussing unconstitutional conditions of confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-16\">. The Honorable P.K.
