We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warwick Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>654 F.3d 267, 271 (2d Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 </em>U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (internal quotations omitted). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., </em>684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review of the record and relevant case law, we conclude that the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, substantially for the reasons stated in its September 11, 2013 order. The District Court correctly found that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over any claim that plaintiff was improperly dismissed from St. Paul\u2019s School of Nursing. <em>See Gertler v. Goodgold, </em>107 A.D.2d 481, 487 N.Y.S.2d 565, 570 (1st Dep\u2019t 1985) (\u201c[Ijnternal administrative and academic determinations ... are redressable, if at all, in an Article 78 proceeding, not a plenary action.\u201d). It also properly found that Papaspiradakos\u2019s claims \u2014 for example, that one of St. Paul\u2019s classrooms contains only four microscopes and \u201ca solitary plastic skeleton,\u201d or that St. Paul\u2019s faculty is \u201cdisinterested, malicious, [and] intentionally incompetent\u201d \u2014 either sound in inactionable educational malpractice, fail to show breach of a specific promise, or are unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Hoffman v. Bd. of Ed. of City of New York, </em>49 N.Y.2d 121, 125, 424 N.Y.S.2d 376, 400 N.E.2d 317 (1979); <em>Paladino v. Adelphi Univ., </em>89 A.D.2d 85, 454 N.Y.S.2d 868, 873 (2d Dep\u2019t 1982); <em>see also Papaspiridakos v. Educ. Affiliates, Inc., </em>No. 10 Civ. 5628, 2013 WL 4899136, at *4-*6 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2013). Moreover, St. Paul\u2019s display of a plaque stating that it was a member of the National League of Nursing (which Papaspiradakos did not even see until after he was suspended) is not a deceptive business practice because St. Paul\u2019s was, in fact, a member of the National League of Nursing in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">The District Court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Papaspiradakos\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Papaspiradakos\u2019s motion merely attempted to relitigate questions already decided. <em>See Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201c[A] motion to reconsider should not be granted where the moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>We have considered all of the arguments raised by Papaspiridakos on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s September 12, 2013 judgment and September 30, 2013 order denying reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">. We also deny as moot defendant\u2019s motion to strike portions of Papaspiradakos\u2019s appendix and brief (ECF No. 47), inasmuch as any supplemental materials that Papaspiradakos may have submitted that were not before the District Court do not affect our review and disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
