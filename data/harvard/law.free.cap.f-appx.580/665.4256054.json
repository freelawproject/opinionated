Goddard and survivor\u2019s benefits to his widow Sandra J. Goddard. The Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Program elected not to file a brief in this appeal. Exercising jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), as incorporated by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKR\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Mr. Goddard was born in 1933. He worked as a warehouse technician at a coal mine and at a uranium mine in the 1970s and 1980s before Antelope employed him to work in its warehouses in 1989. He retired in 2000. His warehouse position exposed him to varying amounts of coal dust, some days light and some days heavy.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In the late 1990s, Mr. Goddard started experiencing respiratory trouble. He was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) \u2014 \u201ca disease of unknown cause that is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the lungs,\u201d Emp\u2019r Hrg. Exh. 4 at 6\u2014 and with a related disease, usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). Within about six months of his retirement, he was on oxygen. Mr. Goddard filed for miner\u2019s benefits in April 2002. He died in October 2003; his death certificate specified cause of death as IPF. In November 2003, Mrs. Goddard filed for survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">After the Department of Labor initially awarded benefits on both claims, Antelope sought a hearing before an administrative law judge (AL J). The hearing was held on May 24, 2006. Since then, there have been four ALJ decisions and four appeals to the Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board (Review Board). We discuss those rulings later in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">II. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">To make sense of the evidence and administrative decisions, it is helpful to understand the legal framework for black lung claims. \u201cTo obtain benefits under the Act, a miner must demonstrate that he satisfies three conditions: (1) he or she suffers from pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment; and (3) the pneumoconiosis is totally disabling.\u201d <em>Energy W. Mining Co. v. Oliver, </em>555 F.3d 1211, 1214 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">\u201cPneumoconiosis\u201d includes both clinical pneumoconiosis and legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a). Clinical pneu-moconiosis \u201cconsists of those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconioses, i.e., the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.201(a)(1). Legal pneumoconiosis is \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.201(a)(2), including \u201cany chronic pulmonary disease or respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">The regulations list four ways to make a finding of pneumoconiosis. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a). The first is through x-ray evidence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a)(1), and the second is through biopsy or autopsy evidence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a)(2). The third is through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>certain presumptions that are inapplicable in this case. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a)(3). And the fourth is through \u201ca physician, exercising sound medical judgment ..., finding] that the miner suffers or suffered from pneu-moconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201. Any such finding must be based on objective medical evidence ... [and] must be supported by a reasoned medical opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.202(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">After finding pneumoconiosis, the ALJ must determine whether it \u201carose at least in part out of coal mine employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.203(a). \u201cIf a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis was employed for ten years or more in one or more coal mines, there shall be a rebutta-ble presumption that the pneumoconiosis arose out of such employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.203(b). This presumption, however, is applicable only to clinical pneumoconio-sis, not to legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See Andersen v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>455 F.3d 1102, 1105 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Next the ALJ must determine whether the miner is (or was at the time of death) totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(a). \u201cA miner shall be considered totally disabled due to pneumo-coniosis if pneumoconiosis, as defined in \u00a7 718.201, is a substantially contributing cause of the miner\u2019s totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.204(c)(1). Total disability can be established by various evidence: pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas tests, evidence that the miner has pneumoconiosis and suffers from corpulmonale with right-side congestive heart failure, or a physician\u2019s conclusion that the miner\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary condition prevents or prevented the miner from working. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.204(b)(2)(i)-(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">For survivor\u2019s benefits, the claimant must prove the miner had pneumoconiosis that arose out of coal mine employment and the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumo-coniosis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(a). Death is considered \u201cdue to pneumoconiosis\u201d when \u201ccompetent medical evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was the cause of the miner\u2019s death\u201d or when \u201cpneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death,\u201d meaning it \u201chastened] the miner\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(b)(1), (2), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">III. Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Mr. Goddard saw several physicians and submitted to various tests, including x-rays and a lung biopsy. In addition to his treatment records, the parties proffered expert reports and opinions supporting their opposing positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Donald Smith, a board-certified pulmonary specialist, diagnosed Mr. Goddard with IPF and treated him until his death. Dr. Smith stated Mr. Goddard was totally incapacitated by his respiratory impairment. He opined that Mr. Goddard did not have \u201cclassic coal worker\u2019s pneumoco-niosis,\u201d Emp\u2019r Hrg. Exh. 4 at 8, but it was more likely than not that coal-mine-dust exposure contributed to the development of IPF and Mr. Goddard\u2019s death was hastened by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Joshua Portnoy and Kevin Brown of National Jewish Medical Center in Denver examined Mr. Goddard and also diagnosed IPF, with features consistent with UIP. They opined that \u201chis environmental and occupational exposures may potentially cause pulmonary fibrosis with UIP pathology,\u201d but in light of the biopsy results, \u201cthese etiologies are possible, but unlikely as the cause of his lung disease.\u201d 8/31 /2001 Report at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Three pathologists reviewed the biopsy. Carlyne Cool of National Jewish Medical Center diagnosed interstitial fibrosis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>honeycombing consistent with UIP. According to Drs. Portnoy and Brown, she found no evidence of pneumoconiosis. Anita Stinson diagnosed UIP. Everett Oesterling opined that Mr. Goddard \u201chad minimal anthracotic pigmentation of his lung tissue\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no evidence of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis.\u201d Emp\u2019r Hrg. Exh. 1 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Three board-certified radiologists and certified B-readers of x-rays reviewed various x-rays. Thomas Miller reported \u201c[findings consistent with simple pneumo-coniosis.\u201d Claimant Hrg. Exh. 1 at 1. Michael Alexander reported an impression of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis. Jerome Wiot opined that the x-ray he examined was abnormal, but did not show coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and instead was more consistent with IPF.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Michelle Bennett, a family practitioner in Wyoming and former medical director of Northern Wyoming Respiratory Care, examined Mr. Goddard for the Office of Coal Worker\u2019s Compensation. Dr. Bennett agreed with Dr. Smith\u2019s diagnosis of IPF, and stated she would diagnose coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis based on a chest x-ray, work history, and the progress of the disease. She stated there is medical evidence that coal dust can cause fibrotic lung disease; she believed coal dust exposure had a material effect on Mr. Goddard\u2019s respiratory condition and it was a significantly aggravating factor of his IPF.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Joshua Perper, a board-certified forensic pathologist, reviewed the records and concluded Mr. Goddard suffered \u201csevere coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis of the interstitial fibrosis type\u201d because of his coal mining work and the disease \u201cresulted in progressive, severe and permanent respiratory disability and ultimately caused and hastened his death in respiratory failure.\u201d Claimant Hrg. Exh. 3 at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In contrast, Lawrence Repsher, a board-certified pulmonary specialist, reviewed the records and concluded there was no evidence of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis and Mr. Goddard\u2019s pulmonary issues were accounted for by the UIP/IPF diagnoses. He rejected the idea that IPF/UIP is connected to work in a coal mine and stated that evidence to the contrary \u201ccarries] essentially no weight as far as establishing some causal connection.\u201d Emp\u2019r Hrg. Exh. 10 at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">David Rosenberg, a board-certified physician specializing in lung disease and pulmonary disorders, reviewed the records and opined that Mr. Goddard\u2019s \u201cdisability and ultimate death[] were not related in any fashion to past coal dust exposure or the presence of [coal worker\u2019s pneumoconi-osis].\u201d Emp\u2019r Hrg. Exh. 6 at 6. He also stated that \u201cno causative relationship between coal dust exposure and linear interstitial fibrosis has been proven,\u201d and that \u201cpathologically, coal mine dust exposure does not cause linear interstitial fibrosis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">IY. Administrative Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">A. First Agency Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">In his first decision, issued on May 3, 2007, the ALJ found both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis. Evaluating each category of \u00a7 718.202(a) evidence, he concluded that x-ray evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1) and the weight of the evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) established pneumoconiosis. Based on the opinions of Drs. Bennett, Smith, and Perper, the ALJ determined that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Mr. Goddard\u2019s totally disabling pulmonary impairment and, ultimately, his death. He therefore granted both miner\u2019s and surviv- or\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Antelope appealed. On May 29, 2008, the Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ing of clinical pneumoconiosis based on the x-ray evidence, pursuant to \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). In doing so, the Review Board rejected Antelope\u2019s argument that the agency cannot find pneumoconiosis solely on one \u00a7 718.202(a) category of evidence. But the Review Board agreed with Antelope that the ALJ did not adequately explain his finding of legal pneumoconiosis or why he credited the opinions of Drs. Bennett, Smith, and Perper over the opinions of Drs. Repsher and Rosenberg. Accordingly, the Review Board vacated the ALJ\u2019s findings and directed him to \u201cassess the probative value of all relevant medical opinions\u201d and to \u201cconsider the physicians\u2019 qualifications and determine whether their conclusions are reasoned.\u201d 5/29/2008 Rev. Bd. Dec. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">B. Second Agency Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In his second decision, issued on December 9, 2008, the ALJ again undertook a \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) analysis. He credited the opinions of Drs. Bennett and Smith and concluded that \u201cin this case, IPF falls within the definition of [coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis], meeting the criteria in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4).\u201d 12/9/2008 ALJ Dec. at 6. Because pneumoconiosis was demonstrated by evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1) and (a)(4), the ALJ concluded that pneumoconiosis was shown. He further found total disability under \u00a7 718.204. Thus, he again awarded both miner\u2019s and survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Antelope appealed to the Review Board, which determined on January 8, 2010, that the ALJ had not complied with its remand instructions. In relevant part, the Review Board held the ALJ had failed to adequately discuss and assign weight to the medical opinions under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). Accordingly, the Review Board vacated the decision and remanded the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">C. Third Agency Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">On January 10, 2011, the ALJ issued his third decision. This time, after reviewing the medical evidence, the ALJ concluded under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) that the record did not establish Mr. Goddard had pneumoco-niosis. He determined that the lack of evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) outweighed the x-ray evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). Consequently, he denied benefits on both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Mrs. Goddard appealed. On February 29, 2012, the Review Board agreed with her that the ALJ had failed to comply with its instructions, holding, that he had not adequately explained his findings or how he considered the conflicting evidence. The Review Board again vacated the decision and remanded for further proceedings, this time before a new ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">D. Fourth Agency Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">In the fourth ALJ decision, issued on October 31, 2012, the new ALJ started with the \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) analysis. He outlined the various physicians\u2019 reports and ultimately considered the opinions of Drs. Smith, Oesterling, and Perper to be entitled to the most weight. He afforded Dr. Perper\u2019s opinion more weight than Dr. Oesterling\u2019s, and, based on the opinions of Drs. Smith and Perper, he found that Mrs. Goddard had established legal pneumoco-niosis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). He then found total disability under \u00a7 718.204(b). For the claim to survivor\u2019s benefits, he found that Mr. Goddard\u2019s death was due to legal pneumoconiosis. He therefore granted both claims for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">On November 27, 2013, the Review Board affirmed both awards. It rejected Antelope\u2019s contention that the new ALJ should have made a de novo finding on clinical pneumoconiosis, holding that the new ALJ had discretion to rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>finding in the first decision, affirmed on review, that clinical pneumoconiosis was shown under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). It also held the ALJ had followed its instructions to reweigh the evidence of legal pneumoconi-osis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) and had adequately explained why he gave less weight to Antelope\u2019s experts and more weight to Dr. Perper\u2019s opinion. Addressing Antelope\u2019s complaint that the ALJ had not made a finding regarding causation under \u00a7 718.204(c), the Review Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHX\">[A]ny error by the [ALJ] in failing to render a specific finding under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c) is harmless. The Board\u2019s remand order made clear that the central issue for resolution in this case is whether the evidence established that the miner\u2019s disabling interstitial fibrosis was due to coal dust exposure, an analysis relevant to both the issues of the existence of legal pneumoconiosis at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) and disability causation at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c). As discussed <em>supra, </em>the [ALJ] permissibly credited Dr. Perper\u2019s opinion that the miner had disabling interstitial fibrosis caused by coal dust exposure. Because the [ALJ\u2019s] analysis of the evidence at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) encompassed the issue of disability causation, it is not necessary that we remand the case for a specific finding pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">11/27/2013 Rev. Bd. Dec. at 7-8 (footnotes and citations omitted). Antelope\u2019s petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\u201cFor questions of law, we review the Review Board\u2019s decision de novo.\u201d <em>Antelope Coal Co./Rio Tinto Energy Am. v. Goodin, </em>743 F.3d 1331, 1341 (10th Cir. 2014). \u201cFor questions of fact, we determine whether the Review Board properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Antelope argues: (1) the Review Board erred in affirming the finding of pneumo-coniosis based on x-ray evidence alone, rather than requiring the ALJ to weigh all relevant evidence of pneumoconiosis together; (2) the fourth ALJ decision is inadequate and not supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the Review Board exceeded its authority in vacating the third ALJ decision because it was based on substantial evidence and consistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">A. Weighing Evidence Together</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Antelope first attacks the agency\u2019s finding of pneumoconiosis based solely on x-ray evidence under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). It urges us to join three other circuits in holding that \u201calthough section 718.202(a) enumerates four distinct methods of establishing pneumoconiosis, all types of relevant evidence must be weighed together to determine whether the claimant suffers from the disease.\u201d <em>Penn Allegheny Coal Co. v. Williams, </em>114 F.3d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Dixie Fuel Co., LLC v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>700 F.3d 878, 880 (6th Cir.2012); <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 209-10 (4th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">We need not decide this issue in this case, however, because the agency arrived at its finding of legal pneumoconiosis through a comprehensive review and weighing of the medical evidence. Therefore, it appears that the agency performed the weighing that Antelope seeks. And in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>light of the agency\u2019s finding of legal pneu-moconiosis, even if the agency erred in finding clinical pneumoconiosis based solely on x-ray evidence, it would not be reversible error unless the determination of legal pneumoconiosis also is reversible error. <em>See Antelope Coal Co./Rio Tinto Energy Am., </em>743 F.3d at 1349 (\u201cEven if the x-ray had been more readable and had shown no clinical pneumoconiosis, the ALJ\u2019s determination of legal pneumoconi-osis would stand because legal pneumoco-niosis can be found without evidence of clinical pneumoconiosis.\u201d). As discussed below, we do not conclude the finding of legal pneumoconiosis was reversible error, so we need not consider whether the agency erred in finding clinical pneumoco-niosis based only on x-ray evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">B. Fourth Agency Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Antelope argues the fourth ALJ decision was insufficient for three reasons. First, Antelope suggests the ALJ inadequately explained his decision. But \u201c[i]f a reviewing court can discern what the ALJ did and why he did it, the duty of explanation is satisfied.\u201d <em>Gunderson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>601 F.3d 1013, 1022 (10th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have had no trouble discerning what the agency did and why it did it; \u201c[b]oth the Board and the ALJ have shown their work,\u201d <em>Energy W. Mining Co., </em>555 F.3d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Second, Antelope contends the ALJ failed to resolve disability causation under \u00a7 718.204, asserting he did not find that Mrs. Goddard had shown pneumoconiosis to be a material or substantial contributing cause to the totally disabling pulmonary impairment. The Review Board held, however, any error in not making a more specific \u00a7 718.204(c) finding was harmless because the ALJ\u2019s analysis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) also \u201cencompassed the issue of disability causation\u201d under \u00a7 718.204(c). 11/27/2013 Rev. Bd. Dec. at 8. Antelope does not take issue with the Review Board\u2019s determination of harmless error, and we agree with the Review Board that no remand is required, because the ALJ effectively resolved the issue of disability causation when he found legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See Andersen, </em>455 F.3d at 1105 (stating that a claimant establishes legal pneumoconiosis only by proving that his respiratory condition \u201cis significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Third, Antelope asserts the ALJ\u2019s analysis of the medical opinions is impermissibly selective and unsupported by substantial evidence. We have reviewed each of Antelope\u2019s specific contentions with regard to this argument and conclude that none of them compel us to vacate the agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">\u201cOur task is to determine whether the Board properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Energy W. Mining Co., </em>555 F.3d at 1217 (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree with the Review Board that, at a minimum, Dr. Perper\u2019s opinion constitutes substantial evidence to support the decision. In large part, Antelope\u2019s arguments are based on disagreements with the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the evidence. \u201cHowever, in deciding whether substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, the court cannot reweigh the evidence, but may only inquire into the existence of evidence to support the trier of fact.\u201d <em>N. Coal Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>100 F.3d 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, this record presents a conflict of medical opinions, and \u201c[w]e are especially mindful that the task of weighing conflicting medical evidence is within the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>province of the ALJ and that where medical professionals are in disagreement, the trier of fact is in a unique position to determine credibility and weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Energy W. Mining Co., </em>555 F.3d at 1217 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">C. Vacatur of Third ALJ Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Finally, Antelope argues the Review Board should not have vacated the third ALJ decision because that decision was adequately explained and supported by substantial evidence. Again, we disagree with Antelope\u2019s position. The Review Board did not err in concluding the ALJ failed to comply with its instructions on the second remand and failed to adequately explain his findings. Particularly, the third ALJ decision neglected to explain why the ALJ credited the opinions against finding pneumoconiosis over the opinions in favor of finding pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
