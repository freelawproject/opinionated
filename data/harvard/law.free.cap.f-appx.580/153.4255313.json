He appeals, claiming that the district court clearly erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">Clark was indicted in April 1996 along with Andre Paul Gaston. Before his indictment and while Clark was in state custody awaiting trial on state drug charges, he was approached by a representative of Gaston\u2019s attorney and asked to sign an affidavit exonerating Gaston. Clark signed the affidavit in which he stated that he (Clark) was solely responsible for the drugs at issue and that Gaston \u201cdid not know about the cocaine.... It belonged to me.\u201d The affidavit was never used, however, and was apparently not properly notarized under applicable state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The affidavit was discovered by the Government during pre-trial discovery. At sentencing, the district court imposed a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, finding that Clark had made \u201ca knowing false statement ... for the purpose of influencing the action of a judicial officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">Clark claims that the district court erred in imposing the enhancement because: (1) he did not \u201cwillfully\u201d obstruct justice; (2) the affidavit was never actually used; (3) the information was not \u201cmaterial;\u201d (4) the false information did not relate to Clark\u2019s offense; (5) the affidavit was invalid under North Carolina law; and (6) the adjustment in these circumstances is \u201cinherently unfair and unjust\u201d (Brief of Appellant, p. 22) because Gaston\u2019s attorney behaved in an unethical manner in approaching Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-27\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir. 1995). The court\u2019s determination that particular conduct qualifies for the adjustment is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Saintil, </em>910 F.2d 1231, 1232 (4th Cir.1990). Section 3C1.1 provides for a two-level increase if the defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. \u201cA wide range of conduct falls within the parameters of this section.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 883 (4th Cir.1991). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 contains a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct covered by the guideline, including \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 3(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Clark first claims that he did not \u201cwillfully\u201d obstruct or impede the investigation because, as he testified at his sentencing hearing, he did not know what Gaston knew or did not know and that he expressed concern to the law clerk about the affidavit\u2019s accuracy. The district court took into consideration Clark\u2019s testimony, the affidavit itself, the testimony of Gaston\u2019s attorney, and a tape recording of a conversation among Clark, Gaston, and another individual clearly showing Gaston\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. The district court found Clark\u2019s testimony not credible and that finding is not subject to review. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Next, Clark contends that Application Note 3(f) does not apply because the affidavit was never actually used \u2014 i.e., it was never presented to a judge, magistrate, or the prosecutor handling Gaston\u2019s case. However, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 specifically includes attempts within its definition of obstruction of justice. At the time he signed the affidavit, Clark was told that it would be presented to the court the following day for the purpose of obtaining Gaston\u2019s release on bond. As the district court properly concluded, Clark signed the affidavit \u201cwith the intent of making a statement he knew was false at the time for the purpose of assisting his friend Mr. Gaston in getting out of jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Third, Clark claims that the information included in the affidavit was not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the issue under determination because no judge or magistrate ever considered the affidavit, and because it was not relevant to Gaston\u2019s bond hearing. We have already concluded that Clark\u2019s execution of the affidavit constituted an attempt within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Further, the information in the affidavit concerned the criminal culpability of Clark\u2019s codefen-dant and was, therefore, clearly \u201cmaterial\u201d to Gaston\u2019s criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Clark\u2019s fourth claim is that the adjustment does not apply because the false information contained in the affidavit did not relate to Clark\u2019s crime, but to Gaston\u2019s. However, the adjustment may be applied where the defendant lied about another\u2019s involvement in the crime. <em>See United States v. Dyer, </em>910 F.2d 530, 533 (8th Cir.1990) (upholding adjustment where defendant \u201cfreely admitted her own crimes on the witness stand\u201d but lied about another\u2019s involvement).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Clark\u2019s fifth claim is based on his assertion that the affidavit was presumptively invalid under North Carolina law. However, he has provided no authority \u2014 and we are not aware of any \u2014 that would make the validity of the affidavit a prerequisite to finding that Clark attempted to obstruct justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Finally, Clark asserts that application of the enhancement is \u201cinherently unfair and unjust\u201d because Gaston\u2019s attorney behaved unethically in obtaining the affidavit. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>find this claim without merit. The attorney\u2019s behavior aside, Clark made a knowingly false statement that he believed would be presented in state court to obtain Gaston\u2019s release from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Accordingly, we find that the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Clark\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. His sentence is therefore affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-22\">.
