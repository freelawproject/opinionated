June 11, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 927 190 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 15, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) <em>(per curiam). </em>The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Chen brought a so-called \u201cother resistance\u201d claim for asylum and withholding of removal. To succeed, he needed to demonstrate that: (1) he engaged in \u201cresistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy; and (2) he suffered harm rising to the level of persecution or had a well-founded fear or likelihood of suffering such harm as a direct result of that resistance. <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 313 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b); <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520, 523 (A.G.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">In the main, Chen challenges the agency\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution. He contends that the combination of his wife\u2019s abortion and sterilization (which traumatized him), the destruction of their home, and the fines imposed on them together rose to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">\u201c[P]ersecution is the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cSuch a definition is sufficiently general to encompass \u2018a variety of forms of adverse treatment, including non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse, or non-physical forms of harm such as the deliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Ivanishvili, </em>433 F.3d at 341). For economic harm to constitute persecution, the harm must be \u201csevere,\u201d but an applicant \u201cneed not demonstrate a total deprivation of livelihood or a total withdrawal of all economic opportunity in order to demonstrate harm amounting to persecution.\u201d <em>Matter of T-Z- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 170-73 (BIA 2007); <em>see also Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir.2002) (requiring an applicant to present testimony or evidence of his financial situation in order to show \u201cthat he suffered a deliberate imposition of substantial economic disadvantage.\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">The agency reasonably concluded that the cumulative harm Chen suffered did not amount to persecution. As the BIA pointed out, Chen has paid all but $1,000 of the fines; and as the IJ pointed out, Chen is \u201cin a position now\u201d to clear that debt. Chen testified that he has owed the fine for more than ten years; that he repaid much of it with loans from neighbors; that he currently earns between $6,000 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>$7,000 per year in the United States; and that he incurred a $50,000 debt to emigrate here (of which $20,000 remains). Plainly, the fine is a disadvantage (as all fines are); but Chen failed to identify any specific, substantial disadvantage that he has suffered as a result. <em>See Matter of T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 170-73; <em>see also Guan Shan Liao, </em>293 F.3d at 70. And while his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization was not irrelevant to the analysis, <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313, the combination of it and the fines would not compel a finding of persecution, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">On appeal, the parties spar over the meaning of this Court\u2019s per curiam decision in <em>Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, </em>which addressed a claim of past persecution based on \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy. In that case, Jian Qiu Liu testified when he and his wife failed to produce a birth permit, family planning officials</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">demanded that Liu\u2019s wife be taken so that a forced abortion could be performed. As Liu\u2019s wife was being \u2018dragged\u2019 away, Liu pleaded for the officials to stop. Liu then tried to physically stop them. One of the officials slapped Liu, but Liu continued to struggle. At this point, several of the officials surrounded Liu and punched him repeatedly in the face, chest, and back. The police were later called \u2014 after the family planning officials took Liu\u2019s wife away in order to perform an abortion\u2014 and Liu spent two days in custody for violating China\u2019s family planning policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">632 F.3d 820, 821 (2d Cir.2011). The IJ deemed this to be past persecution and granted asylum. The BIA reversed. This Court denied Liu\u2019s petition for review, observing that <em>\u201cprior </em>to his arrest and detention by local police, [Liu] suffered only minor bruising from an altercation with family planning officials, which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Chen reads our decision in <em>Liu </em>to measure past persecution based solely on what transpired before Liu was imprisoned. So, in Chen\u2019s case, the agency should have compared his suffering to the \u201cminor bruising\u201d that resulted from Liu\u2019s single altercation with family planning officials. That analysis would lead to the inexorable conclusion that \u201cthe economic, emotional and psychological harm\u201d he suffered was \u201csubstantially worse than any minor bruises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>Liu </em>does not call for such mathematical parsing of the timeline. To the contrary, like Chen, Liu argued that the agency failed \u201cto analyze whether the beating occurred in the context of his arrest,\u201d that is, whether the cumulative harm constituted persecution. <em>Liu, </em>632 F.3d at 822. The Court admonished that \u201ca beating that occurs in the context of an arrest or detention may constitute persecution,\u201d and the agency must be \u201ckeenly sensitive\u201d to that possibility. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beskovic, </em>467 F.3d at 226). Here, the agency correctly distinguished <em>Liu: </em>Chen had no altercation with family planning officials. In fact, he had few interactions with them at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">In her oral decision, the IJ explained that while she found Chen\u2019s testimony to be credible, she found one aspect of it implausible: his prediction that family planning officials will sterilize him if he fails to repay the fine. The IJ reasoned that Chen\u2019s wife has been sterilized already, and so there is no reason for officials to mete out \u201csuch a severe penalty as sterilization\u201d on Chen. Chen labels this finding \u201cextremely naive\u201d in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201chorror stories stemming from the family planning authorities\u2019 draconian regime.\u201d However, the 2007 State Department profile on China, which Chen admitted into evidence, states that Fujianese family planning officials deny that parents can be sterilized if they are unable or refuse to pay birth control fines, and that they have permitted couples to make installment payments. The State Department acknowledges media reports of people being punished for failing to pay fines, but notes that such e\u00e1ses have not been independently verified. This constitutes substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Chen failed to satisfy his burden of showing an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The BIA\u2019s decision assumed, without finding, that Chen engaged in \u201cresistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy. So we do not reach the issue of whether Chen did, in fact, resist the family planning policy. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Having reasonably found that Chen failed to establish the objective likelihood of persecution necessary for asylum, the agency did not err in denying withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, because these claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
