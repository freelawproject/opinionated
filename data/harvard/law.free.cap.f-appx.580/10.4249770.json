Nathan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b37-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">In 2005, Delphi Corporation (\u201cDelphi\u201d), now reorganized as DPH Holdings Corporation, filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. During those proceedings, Plaintiffs-Appellees ACE American Insurance Company and Pacific Employers Insurance Company (collectively, \u201cthe Insurers\u201d) initiated this adversary action seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration that their insurance policies with Delphi do not obligate them to assume Delphi\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation liabilities arising from the company\u2019s self-insured entities in Michigan. After this Court affirmed the denial of a motion to dismiss, <em>In re DPH Holdings Corp., </em>448 Fed.Appx. 134 (2d Cir. 2011), Defendants-Appellants State of Michigan Funds Administration and State of Michigan Workers\u2019 Compensation Agency (collectively, \u201cMichigan Defendants\u201d) answered the Insurers\u2019 complaint and the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court (Drain, <em>J.) </em>granted summary judgment to the Insurers and entered a final judgment in their favor. On August 1, 2013 the district court (Engelmayer, <em>J.) </em>affirmed that deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sion. This appeal followed. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The Michigan Defendants first challenge the bankruptcy court and district court decisions that pursuant to the plain terms of the Insurers\u2019 contracts with Delphi, these contracts do not provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Delphi or its self-insured subsidiaries in Michigan. \u201cOn appeal from the district court\u2019s review of a bankruptcy court decision, \u2018we review the bankruptcy court decision independently, accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous but reviewing its conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d In re Baker, </em>604 F.3d 727, 729 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>In re Enron Corp., </em>419 F.3d 115, 124 (2d Cir.2005)). Because the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure import the summary judgment standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7056, summary judgment is only appropriate if, \u201cafter construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, ... \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silverman v. Teamsters Local 210 Affiliated Health &amp; Ins. Fund, </em>761 F.3d 277, 284 (2d Cir.2014) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We agree with the bankruptcy court that, by their plain meaning, the Insurers\u2019 contracts do not cover Delphi or its self-insured subsidiaries in Michigan. The \u201ccardinal rule\u201d of Michigan contract law \u201cis to ascertain the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>City of Grosse Pointe Park v. Mich. Mun. Liab. &amp; Prop. Pool, </em>473 Mich. 188, 197, 702 N.W.2d 106 (2005). When the terms of a contract are unambiguous, the contract is \u201cnot open to judicial construction and must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Rory v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>473 Mich. 457, 468, 703 N.W.2d 23 (2005). <em>See also Shay v. Aldrich, </em>487 Mich. 648, 650, 790 N.W.2d 629 (2010). In general, \u201c[ijnsurance policies are contracts and ... are subject to the same contract construction principles that apply to any other species of contract.\u201d <em>Titan Ins. Co. v. Hyten, </em>491 Mich. 547, 554, 817 N.W.2d 562 (2012) (citation omitted). But \u201cwhen a provision in an insurance policy is mandated by statute, the rights and limitations of the coverage are governed by that statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Michigan Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act, \u201c[ejvery contract for insurance ... shall be subject to the provisions of this act and provisions inconsistent with this act are void.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 418.621(1). <em>See also New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Moss, </em>312 Mich. 459, 472, 20 N.W.2d 272 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The Insurers\u2019 contracts with Delphi between 2000 and 2008 unambiguously limit coverage in Michigan to identified Delphi entities that were not self-insured in the state. While these multi-state contracts consistently list Delphi as \u201cthe insured\u201d or the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d each state \u2014 including Michigan \u2014 has a separate section that identifies particular Delphi entities as the insured parties and estimates insurance premiums based on those entities. Each Michigan-specific section identifies only Delphi entities that lacked self-insurance in the state. Every contract also contains an explicit provision stating that the insurance policies cover all workplaces in states that have separate information pages \u201cunless you have other insurance or are self-insured for such workplaces.\u201d J.A. 644. The contracts between 2003 and 2008 even have an \u201cexclusion endorsement\u201d that denies coverage to entities in Michigan that are covered by separate excess policies issued to Delphi\u2019s self-insured entities. J.A. 3154. The general references to Delphi do not override <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the clear intent of these Michigan-specific sections and additional exclusions. <em>See Kmart Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>88 F.Supp.2d 767, 774 (E.D.Mich.2000) (\u201cMichigan law requires that where a specific contract clause is at odds with a general contract clause, the more specific clause will control.\u201d); <em>Klapp v. United Ins. Grp. Agency, Inc., </em>468 Mich. 459, 468, 668 N.W.2d 447 (2003) (noting that courts should \u201cavoid an interpretation that would render any part of the contract surplusage or nugatory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We reject the Michigan Defendants\u2019 argument that the inclusion of the \u201cMichigan Endorsement\u201d in every contract overrides this clear and unambiguous language and extends coverage to all of Delphi\u2019s Michigan entities. By its terms, the \u201cMichigan Endorsement\u201d applies only to the \u201cinsured employer.\u201d <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 418.621(4). In context, the plain meaning of \u201cinsured employer\u201d in these contracts is limited to those entities covered in the policies. Each contract states that the Endorsement applies \u201conly to the insurance provided by the policy.\u201d J.A. 2748. As previously discussed, the policies cover particular Delphi entities in Michigan that lack self-insurance, not all of Delphi\u2019s Michigan entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Nothing in the Michigan Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act is contrary to the contractual provisions that state the parties\u2019 agreement as to which Delphi-related entities are provided coverage under the contracts, nor does the Act render the parties\u2019 intent on this issue irrelevant. The Insurers are not obligated to cover Delphi\u2019s self-insured entities under Michigan law, <em>see </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 418.621(2), and the contracts here do not provide coverage to these entities. As a result, the Insurers \u201conly ask[ ] that [the court] not impose upon [them] obligations which [they] never contracted to assume and which are not mandated by the statute.\u201d <em>McQueen v. Great Markwestern Packing Co., </em>402 Mich. 321, 334, 262 N.W.2d 820 (1978). Because of that, and for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, these insurance contracts neither conflict with the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act nor upset Michigan\u2019s system of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The Michigan Defendants next contend that the Insurers\u2019 suit violates its sovereign immunity. We find this argument unpersuasive. This Court has already decided that, \u201c[s]inee the adversary proceeding here is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding (or, at least, is otherwise necessary to effectuate the <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court), it does not offend the Michigan Defendants\u2019 sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>In re DPH Holdings Corp., </em>448 Fed.Appx. at 137 (citing <em>Cent. Va. Comm. Coll. v. Katz, </em>546 U.S. 356, 377, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006)). The Michigan Defendants have not raised any arguments that warrant reconsidering that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Finally, we reject the Michigan Defendants\u2019 argument that the district court should have abstained from affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision as a matter of permissive abstention under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1) or mandatory abstention pursuant to <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co., </em>319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943). First, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s permissive abstention decision. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(d). Second, we detect no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision that <em>Burford </em>does not require abstention in this case. <em>See Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, </em>380 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">We have reviewed Appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
