The district court held that federal and state anti-discrimination laws did not apply extraterritorially and dismissed the remaining breach of contract claim under the theory of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-24\">In a thorough and well-reasoned Memorandum Opinion, Judge Cooper explained why she was granting summary judgment on Archut\u2019s federal and state anti-discrimination claims. <em>See Archut v. Ross Univ. Sch. of Veterinary Med., </em>No. 10-1681 (MLC), 2012 WL 5867148 (D.N.J. Nov. 19, 2012). The court explained its conclusion that the statutes those claims are based upon do not apply extraterritorially, and we can add little to that court\u2019s analysis and discussion. <em>See Morrison v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>National Australia Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 2878, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010) (determining that absent, a \u201cclear indication of an exterritorial application, [the statute] has none.\u201d). Accordingly, we will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the aforementioned Memorandum Opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Judge Cooper also carefully and completely explained her reasons for granting Ross\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining breach of contract claim on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens. See Archut v. Ross Univ. Sch. of Veterinary Med., </em>No. 10-1681(MLC), 2013 WL 5913675 (D.N.J. Oct. 31, 2013). In her thorough opinion, Judge Cooper explained that she was dismissing the contract claim because it arises from conduct that occurred in St. Kitts. As the judge explained, St. Kitts is therefore the appropriate forum to litigate the alleged contract breach. Since \u201cthe law of St. Kitts likely governs the dispute, trial of the case in a St. Kitts forum will be much easier and expeditious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *15. Accordingly, we will affirm \u2022 the district court substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order without further elaboration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-16\">.
