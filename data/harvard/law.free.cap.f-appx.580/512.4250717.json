His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging an appeal waiver in the plea agreement, and questioning the reasonableness of King\u2019s sentence. In addition, counsel seeks leave to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-24\">After careful de novo review, we enforce the appeal waiver. See <em>United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (standard for enforcing appeal waivers); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>627 F.3d 702, 704 (8th Cir.2010) (standard of review). First, we conclude that counsel\u2019s challenge to King\u2019s sentence falls within the scope of the appeal waiver. Second, based on King\u2019s statements under oath at the plea hearing, we are satisfied that he entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See Nguyen v. United States, </em>114 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>699, 703 (8th Cir.1997). Third, we conclude that no miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 891-92. Finally, having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues outside the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-27\">. The Honorable David S.
