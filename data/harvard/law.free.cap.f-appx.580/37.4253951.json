POOLER, REENA RAGGI, and PETER W. HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b63-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b63-19\">Emerson Haynes, pro se, appeals a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Skretny, <em>C.J.) </em>entered on September 6, 2011, following a jury verdict, convicting him of unlawful use of premises for the purpose of manufacturing and distributing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-20\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly denied Haynes\u2019s pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the indictment and to suppress evidence. Haynes based his motions on unsupported allegations that the grand jury considered improper evidence, the prosecution was vindictive, the Government\u2019s conduct was \u201coutrageous,\u201d and his speedy trial rights were violated. We further conclude that Haynes was not denied his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to challenge the validity of the search warrant. The October 19, 2009 report and recommendation of the magistrate judge reflects that his challenge to the warrant was considered and rejected. We also find no support in the record for Haynes\u2019s contentions that the district court acted as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the Government, or that the court colluded with the Government and standby counsel to violate his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">With respect to Haynes\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, those claims should be made in the first instance to the district court. <em>See United States v. Matos, </em>905 F.2d 30, 32 (2d Cir.1990). This Court prefers to hear ineffective assistance claims on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>365 F.3d 150, 152 (2d Cir. 2004). Although we may decide such claims on direct appeal when their resolution is \u201cbeyond any doubt\u201d or in the interest of justice, Haynes has not made such a showing. Matos, 905 F.2d at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We have considered Haynes\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
