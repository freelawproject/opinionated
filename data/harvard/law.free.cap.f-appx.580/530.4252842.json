Febach appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for disability insurance benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(1) The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) provided \u201cpersuasive, specific, valid\u201d reasons for giving limited weight to the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) determination that Febach has a 20% disability rating for depression. <em>McCartey v. Massanari, </em>298 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). Although Febach was diagnosed with depression, that diagnosis alone is insufficient for finding a \u201csevere\u201d impairment, as required by the social security regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). There was sufficient evidence in the record for the ALJ to conclude that Febach\u2019s depression is not \u201csevere,\u201d including reports by at least three of Febach\u2019s physicians suggesting that his impairment is \u201cnon-severe!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">(2) Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Most notably, the fact that Febach spent ninety days bow hunting in the year prior to his ALJ hearing supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Febach\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [his] symptoms are not credible.\u201d Febach testified that the bulk of his camping days were spent driving or resting in the camper, and that he used a modified bow on account of his inability to lift a standard one. But Febach\u2019s hunting activities could also reasonably suggest that he has the ability and motivation to plan and execute a lengthy excursion in a remote location; sit in a car and drive some distance; stand for substantial periods; and lift objects necessary for camping by oneself. These activities support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion regarding Febach\u2019s credibility as to the functional limitations caused by his physical injuries, chronic pain, and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201cWhen evidence reasonably supports either confirming or reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore affirm the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">(3) In light of the adverse credibility determination and the medical evidence, the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination was not in error. Febach contends that the ALJ erred by not including in the residual functional capacity determination the effects of Febach\u2019s chronic pain and depression, in particular his alleged inability to consistently show up for work. Although there was medical evidence demonstrating that Febach suffered from both chronic pain and depression, the ALJ\u2019s reasonable adverse credibility determination provided \u201cclear or convincing reasons for rejecting [Febach\u2019s] claims,\u201d <em>Gallant v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1450, 1456 (9th Cir. 1984), as to the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of his symptoms, including his inability to show up for work regularly. Therefore, the ALJ did not err in failing to incorporate those limitations into the residual functional capacity determination, or in failing to consider the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that a person who could not attend work regularly would not be able to find substantial gainful employment in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
