We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on omissions in Cao\u2019s asylum application and written statement and inconsistencies in his testimony regarding a police beating, a requirement to report to the police once a month, going into hiding, and applying for a marriage permit. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011) (omitted incidents of arrest and mistreatment supported adverse credibility finding); <em>Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (totality of the circumstances supported adverse credibility determination). In the absence of credible testimony, Cao\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Because Cao\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the BIA found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
