June 12, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A093 409 915 (Immig. Ct. New York City Mar. 16, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-25\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>Pretermission of Asylum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). However, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Here, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s pretermission of asylum because Diallo merely \u201cquarrels over the correctness of the [agency\u2019s] factual finding[ ]\u201d that he did not return to Guinea in 2004 and reenter the United States in 2007. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Dial-lo contends that the agency erred by finding his witness credible but concluding that the witness\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish the timeliness of his application. However, as the IJ explained, the witness did not have any firsthand knowledge of Diallo\u2019s whereabouts' between 2004 and 2007. Diallo\u2019s assertion that the IJ held him to an overly stringent burden by requiring an eye witnesses to establish his return to Guinea and reentry to the United States is incorrect. The IJ did not pretermit Diallo\u2019s asylum application because he did not produce an eye witness; she found that Diallo failed to establish the timeliness of his application because he testified inconsistently about whether his passport was stamped when he returned to Guinea and offered no tickets, boarding passes, stamps in his passport, or airline confirmations to establish that he ever flew back as he testified that he did. Diallo has waived review of these findings by failing to contest them in this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Dial-lo\u2019s suggestion that the agency erred by assessing the credibly of his testimony, in determining whether that testimony constituted clear and convincing evidence, is unsupported and clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\n<em>Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">For applications such as Diallo\u2019s, which are governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may base a credibility finding on an applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u201cWe defer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Diallo\u2019s criticism of the BIA for failing to explicitly discuss the underlying bases for the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is misplaced; the BIA did not explicitly discuss the underlying bases because Dial-lo did not challenge them on appeal. In addition to the statutory, jurisdictional requirement that petitioners exhaust each category of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), petitioners must raise specific issues with the BIA before raising them in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 77-78 (2d Cir.2004). Issue exhaustion is mandatory: \u201cIf[, as here,] the government points out to the appeals court that an issue relied on before that court by a petitioner was not properly raised below, the court must decline to consider that issue, except in [] extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007). We therefore decline to consider Diallo\u2019s unexhausted challenges to the \u201cfindings that informed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\n<em>CAT Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Lastly, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of CAT relief because Diablo did not contest it before the BIA. In contrast to issue exhaustion, the failure to contest the denial of a category of relief is a jurisdictional defect. <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cThe failure to seek review of the CAT claim deprives us of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part, insofar as it challenges the pretermission of asylum and denial of CAT relief, and DENIED in part, as it relates to the denial of withholding of removal. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
