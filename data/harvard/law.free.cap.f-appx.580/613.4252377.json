Bennett, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b639-26\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-27\">A jury convicted appellant Carlos Rodriguez of conspiracy to distribute at least five-hundred grams of methamphetamine mixture or at least fifty grams of pure methamphetamine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). After we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>versed the jury\u2019s methamphetamine quantity finding, <em>United States v. Maciel, </em>461 Fed.Appx. 610, 615-16 (9th Cir.2011), the district court made the quantity determination anew and found Rodriguez responsible for approximately seventy grams of methamphetamine mixture with a purity of forty-two percent. That finding put Rodriguez at base offense level twenty-eight and a Sentencing Guidelines range of 140 to 175 months. Taking into account Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history and the danger he posed to the community, the district court sentenced Rodriguez to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Rodriguez now asks us (1) to vacate and remand his sentence because the district court\u2019s quantity determination was clearly erroneous, and (2) to strike the condition of his supervised release forbidding him from associating with \u201cpersons associated with the F-13 gang\u201d as unconstitutionally vague. We affirm Rodriguez\u2019s sentence, but remand to the district court to strike the clause \u201cor persons associated with the F-13 gang\u201d from Rodriguez\u2019s conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The government concedes that the clause \u201cor persons associated with the F-13 gang\u201d in Rodriguez\u2019s conditions of supervised release is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>626 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.201(j). On remand, the district court shall revise condition nine accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s thoughtful and careful use of comparator evidence seized from Rodriguez\u2019s suppliers to calculate the purity and thus the quantity of the methamphetamine involved in the conspiracy possessed \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Forrester, </em>616 F.3d 929, 949 (9th Cir.2010); <em>accord United States v. Lopes-Montes, </em>165 F.3d 730, 731-32 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, the district court exercised appropriate caution and gave the defendant the benefit of the doubt in using forty-two percent purity instead of ninety-eight percent \u2014 as urged by the government \u2014 as a starting point. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b639-28\"> jyg disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
