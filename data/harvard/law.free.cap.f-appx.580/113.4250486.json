The Government appeals, arguing that Salinas\u2019s conviction is subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum. We agree, and will vacate Salinas\u2019s judgment of sentence and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Salinas was arrested as part of a DEA investigation into Pittsburgh-area cocaine distribution and charged, alongside eleven co-defendants, with one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. In August 2013, Salinas pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which the Government agreed to recommend a sentence below the 120-month mandatory minimum, provided the conditions in the federal sentencing \u201csafety valve,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), were satisfied. The plea agreement made clear that Salinas would not qualify for the safety valve if he had more than 1 criminal history point under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Following Salinas\u2019s guilty plea, the U.S. Probation Office prepared a presentence investigation report (PSR), in which it determined Salinas had 4 criminal history points: 1 point from a 2009 North Carolina guilty plea for driving while impaired and 3 points from a 2000 Pennsylvania guilty plea for stalking and harassment. Neither Salinas nor the Government objected to the PSR. Salinas later filed a sentencing memorandum stating that at the time he pleaded guilty, both his counsel and the Government assumed he would be eligible for the safety valve. However, by the time of sentencing, Salinas was no longer under that impression: in his memo, he acknowledged that the stalking conviction \u201cmay disqualify\u201d him from safety valve eligibility and subject him to the mandatory minimum. A49. Despite this, he did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea. Rather, he asked the District Court and the Government to \u201cfind a way to do justice in this case,\u201d which \u201cwould include avoidance of the 10 year mandatory imprisonment.\u201d A49. Specifically, he argued that the stalking conviction \u201cshould be treated as \u2018stale\u2019 and therefore not count against\u201d him for sentencing purposes. A49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">At sentencing, the District Court determined that Salinas\u2019s total offense level was 29 and his criminal history category was III, resulting in a Guidelines range of 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. Counsel for both parties informed the Court that they initially thought the safety valve would apply. Candidly admitting that he was \u201chollering against the wind\u201d in light of the mandatory minimum, defense counsel asked the Court to nonetheless consider a 70-to 87-month sentence \u2014 Salinas\u2019s Guidelines range without the stalking conviction \u2014 because \u201c[t]en years does not do justice.\u201d A64-65. Government counsel also expressed reservations about the mandatory minimum, but noted that his hands were tied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">I don\u2019t have the capacity to bargain away what the law is. We were under a misapprehension ... that the record would yield a criminal history category of I. Once it became apparent that that was not the case, my ability to do anything about that evaporated. And I feel badly that that\u2019s the case, but that is the case, and as a matter of law, I simply don\u2019t have the power to engage in the agreement that we initially started down the road to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">A65.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">The District Court proceeded to discount the stalking conviction, noting that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>was 14 years old and saying, \u201cI am going to vary on this thing based on what I see as [Salinas\u2019s] performance to date,\u201d including his work record and family situation. A66-67. Government counsel explained to the Court that he had explored other sentencing possibilities with his supervisors, but had been \u201cgiven [his] marching orders\u201d and had been told to appeal \u201canything other than the mandatory sentence.\u201d A67. \u201cWell, so be it, and someone else down the road will see if I\u2019m wrong if this doesn\u2019t sound right to the powers that be,\u201d the District Court replied. A67-68. The Court then imposed a 72-month sentence, calling it \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the intention of the guidelines and of the sentencing code and the background of the Defendant.\u201d A70. As expected, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Even in the <em>post-Booker </em>era of advisory Guidelines and considerable sentencing discretion, we are constrained by the will of Congress, which \u201cour Constitution entrusts ... with the power to define crimes and set punishment for those crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>682 F.3d 244, 260 (3d Cir.2012) (citing <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 82, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955)). Indeed, \u201cCongress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). Although our role is always to do justice, we do not have unlimited latitude; \u201c[o]urs is a nation of laws, not judges.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>638 F.3d 233, 247 (3d Cir.2011). Subject to the limits of the Constitution, we must uphold legislative choices on criminal punishment, \u201cmade as they are by our elected representatives.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>682 F.3d at 260. This is so regardless of whether we personally agree with those choices. \u201cSentencing is one of the most difficult tasks a district court judge must perform,\u201d especially \u201cwhen a judge believes that the punishment mandated by Congress is not a just and proportional sanction for the conduct involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[t]o the extent that the District Court was dissatisfied with this state of affairs, the remedy lies with Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we note that in recent years Congress has acted to reduce mandatory minimums for some drug offenses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sava-ni, </em>733 F.3d 56, 60 (3d Cir.2013) (describing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">As the law now stands, however, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) states that a defendant convicted of trafficking 5 kilograms or more of cocaine <em>shall </em>be sentenced to at least 10 years\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 a punishment reflecting Congress\u2019s view on the seriousness of the crime. A district court cannot impose a sentence below that minimum unless the Government files a substantial assistance motion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or the defendant qualifies for the safety valve, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). It is undisputed that neither happened here. Therefore, the 10-year mandatory minimum applies to Salinas\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">For the reasons stated, we will vacate Salinas\u2019s judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. This reflects a statutory requirement: a defendant with \"more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines,\u201d is ineligible for safety valve relief. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
