Nix appeals the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>petition for redetermination of his tax deficiency for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>tax year 2008. Mr. Nix admitted at trial that he worked and received compensation in 2008. The Internal Revenue Service presented evidence documenting Mr. Nix\u2019s compensation from T-Mobile USA and a dividend that he received from AT &amp; T. The Tax Court determined that he was liable for federal income tax deficiencies and various penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Nonetheless, Mr. Nix argues that he was not required to pay federal income taxes in 2008 because he believes the relevant statutes and regulations exclude him from any such legal duty. Mr. Nix previously raised many of the same meritless and frivolous arguments that he raises here during the appeal of his tax deficiency for tax years 2003 and 2004. <em>See Nix v. Comm\u2019r of IRS, </em>553 Fed.Appx. 960, 961 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2014). We affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s ruling in that case and held that Mr. Nix\u2019s statutory interpretation arguments to the contrary were unavailing. They remain unavailing today. To the extent that Mr. Nix raises additional statutory interpretation arguments \u2014 e.g., that Forms W-2 or 1099 cannot serve as evidence of a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income\u2014 they similarly lack legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Because Mr. Nix has not challenged the computation of his income or the deficiencies and penalties levied against him, nor offered any credible evidence to contradict the Tax Court\u2019s findings, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
