Robinson now claims error in the district court\u2019s <em>in li-mine </em>determination that, should he testify, his prior conviction for conspiracy to commit murder would likely be admissible to impeach his credibility. Robinson argues that, in light of the district court\u2019s application of the wrong balancing test, he was unconstitutionally forced to choose between exercising his right to testify and receiving a fair trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-24\">First, because Robinson declined to testify, we conclude that he has forfeited the issues he raises on appeal. <em>See Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 41-43, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984); <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 970-71 (4th Cir.1996). Lest the exception swallow the rule, we must reject Robinson\u2019s attempt to evade his forfeiture by asserting an infringement of his constitutional rights. <em>See United States v. Gunter, </em>551 F.3d 472, 483-84 (6th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Schrader, </em>10 F.3d 1345 (8th Cir.1993). Moreover, were we to consider Robinson\u2019s claim of evidentiary error on its face, our review would be hampered by the same hurdles the Supreme Court identified in <em>Luce. Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41-42, 105 S.Ct. 460. Finally, the record belies Robinson\u2019s suggestion that the district court rendered a definitive, and thus reviewable, decision on his murder conviction\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
