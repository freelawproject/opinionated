Because we are bound by opinions of earlier panels, <em>see Gaitan v. Holder, </em>671 F.3d 678, 681 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 526, 184 L.Ed.2d 339 (2012), we are foreclosed from reconsidering this Court\u2019s determination that the group Mendoza-Mejia proposed is not cognizable as a particular social group for purposes of withholding of removal, <em>see De Castro-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>713 F.3d 375, 380 (8th Cir.2013) (explaining that to qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that his life or freedom will be threatened in the country to which he is being removed because of, among other things, his membership in a particular social group). The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
