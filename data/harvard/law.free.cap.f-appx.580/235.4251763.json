(Count 8s). Horne was sentenced to a total of 188 months of imprisonment, consisting of a 128-month sentence for Count Is and a sixty-month consecutive sentence for Count 8s. On appeal, Horne alleges that the district court erred by disqualifying one of his retained attorneys. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">Horne was represented in the district court by Kenneth W. Ravenell and Cre-st\u00f3n Smith, until Ravenell was disqualified due to a conflict of interest. Both attorneys were privately retained. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to disqualify Ravenell. <em>See United States v. Urutyan, </em>564 F.3d 679, 686 (4th Cir.2009) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-20\">A defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice is not absolute. <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to choose one\u2019s own counsel is circumscribed in several important respects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Importantly, a defendant\u2019s choice of counsel can be overcome by a showing of a conflict or a serious potential for conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692. This is because \u201c \u2018the essential aim of the Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Uru-tyan, </em>564 F.3d at 686 (quoting <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692). On this record we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in ruling on this issue and thus we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-21\">We also deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based on Horne\u2019s appellate waiver. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
