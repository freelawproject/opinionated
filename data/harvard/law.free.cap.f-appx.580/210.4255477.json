He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that the district court entered an order on June 30, 2014, granting in part Carrington\u2019s motion. Accordingly, because the district court has recently acted on Carrington\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
