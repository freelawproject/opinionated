We granted a certificate of ap-pealability as to \u201cwhether the trial court\u2019s admission of appellant\u2019s statements violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>affirm the thorough and well-reasoned decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">1. The state court\u2019s conclusion that Marentes\u2019 unwarned statements were voluntary is not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Like the district court, we have reviewed the videotape of the interrogation in question. At a minimum, fairminded jurists could disagree as to whether Marentes\u2019 will was overborne by the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of his confession. <em>See Dickerson v. United States, </em>580 U.S. 428, 434, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000); <em>Withrow v. Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 693-94, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (identifying potentially relevant circumstances). Although the detectives employed tactics such as appealing to his conscience and minimizing the moral seriousness of the offense, Marentes does not identify how these tactics, separately or taken as a whole, amounted to impermissible police coercion in these circumstances. <em>See Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 387, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (\u201c[E]ven where interrogations of greater duration [than three hours] were held to be improper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by other facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated and sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and threats.\u201d); <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986) (\u201c[C]oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d). The detectives made no impermissible threats or promises of leniency. Marentes became emotional and upset at times, but he otherwise appeared alert, responsive and coherent throughout his encounter with the detectives, despite his relative youth. <em>Cf. Doody v. Ryan, </em>649 F.3d 986, 1009-13 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">2. Even if Marentes was in custody before the detectives provided him with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, thus requiring suppression of his <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements, he has not demonstrated that the admission of his prewarning statements at trial had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309-12, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). Although the entire videotaped confession may have had a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on Marentes\u2019 defense, <em>Rice v. Wood, </em>77 F.3d 1138, 1142 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc), his far more damaging statements came after he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Those postwarning statements were admissible, and Marentes fails to demonstrate how exclusion of only his prewarning statements would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">3. The state court reasonably applied clearly established federal law in determining that Marentes\u2019 postwarning statements were admissible because they were voluntary and not obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>or its progeny. As the Supreme Court clarified after the district court issued its decision, clearly established federal law encompasses only the holdings of the Supreme Court <em>\u201cas of \u2018the time the state court renders its decision.\u2019 \u201d Greene v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 38, 44, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011) (quoting <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1399, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011)). Here, <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), is the clearly established law of relevance, because <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>not yet been decided when the state court issued its decision. <em>See Thompson v. Runnels, </em>705 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Because all of Marentes\u2019 prewarning statements were voluntary and not the product of police coercion (whether or not obtained in violation of <em>Miranda), </em>his \u201cpostwarning confession [was] admissible unless it was involuntarily made, despite the <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 2006). The state court reasonably determined that Marentes\u2019 postwarning statements were voluntary based on \u201cthe surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to [Marentes].\u201d <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285. After a break, the detectives read Marentes his <em>Miranda </em>rights; Mar-entes indicated that he understood these rights and affirmatively agreed to continue answering the detectives\u2019 questions. <em>See Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986); <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (holding that a defendant\u2019s decision to continue speaking after being informed of his rights is \u201chighly probative\u201d of the voluntariness of his subsequent statements). Throughout the balance of the interrogation, Mar-entes remained responsive and conversational with the detectives, who employed similar techniques to those used during the prewarning interrogation. The state court reasonably determined that these techniques were not unduly coercive and that Marentes\u2019 will was not overborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
