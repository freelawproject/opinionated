In the factual basis supporting the plea agreement, Farahi admitted that he had lied to Newpoint investors about the type and risk level of the instruments he bought with the investors\u2019 money, and that for years he sold unregistered securities to investors without disclosing that he knew he was violating SEC regulations. In addition, there is substantial evidence of the breadth and duration of Farahi\u2019s fraudulent scheme in the record. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that over 80 Newpoint investors were victims of Farahi\u2019s criminal conduct and suffered losses of over $22 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(L), 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion when it declined to reduce the loss calculation by the amount of money Farahi returned to investors after his crimes were discovered. Application Note 3(E)(i) to section 2B1.1, on which the district court expressly relied, makes clear that only money returned <em>before </em>the defendant\u2019s offense is detected should be credited against the loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">2. Farahi admits that he knowingly lied to Sun West in order to convince the bank to renew his $2 million credit line. Given that: (1) Sun West had a system of annually approving such renewals, (2) Sun West relied on Farahi\u2019s misrepresentations in deciding to renew his line of credit, and (3) the loan would have been due on demand absent renewal, the district court didn\u2019t err in finding that Farahi derived more than $1 million from Sun West as a result of his criminal conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(15)(A) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">3. The factual basis of Farahi\u2019s plea makes clear that he advised investors as to the type and number of investment products to purchase, and he doesn\u2019t challenge the government\u2019s evidence that he was a broker registered with FINRA. The district court therefore had ample basis to apply a four-level enhancement for Far-ahi\u2019s status as an investment adviser and/or broker. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(18)(A) (2012); <em>see also id., </em>Application Note 14(A); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b2(a)(ll); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(48).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">4. The record indicates the district court may have failed to include in its Guidelines calculation the one-level downward departure it granted pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. But the court went on to give Farahi a sentence that was far below the Guidelines range for an offense level of either 37 or 38, so any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Waknine, </em>543 F.3d 546, 553-54 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">5. The district court expressly considered the factors it\u2019s required to under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and gave detailed consideration to Farahi\u2019s character, community participation and lack of criminal history. The court cited these mitigating factors as reasons for providing a sentence that was substantially below that which the Guidelines prescribed. Thus, the court fulfilled its obligation under section 3553(a), and did not commit a \u201cclear error of judgment in the conclusion it page 4 reached upon weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Ressam, </em>679 F.3d 1069, 1087 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">6. The district court didn\u2019t err in ordering $24,366,617.11 in restitution. The financial investigator\u2019s report on loan fraud losses and the Receiver\u2019s report on the amount still due to investors support this figure. Farahi\u2019s argument that the award should be decreased as the Receiver distributes funds is premature, as such a reduction \u201conly comes into play after the district court has already ordered restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tion in the full amount of the victim\u2019s loss.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bright, </em>358 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
