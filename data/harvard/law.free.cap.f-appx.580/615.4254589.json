We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on findings that it was implausible Chen did not know or remember the names of the other church members who were beaten, the omission from her declaration of the fact that the police visited her home after she was released from detention, and the inconsistency between her testimony and the documentary evidence regarding when she was released from detention. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (adverse credibility determination was supported by the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d). The record does not compel acceptance of Chen\u2019s explanations. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). In the absence of credible testimony, petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Because petitioners\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, and they point to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not they will be tortured if returned to China, their CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
