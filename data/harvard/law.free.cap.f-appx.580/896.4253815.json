We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Marshall is a professed Buddhist and a Bureau inmate. RFRA prevents the Bureau from substantially burdening Marshall\u2019s exercise of religion except in the least restrictive furtherance of a compelling governmental interest. Exercise of religion includes dietary habits and restrictions. Once a prisoner satisfies his burden of producing evidence that the Bureau is burdening his sincere exercise of religion, the Bureau must persuade the court that it is doing so in the least restrictive furtherance of a compelling governmental interest. Failing the Bureau\u2019s discharge of that ultimate burden of proof, the prisoner is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Marshall failed to produce evidence that <em>Buddhism </em>required his dietary demands. He failed to produce evidence that the Bureau substantially burdened his exercise <em>of religion, </em>rather than his satisfaction of <em>personal </em>dietary preferences. Consequently, the Bureau was not required to prove ultimately that its undisputed dietary accommodations to Marshall served a compelling governmental interest in the least restrictive manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">. Marshall's <em>Bivens </em>claims under the First and Eighth Amendments, assuming he has stated any (the district court assumed he had not), rise and fall with his RFRA claim. Separately addressing them is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
