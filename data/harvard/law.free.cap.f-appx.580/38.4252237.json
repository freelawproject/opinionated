Time Warner Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). In addition, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was based on an interpretation of law, such as futility, in which case we review the legal conclusion <em>de novo.\u201d Panther Partners, Inc. v. Ika-nos Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2012). Finally, we review a district court\u2019s denial of reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., </em>642 F.3d 121, 125 (2d Cir.2011). A district court abuses its discretion when its decision: (1) rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding; or (2) cannot be found within the range of permissible decisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Leung and Jones correctly contend that the district court improperly dismissed their claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and then improperly denied reconsideration of this decision. Despite the fact that NYUMC only sought dismissal of these claims in part, the district court nevertheless dismissed these claims in their entirety, concluding that \u201cSection 1981 is not a substitute for an employment discrimination claim.\u201d We have previously noted our \u201cpuzzlement\u201d with this conclusion, <em>Leung v. New York Univ., </em>495 Fed.Appx. 124,125 n. 1 (2d Cir.2012), and we now hold that it was error. Congress \u201cintended \u00a7 1981 to apply to employment discrimination\u201d and Section 1981 \u201cprovid[es] a vehicle for every employee to remedy racial discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>in the workplace.\u201d <em>Lauture v. Int\u2019l Bus. Mach. Corp., </em>216 F.3d 258, 263, 264 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, despite the district court\u2019s concerns, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to point to a specific written contract outside of their employment relationship is not fatal to their claim. <em>See id. </em>at 260 (holding \u201cthat an at-will employee may sue under \u00a7 1981 for racially discriminatory termination.\u201d). In addition, \u201c42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 encompasses claims of retaliation.\u201d <em>CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, </em>553 U.S. 442, 457, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Therefore, we remand plaintiffs\u2019 discrimination and retaliation claims against NYUMC pursuant to Section 1981 to the district court. In its brief, NYUMC asserts additional reasons for the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1981 claims, or at least a portion of these claims. We decline to consider these arguments in the first instance and leave defining the contours of these Section 1981 claims to the district court on remand. On remand, the district court should also consider the liability of the individual defendants for these Section 1981 claims, a question it previously left unaddressed. See <em>Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, N.Y., </em>375 F.3d 206, 229 (2d Cir. 2004) (setting out the requirements for individual liability under Section 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 hostile work environment claims, we find that the district court appropriately denied and deemed futile plaintiffs\u2019 hostile work environment claims pursuant to Title VII and New York State Executive Law \u00a7 296. However, in dismissing the various hostile work environment claims in this case, the district court failed to independently address plaintiffs\u2019 hostile work environment claims pursuant to the Administrative Code of the City of New York, \u00a7 8-107.1(a) et seq. (the \u201cNYCHRL\u201d). Under the lower standard applicable to this provision, a \u201cplaintiff need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that [he] has been treated less well than other employees because of [his] [race].\u201d <em>Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., </em>715 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court never independently addressed plaintiffs\u2019 NYCHRL hostile work environment claims, we remand for then-consideration in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We have considered the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. To summarize, we: (1) vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal and finding of futility as to plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1981 claims for discrimination and retaliation against NYUMC, and remand for reconsideration of these claims against NYUMC and the individual defendants, and (2) vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 NYCHRL hostile work environment claims against NYUMC, and remand for consideration of these claims against NYUMC. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">. We note that the parties refer to the hospital center where Leung, Jones, and their coworkers were employed both as New York University Medical Center <em>and </em>NYU Hospital Center. Although both of these entities are separately identified in the case caption, we do not understand the parties to be drawing any distinction between the two. Therefore, we refer to the primary defendant in this case, alternatively named as New York University Medical Center and NYU Hospital Center, with the abbreviation \"NYUMC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-14\">. Plaintiffs-appellants also initially appealed the district court\u2019s May 10, 2013 order denying relief pursuant to Rule 60(b). A previous order in this case denied this portion of the appeal as moot. <em>See Leung v. New York Univ., </em>No. 13-2267, Dkt. No. 79 (2d Cir. Apr. 2, 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
