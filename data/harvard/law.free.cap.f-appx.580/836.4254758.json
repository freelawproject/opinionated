We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">On June 26, 2013, Sergeant (\u201cSgt.\u201d) Emanuel Prospere and Detective Roderick Passmore of the Miami Police Department were investigating the homicide of Duane Luscant, who had been killed on June 11. Luscant had been shot several times, and the murder weapon had not been recovered. Law enforcement had identified several suspects, including Samuel, because officers had obtained information that Luscant had received threatening text messages from Samuel concerning a narcotics transaction. The text messages stated Samuel \u201cwas going to do something to the victim.\u201d ROA at 177. Unidentified witnesses also had identified Samuel as having been involved in the Luscant homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Sgt. Prospere had known Samuel for approximately nine years, and he and Samuel \u201chave a history.\u201d ROA at 177. As a result of the investigation, Sgt. Prospere wanted to question Samuel about the homicide. At approximately 8:00 p.m. on June 26, 2013, Sgt. Prospere and Detective Passmore saw Samuel riding a bicycle. When he first saw Samuel on June 26, Sgt. Prospere was driving an unmarked car, traveling eastbound. Samuel was approximately 20 feet away, traveling westbound, and did not change direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">As Samuel approached the officers, Detective Passmore told Sgt. Prospere: \u201c[B]e careful, I noticed a bulge.\u201d ROA at 179. Sgt. Prospere exited his car and told Samuel he wanted to speak with him. Neither officer drew his weapon when exiting the car. Samuel dismounted his bicycle, and Sgt. Prospere \u201cgrabbed him by the rear of the shirt,\u201d to ensure the officers\u2019 safety and to prevent Samuel from running. ROA at 179. When Sgt. Prospere ordered Samuel to place his hands on the squad car, Samuel told Sgt. Prospere he had a gun in his pocket. Sgt. Prospere saw the gun and requested assistance over the radio. Another officer arrived and removed a loaded gun from Samuel\u2019s pocket. Neither Sgt. Prospere nor Detective Passmore asked Samuel any questions before he mentioned the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">The gun was loaded. The gun was a 9mm semi-automatic Ruger that had been manufactured in Arizona and had traveled in interstate commerce. Samuel had three prior Florida convictions for possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">A federal grand jury indicted Samuel for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Samuel moved to suppress a gun and ammunition seized from him during the June 26, 2013, traffic stop and any statements attributed to him on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">Sgt. Prospere testified to the above facts and testified Samuel was both a person of interest and a suspect in the homicide investigation. When asked to identify the source of the information regarding the text messages, Sgt. Prospere responded the investigation was still open, and the government stated it \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to put any of the witnesses in jeopardy.\u201d ROA at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>182. Sgt. Prospere testified the information about the threatening messages had been received on June 12, the day after the homicide. Various individuals also had identified Samuel on June 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Samuel called Detective Passmore, who testified he had been involved in the investigation into the Luscant homicide. During that investigation, he and Sgt. Prospere interviewed Michael Miller, whom officers had arrested for aggravated assault with a firearm. Miller said he was an associate of Samuel and told the officers where Samuel could be found. On the day the officers stopped Samuel, Detective Passmore had been in the passenger\u2019s seat of the car, when Samuel approached them on the driver\u2019s side. As the officers and Samuel approached each other, Detective Passmore warned Sgt. Prospere about a bulge in Samuel\u2019s waistband. Based on his experience, Detective Passmore believed the bulge, which was on the front right side of Samuel\u2019s pants, was a gun. Detective Passmore further testified, if he had not seen a bulge on Samuel, he still would have stopped Samuel to speak with him about the homicide. After finding the gun, the officers decided to take Samuel to the station for further questioning, instead of discussing the homicide on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">During cross-examination by the government, Detective Passmore testified Michael Miller did not tell officers Samuel was involved in the homicide. On June 26, Miller told officers Samuel was part of a group of people with whom the homicide victim \u201csupposedly had some issues\u201d related to money. ROA at 209. Other witnesses previously had identified Samuel as a suspect in the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The district judge denied Samuel\u2019s motion to suppress. The judge found the officers\u2019 testimony to be credible, and concluded a Terry<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stop was justified. The judge explained the officers had reasonable suspicion to briefly stop Samuel to speak with him about their investigation, and that suspicion was \u201cheightened,\u201d when they saw the bulge. ROA at 221. The judge further explained both the information implicating Samuel in the homicide and the bulge in his pocket were valid and independent reasons to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The next month, Samuel signed a plea agreement. He agreed to enter a conditional plea to the charged count but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. Samuel also signed a factual proffer, and he acknowledged he had three prior Florida felony convictions for possession with intent to deliver cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Samuel\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) reported several prior Florida controlled-substanee convictions, including possession with intent to sell cocaine in April 2007, and in two separate cases in July 2011. The probation officer calculated an initial base offense level of 24, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because Samuel had at least two prior felony controlled-substance-offense convictions. The probation officer, however, also determined Samuel was an armed career criminal, who was subject to an offense level of 33, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). The PSI awarded a 3-level, aceeptance-of-responsi-bility reduction, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, which yielded a total offense level of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The probation officer calculated a criminal-history score of 6 and a criminal history category of III, based on Samuel\u2019s prior controlled-substanee convictions. Under \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(3), Samuel was subject to a criminal history category of IV, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>armed career criminal. Based on a total offense level of 80 and a criminal history category of IV, the PSI calculated an initial Sentencing Guidelines range of 135-168 months of imprisonment. Because Samuel was subject to a statutory minimum, 15-year prison term under Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), his Guidelines range became 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Samuel objected to the application of the ACCA. He contended his prior convictions for sale or possession with intent to sell or deliver a controlled substance, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13, did not qualify as ACCA-predicate \u201cserious drug offenses,\u201d because they did not require knowledge of the illicit nature of the substances. For the same reasons, he argued his \u00a7 893.13 convictions did not qualify as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), to qualify him for a base offense level of 24. Absent the improper enhancements, his Guidelines range should have been based on an offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of III.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">During Samuel\u2019s sentencing hearing, he renewed- his objection to the ACCA sentence enhancement. He argued that applying the categorical approach, as required by <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), to an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute such as \u00a7 893.13 entails no more than comparing the elements of the offense of conviction to \u201cthe generic offense of possession -with intent to distribute.\u201d ROA at 230. He contended the generic offense required knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. Florida is one of only two states that does not include this mens rea requirement. Because \u00a7 893.13 criminalizes a broader range of conduct than the generic offense, Samuel argued it never can qualify as an ACCA-predicate. The absence of a mens rea requirement from the ACCA\u2019s plain language is not dispositive, because it does not exempt the required application of \u201cthe formal categorical approach to determine what are the elements of the generic offense.\u201d ROA at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">The district judge overruled Samuel\u2019s ACCA objection. The judge explained the \u00a7 924(e) definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is \u201can offense under state law involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance.\u201d R. at 236. Thus, despite Florida\u2019s elimination of a mens rea requirement from \u00a7 893.13, a conviction under that statute still qualified as an ACCA predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Samuel\u2019s counsel agreed he was subject to a 15-year minimum sentence. He also renewed all prior objections, including those in his PSI objections. The judge stated he had \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties, the presentence report which contains the advisory guidelines and the statutory factors.\u201d ROA at 237. The judge calculated an offense level of 30, a criminal history category of IV, and a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months. The judge sentenced Samuel to 180 months of imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years of supervised release. Samuel renewed his prior objections and also objected to the \u201cprocedural necessity\u201d of the sentence. ROA at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">Samuel argues on appeal the district judge erred in finding each of the following was independently sufficient to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop: (1) one officer\u2019s observation of a bulge near Samuel\u2019s waistband; and (2) the officers\u2019 desire to question him in connection with a homicide investigation. Samuel contends the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to believe he had participated in the homicide, and no exigent circumstances justified the stop. Samuel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>further asserts the officers\u2019 \u201csource of information\u201d did not identify him as a participant in the homicide. Reply Br. at 3 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Nor did the officers identify specific, objective facts on which to base a belief that Samuel may be armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Samuel also argues his prior \u00a7 893.13 convictions do not qualify as ACCA-predi-cate \u201cserious drug offenses.\u201d Samuel notes, in <em>Donawa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir.2013), we held a person may be convicted under Florida\u2019s possession-with-intent statute without knowledge of the nature of the substance in his possession. The federal drug trafficking statute, however, requires such knowledge. Samuel contends \u00a7 893.13 is a \u201cnon-generic\u201d offense under the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and, consequently, cannot qualify as an ACCA-predicate offense. Appellant Br. at 25, 28. He further argues we have rejected the label-based approach suggested by the government, in <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">We review a district judge\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard; we review the judge\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and his application of the law to those facts de novo. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 753-54 (11th Cir.2000). When considering a ruling on a suppression motion, all facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by government authorities. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>890 F.2d 355, 360 (11th Cir.1989). Officers may stop and briefly detain a person to investigate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity even though probable cause may be lacking. <em>See Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 754 (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Similarly, if police \u201chave a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that a person they encounter was involved in or is wanted in connection with a completed felony,\u201d a <em>Terry </em>stop may be made to investigate that suspicion. <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 229, 105 S.Ct. 675, 680, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). When determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the judge must review the totality of the circumstances to ascertain whether officers had a particularized and objective basis to suspect legal wrongdoing. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">In connection with a <em>Terry </em>stop, an officer may conduct a pat-down search if he has reason to believe his own safety or the safety of others is at risk. <em>United States v. White, </em>593 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir. 2010). The officer need not be certain an individual is armed, so long as a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances would be entitled to believe his safety or that of others is in danger. <em>Id. </em>at 1202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop of Samuel was present. <em>See Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750; <em>Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 754. When they encountered Samuel, Sgt. Prospere and Detective Passmore were engaged in the investigation of a homicide in which the victim had been shot several times. They had received information that Samuel had sent threatening text messages to the victim, and various individuals had identified Samuel as having been involved in the homicide. Detective Passmore identified Michael Miller, who told officers on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>day of the encounter (1) that Samuel was part of a group of people with whom the homicide victim \u201csupposedly had some issues\u201d related to money, and (2) where Samuel could be found. ROA at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">When they first saw Samuel, whom Sgt. Prospere knew from their prior history, Detective Passmore warned Sgt. Prospere about a bulge. Based on the prior information potentially connecting Samuel to a shooting homicide, the officers then were entitled to believe their safety was at risk, which justified a pat-down. <em>See White, </em>593 F.3d at 1202. Regardless of whether a <em>Terry </em>stop was justified before the officers became aware of the bulge, the stop was not effected until after Detective Passmore saw the bulge. When viewed in context with the information connecting Samuel to a shooting homicide, the presence of the bulge gave rise to reasonable suspicion he was involved in the homicide and potentially was armed and dangerous. <em>See Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750; <em>Hensley, </em>469 U.S. at 229, 105 S.Ct. at 680; <em>White, </em>593 F.3d at 1202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Samuel\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>United States v. Valerio, </em>718 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.2013), is misplaced. In <em>Valerio, </em>Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents began conducting surveillance of the defendant, Valerio, after he visited a hydroponic-gardening store. <em>Val-erio, </em>718 F.3d at 1322-23. After failing to uncover evidence of drug activities, two DEA agents visited Valerio at his home, where they blocked his exit, approached him with guns drawn, performed a full-body pat-down, and subjected him to questioning, whereupon Valerio admitted to growing marijuana. <em>Id. </em>We held the officers\u2019 seizure of Valerio fell outside of the <em>Terry </em>exception to the probable-cause requirement, because (1) the encounter occurred nearly one week after the officers had last observed Valerio; and (2) no contemporaneous observations of him required swift action. <em>Id. </em>at 1324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Unlike the case in <em>Valerio, </em>the officers in this case had information connecting Samuel to a particular crime. <em>See Hensley, </em>469 U.S. at 229, 105 S.Ct. at 680. Moreover, Detective Passmore\u2019s observation of a bulge permitted a pat-down in the interest of safety, particularly when viewed in context of a shooting homicide investigation in which Samuel was a suspect. <em>See White, </em>593 F.3d at 1202. In contrast, nothing in <em>Valerio </em>suggested Val-erio was a suspect or person of interest in a particular crime, much less a violent one, or that there was any reason to believe he may have been armed at the time of the stop-and-frisk. <em>See Valerio, </em>718 F.3d 1321. Samuel has not shown the district judge erred when he denied Samuel\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">B. <em>Armed Career Criminal Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1294. Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory-minimum, 15-year prison sentence if he has 3 prior convictions for serious drug offenses committed on separate occasions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined, in' relevant part, as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In determining whether a conviction qualifies as an ACCA-predicate offense, judges generally apply a categorical approach and look no further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the crime. <em>Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The Florida cocaine statute in this case provides that \u201ca person may not sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). A violation of \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) involving cocaine is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l) (cross-referencing <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(c), 893.03(2)(a)(4)). Before 2002, Florida courts interpreted \u00a7 893.13 as including a requirement that the defendant knew of the illicit nature of the drugs in his possession. <em>See Shelton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>691 F.3d 1348, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1856, 185 L.Ed.2d 822 (2013). In May 2002, the Florida Legislature enacted Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101, which eliminated knowledge of the illicit nature of the controlled substance as an element of controlled-substance crimes and created an affirmative defense of lack of knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. The amendment did not, however, eliminate the element of knowledge of the presence of the substance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The question presented in <em>Descamps </em>was whether a sentencing judge may examine certain documents to determine whether a prior conviction for a crime with a single, indivisible set of elements qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated-offenses provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-83. When faced with a prior conviction for violating an indivisible statute, one not containing alternative elements, the Supreme Court concluded sentencing judges may apply only the \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d which entails no more than comparing the elements of the statute forming the basis of the prior conviction with the elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d version of that crime. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">In <em>Donawa, </em>we held the petitioner\u2019s pri- or conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver cannabis, in violation of \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended by \u00a7 893.101, did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>See Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1279, 1283-84. We first concluded \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) is an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. To determine whether it qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA, judges may apply only the categorical approach. <em>Id. </em>at 1282-83. Relevant to the facts in <em>Donawa, </em>the definitions of \u201caggravated felony\u201d included a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1280; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). Under \u00a7 924(c)(2), \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 801 et seq.).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Applying the categorical approach, we determined in <em>Donawa </em>that the least of the acts criminalized by \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) did not require knowledge of the nature of the substance in one\u2019s possession. <em>Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1281. The \u201cfederal analogue\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>of the Florida statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), which is among the drug trafficking offenses listed in \u00a7 924(c)(2), requires the government to show the defendant knew of the nature of the substance in his possession. <em>Id. </em>We concluded, \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) did not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking aggravated felony\u201d under the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d in \u00a7 -924(e) does not require knowledge of the illicit nature of the controlled substance to have been an element of a prior state crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). All that is required is that the prior state crime (1) involved manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance, and (2) carried a maximum prison term of ten years or more. <em>See id. </em>A violation of \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) involving cocaine satisfies both of these requirements. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l) (cross-referencing <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(c), 893.03(2)(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Our decision in <em>Donawa </em>addressed the definitions of \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) and \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>Do-nawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1279-84. Each of these terms are defined differently than the term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), (e)(2)(A)(ii). Consequently, <em>Donawa </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Samuel\u2019s arguments concerning \u201cgeneric\u201d crimes likewise are misplaced. We addressed in <em>Donawa </em>whether \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) fits within the \u201cgeneric federal definition\u201d in the context of subsection (c) of \u00a7 924, which is not at issue here. <em>See id. </em>at 1280-82. Subsection (c) defines \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 801 et seq.).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). Because the definition of the enhancement at issue in <em>Dona-wa </em>referred to specific federal crimes, we concluded a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d in \u00a7 924(c) must fit within the \u201cgeneric federal definition\u201d of one of those specific federal offenses, namely, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), which was the \u201cfederal analogue\u201d to \u00a7 893.13. <em>See Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1280-81. The ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d however, contains no such examples of \u201cfederal analogue\u201d or other enumerated offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii); <em>Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1281. The question of whether \u00a7 893.13 qualifies as a \u201cgeneric\u201d offense is inapplicable, because \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is self-defining without reference to any \u201cgeneric\u201d or otherwise enumerated offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Samuel\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Palomino Garcia </em>also is misplaced. In <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>we addressed the Sentencing Guidelines definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1325-37. In <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>we rejected a label-based approach to deciding whether a pri- or offense qualifies for sentence-enhancement purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 1330-31. Samuel\u2019s sentence enhancement was proper, however, because the definition of \u00a7 893.13, based on its statutory text, satisfies the definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), and not because of any label attached to \u00a7 893.13. Therefore, the district judge properly determined Samuel\u2019s post-2002 \u00a7 893.13 convictions qualified as ACCA-predicate offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">. <em>Terry v.
