Braddy appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action with prejudice under \u00a7 2241 but without prejudice to his right to file an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order denying a federal inmate\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Yi v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>412 F.3d 526, 530 (4th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 2241, a prisoner may petition for a writ of habeas corpus if \u201c[h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). Because Braddy\u2019s petition alleged constitutional violations regarding only the conditions of his confinement and did not challenge the fact or duration of his sentence, his claims are more properly brought in an action pursuant to <em>Bivens. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (recognizing habeas as proper remedy for attacking fact or length of confinement); <em>Strader v. Troy, </em>571 F.2d 1263, 1269 (4th Cir.1978) (concluding that because petitioner did \u201cnot assert that he [was] entitled to parole and should be released,\u201d the \u201cclaim for relief must be treated as a suit under ... [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 [ (2012) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Therefore, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
