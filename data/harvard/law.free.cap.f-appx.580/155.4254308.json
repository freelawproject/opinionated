For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">A district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant whose Guidelines sentencing range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Smalls, </em>720 F.3d 193, 195 (4th Cir.2013). Whether to grant such a reduction is within the district court\u2019s discretion, so long as it considers the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) to the extent applicable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Smalls, </em>720 F.3d at 195. The court is not required to grant a reduction, even if the sentence the defendant received is above the amended Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 200 (4th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010). In so doing, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the district court, but instead consider whether the court\u2019s exercise of discretion was arbitrary or capricious. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-25\">Our review of the record demonstrates that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hines\u2019 motion. The court clearly understood its authority to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Hines\u2019 sentence pursuant to the crack cocaine Guidelines amendment but declined to do so based on its careful review of Hines\u2019 circumstances. \u201c[District courts have extremely broad discretion when determining the weight to be given each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffery, </em>631 F.3d 669, 679 (4th Cir.2011). While the court was entitled to consider Hines\u2019 post-conviction conduct, <em>see Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1242, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in determining that Hines\u2019 extensive criminal history, failure to comply with probation or pretrial release, and personal history justified the sentence originally imposed, even in light of the revised Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
