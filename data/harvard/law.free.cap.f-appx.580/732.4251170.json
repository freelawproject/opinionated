Fisher, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tallahassee, FL, Pamela C. Marsh, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Gainesville, FL, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b759-12\">Before TJOFLAT, ROSENBAUM and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b759-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Danton Williams appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of his application for supplemental security income pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3). The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Williams was not disabled and therefore denied the claim. On appeal, Williams argues that we must vacate the district court\u2019s judgment on the ground that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that he had only a mild impairment of concentration, persistence, and pace. We are not persuaded and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We will not reweigh the evidence, decide the facts anew, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">The ALJ must use the following five-step, sequential evaluation process when determining whether a claimant is disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-17\">(1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) based on a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In evaluating a claimant\u2019s mental impairments, the ALJ must make separate evaluations on a four-point scale regarding how the impairment impacts four functional areas: activities of daily living; social functioning; concentration, persistence, or pace; and episodes of decompensation. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1213 (11th Cir.2005). The ALJ must then incorporate the results of this technique into his findings and conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 1213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The Listing of Impairments provides that affective disorders are characterized by \u201cdisturbance of mood, accompanied by a full or partial manic or depressive syndrome.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 112.04. The claimant satisfies the level of severity required for affective disorders when the requirements of both paragraphs A and B are satisfied, or when the requirements in paragraph C are satisfied. <em>Id. </em>To satisfy paragraph B, the claimant must show <em>at least two </em>of the following: (1) marked restriction of activities of daily living; (2) marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; (3) marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or (4) repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Credibility determinations are within the ALJ\u2019s province. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. Although the opinion of an examining physician is generally entitled to greater weight than that of a non-examining physician, the ALJ may reject the opinion of <em>any </em>physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985). When evidence, including opinion evidence, is inconsistent, the ALJ has no duty to consider it. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920b (providing that, if any record evidence is inconsistent, the ALJ will take the additional step of weighing the relevant evidence to determine disability). However, \u201cthe more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight [the ALJ] will give to that opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">A vocational expert\u2019s (\u201cVE\u201d) expert testimony constitutes substantial evidence if the ALJ poses a hypothetical question that comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments, including limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180-81 (holding that the ALJ erred in failing to include a hypothetical to the VE that accounted for Winschel\u2019s moderate limitation in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Williams had only mild difficulties with regard to concentration, persistence, or pace, and Williams\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. First, a Global Assessment of Functioning (\u201cGAF\u201d) score is not dis-positive when determining disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 112.04 (listing requirements to find a claimant with an affective disorder disabled); <em>see also </em>Revised Medical Criteria for Evaluating Mental Disorders and Traumatic Brain Injury, 65 Fed.Reg. 50746, 50764-65 (Aug. 21, 2000) (the Commissioner noting that the GAF scale does not have a direct correlation to the severity requirements in the mental disorders listings). Second, although the physicians at the University of Florida\u2019s Shands Hospital recommended that Williams be involuntarily committed pursuant to the Baker Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that determination has no bearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the AL'J\u2019s finding regarding concentration, persistence, or pace \u2014 the only issue Williams raises on appeal. Finally, the ALJ did not err because the hypothetical to the VE comprised all of Williams\u2019s impairments, including limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace. <em>Cf. Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">.
