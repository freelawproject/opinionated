At sentencing, he objected to a four-level enhancement of his base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense \u2014 drug trafficking. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced Moore to 70 months of imprisonment, within the guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">In 2013, officers with the Dyer County Sheriff\u2019s Office stopped a minivan being driven by Moore. He could not produce his license because it had been revoked due to an earlier conviction for driving while intoxicated. A subsequent search of Moore\u2019s person revealed a clear plastic bag containing three grams of methamphetamine. Moore told officers that he had a .22 caliber revolver in a floorboard compartment behind the driver\u2019s seat. He also indicated there was a shotgun in the van, but that it would not fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">Officers searched the van and found a loaded .22 revolver as well as a sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun. Officers also found several rounds of ammunition and a glass methamphetamine smoking pipe. When interviewed later by police, Moore indicated the methamphetamine had been \u201cfronted\u201d to him by a supplier whom he intended to repay after selling the drugs. He also admitted he had already sold two bags of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>methamphetamine that day before he was stopped on his way to Dyersburg, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Moore later pled guilty in district court for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and possession of an illegally altered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5822, 5861(b), and 5871. The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) calculated Moore\u2019s total offense level at 27, in part based on a four-level enhancement provided under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (Nov. 1, 2018). That enhancement applies when a defendant \u201cuse[s] or possessed] any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Moore objected to the use of the enhancement in his guidelines calculation. A major issue for the court during the sentencing hearing was the location and accessibility of the firearm in relation to Moore. Ultimately, the court found that the firearm in question had the potential to facilitate Moore\u2019s methamphetamine distribution. As a result, it applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement to calculate Moore\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">A sentence is reviewed for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). With respect to the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement, a district court\u2019s factual determination that a firearm was used' or possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is reviewed with due deference for clear error. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>648 F.3d 417, 431-432 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The firearm in question here was found in a compartment in the floor behind the front seat of the minivan. Moore argu\u00e9s that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) should not apply because the firearm\u2019s proximity to him was merely coincidental and was not associated with his admitted drug trafficking. Specifically, he contends that the firearm\u2019s location made it useless for protecting drugs or facilitating a drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">This argument is unavailing. The four-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(B) applies \u201cif the firearm ... facilitated, <em>or had the potential of facilitating, </em>another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 14(A) (emphasis added). In the context of a drug trafficking offense, the enhancement is appropriate if a \u201cfirearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 14(B). Moreover, under the so-called \u201cfortress theory,\u201d which we have adopted,, a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement is warranted \u201cif the firearm had some emboldening role in a defendant\u2019s felonious conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Angel, </em>576 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Ennenga, </em>263 F.3d 499, 503 (6th Cir.2001)). The firearm \u201cneed not be actively used\u201d in the other offense. <em>Id. </em>at 320 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">In this case, there is no dispute that Moore was involved in drug trafficking. Indeed, he admitted that earlier on the day he was arrested, he had sold two bags of methamphetamine. The question, then, is whether the .22 revolver, which was located in a compartment in the floorboard behind the front seat, facilitated or had the potential to facilitate those drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Several factors support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government met its burden to connect the firearm to Moore\u2019s drug trafficking. First, even defense counsel conceded that from the position of the driver\u2019s seat in the minivan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Moore was in fairly close proximity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the .22. Second, although the .22 was not simply lying under a seat, Sheriffs Deputy Chad Jackson testified that it was accessible from the driver\u2019s seat. There appears to be no doubt the .22 was easier to reach than if it had been located in a traditional car\u2019s trunk \u2014 a location for which courts have upheld \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancements. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, </em>257 Fed.Appx. 981, 982 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Wooten, </em>253 Fed.Appx. 854, 858 (11th Cir.2007). Third, the revolver was found fully loaded and with other .22 caliber rounds nearby. Finally, the district court did not credit Moore\u2019s testimony that he had forgotten the firearms were in the minivan until officers asked him if there was anything else in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Analyzing these factors, the district court reasonably concluded that the .22 revolver had the potential of facilitating the drug trafficking that Moore was engaged in. With a nexus thereby established between the firearm and an independent felony, the court did not commit clear error in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) sentencing enhancement. <em>Angel, </em>576 F.3d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. Close proximity, while not dispositive, is \"certainly indicative of a connection\u201d between guns and drugs. <em>United States v.
