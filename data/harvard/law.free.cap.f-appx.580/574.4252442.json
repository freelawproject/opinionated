We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">(1) Chacoan asserts that the district court erred when it instructed the jury on the elements he had to prove to establish supervisory deliberate indifference by Dr. Traquina. We disagree. The instruction given was sufficient to inform the jury that Dr. Traquina could be found responsible for his own deliberate indifference if he failed to act to prevent harm caused by the deliberately indifferent conduct of his subordinates that was known to him. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 663 n. 7, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2022, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Lemire v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr. &amp; Rehab., </em>726 F.3d 1062, 1074-75 (9th Cir.2013); <em>Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989); <em>see also OSU Student Alliance v. Ray, </em>699 F.3d 1053, 1069, 1071 (9th Cir.2012) (pleading standards), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 70, 187 L.Ed.2d 29 (2013); <em>Starr v. Baca, </em>652 F.3d 1202, 1205-07 (9th Cir. 2011) (same); <em>cf. Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1982-83, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Moreover, even if on this record the instruction was not a model of perfection, it is more probable than not that any ambiguity in the instruction was harmless. <em>See Clem v. Lomeli, </em>566 F.3d 1177, 1182 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Dang v. Cross, </em>422 F.3d 800, 811 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Phillips v. U.S. IRS, </em>73 F.3d 939, 941 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">(2) Chacoan also asserts that the district court abused its discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when it did not define the phrase \u201cserious medical need\u201d for the jury. Again, we disagree. Nothing in this record indicates that the jury was confused by that phrase, even if \u201cmore elaboration might not have been improper.\u201d <em>United States v. Keyser, </em>704 F.3d 631, 643 (9th Cir.2012). Moreover, both parties told the jury that Chacoan had a serious medical condition. Here, too, our review of the record indicates that if there was any lack of clarity, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
