Valdes filed two pro se motions for a new trial after a jury convicted him on all counts of a six-count indictment, the district court imposed a 300-month total sentence, and we affirmed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Valdes\u2019s Rule 33 motions were predicated on the transcript of a recorded conversation between himself and several code-fendants that took place in a police car after their arrest. The transcript begins with an officer announcing the time as \u201c7:00 in the evening\u201d, and ends with the same officer announcing the time as being approximately 10:17 p.m., although only 51 minutes and 21 seconds had elapsed. Valdes argued that the starting time of 7 p.m. ran counter to the police\u2019s timeline of events the night of his arrest \u2014 which included numerous conspiratorial phone calls involving him placed after 7 p.m. \u2014 and showed that the government had introduced fabricated evidence. The district court denied the motions without holding an evidentiary hearing, ruling that the evidence was not newly discovered and was merely impeaching evidence that did not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">On appeal, Valdes argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions. He also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not at least holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">We review the denial of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). We also review a district court\u2019s decision to rule on a Rule 33 motion without an evi-dentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 990 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Rule 33 allows a defendant to file a motion for a new trial within three years after the verdict if the motion is based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). The court may grant the motion \u201cif the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). We have held that, to succeed on a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence, the defendant must establish that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">(1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) the failure of the defendant to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, (4) the evidence is material to issues before the court, and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-15\"><em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have noted that motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence \u201care highly disfavored ... and should be granted only with great caution.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">The decision whether to hold an eviden-tiary hearing on a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>United States v. Slocum, </em>708 F.2d 587, 600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>(11th Cir.1983). We have stated that a defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a Rule 33 motion if \u201cthe acumen gained by a trial judge over the course of the proceedings [made him] well qualified to rule ... without a hearing.\u201d <em>Schlei, </em>122 F.3d at 994 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Valdes\u2019s motions for a new trial because it correctly concluded that none of the evidence Valdes offered was new, and even assuming, arguendo, that the evidence was newly discovered, it was merely impeaching evidence and did not warrant a new trial. <em>See Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1287. The district court also did not abuse its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before denying Valdes\u2019s motions, because the trial judge also presided over these motions and thus was already familiar with the evidence. <em>See Schlei, </em>122 F.3d at 994. Accordingly, after review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
