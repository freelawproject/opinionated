The district court sentenced Randolph in the middle of his Guidelines range to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Randolph\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning the substantive reasonableness of Randolph\u2019s sentence. Randolph has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, despite notice of his right to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">We review Randolph\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, applying a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, we examine the totality of the circumstances and, if the sentence is within the properly-calculated Guidelines range, apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216-17 (4th Cir.2010). Such a presumption is rebutted only if the defendant shows \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2012) ] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">On appeal, Randolph\u2019s counsel argues that Randolph\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). We conclude that Randolph has failed to overcome the appellate presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence. In arguing for a downward variance at sentencing, defense counsel pointed out to the court the impact of a single misdemeanor on Randolph\u2019s Guidelines range. Counsel further informed the court that Randolph would seek employment in the culinary field upon release. The district court acknowledged counsel\u2019s arguments, but concluded that a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines range was appropriate \u201cin order to protect the public,\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d and in light of Randolph\u2019s \u201clong criminal record.\u201d Given the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-Guidelines sentence, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to vary downward and to impose a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires counsel to inform Randolph, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Randolph requests that a petition be filed but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Randolph. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
