The District Court sentenced Lig\u00f3n to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-20\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">Because we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we recount only the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">Hieng Ngo (\u201cNgo\u201d) and her husband owned Big Top Beverage, a beer and beverage distributor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their business sold beer and other items that were originally purchased from out-of-state and out-of-the-country. Ngo and her husband were in the habit of storing the proceeds from Big Top Beverage in a safe in the master bedroom of their home. Business proceeds were routinely stored in the safe over the weekend until they could be deposited in the bank on the next business day. At those times, the safe held business proceeds from Big <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Top Beverage as well as family jewelry and personal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u25a0 On May 2, 2011, Ngo was alone in her home. While showering in the basement, she heard a noise on the first floor. Wearing only a towel, she went upstairs to investigate. Once upstairs, she saw Oron-da Lig\u00f3n along with a second man inside her home, and a third man outside. \u201c[Rjobbery, robbery,\u201d Ngo yelled hoping to scare the three men. (App.178.) Lig\u00f3n stood with the safe next to him on the floor, but then he pushed Ngo to the ground and told the man outside to \u201cgive her the gun.\u201d (App.183.) The man outside pointed a gun close to-Ngo\u2019s chest. The men then carried the safe outside. Ngo, still wearing only a towel, ran outside after them and yelled to her neighbors for help. A neighbor saw someone run out of Ngo\u2019s home and drive away in a dark SUV. The neighbor reported the SUV\u2019s license number to the police. Two other bystanders saw a man jump into a black SUV which had stopped near Ngo\u2019s home and then sped off down a nearby street. Besides the safe, Ngo testified that her purse containing additional business proceeds was also stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The license plate was traced to a red Saab, owned by Andrew Kovets (\u201cKo-vets\u201d). The license plate was discovered to be missing from the Kovets\u2019 Saab shortly after the date of the robbery. Ligon\u2019s friend Wilbert Golden owned a parking lot and testified that Lig\u00f3n had visited the lot when Kovets\u2019 Saab was present prior to the robbery. William Cooper (\u201cCooper\u201d), another of Ligon\u2019s friends, testified that Lig\u00f3n admitted to robbing Ngo. Cooper also testified that Lig\u00f3n admitted having said he targeted Ngo because he believed Asians kept large amounts of money in their homes because \u201cthey didn\u2019t believe in banks.\u201d (App.368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Two days after the robbery, Ngo identified Lig\u00f3n from a police photo array as the man who had pushed her down, instructed the man outside to \u201cgive her the gun,\u201d and carried the safe outside her home. (App. 183.) Lig\u00f3n was indicted on one count of interference with interstate commerce by robbery, one count of use of a firearm during a crime of violence, and aiding and abetting both crimes. A jury convicted Lig\u00f3n on the robbery count, but acquitted him on the firearm count. The District Court determined that the total value of stolen property was $54,900, which included $25,000 in business proceeds contained in the stolen safe and $9,700 in business proceeds held in Ngo\u2019s stolen purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">At sentencing, the District Court imposed sentence enhancements for a loss calculation exceeding $50,000 and brandishing a firearm. With a category III criminal history, Ligon\u2019s advisory Guidelines sentence range was 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the District Court imposed 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, restitution of $59,357.00, and the special assessment of $100.00. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Appellant argues that evidence presented at trial was insufficient to show the effect of the robbery on interstate commerce, as is required by the Hobbs Act. This Court has plenary review over challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Taftsiou, </em>144 F.3d 287, 290 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Under Supreme Court precedent, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). This Court affords \u201cdeference to a jury\u2019s findings ... [and] draw[s] all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderskow, </em>88 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The Hobbs Act criminalizes \u201c[wjhoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, a robbery under the Hobbs Act need only have a \u201creasonably probable effect on commerce, however minimal.\u201d <em>United States v. Urban, </em>404 F.3d 754, 763-64 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim here fails because sufficient evidence was presented at trial that could have suggested to a jury that the robbery at hand had a reasonably probable effect on commerce. For one, Cooper, who had known Lig\u00f3n for four years, identified Lig\u00f3n as the source of the \u201cknowledge about the robbery of Big Top Beer and the house that was robbed[.]\u201d <em>(See </em>App. 371.) Ngo also testified that merely a couple of days prior to the robbery, a \u201cblack jeep followed] us to park [on] the street ... across [the] street from [her] house[,]\u201d which caused her to believe that \u201cmaybe we [are] not safe here[.]\u201d (App. 188.) The jury, in addition, heard testimony that Lig\u00f3n targeted Asians and drove a black \u201cJeep Grand Cherokee.\u201d (App.369.) These facts are sufficient for the jury to find a violation of the Hobbs Act. As we observed recently, the \u201ctargeting and the resultant robberies of ... owners were sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the \u2018natural consequences\u2019 of [defendant\u2019s] actions were an actual or potential effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>693 F.3d 398, 405 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Therefore, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that Appellant had violated the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>B. Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Appellant next argues that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury that the evidence needs to show only a <em>de minimis </em>or potential effect on interstate commerce. This Court exercises plenary review to determine whether the jury instructions stated the proper legal standard. <em>See United States v. Leahy, </em>445 F.3d 634, 642 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">This claim must fail. The District Court followed the Third Circuit model jury instruction, which we have approved on a prior occasion. <em>See Powell, </em>693 F.3d at 406-07. Indeed, Appellant concedes that \u201cthis Circuit\u2019s binding precedent forecloses relief on this claim at this time.\u201d (Appellant Br. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the jury instruction was erroneous on grounds that it conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence cabining Congress\u2019s exercise of Commerce Clause power also fails. We have previously rejected such challenges. Because the Hobbs Act contains a jurisdictional element and criminalizes the fundamentally economic crimes of robbery and extortion, violations of the Act have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the aggregate, and the government need not prove a substantial effect in each indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>vidual case. <em>See United States v. Shavers, </em>693 F.3d 363, 372-73 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Therefore, the District Court did not err in instructing on the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\n<em>C. Fact Finding Relevant to Guidelines Range</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Appellant next argues that the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right to jury trial by applying Sentencing Guidelines enhancements based on conduct not proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We exercise plenary review over this claim. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>235 F.3d 858, 861 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\"In a seminal opinion, the Supreme Court held that district courts may consider acquitted conduct at sentencing. <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997). Following <em>Watts, </em>this Court held that \u201ca jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciavarella, </em>716 F.3d 705, 735 (3d Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Watts, </em>519 U.S. at 157, 117 S.Ct. 633) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under our precedent, \u201c[j] udicial factfi ndi ng in the course of selecting a sentence within the permissible range does not offend the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Here, the District Court made factual findings relevant in selecting a sentence within the prescribed statutory range. Because the jury verdict merely demonstrates that there was a reasonable doubt of at least one of the elements of Section 924(c), this did not preclude the District Court from making factual findings at sentencing under the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, contrary to Appellant\u2019s claim, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncement in <em>Alleyne v. United States </em>\u201cdid not curtail a sentencing court\u2019s ability to find facts relevant in selecting a sentence <em>within </em>the prescribed statutory range.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>751 F.3d 107, 117 (3d Cir.2014); <em>see also Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2161 n. 2, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (\u2018While [factfinding used to guide judicial discretion in selecting punishment] may lead judges to select sentences that are more severe than the ones they would have selected without those facts, the Sixth Amendment does not govern that element of sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Therefore, the District Court did not violate Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\n<em>D. Reasonableness of the Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Appellant claims that the District Court failed to address his argument for a variance, rendering his sentence procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Because no objection was made in the District Court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Flores-Mejia, </em>759 F.3d 253, 256 (3d Cir.2014). Appellant\u2019s substantive objection to a sentence is reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 218 (3d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">We first turn to Appellant\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, \u201cthe record should demonstrate that the court considered the 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir.2006). Here, the record sufficiently demonstrates that the District Court meaningfully considered Appellant\u2019s contention. <em>(See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>App. 616 (\u201c[S]tarting with the need to protect the public from further crimes, I place great weight on that section of 3553. I\u2019ve also discussed the nature and circumstances of the offense, a very, very serious crime. It could have ended up as a homicide and irreparable harm to the victim. So it\u2019s a very serious sentence. I\u2019m going to impose [a sentence] which is at the high end of the Guideline range.\u201d); App. 617 (\u201cI considered the types of sentences available, the Guidelines sentencing ranges and Policy Statements, [and] sentencing disparities[.]\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Because the District Court\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable, we now review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. See <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567 (3d Cir.2009). Our substantive review focuses on the totality of the circumstances and is highly deferential. <em>Id. </em>Here, we do not find that the District Court abused its discretion. Lig\u00f3n executed a home invasion with a gun that was premeditated and targeted a certain minority group. Under these circumstances, the District Court was soundly within its discretion to impose a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Therefore, the District Court committed no error in imposing Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>E. Fact Finding for Restitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Appellant argues that the District Court committed plain error in failing to submit to a jury for determination beyond a , reasonable doubt the amount of restitution owed to the victim. Because Appellant did not object to this claim in the District Court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93, 99 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">From the outset, we note that the same line of argument advanced by Appellant here was rejected by this Court in <em>United States v. Leahy, </em>438 F.3d 328, 337-38 (3d Cir.2006) (en banc). There, we held that restitution \u201cis a criminal penalty and that the Sixth Amendment right to jury determinations of certain facts as articulated in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to forfeiture or to orders of restitution imposed as part of a criminal sentence under those two statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338-39. This precedent is fatal to Appellant\u2019s claim, as the plain error standard requires proof that the error is clear under current law. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (holding that a \u201ccourt of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current law\u201d). Here, the law is at best contrary to Appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Therefore, the District Court did not commit plain error in determining the restitution owed to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm judgment of conviction of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
