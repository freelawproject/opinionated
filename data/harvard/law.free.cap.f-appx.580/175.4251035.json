On appeal, White asserts that the district court committed procedural error in its application of a <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2012) downward departure and that the Government breached the plea agreement by seeking a vulnerable victim sentencing enhancement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Government moves to dismiss White\u2019s downward departure claim pursuant to the waiver of appellate rights contained in his plea agreement and urges this court to affirm White\u2019s conviction and sentence with regard to all other issues. Because whether the Government breached the plea agreement is intrinsic to the analysis of whether the waiver of appellate rights is valid, we consider both of White\u2019s appellate issues together.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">Where the government seeks to enforce an appeal waiver, we will enforce the waiver if the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent and the issues raised on appeal fall within the scope of the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ment. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005). We review de novo the validity of an appellate waiver. <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 626 (4th Cir.2010). \u201cGenerally, if a district court questions a defendant regarding the waiver of appellate rights during the [Fed. R.Crim. P.] 11 colloquy and the record indicates that the defendant understood the full significance of the waiver, the waiver is valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Thoms-bury, </em>670 F.3d 532, 537 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We have reviewed the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy and conclude that White knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal whatever sentence the district court imposed. Further, White\u2019s claim that the district court improperly applied a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, a question of procedural reasonableness, is within the scope of his waiver. Lastly, we conclude that the Government did not breach the plea agreement by seeking a vulnerable victim sentencing enhancement because the plea agreement forbade the Government only from seeking an upward departure or variance, and it permitted the Government to seek additional enhancements other than those enumerated in the agreement. Therefore, we conclude that White\u2019s appeal of this issue is barred by the waiver of his appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to White\u2019s downward departure claim and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-16\"> White\u2019s counsel states that he is submitting the second issue pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). However, because he seeks review on the merits of the first issue, we have not construed the brief as filed pursuant to <em>An-ders.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
