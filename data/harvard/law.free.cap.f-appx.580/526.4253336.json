Here, we resolve his challenge to his sentence. Richardson argues that the district court should not have assigned him one criminal history point for his 2000 misdemeanor conviction because he did not have counsel during the proceeding and the conviction resulted in a sentence of time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-22\">The Sixth Amendment provides that an indigent criminal defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without the assistance of appointed counsel. <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 374, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979). However, \u201conce the government establishes the fact of a conviction, the burden rests on the defendant to show that the conviction was unconstitutional.\u201d <em>United States v. Wahid, </em>614 F.3d 1009, 1017 (9th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Newman, </em>912 F.2d 1119, 1121 (9th Cir.1990)). \u201cA defendant cannot carry this burden \u2018merely by pointing to a silent or ambiguous record.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>316 F.3d 1054, 1056 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>States v. Mulloy, </em>3 F.3d 1337, 1339 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Government established the fact of Richardson\u2019s conviction. In contrast, Richardson presented no evidence demonstrating that he did not make a knowing and intentional waiver of his right to counsel or that his conviction was otherwise unconstitutional. Because Richardson has failed to overcome the presumption of validity accorded to his 2000 conviction, we conclude the district court did not err in assigning Richardson one criminal history point for the 2000 misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b552-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
