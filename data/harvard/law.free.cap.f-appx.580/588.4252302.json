This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of an applicant\u2019s asylum claim under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006). BIA denials of withholding and CAT protection are also reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 933, 936 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings. Therefore, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">There is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision that Stepanyan failed to present a viable claim for asylum. The BIA reversed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u2019s\u201d) adverse credibility finding and concluded that Stepanyan\u2019s testimony demonstrated past persecution on the basis of imputed political opinion. A showing of past persecution results in a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). However, the BIA went on to affirm the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the government had rebutted this presumption in light of Stepanyan\u2019s fundamentally changed circumstances pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). The BIA based this conclusion on the fact that Stepanyan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>prior persecution was related to her contribution to her husband\u2019s opposition political efforts. The BIA noted that Stepanyan\u2019s husband no longer resides Armenia and that there is no indication in the record that he will return there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the BIA emphasized that Stepanyan had indicated that she does not belong to any political organizations in Armenia or have any friends within any political party. As a result, the BIA concluded that the evidence in the record rebutted the regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Stepanyan argues that the BIA improperly relied upon changes in her personal situation to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and insists that the BIA can only consider changes in Armenia\u2019s country conditions. However, the language in the applicable asylum regulation does not support Stepa-nyan\u2019s position. An earlier version of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) did limit the government\u2019s rebuttal of the presumption to evidence that \u201cconditions in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality or last habitual residence have changed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) (1999). However, this language was broadened on December 6, 2000 to provide that the government can rely upon evidence of \u201cfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A); <em>see also </em>Asylum Procedures, 65 Fed.Reg. 76121, 76127 (Dec. 6, 2000) (noting that \u201cthe presumption may be overcome by events other than a change in country conditions\u201d). We defer to the conclusion of the BIA that \u201cfundamental change[s] in circumstances\u201d can include changes in a petitioner\u2019s personal circumstances. <em>See Garcia-Quintero v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.2006). Nothing in our caselaw compels the contrary conclusion. <em>Cf. Qu v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.2005). The evidence in the record substantially supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Stepanyan no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in Armenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We also reject Stepanyan\u2019s contention that we should remand the proceedings back to the IJ to determine whether she is eligible for humanitarian asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notably, Stepanyan failed to raise this issue on appeal to the BIA. Consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Stepanyan\u2019s claim for humanitarian asylum because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to that claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see, e.g., Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (refusing to consider claim for humanitarian asylum because petitioners failed to raise that issue before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust their administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Finally, in order to prevail on her CAT claim, Stepanyan must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if removed to Armenia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005). Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>stantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Stepanyan is not entitled to CAT protection. Stepanyan argues that the BIA improperly failed to examine the CAT claim separate and apart from the withholding of removal claim. While the BIA\u2019s decision does not include an extensive discussion of her CAT claim, the final decision addresses Stepanyan\u2019s eligibility for CAT protection separately from its discussion of her asylum and withholding of removal claims and cites to the applicable regulatory provisions. Furthermore, substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Stepanyan failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will face torture upon returning to Armenia. As discussed above, the record does not indicate that it is likely that she will face persecution given her husband\u2019s departure from Armenia. Furthermore, while Stepanyan has testified that she was detained and beaten by the police, it is not clear that this persecution rises to the level of torture. Accordingly, Stepanyan\u2019s CAT claim also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b615-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
