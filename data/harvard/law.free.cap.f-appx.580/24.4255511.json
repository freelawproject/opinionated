Singh\u2019s briefs challenge the scheduling of the bench trial and the district court\u2019s ruling that he failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">I. Trial Scheduling</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">We review a district judge\u2019s decision to deny a continuance \u201conly for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc., </em>259 F.3d 91, 100 (2d Cir.2001). A defendant seeking a reversal must demonstrate that the court\u2019s decision was both arbitrary and prejudicial. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>626 F.3d 682, 690 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">Singh gives us no reason to believe that his inability to attend the trial prejudiced his case. In light of Singh\u2019s absence, his attorney presented Singh\u2019s testimony via his deposition transcript, which thoroughly covered all the subjects on which Singh had offered to testify at trial. Singh identifies no additional testimony that he could have provided, much less shows how that testimony may have changed the verdict. <em>See Payne v. Jones, </em>711 F.3d 85, 91 (2d Cir.2013) (finding no prejudice where \u201cthe defendant failed to identify anything he would have testified to that was not included in the deposition testimony that was read to the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Singh appears to suggest that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel \u201cmisled\u201d him about the date of the trial. But a lawyer\u2019s purported shortcomings present no cognizable ground for relief in a civil matter, where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not apply. <em>United States v. Coven, </em>662 F.2d 162, 176 (2d Cir.1981). Any alleged misunderstanding between Singh and his attorney regarding the trial date provides no basis to disturb the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">II. Evidence at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\">Following a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See L.I. Head Start Child Dev. Servs., Inc. v. Econ. Opportunity Comm\u2019n of Nassau County, </em>710 F.3d 57, 65 (2d Cir.2013). We \u201cgive deference to all credibility determinations and reasonable inferences of the [fact finder], and may not weigh the credibility of witnesses or otherwise consider the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dish, </em>691 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-18\">Under New York law, a claimant seeking to establish a prima facie case of negligence must demonstrate that \u201c(1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a cognizable duty of care; (2) the defendant breached that duty; and (3) the plaintiff suffered damaged as a proximate result.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Williams v. Utica Coll. of Syracuse Univ., </em>453 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a claimant is injured by a dangerous condition on the defendant\u2019s property and the defendant did not create the condition, the defendant is liable only if he had actual or constructive notice of the defect. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>121 F.3d 86, 89-90 (2d Cir.1997). To give rise to constructive notice, the defect \u201cmust be visible and apparent and it must exist for a sufficient length of time prior to the accident to permit defendant\u2019s employees to discover and remedy it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Singh failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence. The district court reasonably found that Singh did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his injury was caused by a \u201cdefect\u201d on Home Depot\u2019s property, much less that Home Depot or its employees were or should have been aware of that defect. Singh suggests that a broken pallet caused his fall, but the record does not establish that the pallet was even broken, much less who broke it or whether Home Depot\u2019s employees should have been aware of the condition. Read generously, Singh\u2019s position is that the very design of Home Depot\u2019s tile display, allowing customers to move heavy packages unattended, was unreasonably dangerous. But the evidence that Home Depot had used the same display \u2014 similar to others throughout its stores \u2014 for at least a month without prior accidents or complaints supports the district court\u2019s finding that the design comported with standards of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
