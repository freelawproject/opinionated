After examining the appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b507-21\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">Former Wisconsin inmate Jerry Means appeals the dismissal of his civil-rights suit alleging that he was wrongly confined in segregation for 34 days without a hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-23\">In his complaint Means alleged the following facts, which we accept as true and construe in his favor. <em>See Brumfield v. City of Chicago, </em>735 F.3d 619, 622 (7th Cir.2013). After violating parole, Means was returned to prison and immediately placed in segregation without explanation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>He later received a memo from the prison\u2019s \u201csecurity director\u201d attributing his \u201cnon-punitive\u201d segregated status to his pri- or \u201cassaultive behavior.\u201d Means spent 34 days in segregation before being transferred to a special-needs unit that houses mentally ill inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Means sued the prison warden and several prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they deprived him of a protected liberty interest by placing him in segregation without a hearing. The district court screened the complaint, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and concluded that it failed to state a claim because his time in segregation did not involve a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">For prisoners, liberty interests arise only from policies that impose \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 221-23, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005) (quoting <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)); <em>see also Hardaway v. Meyerhoff, </em>734 F.3d 740, 743 (7th Cir.2013). Segregated confinement may trigger a liberty interest, and thereby due process protections, if the length is substantial or the conditions are unusually harsh. <em>See Townsend v. Cooper, </em>759 F.3d 678, 687 (7th Cir.2014); <em>Hardaway, </em>734 F.3d at 743-44; <em>Marion v. Columbia Corr. Inst., </em>559 F.3d 693, 697-98 (7th Cir.2009). But Means\u2019s segregation term of just over one month, by itself, did not implicate a liberty interest. <em>See, e.g., Earl v. Racine Cnty. Jail, </em>718 F.3d 689, 690, 692 (7th Cir.2013) (12-day and 7-day segregation terms did not implicate liberty interest); <em>Townsend v. Fuchs, 522 </em>F.3d 765, 766, 771-72 (7th Cir.2008) (59-day segregation term); Lekas <em>v. Briley, </em>405 F.3d 602, 612 (7th Cir. 2005) (90-day segregation term); <em>Richardson v. Runnels, </em>594 F.3d 666, 672 (9th Cir.2010) (16-day segregation term); <em>cf. Toston v. Thurmer, </em>689 F.3d 828, 832 (7th Cir.2012) (remanding where district court made no findings about whether 90-day segregation term deprived prisoner of liberty); <em>Orr v. Larkins, </em>610 F.3d 1032, 1033-34 (8th Cir.2010) (9-month segregation term did not implicate liberty interest). Nor were the alleged \u201cintolerable conditions\u201d \u2014 being strip-searched and prevented from accessing the law library or pursuing administrative remedies \u2014 so extreme as to involve due process considerations. <em>See Hardaway, </em>734 F.3d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">To the extent that the complaint can be read also to challenge the conditions of confinement \u2014 a challenge that the district court did not address \u2014 it also fails to state a claim because the alleged conditions do not amount to \u201cthe denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities,\u201d <em>see Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Townsend, 522 </em>F.3d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
