The district court found that Jason Washington did not possess a firearm \u201cin connection with the offense\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2). The court did not clearly err in so finding. <em>See United States v. Ferryman, </em>444 F.3d 1183, 1185 (9th Cir.2006). The court carefully considered the circumstances surrounding those instances in which Washington possessed a firearm and concluded that Washington had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he lawfully possessed the firearms for purposes unconnected to the drug offenses at issue. We cannot say that the court\u2019s finding leaves us \u201cwith a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">2. The district court also found that Washington was not \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4). The enhancement for role in the offense applies under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 when \u201cthe defendant exercised some control over others involved in the commission of the offense or was responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Yi, </em>704 F.3d 800, 807 (9th Cir.2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the district court committed two legal errors in conducting this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">First, the court did not address Washington\u2019s control over others or his organizational role at all. Instead, it concluded that the enhancement should not apply because Washington did not present a recidivism risk or danger to the public, two of the factors the Sentencing Commission has indicated underlie the role enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. background. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>though sentencing courts may draw upon background commentary to inform their analysis, they must begin with the plain language of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Cruz-Gramajo, </em>570 F.3d 1162, 1167, 1168 n. 4 (9th Cir.2009). As with the enhancement for obstruction of justice, if the court determines that the factual predicate for the enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 has been established, application of the enhancement is mandatory. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ancheta, </em>38 F.3d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that once a guideline provision\u2019s criteria have been met, the enhancement is \u201cmandatory, not discretionary\u201d). When imposing a sentence, the court may, of course, consider departing from the applicable guidelines range if it believes the enhancement overstates the defendant\u2019s culpability. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 92, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). But when determining eligibility for the safety valve, the court must apply the enhancement according to its plain terms, without regard to departures. <em>See United States v. Valencia-Andrade, </em>72 F.3d 770, 773-74 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that a court calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history points for purposes of safety valve eligibility must do so without considering departures).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Second, the court erred by importing the \u201cheartland\u201d analysis of <em>Koon </em>into the safety valve context. That analysis is appropriate only when, after correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range, a court is considering whether to grant a variance or departure from that range. It has no relevance when a court is determining whether a particular guideline enhancement applies in the first place. The guidelines make this clear by stating that a court must apply the enhancement for role in the offense before considering any departures or variances. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">3. In light of the above, we reverse and remand with respect to the role enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 so that the district court may reconsider its analysis, taking into account Washington\u2019s \u201ccontrol over others involved in the commission of the offense\u201d and his responsibility \u201cfor organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\u201d <em>Yi, </em>704 F.3d at 807. If the court determines that the factual predicate for the role enhancement has been established in light of the evidence in the record, that finding would preclude safety valve relief. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 cmt. n. 5. On the other hand, if the record does not support application of the enhancement after the court analyzes it within the framework laid out above, safety valve relief would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), is an open question. While at least one circuit has concluded <em>posb-Alleyne </em>that the statute doesn\u2019t offend the Sixth Amendment, <em>see United States v. Harakaly, </em>734 F.3d 88, 97-99 (1st Cir.2013), our circuit has yet to decide the issue. <em>See United States v. Tequidar-Esquer, </em>No. 13-10514 (9th Cir. appeal docketed Oct. 7, 2013). Having prevailed below on the issue of safety valve eligibility, Washington had no occasion to brief the issue in this appeal, and we therefore do not address it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
