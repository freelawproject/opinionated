We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-20\">Cornu-Labat\u2019s claims of outrage, defamation, and false light against Merred fail because Merred is immune from civil liability under Washington\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, Wash. Rev.Code Ann. (\u201cRCW\u201d) \u00a7 4.24.510. Merred\u2019s calls to law enforcement and school employees were \u201creasonably of concern\u201d to both, for law enforcement to enforce the protection order and for the school to ensure the safety of its students. RCW \u00a7 4.24.510; <em>see Bailey v. State, </em>147 Wash.App. 251, 191 P.3d 1285, 1287 (2008). Washington law does not require good faith on the part of Merred to receive this statutory protection. <em>See Phoenix Trading, Inc. v. Loops LLC, </em>732 F.3d 936, 942 (9th Cir.2013) (providing that RCW \u00a7 4.24.510 does not include a good faith requirement); <em>Bailey, </em>191 P.3d at 1290-91 (holding that the good faith reference in the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s purpose section is trumped by the statute\u2019s more specific provision setting out requirements for receiving immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-21\">Cornu-Labat\u2019s claims against Officers Bakke and Clark and the City of Quincy under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, based on an alleged Fourth Amendment violation, and for false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and negligence, also fall short. The officers had probable cause to arrest Cornu-Labat. They relied on \u201creasonably trustworthy information\u201d \u2014 the 911 dispatcher\u2019s description, the Spillman computer report of the protection order, and their in-person conversation with Alexa Merred \u2014 \u201csufficient to warrant a prudent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>person in believing\u201d that Cornu-Labat had violated the protection order. <em>Rohde v. City of Roseburg, </em>187 F.3d 1142, 1144 (9th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Probable cause defeats Cornu-Labat\u2019s \u00a7 1983, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1143-44 (requiring a lack of probable cause to determine that a false arrest occurred under \u00a7 1983); <em>Hanson v. City of Snohomish, </em>121 Wash.2d 552, 852 P.2d 295, 298, 301 (1993) (recognizing that probable cause is a complete defense to claims of malicious prosecution, false arrest, and false imprisonment under Washington law). Cornu-Labat also fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City of Quincy had a \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d that served as the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind an alleged Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv. of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Cornu-Labat\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and negligence claims against Grant County fare no better. Because the police officers had probable cause to arrest Cornu-Labat, he was not deprived of any constitutional right due to Grant County\u2019s actions or customs, nor was Grant County an \u201cintegral participant\u201d in committing the alleged violation. <em>See Mabe v. San Bernardino Cnty., Dep\u2019t of Public Soc. Servc., </em>237 F.3d 1101, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Hopkins v. Bonvicino, </em>573 F.3d 752, 769-70 (9th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given that probable cause for the arrest existed, the record does not support Cornu-Labat\u2019s assertion that Grant County\u2019s use of the Spillman computer system was the \u201cbut for\u201d or legal cause of his arrest. <em>See Joyce v. State, Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>155 Wash.2d 306, 119 P.3d 825, 833-34 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Cornu-Labat\u2019s defamation claim fails to identify a provably false statement or publication made by Grant County, the City of Quincy, or Officers Bakke and Clark. <em>See Due Tan v. Le, </em>177 Wash.2d 649, 300 P.3d 356, 363 (2013). As with defamation, \u201cfalse light claims require a showing of falsity and knowledge of, or reckless disregard for that falsity.\u201d <em>Corey v. Pierce Cnty., </em>154 Wash.App. 752, 225 P.3d 367, 373 (2010). Thus both claims fall together.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Finally, Cornu-Labat argues that a jury must decide whether the defendants\u2019 actions were outrageous. Although the elements of outrage \u201care generally factual questions for the jury,\u201d a district court may grant summary judgment if \u201creasonable minds could [not] differ on whether the conduct was sufficiently extreme to result in liability.\u201d <em>Strong v. Terrell, </em>147 Wash.App. 376, 195 P.3d 977, 981-82 (2008). Grant County\u2019s use of a pre-set field for inputting temporary protection order information into the National Crime Center Information database and the officers\u2019 use of that database did not exceed \u201call possible bounds of decency.\u201d <em>Grimsby v. Samson, </em>85 Wash.2d 52, 530 P.2d 291, 295 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
