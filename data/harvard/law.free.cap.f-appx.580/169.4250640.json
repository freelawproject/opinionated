Masilotti has also filed an application to proceed in forma pauperis. Because the appeal is interlocutory, we deny Masilotti\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-21\">Section 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken from ... a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title[,]\u201d or from interlocutory orders denying arbitration, but an appeal generally \u201cmay not be taken from an interlocutory orders granting a stay of any action\u201d referred to arbitration, or \u201cdirecting arbitration to proeeed[.]\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), (b) (2012); <em>see In re Pisgah Contractors, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 133, 135 (4th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">A \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 16 is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 86, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, where a district court orders arbitration and dismisses an action, \u201cleaving the court nothing to do but execute the judgment,\u201d the order is a final, appealable order. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, where the district court orders arbitration and enters \u201ca stay instead of a dismissal ... that order would not be appealable,\u201d as it is interlocutory. <em>Id. </em>at 87 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">The district court\u2019s February 28, 2014 order was not a final, appealable order. As we have previously explained, an order staying an action and compelling arbitration is not final and appealable even if the district' court \u201cretained jurisdiction through its stay only to enforce or vacate a forthcoming arbitration award[,]\u201d and therefore, as a \u201cpractical\u201d matter, \u201crendered] a final resolution as to all issues befor\u00e9 it.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. Prudential Sec. Inc., </em>4 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.1993). The fact that the district court\u2019s order directs that the case be administratively closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>does not render the order final and appeal-able. <em>See Pennm-Am. Ins. Co. v. Mapp, </em>521 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.2008) (finding that \u201can otherwise non-final order does not become final because the district court administratively closed the case after issuing the order. A reviewing court must consider whether an order is final and appealable without regard to the existence of the administrative closure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Accordingly, we deny Masilotti\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-18\"> Section 16(b) also permits the court to review, in its discretion, interlocutory orders that a district court certifies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (2012). The district court did not do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
