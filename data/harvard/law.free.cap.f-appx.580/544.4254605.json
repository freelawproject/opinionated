We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Re-galado-Escobar v. Holder, </em>717 F.3d 724, 726-27 (9th Cir.2013), and we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We deny the petition with respect to Ruvalca-ba\u2019s withholding of removal claim and remand his CAT claim for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The evidence presented by Ruvalcaba is not sufficient to compel the conclusion that his political opinion was a central reason for the mistreatment he suffered in Mexico. Ruvalcaba was beaten after he returned to the property that had previously been confiscated by the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) Committee and that \u201cwas still undergoing some kind of legal process.\u201d Significant to the BIA was the fact that the PRD Committee took the land of 25 other landowners at the same time, yet Ruvalcaba failed to present any evidence regarding the political affiliation of these other landowners. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Ruvalcaba was threatened and beaten as a result of a land dispute between his father and the government, and not because of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">Further, the record does not compel a finding that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Ruvalcaba would be persecuted if he is returned to Mexico. The BIA noted the amount of time that had elapsed since Ruvalcaba\u2019s mistreatment and took administrative notice of the fact that since his mistreatment, Ruvalcaba\u2019s political party, National Action Party (PAN), had, at least temporarily, assumed power. As such, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ruvalcaba did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon his return to Mexico, and the petition for review as to the withholding of removal claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Finally, both the IJ and the BIA failed to consider evidence of country conditions, specifically the country reports, when they determined that Ruvalcaba was ineligible for CAT relief. Because \u201cfailure ... to consider evidence of country conditions constitutes reversible error,\u201d we grant the petition for review as to Ruvalcaba\u2019s application for CAT relief and remand to the BIA with instructions to reconsider Ruval-caba\u2019s CAT claim in light of the country conditions in Mexico and state its conclusions in the record. <em>Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, </em>594 F.3d 701, 705 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
