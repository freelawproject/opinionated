We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2). <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The district court properly dismissed Dews\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Dews failed to allege facts showing that defendants knew that Dews faced substantial risk of serious harm to his health and disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (elements of an Eighth Amendment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The district court properly dismissed Dews\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claims because Dews failed to allege facts showing that defendants deprived him of a recognized property or liberty interest, <em>see Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-71, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), intentionally treated him differently from others who were similarly situated without a rational basis, <em>see N. Pacifica LLC v. City of Pacifica, </em>526 F.3d 478, 486 (9th Cir. 2008), or intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his membership in a protected class <em>see Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1166 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The district court properly dismissed Dews\u2019s conspiracy claim because Dews failed to allege an \u201cunderlying constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Lacey v. Maricopa County., </em>693 F.3d 896, 935 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">We do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Dews\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris, filed on April 21, 2014, is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
