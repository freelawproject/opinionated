Thus, the petition is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b521-18\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">De Hang Chen, a Chinese citizen, petitions for review from the denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-20\">Chen entered the United States without inspection, conceded his removability before an immigration judge, and, through counsel, sought asylum and related relief based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Chen acquired new counsel before his merits hearing, where he testified that his wife had been forced to undergo an abortion and that twice he had scuffled with a local village official in his native Fujian province. The IJ denied relief, finding Chen not credible \u2014 based on key inconsistencies between his testimony and written submissions \u2014 and his evidence insufficient to corroborate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-24\">In his appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Chen, through the same counsel, primarily challenged the adverse credibility finding, and he noted in one sentence that his application did not mention the altercations with the local official at his first lawyer\u2019s suggestion. The Board dismissed Chen\u2019s appeal, adding in a footnote that his contention about his first lawyer\u2019s advice \u201clack[ed] support in the record\u201d because Chen had not asserted any claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-25\">Now represented by a third lawyer, Chen petitions for review before this court, arguing that his <em>second </em>lawyer ineffectively assisted him by not submitting an updated application or corroborating evidence and by not asking him to clarify his inconsistent testimony. But we lack jurisdiction to consider any claim relating to the alleged ineffective assistance of Chen\u2019s second counsel because Chen did not exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Singh v. Holder, </em>720 F.3d 635, 640 (7th Cir.2013). Before presenting his ineffective-assistance claim to us, Chen first needed to present it to the Board, as in a motion to reopen, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); <em>United States v. Arita-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Campos, </em>607 F.3d 487, 491-92 (7th Cir. 2010); such a motion would have allowed the Board to consider whether his second lawyer was ineffective, <em>see Matter of Loza-da, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Although an issue is deemed exhausted if the Board addresses it on its own, <em>see Arobelidze v. Holder, </em>653 F.3d 513, 517 (7th Cir.2011), the Board\u2019s allusion in its footnote to the absence of a claim in no way constitutes exhaustion, <em>see Tian v. Holder, </em>745 F.3d 822, 826 (7th Cir.2014), and in any event Chen\u2019s reference before the Board was to his first lawyer, not the second lawyer of whom he complains here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
