In short, Florida Power &amp; Light (\u201cFPL\u201d) revoked Michael Kohl\u2019s unescorted nuclear access to its Turkey Point nuclear power plant after Kohl was arrested for grand theft. FPL contends that it was required to revoke Kohl\u2019s unescorted nuclear access due to certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) regulations, which state that an individual must be \u201ctrustworthy and reliable\u201d to maintain unescorted access. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, System Council UM (\u201cIBEW\u201d) filed a grievance on behalf of Kohl stating that \u201cI Mike Kohl, request that my Nuclear Access be reinstated and I be returned to work and made whole.\u201d After filing this grievance, the IBEW filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. While this petition was pending, FPL lifted its revocation of Kohl\u2019s unescorted access after the state dropped the grand theft charges. FPL then moved for the district court to dismiss the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction because the case was moot. The district court granted FPL\u2019s motion, holding that \u201c[sjince there is no longer an impediment to Kohl obtaining unescorted access, there is no effective relief the Court could grant via arbitration.\u201d (District Court\u2019s Order, Doc. 27 at 2). IBEW now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Molinos Valle Del Cibao, C. por A. v. Lama, </em>633 F.3d 1330, 1340 (11th Cir. 2011). And we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order denying a motion to compel arbitration. <em>Musnick v. King Motor Co. of Fort Lauderdale, </em>325 F.3d 1255, 1257 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">- IBEW\u2019s contention that the district court could not determine whether the underlying grievance itself is moot is without merit. Though cited by neither party, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in, <em>Vaden v. Discover Bank, </em>556 U.S. 49, 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 1273, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009), makes clear that \u201ca federal court should determine its jurisdiction by \u2018looking through\u2019 a [petition to compel arbitration] to the parties\u2019 underlying substantive \u25a0 controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (2012)). If a district court lacks jurisdiction over the substantive controversy, it lacks jurisdiction to compel arbitration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">But here, the district court incorrectly determined that the underlying controversy was moot. The district court acknowledged that IBEW\u2019s grievance on behalf' of Kohl \u201cspecifically raises the issue of back pay and reinstatement at the Turkey Point facility.\u201d (Doc. 27 at 2). Thus, even if the issue of nuclear access is moot, IBEW\u2019s request that Kohl be returned to his previous job and receive back pay is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">\u25a0In a footnote, the district court examined the issues of back pay and reinstatement, indicating that back pay and reinstatement are \u201ccollateral effect[s] of FPL\u2019s application of NRC regulations and [are] unrelated to the collective bargaining agreement between FPL and IBEW.\u201d (Doc. 27 at 2 n. 1). On remand, the district _court should consider only whether the collective bargaining agreement provides the arbitrator with authority to adjudicate this dispute, not issues that go to the merits, such as whether the NRC regulations render FPL\u2019s actions unreviewable. <em>See, e.g., International Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local 2150 v. NextEra Energy Point Beach, LLC, </em>762 F.3d 592, 596 (7th Cir.2014) (\u201c[W]e do <em>not </em>hold that the arbitrator may ... review and overturn [defendant\u2019s] revocation of [plaintiffs] unescorted access privileges.... [T]he arbitrator may well find the decision unre-viewable... .But the potential weakness of [plaintiffs] claim on the merits is no defense to the arbitrability of this dispute, as a threshold question.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Consequently, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying IBEW\u2019s Motion to Compel Arbitration and remand the case to the district court with instructions to determine whether FPL\u2019s determination of \u201caccess rights\u201d falls within the arbitration provisions of IBEW and FPL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Anders v. Hometown Mortg. Servs., Inc., </em>346 F.3d 1024, 1027 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 452, 123 S.Ct. 2402, 2407, 156 L.Ed.2d 414 (2003) (holding that \u201cgateway matters,\u201d such as the scope of an arbitration provision, should be determined by courts and not arbitrators)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">VACATED and REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
