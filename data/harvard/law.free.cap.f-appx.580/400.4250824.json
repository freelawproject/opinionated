The district court classified Grundy as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines after determining that two of Grundy\u2019s previous Ohio domestic violence convictions constituted \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d Grundy challenges the career offender enhancement, \u25a0 but the government responds that the appellate waiver in his plea agreement precludes review of the issue. We agree with the government and therefore DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-20\">From October ' 2007 until November 2012, Grundy conspired with seven others to distribute heroin in northeastern Ohio. He eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin. In his written plea agreement, Grundy acknowledged that his crime carried a maximum 40-year sentence. He also recognized that he and the government had made \u201cno agreement about the sentencing range to be used or sentence to be imposed in this case.\u201d (R. 107, Plea Agreement \u00b6 10.) Under the plea agreement, Grundy \u201cexpressly and voluntarily waive[d]\u201d most appellate and collateral-attack rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He reserved only his right to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-21\">(a) any punishment in excess of the statutory maximum; (b) any sentence to the extent it exceeds the greater of any mandatory minimum sentence or the maximum of the sentencing imprisonment range determined under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in accordance with the sentencing stipulations and computations in this agreement, using the Criminal History Category found applicable by the Court; or (c) the Court\u2019s determination of Defendant\u2019s Criminal History Category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-22\">(R. 107, Plea Agreement \u00b6 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-23\">The district court classified Grundy as a career offender under the guidelines due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to his previous domestic violence convictions. After the court granted the government\u2019s motion for a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, it sentenced Grundy to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the resulting guidelines range (151-188 months). Grundy appeals, invoking only the second appellate waiver exception, subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">A defendant \u201cmay waive any right, even a constitutional right, by means of a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>388 F.3d 197, 199 (6th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). So long as the defendant knowingly and voluntarily enters a plea agreement including a waiver of appellate rights, we enforce the waiver according to its terms. <em>E.g., United States v. Toth, </em>668 F.3d 374, 378 (6th Cir.2012). \u201cThis rule reflects the mutually beneficial possibilities of the waiver as a plea-bargaining tool: the defendant may use it to seek concessions, and the government hopes to use it to avoid unnecessary appellate litigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Tyus, </em>526 F. App\u2019x 581, 582 (6th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Because Grundy does not contest the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty \u2022plea, we look to the language of the appellate waiver. Grundy argues that subsection (b) reserves his right to appeal the district court\u2019s \u201cerroneous application of the career offender enhancement.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 1-2.) It does not. By the plain terms of the waiver, subsection (b) preserves Grundy\u2019s right to appeal only to the extent his sentence exceeds the maximum of the guidelines imprisonment range or the statutory minimum, whichever is greater. This provision further presumes a guidelines range \u201cdetermined ... in accordance with the sentencing stipulations and computations in this agreement, using the Criminal History Category found applicable by the Court.\u201d Here, the agreement states that the parties left the sentencing range undecided, \u201cother than to stipulate to the computation of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines offense level.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (R. 107, Plea Agreement \u00b6 10; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 25.) To that end, paragraph twelve, titled \u201cStipulated Guideline Computation,\u201d prescribes a base offense level of 28 as \u201ca correct computation of the applicable offense level.\u201d Though the plea agreement did not anticipate the district court\u2019s use of a career offender offense level, Grundy\u2019s 151-month sentence nonetheless falls within the sentencing range for the stipulated offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of VI (140-175 months). U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table. Grundy therefore cannot appeal under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Nothing in <em>United States v. Hockenber-ry, </em>730 F.3d 645 (6th Cir.2013), cited by Grundy, counsels otherwise. In <em>Hocken-berry, </em>we reached the merits of the defendant\u2019s challenge to his career criminal enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> despite the presence of a similar appellate waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 656, 665. Yet the <em>Hockenberry </em>waiver differed from Grundy\u2019s in one important respect: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>it specifically reserved the defendant\u2019s right to appeal his \u201cclassification ... as an Armed Career Criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Grundy did not reserve the right to appeal his classification as a career offender. Accordingly, we enforce the appellate waiver and DISMISS the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. Though the agreement contemplates reductions for acceptance of responsibility and cooperation with law enforcement, it clarifies that these adjustments remain within the court's discretion. (R. 107, Plea Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 25.) Grundy does not contest that the government honored its commitments to support these reductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\">. This Court recognizes that the guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4131.1 and \u00a7 4131.2(a) is largely similar to the Armed Career Criminal Act's definition of \"violent felony\u201d; consequently, cases interpreting either may provide \"a useful comparison.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sawyers, </em>409 F.3d 732, 740 n. 9 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330, 334 n. 5 (4th Cir.2001)), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Vanhook, </em>640 F.3d 706 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-16\">. The government has filed a motion to take judicial notice of certain documents relating to the merits of Grundy's appeal. Because we dismiss this appeal in accordance with the appellate waiver, we deny the motion as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
