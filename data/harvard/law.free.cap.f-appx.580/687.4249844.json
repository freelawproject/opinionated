MORITZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-21\">Plaintiff Christopher Michael Hale, while a prisoner of the State of New Mexi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>co, filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action alleging interference with religious exercise, denial of medical care after being sprayed with mace, retaliation for filing grievances, and excessive force while incarcerated. He appeals from the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his claims against defendants GEO Group and the New Mexico Department of Corrections and granting summary judgment to the remaining defendants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and dismiss the appeal as frivolous. We also deny Mr. Hale\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (IFP).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Because Mr. Hale appears pro se, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 &amp; n. 3 (10th Cir.1991) (discussing <em>Haines v. Ker-ner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam)). But this court will not act as a pro se litigant\u2019s advocate. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, although we make some allowances for \u2018the pro se plaintiffs failure to cite proper legal authority, his confusion of various legal theories, his poor syntax and sentence construction, or his unfamiliarity with pleading requirements,\u2019 ..., the court cannot take on the responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir.2005) (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Hall, </em>935 F.2d at 1110).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The district court\u2019s July 11, 2011, September 28, 2012, and July 26, 2013, orders contain a thorough and well-organized analysis of Mr. Hale\u2019s claims. Mr. Hale\u2019s arguments on appeal, however, are merely conclusory statements, <em>e.g. </em>\u201cIssue 1: Assault by Capt. Mitchell.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 3. Further, although Hale named several individuals as defendants, his appeal brief refers to only two of those defendants \u2014 Mitchell and Perry. <em>See id. </em>at 2. Finally, Mr. Hale fails to develop any argument demonstrating that the district court\u2019s rationale is faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Under these circumstances, we conclude this appeal is frivolous. Consequently, we deny Mr. Hale\u2019s motion for IFP due to his failure to raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991). Further, because Mr. Hale was incarcerated when he filed his notice of appeal, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, applies and Mr. Hale is \u201crequired to pay the full amount of [the] filing fee.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1). <em>See also Brown v. Eppler, </em>725 F.3d 1221, 1230 (10th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The appeal is dismissed. Mr. Hale\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and he is directed to pay the full $505.00 appellate filing fee forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>trines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
