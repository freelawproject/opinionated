We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and review de novo questions of law. <em>Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>706 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.2013). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying for lack of prima facie eligibility for relief Reyes-Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen to seek cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1080 (\u201cThe BIA is entitled to deny a motion to reopen where the applicant fails to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief.\u201d). The new evidence accompanying Reyes-Garcia\u2019s motion did not reveal a reasonable likelihood that he would succeed in demonstrating the requisite exceptional and extremely unusual hardship in reopened proceedings. <em>See Garcia v. Holder, </em>621 F.3d 906, 912-13 (9th Cir.2010)-(stating that prima facie eligibility \u201cis established when \u2018the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied,\u2019 \u201d and holding that, where hardship evidence \u201cmight ... warrant reopening,\u201d the BIA does \u201cnot abuse its discretion by concluding otherwise\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the BIA did not err by not noting the government\u2019s lack of opposition to Reyes-Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Limsico v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 210, 213 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the BIA does \u201cnot err\u201d by denying a \u201cmotion to reopen without an opposition\u201d from the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We are not persuaded the BIA\u2019s characterization of Reyes-Garcia\u2019s daughter\u2019s psychological condition as \u201csevere\u201d indicates that the BIA failed to give proper consideration to Reyes-Garcia\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">To the extent that Reyes-Garda claims that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen violated due process, his claim lacks merit. <em>See Cruz Rendon v. Holder, </em>603 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cIn order to prevail on [a due process] claim, the alien ... must show prejudice, \u2018which means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
