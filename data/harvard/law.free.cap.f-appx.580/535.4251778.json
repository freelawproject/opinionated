We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The district court did not clearly err in ruling that \u201cECODIESEL\u201d was a descriptive mark, rather than a suggestive mark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Lahoti v. VeriCheck, Inc., </em>586 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2009). The district court did not violate the anti-dissection rule when it examined the two components of the ECODIESEL mark and then analyzed the composite term as a whole. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1200-01; <em>Surgicenters of Am., Inc. v. Med. Dental Surgeries, Co., </em>601 F.2d 1011, 1015-18 (9th Cir.1979). Nor did the district court clearly err in holding that no \u201cmental leap is required in order to reach a conclusion\u201d that the ECODIESEL mark refers to environmentally friendly diesel fuel. <em>Rudolph Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Realys, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 1195, 1198 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Surgicenters, </em>601 F.2d at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Volkswagen\u2019s registration of \u201cECO-DIESEL\u201d in 1992 (a mark it apparently abandoned in 1999), provides little evidence of the distinctiveness of Unitek\u2019s mark, given that the more widespread use of the \u201ceco-\u201d prefix since 1992 has reduced its distinctiveness. Nor does the attempted registration of the term \u201cECO-DIESEL\u201d by Jeff Gordon provide evidence of distinctiveness, given that Gordon\u2019s application was ultimately rejected or abandoned. The other \u201cECO-\u201d registered marks cited by Unitek likewise provide little evidence of distinctiveness, because they are not \u201chighly similar\u201d to Unitek\u2019s mark, <em>Lahoti, </em>586 F.3d at 1199, and relate to different goods, <em>see id. </em>at 1201. Finally, the evidentiary value of Chrysler\u2019s statements regarding the brand strength of \u201cEcoDiesel\u201d as applied to its diesel engines is slight. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Unitek had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the trademark infringement claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Herb Reed Enters., LLC v. Florida Entm\u2019t Mgmt., Inc., </em>736 F.3d 1239, 1247 (9th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Un-itek had not established a likelihood of irreparable harm. <em>See id. </em>at 1249. Although the record reflects some effort by Unitek to create a viable #2 diesel fuel product, the record does not suggest that Chrysler\u2019s use of \u201cEcoDiesel\u201d will have any appreciable effect on those efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. Unitek does not argue on appeal that the ECODIESEL mark has acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-19\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on this ground, we do not reach its analysis of the likelihood of confusion question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
