Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed.Cir. 1991), Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(A). This filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v.

Cross\u2019s petition concerning the Board\u2019s final order was received by this court after the statutory deadline for filing a petition. Because Cross\u2019s petition was not received by this court within 60 days of the date of the Board\u2019s decision, the court has no authority to hear the case, regardless of Cross\u2019s arguments as to her efforts to ensure the timely delivery of her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
