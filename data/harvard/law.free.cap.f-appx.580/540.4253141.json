We review for substantial evidence and will reverse only if the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Jiang v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1086, 1091 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Assuming that Wu engaged in other resistance to China\u2019s \u201cone couple, one child\u201d policy, the record does not compel the conclusion that Wu suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his resistance. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1158-59 (9th Cir.2004). Although his wife\u2019s forced abortion serves as some proof that he suffered past persecution, that alone is not sufficient to establish past persecution. <em>Jiang, </em>611 F.3d at 1095-96. To further support his claim, Wu argues that he suffered past persecution when the director of the local birth planning office threatened to have him sterilized if he ever again attempted to have another child with his wife. We have held that \u201crepeated and especially menacing death threats can constitute a primary part of a past persecution claim, particularly where those threats are combined with confrontation or other mistreatment.\u201d <em>Lim v. I.N.S., </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). By his own admission, however, Wu did not receive \u201crepeated and especially menacing death threats.\u201d Rather, he was threatened with sterilization only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Wu further argues that he suffered past persecution because his wife was fired from her job for attempting to have a second child and that his wife\u2019s unemployment caused financial hardship for his family. Nevertheless, Wu failed to specifically raise this issue in his appeal before the BIA and we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>Young v. Holder, </em>697 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Wu does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Wu testified at his removal proceeding that he wants to have more children, but fears that he will be sterilized by birth planning authorities should his wife become pregnant again. Wu\u2019s fear, however, is too speculative to qualify as objectively reasonable. <em>See Nagoulko v. I.N.S., </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The BIA correctly concluded that Wu\u2019s failure to establish a well-founded fear of persecution forecloses eligibility under the more demanding standard of eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006). Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Wu failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured if removed to China. <em>See Walckary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
