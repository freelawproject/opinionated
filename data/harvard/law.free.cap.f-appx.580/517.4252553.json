We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We \u201clook to the IJ\u2019s oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Tekle v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see id., </em>and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding based upon Singh\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding the identity of his family members sought by police and the nature of the mistreatment Singh suffered while in police custody. <em>See Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005). This finding goes to the heart of Singh\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741-42 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The IJ did not err in deciding that Singh\u2019s father\u2019s death certificate, which did not state a cause of death, failed adequately to corroborate Singh\u2019s claim. <em>Cf. Don, </em>476 F.3d at 744 (\u201cThe IJ adequately articulated his decision, and did not abuse his discretion by failing to interpret the evidence in the manner advocated by Don.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Because the IJ made her credibility finding without consideration of Singh\u2019s original asylum application, the IJ and the BIA did not err in failing thoroughly to address Singh\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance in the preparation of Singh\u2019s original asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The BIA did not err in denying Singh\u2019s motion to remand because Singh failed to demonstrate why he could not have obtained and presented the newly-submitted evidence to the IJ. <em>See Goel, </em>490 F.3d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Singh failed credibly to establish that he is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b543-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
