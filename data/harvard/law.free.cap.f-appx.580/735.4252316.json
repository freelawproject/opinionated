Ward, a veteran of the U.S. Army Reserves, appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of his civilian employer, United Parcel Service (UPS), on his discrimination and retaliation claims brought under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as well as his discrimination claim brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review of the parties\u2019 arguments and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">In 2003 Ward left his job at UPS after being called to active-duty military service. While stationed in Iraq, he suffered a combat injury to his left knee. As a result, when Ward returned from Iraq, UPS denied his July 2005 request to return to work because his service-related injury prevented him from performing any full-time union job at the Anniston Center where he had worked. Ward then filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in the fall of 2005, asking that UPS reinstate him to full-time employment. Ward and UPS settled this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>In 2006 UPS placed Ward in an operations-clerk position, but he was removed from that job in October 2009 when its former occupant, who had seniority, returned from her own tour of military duty. Ward then remained out of work until early 2011, when he returned to work at UPS after accepting two part-time positions that involved scanning and loading packages. Ward\u2019s USERRA discrimination and retaliation claims challenge UPS\u2019s actions that kept Ward out of work during this 14-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In March 2011, Ward\u2019s UPS supervisor learned, that Ward was going to see his private physician because he was experiencing pain in his leg. Ward\u2019s supervisor later instructed Ward to see a company physician before he could return to work. The company doctor cleared Ward to return to work. Ward also provided UPS with a note from his private doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Then in May 2011, UPS officials met with Ward and accused him of submitting a falsified doctor\u2019s note from his private doctor during the March 2011 events just described. Ward alleged that he was terminated at this meeting, although UPS disputes that fact. Regardless, apparently after investigating who prepared the disputed doctor\u2019s note, UPS told Ward to return to work. UPS also paid Ward for two days of missed work between the date of the meeting and when Ward returned to work. At some later date, Ward again changed to the operations-clerk position and he was still employed in that job with UPS as of May 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In May 2012, Ward filed suit against UPS and two of his supervisors alleging discrimination and retaliation under the USERRA, discrimination and retaliation under the ADA, and various state law tort claims. After discovery, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Ward\u2019s claims, which the district court granted. Ward now appeals the granting of summary judgment on three claims: (1) the USERRA discrimination claim, based on UPS\u2019s failure to employ Ward between October 2009 and January 2011; (2) the USERRA retaliation claim, based on UPS\u2019s failure to employ him during the same time period; and (3) the ADA discrimination claim with regard to UPS\u2019s conduct in March and May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1162. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the non-movant then bears the responsibility to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">A. USERRA Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Ward first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his USERRA discrimination claim. Ward claims that UPS did not allow him to combine an open part-time scanning position with another part-time clerk position occupied by an employee who had less seniority. Ward also claims that UPS made it onerous for him to return to work by requiring him to submit to numerous, unwarranted medical evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Under the USERRA, a person who is a member of or who has performed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>uniformed service shall not be denied \u201cinitial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership\u201d or performance of service. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a). An employer, therefore, violates the USERRA where the employee\u2019s membership or service in the uniformed services is a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s failure to reemploy the individual. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4311(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the USERRA, the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his military membership or service was a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s decision. <em>See Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir.2005). A motivating factor does not necessarily have to be the sole cause for the employer\u2019s decision, but is defined as one of the factors that a truthful employer would list as its reasons for its decision. <em>Id. </em>A court can infer a discriminatory motivation from a variety of considerations, such as: (1) the temporal proximity between the plaintiffs military activity and the adverse employment action; (2) inconsistencies between the proffered reason for the employer\u2019s decision and other actions of the employer; (3) an employer\u2019s expressed hostility toward members of the protected class combined with its knowledge of the plaintiffs military activity; and (4) disparate treatment of similarly situated employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Here, Ward did not present sufficient evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that his military service was a motivating factor in UPS\u2019s failure to employ him between October 2009 and January 2011. Notably, he failed to offer evidence of express hostility towards members of the military or disparate treatment of similarly situated employees. <em>See id. </em>At best, Ward attempted to show inconsistencies in UPS\u2019s proffered reasons for its actions. But the evidence Ward offered did not show a material dispute of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">First, Ward failed to offer concrete evidence \u2014 beyond his own deposition testimony claiming he believed another qualifying position existed \u2014 to dispute UPS\u2019s decision not to combine two part-time positions. Ward\u2019s failure is particularly significant given UPS\u2019s Business Manager Russell Hamrac\u2019s testimony that the second position Ward pointed to (1) did not meet Ward\u2019s medical restrictions and (2) necessarily had to be performed at the same time as the other available part-time position. Second, Ward did not offer sufficient evidence to dispute UPS\u2019s contention that its requests for additional medical evaluations were good faith efforts to get updated information on Ward\u2019s physical restrictions. Nor has Ward offered evidence that these requests prevented him from returning to work during the disputed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Because Ward has not shown a material dispute of fact as to whether his military service was a motivating factor in UPS\u2019s failure to employ him between October 2009 and January 2011, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of UPS on Ward\u2019s USERRA discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">B. USERRA Retaliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Ward next argues that the district court wrongly concluded that he had failed to show evidence of retaliation under the US-ERRA. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(b). He contends that UPS retaliated against him for filing his 2005 DOL complaint by holding him out of work for 14 months after he was removed from the operations-clerk position in 2009. Ward argues that a jury could find causation despite the lack of temporal proximity, because UPS retaliat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ed against him when the \u201cfirst opportunity\u201d presented itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The USERRA prohibits an employer from taking an adverse employment action against employees who seek to enforce the Act\u2019s protections. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(b). An employer engages in prohibited retaliatory conduct where it takes an adverse action against an employee motivated by that employee\u2019s efforts to enforce the US-ERRA, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of the employee\u2019s protected activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4311(c)(2); see <em>also Sheehan v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed.Cir.2001) (stating that the USER-RA\u2019s enactment confirmed \u201cthat the standard of proof in a discrimination or retaliation case is the so-called \u2018but-for\u2019 test\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In the context of employment retaliation cases, a plaintiffs burden to prove causation can be met by showing a close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and adverse-employment action. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Where there was a significant time gap between the protected activity and the adverse action, the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to demonstrate a causal connection, such as a pattern of antagonism or that the adverse action was the first opportunity for the employer to retaliate. <em>See, e.g., Kachmar v. SunGard Data Sys., Inc., </em>109 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.1997) (evidence of a \u201cpattern of antagonism\u201d following the protected activity may give rise to the inference of causation); <em>Dale v. Wynne, </em>497 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1346 (M.D.Ala.2007) (\u201cIn this instance, a six-week gap is enough to show temporal proximity, particularly because Dale\u2019s return to work was the first opportunity Wilson had to retaliate against her.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that Ward failed to point to evidence supporting his claim that his 2005 DOL complaint was the motivating factor behind UPS\u2019s allegedly adverse actions in 2009. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(b), (c)(2). The temporal gap between the two events was too long to demonstrate causation without additional evidence. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364 (\u201c[M]ere temporal proximity, without more, must be \u2018very close.\u2019 \u201d). Although Ward claimed UPS\u2019s employment decision in 2009 was its \u201cfirst opportunity\u201d to retaliate, the record does not support this assertion given that UPS made at least two other intervening decisions to reemploy Ward. Because Ward has not offered evidence showing a causal connection between his 2005 DOL complaint and his period of unemployment between 2009 and 2011, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for UPS on Ward\u2019s USERRA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">III. ADA Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Lastly, Ward argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment on his ADA discrimination claim with regard to the events occurring in March and May 2011. He argues that the court wrongly concluded that his termination in May 2011 and his temporary loss of two and a half days\u2019 worth of pay did not qualify as adverse employment actions. Additionally, Ward argues that he presented sufficient evidence that he had been discriminated against on account of his disability, which was a limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The ADA holds that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>analyze ADA discrimination claims under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. See <em>Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff may show that (1) he was disabled, (2) he was qualified to perform the job, and (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability. <em>Cleveland, </em>369 F.3d at 1193. If the plaintiff meets his prima facie burden, and the defendant presents a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, the plaintiff may then demonstrate that the reason given was a pretext for disability discrimination.. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">We have also cautioned that \u201cestablishing the elements of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework is not, and never was intended to be, the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case.\u201d <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011). A plaintiff also may defeat a summary judgment motion by presenting \u201ca convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Here, even assuming both that Ward\u2019s permanent limp qualified as a disability under the ADA and that he suffered an adverse employment action, the district court correctly concluded that he failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between the adverse action and the disability. The record does not support Ward\u2019s claim that he was singled out for the company-doctor examination based on his permanent limp. To the contrary, Ward does not dispute that he was having leg pain and was going to see his personal doctor. The record also shows that UPS had a policy of sending its workers to a company doctor when they complained of pain while on the job, which Ward does not dispute. Neither does he demonstrate that UPS discriminatorily applied this policy or that he was treated differently than other employees in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Likewise, Ward failed to offer evidence that his alleged termination was related to his disability instead of UPS\u2019s concerns that he may have falsified a doctor\u2019s note. As a result, Ward has not shown a material dispute of fact on his ADA discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Because the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of UPS on Ward\u2019s USERRA and ADA claims, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. Ward's suit also raised USERRA claims against UPS officials Russell Hamrac and Ron Headley, as well as several state-law tort claims. Ward does not challenge the disposition of these claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
