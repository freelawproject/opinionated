We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-21\">We lack jurisdiction over Encarnacion\u2019s appeal because it is taken from a nonfinal order. With several exceptions not appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>cable here, a district court order is appeal-able only if the district court enters a final order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A final order is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lyb-rand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). We lack jurisdiction over an appeal where, as here, the district court enters final judgment despite overlooking claims contained in the complaint. <em>See United States ex rel. Polansky v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>762 F.3d 160 (2d Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The district court decision and order is silent as to Encarnacion\u2019s allegations that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. There is no apparent explanation for the district\u2019s court\u2019s silence, and its ruling on Encarnacion\u2019s double jeopardy claim is unrelated to his Eighth Amendment claim. If the district court intended to dismiss the Eighth Amendment claims as well, then it may clarify its reasons for dismissal, and re-enter final judgment. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment claim will likely proceed to final adjudication. Either of those scenarios would establish a jurisdictional basis for a subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
