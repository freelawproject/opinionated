We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, we review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Charco-Silva gave conflicting testimony on the length of his trip to Mexico. He initially testified that the trip lasted 18 days. He subsequently testified that it lasted four months. The IJ noted the inconsistency but, without making an express finding on the length of the trip, found that Charco-Silva \u201chas established that he has been physically present in the United States for the requisite ten year period.\u201d \u201cBased on these discrepancies,\u201d the BIA found \u201cclear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that respondent was physically present in the United States for a continuous period- of not less than 10 years.\u201d Charco-Silva moved for reconsideration, arguing that the BIA had engaged in improper factfinding and that \u201cthe Board should have remanded for further, specific fact-finding before the IJ on Respondent\u2019s trip to his native country before finding him statutorily ineligible for Cancellation of Removal.\u201d The BIA rejected Charco-Silva\u2019s argument, concluding that it had properly applied its clear error standard of review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We recognize that there are two ways to read the record, but we conclude that the BIA erred under either reading. Under one reading, the IJ never made a factual finding on the length of Charco-Silva\u2019s trip to Mexico. If that was the case, then the BIA was required to remand the matter to the IJ rather than engaging in its own factfinding. <em>See Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>683 F.3d 1164, 1170 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201cWhere the IJ has not made a finding of fact On a disputed matter, and such a finding is necessary to resolution of the case, the BIA must remand to the IJ to make the required finding; it may not conduct its own fact-finding.\u201d (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv))).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Under the alternative reading of the record, the IJ made an implicit finding, based on all of the evidence in the record, that the trip lasted 18 days rather than four months. If so, then the BIA was not free to overturn that finding simply because it \u201cwould have weighed the evidence differently or decided the facts differently had it been the factfinder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1171 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord In re R-S-H, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003). On the contrary, \u201c[wjhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>683 F.3d at 1171 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)); <em>accord In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 263 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The government suggests that the BIA\u2019s decision could be sustained as a finding of insufficient evidence rather than as a finding of clear error on the part of the IJ. The BIA, however, reversed the IJ on the ground of clear error, not insufficient evidence, and we may not deny a petition for review on a ground upon which the BIA did not rely. <em>See Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\u201cIn reviewing the decision of the BIA, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>consider only the grounds relied upon by that agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Where, as here, the BIA fails to follow its own regulations and makes factual findings, it commits an error of law, which we have jurisdiction to correct. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>688 F.3d at 1170; <em>see also Hernandez-Velasquez v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cAn error of law is an abuse of discretion\u201d). We therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA to remand to the IJ to make an express finding of fact on the length of Charco-Silva\u2019s trip to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
