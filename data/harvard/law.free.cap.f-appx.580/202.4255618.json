We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Mu\u2019 min\u2019s motion for injunctive relief and expe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>dited treatment and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Mu\u2019min v. Kincaid, </em>No. 7:13-cv-00588-GEC (W.D.Va. Feb. 19, 2014).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-18\"> Mu\u2019min's RLUIPA claim was not properly before the district court. He did not clearly assert a desire to raise a RLUIPA claim until his motion to reconsider and at no time fairly communicated his intention to the district court prior to its ruling. Because the district court dismissed Mu\u2019 min's civil action without prejudice, nothing prevents Mu\u2019min from pursuing a RLUIPA claim in a new action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
