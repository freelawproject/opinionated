We affirm the custodial portion of the sentence but vacate the fine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">Defendant argues that the court improperly applied a four-level adjustment for his role in organizing criminal activity involving five or more participants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Specifically, he argues that the evidence presented prior to sentencing was insufficient to support the court\u2019s findings regarding the fifth participant, and the FBI report proffered as evidence at sentencing was inadmissible because it was not sufficiently reliable and consisted of hearsay. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Martinez, </em>556 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a)) (at sentencing, \u201ca district court may consider any relevant information, \u2018provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u2019 \u201d); Fed.R.Evid. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">This case is distinguishable from the case cited by Defendant for the proposition that the FBI report is not sufficiently reliable for the court to consider. An FBI report detailing an interview with a named victim of the fraudulent scheme is far from the uncorroborated and contradictory statement made by an unidentified witness that the Second Circuit rejected in <em>United States v. Chunzar-Plazas, </em>45 F.3d 51, 58 (2d Cir.1995). It is not error for a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tencing court to conclude that an FBI report such as the one proffered here has \u201csufficient indica of reliability\u201d to be taken into account at sentencing. <em>See e.g., United States v. Burns, </em>894 F.2d 334, 336-37 (9th Cir.1990) (investigative report prepared by Secret Service agents was sufficiently reliable to be admissible at sentencing). Further, it is irrelevant that the FBI report contains hearsay. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (\u201ccourt may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence\u201d); Fed. R.Evid. 1101(d)(3) (Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in sentencing proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In light of the evidence in the FBI report concerning the fifth participant, this Court is not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>339 F.3d 1080, 1082 (9th Cir.2003) (describing the standard for clear error) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Treadwell, </em>593 F.3d 990, 999 (9th Cir.2010) (factual findings are reviewed for clear error). We affirm the district court\u2019s application of the role enhancement and the term of incarceration set in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Defendant argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing a fine because the information in the presentence report established that Defendant had insufficient assets and earning potential to pay it. <em>See United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998) (a probation officer\u2019s report is sufficient evidence for purposes of sentencing). The Government concedes this point and agrees that the fine should be vacated because its imposition could hinder payment of the restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(b) (\u201cthe court shall impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine will not impair the ability of the defendant to make restitution\u201d). We agree that the fine should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

The opinion holds that a notary seal is an \"authentication feature\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028, and as such, the district court was correct in applying an enhancement for use of an authentication feature under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(A)(ii) (formerly \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)( 10)(B)(ii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
