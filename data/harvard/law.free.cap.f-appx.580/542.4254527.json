England, Jr., Chief District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">The district court properly denied California state prisoner Anthony Bravo\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which is based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">\u201cWhen more than one state court has adjudicated a claim, we analyze the last reasoned decision.\u201d <em>Barker v. Fleming, </em>428 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). An exception to this rule arises when \u201cthe last reasoned decision adopted or substantially incorporated the reasoning from a previous decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1093. That exception does not apply here where the California Court of Appeal did not discuss or reference the opinion of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-23\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). By omitting the language regarding a \u201creasonable probability,\u201d the Court of Appeal impermissibly held Petitioner to a heightened standard on the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-24\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-25\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s reliance on an improper standard as to the prejudice prong of Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance argument requires that this panel review his claim de novo. <em>See Cooper-Smith v. Palmateer, </em>397 F.3d 1236, 1243 (9th Cir. 2005). However, even under a de novo standard of review, Petitioner failed to establish either prejudice or deficient performance under <em>Strickland. </em>Any failure by defense counsel to investigate the potential witness or to present evidence of the facts included in her declaration was harmless in light of the overwhelming evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>dence of Petitioner\u2019s guilt. This evidence includes Petitioner\u2019s refusal to comply with police orders over an extended period of time, the discovery of firearms and ammunition in a locked safe located near where Petitioner had been standing, the presence of men\u2019s clothing in Petitioner\u2019s size in the bedroom, and bills and registration documents in Petitioner\u2019s name in the bedroom. Moreover, defense witness Jonathan Ortiz was less than credible \u2014 as Petitioner himself acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">As to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deficient performance prong, \u201cthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (quoting <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)). Petitioner offers no evidence to suggest that counsel\u2019s decisions were not \u201cbased on professional judgment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 681, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and Petitioner therefore fails to meet his \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>Murtishaw v. Woodford, </em>255 F.3d 926, 939 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b568-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
