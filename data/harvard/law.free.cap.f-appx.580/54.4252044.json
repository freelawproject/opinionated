Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-19\">In 1996, a jury found Torres-Montalvo guilty of one count of conspiracy to kidnap, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(c), two counts of kidnapping (one count for each -victim), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1), and one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. We affirmed. <em>See United States v. Palmar-Ruedas, </em>121 F.3d 841, 859 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-20\">In 2013, Torres-Montalvo filed in the District Court a motion under \u00a7 3682(c)(2), seeking to reduce his sentence through the retroactive application of Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (providing that Amendment 591 is retroactive). The District Court denied the motion, holding that Amendment 591 offered no relief because the sentencing court \u201cselected the appropriate offense guideline!)]\u201d Torres-Mon-talvo appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-21\">Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). A sentence may be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only when \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.; United, States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 614 (3d Cir.2002). The applicable policy statement provides that a sentence reduction is not authorized if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A sentencing court is required to \u201cfollow [a sequence of steps] to arrive at the correct guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Boney, </em>769 F.3d 153, 160, 2014 WL 4494861, at *5 (3d Cir. Sept. 15, 2014); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>155 F.3d 682, 684-85 (3d Cir.1998) (describing each step). At the first step, a sentencing court refers to the Statutory Index of the Guidelines Manual in choosing the offense guideline in Chapter Two that is applicable to the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(a); lB1.2(a). Prior to Amendment 591, a sentencing court proceeding under the first step was authorized to use the Statutory Index as an \u201caid in finding the most applicable guideline among several possibilities.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>245 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir.2001). The sentencing court could select an offense guideline based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, even if that conduct did not result in conviction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>186 F.3d 290, 297 (3d Cir.1999). Amendment 591 modified the Guidelines to require a sentencing court to apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index that corresponds to the statute under which the defendant was convicted. <em>See Diaz, </em>245 F.3d at 302 (3d Cir.2001) (noting that the \u201camendment reflects a change from the permissive to the mandatory.\u201d); <em>see also Boney, </em>769 F.3d at 160 n. 6, 2014 WL 4494861, at *5 n. 6 (\u201cAmendment 591 modified the Sentencing Guidelines to clarify that the sentencing court <em>must </em>use the applicable guideline provided in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) for the offense of conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In this case, at step one, the sentencing court referred to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1, the applicable offense guideline for Torres-Montalvo\u2019s kidnapping conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because this is the procedure now mandated by Amendment 591, that Amendment did not have the effect of lowering Torres-Montalvo\u2019s applicable sentencing range. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Therefore, Torres-Montalvo is not entitled to a reduction in his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To the extent that Torres-Montalvo challenges the sentencing court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>subsequent assessment of the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, and adjustments, relief is not available. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that Amendment 591 applies only to the selection of the relevant offense guideline); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>293 F.3d 584, 586 (2d Cir.2002) (stating that the \u201cplain wording of Amendment 591 applies <em>only </em>to the choice of the applicable offense guideline, not to the subsequent selection of the base offense level.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Because the District Court did not err in denying Torres-Montalvo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we conclude that his appeal presents us with no substantial question. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-23\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Where the denial of relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) involves a legal question concerning eligibility, we review the District Court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>562 F.3d 275, 277 (3d Cir.2009). \"By contrast, when the district court determines that a defendant is eligible for relief but declines to reduce his sentence, our review is for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>696 F.3d 416, 420 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing <em>Sanchez, </em>562 F.3d at 277 n. 4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">. The sentencing court separated Torres-Montalvo\u2019s convictions into two groups. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.1 (a). The first group consisted of conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping of one victim, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The second group included conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping of the other victim, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The sentencing court applied \u00a7 2A4.1 to both groups because kidnapping carried the highest total offense level. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.3(a); <em>see also United States v. Salgado, </em>745 F.3d 1135, 1137 (11th Cir.2014) (noting that U.S.S.G. 3D1.3(a) required an assessment of \"which of the three grouped convictions would yield the highest adjusted offense level by calculating Salgado\u2019s offense level under the guideline for each offense.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
