See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Eldis Gjikani, a native and citizen of Albania, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006). We dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that Gjikani\u2019s asylum application was untimely because the facts underlying that determination are disputed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Sumolang v. Holder, </em>723 F.3d 1080, 1082 (9th Cir. 2013) (no jurisdiction to review untimeliness determination based on underlying factual dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Gjikani fled Albania in 2004 due to a blood feud with an individual who harassed his family and sought to harm him. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Gjikani failed to establish that he suffered harm or fears harm from the Albanian government or a source that the government was or would be unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2005) (record did not compel government was unable or unwilling to control harassers); <em>see also Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, </em>594 F.3d 701, 705 n. 6 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[cjountry reports are accorded special weight in removal proceedings\u201d). Contrary to Gjikani\u2019s contentions in his opening brief, it was his burden to demonstrate that the Albanian government was unable or unwilling to control the person he fears. <em>See Nahrvani, </em>399 F.3d at 1154. Gjikani\u2019s contention that the agency failed to consider certain evidence does not overcome the presumption that the agency reviewed all of the evidence he presented. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000). Thus, Gjikani\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Finally, Gjikani does not make any arguments in his opening brief regarding the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
