We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, including repeated inconsistencies about where Zhao was working when he learned of his sister\u2019s illness, the inconsistency between his testimony and his household registration regarding his occupation, and a finding that Zhao\u2019s demeanor undermined his credibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding reasonable under the totality of circumstances); <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (noting special deference to demeanor-based credibility findings); <em>see also Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011) (BIA not compelled to accept petitioner\u2019s explanations for inconsistencies). In the absence of credible testimony, Zhao\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Because Zhao\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the BIA found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
