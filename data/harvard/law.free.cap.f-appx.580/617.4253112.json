We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2010). We review de novo due process challenges to immigration decisions. <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Zuo\u2019s omission from his application and declaration that family planning officials imprisoned him for approximately one month, and inconsistencies in Zuo\u2019s testimony regarding where he was when his wife was forced to have an IUD. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011) (omitted incidents of arrest and mistreatment supported adverse credibility finding); <em>Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1046-47 (in post-REAL ID act cases, an inconsistency need not go to the heart of the claim, but when it does, it is \u201cof great weight\u201d). We reject Zuo\u2019s contention that the agency engaged in speculation or conjecture. In light of the supported credibility findings described above, we reject Zuo\u2019s due process contention regarding translation problems. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process claim). In the absence of credible testimony, Zuo\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Because Zuo\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the BIA found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
