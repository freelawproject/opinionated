In applying the ACCA, the district court found Sims to have been convicted of three \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B): first for fleeing a police officer by car, second for burglarizing a dwelling, and third for first-degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-24\">In the district court and now on appeal, Sims maintains his fleeing conviction under Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.487, subd. 8, is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. In <em>United States v. Bartel, </em>698 F.3d 658, 662 (8th Cir.2012), we came to the opposite conclusion, but Sims urges Bartel\u2019s result is no longer viable \u201cin the wake of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>[570] U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-27\">After Sims and the government submitted their appellate briefs, we decided <em>United States v. Pate, </em>754 F.3d 550 (8th Cir. 2014), which reaffirmed <em>Bartel </em>in light of <em>Descamps. See id. </em>at 555-56. Like <em>Pate, </em>\u201cMinn.Stat. \u00a7 609.487, subd. 3, as relevant to this case, is indivisible and is not one of the enumerated offenses listed in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555. As such, we again conclude \u201c \u2018a violation of Minnesota Statute \u00a7 609.487, subd. 3 presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another and is therefore a violent felony under the ACCA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56 (quoting <em>Bartel, </em>698 F.3d at 662).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-28\">Because the district court did not err in sentencing Sims pursuant to the ACCA, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-30\">.
