On November 5, 2013, he was sentenced to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Norris challenges the sentence as procedurally unreasonable. He contends the district court improperly applied a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), based on the finding that he used the firearm in connection with another felony. Although the government originally opposed Norris\u2019s claim of error, following oral arguments in this appeal, the government has acknowledged that Norris did not \u201cuse\u201d the firearm. That is, the government has conceded \u201cthat defendant did not carry out any purpose or action by means of the firearm when he told [Ronnie] Mutter to dispose of it\u201d ... but only \u201csought Mutter\u2019s cooperation as to another felony which <em>involved </em>the firearm.\u201d Based on this concession, the government has joined with Norris in moving the court to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">We find the motion well taken. Merely instructing the presumed owner of the firearm to \u201cget rid of it\u201d because it was evidence in a pending murder investigation \u2014 where Norris exercised no authority or influence over Mutter, where Mutter did not in fact own or possess the firearm, and where the instruction did not result in the desired impact on the firearm \u2014 is not \u201cuse\u201d of the firearm in connection with another felony. Accordingly, notwithstanding the \u201cdue deference\u201d owed to the district court\u2019s sentencing determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>see United States v. Stafford, </em>721 F.3d 380, 400-01 (6th Cir.2013), we find the sentence enhancement improper. We therefore VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-22\">. Our ruling should not be construed as precluding the district court\u2019s consideration of Norris\u2019s communication with Mutter in fashioning an appropriate sentence. We hold simply that enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) is not appropriate on the facts of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
