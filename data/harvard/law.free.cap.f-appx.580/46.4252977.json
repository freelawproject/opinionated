Koehn appeals from the October 18, 2013 judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Skretny, <em>J.). </em>The district court imposed a below-Guideline sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment after Koehn pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of attempted production of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(b). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">Koehn argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, but his plea agreement expressly waived the right to bring this challenge. The agreement provided in relevant part that the defendant \u201cknowingly waives the right to appeal and collaterally attack any component of a sentence imposed by the Court which falls within or is less than ... 324 to 405 months ... notwithstanding the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>which the Court determines the sentence.\u201d Because the district court\u2019s sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment clearly falls within the bounds of the plea agreement, we do not reach the merits of Koehn\u2019s claims unless we find the waiver unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u201cWaivers of the right to appeal a sentence are presumptively enforceable,\u201d <em>United States v. Riggi, </em>649 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), and a waiver will be treated as valid so long as it is \u201cknowingly, voluntarily, and competently provided by the defendant,\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Perez, </em>215 F.3d 315, 318 (2d Cir.2000). Defendant does not dispute that he entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily. Rather, he asserts we should not enforce his waiver because the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility he thereby received constitutes inadequate consideration. In so arguing, Koehn relies on cases in which we have applied a \u201cclose look\u201d to \u201cunorthodox\u201d appellate waivers, and declined to enforce them where the defendant \u201creceived very little benefit in exchange for [his] plea of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Goodman, </em>165 F.3d 169, 174 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Rosa, </em>123 F.3d 94, 99 (2d Cir.1997). These cases are inap-posite because the waiver at issue is not unorthodox. \u2018We have regularly enforced knowing and voluntary waivers in the conventional form that waive the right to appeal a sentence <em>within (or below) an agreed guideline range.\u201d Goodman, </em>165 F.3d at 174 (emphasis in original); <em>see also United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 22-23 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cThe \u2018decisive considerations\u2019 motivating our decision to enforce, <em>vel non, </em>an appeal waiver are the \u2018nature of the right at issue\u2019 and \u201cwhether the sentence was reached in a manner that the plea agreement did not anticipate.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Coston, </em>737 F.3d 235, 237 (2d Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Riggi, </em>649 F.3d at 148). Here, defendant stipulated to the correctness of a reduced Guideline calculation, and received, not only the promised three-level reduction, but also a sentence that fell seven years below the low end of the Guideline range contemplated by the parties. \u201cWhile receipt of the expected benefits of a plea is, of course, not in and of itself a reason to hold a defendant to a plea agreement which is otherwise invalid,\u201d it speaks to the \u201coverall fairness, and thereby the validity, of that agreement.\u201d <em>Rosa, </em>123 F.3d at 101-02. Because the plea agreement here was otherwise valid, we hold that it precludes Koehn\u2019s present challenges to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Even if Koehn had not waived the right to bring his present appeal, he would not be entitled to relief because his sentencing challenge fails on the merits. \u201cThe district courts have discretion to select an appropriate sentence, and in doing so are statutorily bound to consider the factors listed in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 188 (2d Cir.2008). Nonetheless, \u201cthe requirement that a sentencing judge consider an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor is <em>not </em>synonymous with a requirement [that] the factor be given determinative or dispositive weight in the particular ease.\u201d <em>United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d 145, 157 (2d Cir.2006) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record below reveals that the district court carefully considered the sentencing factors set out in Section 3553(a) in addition to this court\u2019s guidance in <em>United States v. Dorvee, </em>616 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2010) and <em>United States v. Tutty, </em>612 F.3d 128 (2d Cir.2010). The district court also fully explained its reasons for discrediting the assertions of the defendant\u2019s expert that Koehn\u2019s persistent attempts to procure a four-year-old child were mere fantasy, and we identify no clear error in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>conclusion. Nor are we persuaded that defendant\u2019s sentence \u2014 seven years below the low end of the agreed-upon guidelines range \u2014 \u201ccannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavern, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We have considered the remainder .of Koehn\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the appeal hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
