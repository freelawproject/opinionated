(\u201cSmith\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting Stellar J Corporation (\u201cStellar\u201d) and Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America\u2019s (\u201cTravelers\u201d) motion for partial summary judgment dismissing Smith\u2019s breach of contract counterclaims with prejudice. Before this Court, Smith contends that an unlicensed contractor can file a counterclaim and recover damages pursuant to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008), even though that statute barred unlicensed contractors from filing a complaint for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">We affirm the judgment because we conclude that Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008), when properly construed, precluded an unlicensed contractor from recovering damages whether the contractor filed a cause of action in a complaint or in a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-17\">Prior to being amended in 2007, Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 701.131(l)\u2019s predecessor, former Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.065(1), read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a contractor may not perfect a claim of a construction lien, or commence a claim with the Construction Contractors Board, in arbitration or in any court of this state for compensation for the performance of any work or for the breach of any contract for work that is subject to this chapter, unless the contractor had a valid license issued by the board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-19\">(a) At the time the contractor bid or entered into the contract for performance of the work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-20\">(b) Continuously while performing the work for which compensation is sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.065(1) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Smith filed its counterclaims on April 10, 2009. As amended in 2007, and effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>as of January 1, 2008, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.181(1) (2008) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a contractor may not perfect a construction lien, file a complaint with the Construction Contractors Board or commence an arbitration or a <em>court action </em>for compensation for the performance of any work or for the breach of any contract for work that is subject to this chapter unless the contractor had a valid license issued by the board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">(a) at the time the contractor bid or entered into the contract for performance of the work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(b) Continuously while performing the work for which compensation is sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Or. Laws 2007, ch. 793, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The parties do not dispute that the Oregon Legislature amended the statute at the request of Oregon\u2019s Construction Contractors Board (\u201cCCB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) or that the CCB sought to replace the term \u201cclaim\u201d so as to alleviate confusion that the statute related to filing an insurance claim, instead of a lawsuit or a counterclaim, regarding construction work.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Smith maintains that, because Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) only prohibited a contractor from \u201ccommenc[ing] ... a court action,\u201d it was not barred from filing its counterclaims. The only authority cited by Smith in support of its contention that Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) did not bar an unlicensed contractor from filing a cause of action or a counterclaim for breach of contract is dictum in a footnote in <em>Pincetich v. Nolan, </em>252 Or.App. 42, 285 P.3d 759 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">In <em>Pincetich, </em>the Oregon Court of Appeals held that Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) barred an unlicensed contractor from prevailing in an action the contractor file for compensation for work pursuant to a construction contract. <em>Id. </em>at 760, 762. In a footnote discussing the scope of Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1), the court in <em>Pincetich </em>opined in dictum that the term \u201ccourt action\u201d in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) \u201cper-mit\u00eds] an unlicensed contractor to file any counterclaim or third-party claim, even if that claim seeks' compensation for construction work, provided the contractor does not commence a court action for compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762 n. 3. Smith contends that this footnote is \u201cdispositive\u201d of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">This Court is \u201cnot bound by dicta of state appellate courts.\u201d <em>Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ensley, </em>174 F.3d 977, 983 (9th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). We have also held, however, that \u201c[i]n cases where the highest appellate court of the state has not spoken, well-considered dicta should not be ignored.\u201d <em>Columbia Grain, Inc. v. Or. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>22 F.3d 928, 932 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The <em>Pincetich </em>footnote is not \u201cwell-considered\u201d dictum that this Court is bound to follow. The dispositive issue in <em>Pincetich </em>was whether an exception to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) applied to an unlicensed contractor that filed suit. <em>Pincetich, </em>285 P.3d at 760-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">Because the <em>Pincetich </em>footnote is not controlling in deciding the question raised in this appeal, and in the absence of a dispositive ruling by the Oregon Supreme Court, we must construe the intent of the Oregon legislature in drafting Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008). To interpret Oregon law, this Court has looked to the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or. 160, 206 P.3d 1042 (2009). <em>Powell\u2019s Books, Inc. v. Kroger, </em>622 F.3d 1202, 1209 (9th Cir.2010). In <em>Gaines, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court restated its \u201cmeth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>odology for interpreting a statute\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">The first step remains an examination of text and context. But ... we no longer will require an ambiguity in the text of a statute as a necessary predicate to the second step \u2014 consideration of pertinent legislative history that a party may proffer. Instead, a party is free to proffer legislative history to the court, and the court will consult it after examining text and context, even if the court does not perceive an ambiguity in the statute\u2019s text, where that legislative history appears useful to the court\u2019s analysis. However, the extent of the court\u2019s consideration of that history, and the evaluative weight that the court gives it, is for the court to determine. The third, and final step, of the interpretative methodology is unchanged. If the legislature\u2019s intent remains unclear after examining text, context, and legislative history, the court may resort to general maxims of statutory construction to aid in resolving the remaining uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><em>Gaines, </em>206 P.3d at 1050-51 (discussing Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 174.020) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In general, commencing an \u201caction\u201d refers to filing suit. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (West 2014) (defining \u201caction,\u201d in part, as \u201c[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding\u201d). For example, in <em>Abbott v. Baldwin, </em>178 Or.App. 289, 36 P.3d 516 (2001), in the context of a request for post-conviction relief, an Oregon intermediate appellate court explained that \u201c[t]he term \u2018action\u2019 ... has a well-established legal meaning,\u201d which \u201cis a discrete judicial proceeding involving a demand for relief that must be independently commenced and adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521-22 (citing Or. R. Civ. P. 1(A), 3, 70; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 29 (6th ed.1990)). The court in <em>Abbott </em>also explained that \u201caction\u201d \u201chas essentially the same meaning as the term \u2018case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522 (citing <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>161 Or.App. 345, 985 P.2d 827, 831 (1999); Or. R. Civ. P. 1(A)). As the court in <em>Abbott </em>acknowledged, an Oregon intermediate appellate court in <em>State v. Cunningham </em>stated \u201c[ejven within the legal context ... the meaning of the word [\u2018case\u2019] is not narrow\u201d and can be defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201cA general term for an action, cause, suit or controversy, at law or in equity; a question contested before a court of justice; an aggregate of facts which furnishes occasion for the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of justice. A judicial proceeding for the determination of a controversy between parties wherein rights are enforced or protected, or wrongs are prevented or redressed; <em>any </em>proceeding judicial in its nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av7-dedup-0\"><em>Cunningham, </em>985 P.2d at 831 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 195 (5th ed.1979)) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, both <em>Abbott </em>and <em>Cunningham </em>indicate that the term \u201caction,\u201d which \u201chas essentially the same meaning as the term \u2018case,\u2019 \u201d refers to \u201c\u2018any proceeding judicial in its nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abbott, </em>36 P.3d at 522; <em>Cunningham, </em>985 P.2d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) applies to a \u201ccourt action for compensation for the performance of any work or for the breach of any contract for work that is subject to this chapter.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008). This language indicates that the statutory term \u201ccourt action\u201d means a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201ccause of action\u201d because application of the statute turns on a party\u2019s assertion of a right to payment for work subject to Chapter 701, not the form of the filing. <em>See, e.g., Ram Technical Servs., Inc. v. Koresko, </em>346 Or. 215, 208 P.3d 950, 961 (2009) (stating \u201cclaim\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018[t]he aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 264 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(2004)); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (West 2014) (defining \u201ccause of action\u201d as \u201c[a] group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for suing; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Turning to general maxims of statutory construction, \u201ccourts must refuse to give literal application to language when to do so would produce an absurd or unreasonable result.\u201d <em>McKean-Coffman v. Emp\u2019t Div., </em>312 Or. 543, 824 P.2d 410, 414 (1992). The purpose of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) was \u201cto deter unlicensed contractors from performing construction work by denying them the ability to pursue <em>claims </em>for compensation for their work.\u201d <em>Pincetich, </em>285 P.3d at 762 (emphasis added). In light of this purpose, to interpret the words \u201ccommence ... a court action\u201d in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) to exclude counterclaims filed by contractors that are unlicensed is unreasonable and contrary to the intent of the legislature to bar unlicensed contractors from recovering compensation for their work. Such an interpretation would permit unlicensed contractors to recover damages when they are sued, but not when they file a complaint for breach of contract. There is no principled basis for such an irrational interpretation of Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">After <em>Pincetich </em>was published, the CCB informed the Oregon legislature that the use of \u201ccourt action\u201d in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) had had an \u201cunintended consequence.\u201d In pertinent part, the statute was amended to make it clear that an unlicensed contractor could not \u201ccommence ... a claim in a court of this state for compensation for the performance of any work or for the breach of any contract for work that is subject to this chapter, unless the contractor had a valid license.\u201d <em>See </em>Or .Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2014); Or. Laws 2013, ch. 251, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We are persuaded that to interpret Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) to bar an unlicensed contractor from filing a claim for breach of contract, but to permit one to recover in a counterclaim, would be an absurd and unreasonable result, clearly contrary to legislative intent. The district court did not err in dismissing Smiht\u2019s counterclaims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Smith also contends that it is excepted from Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008), pursuant to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(2)(a) (2008). But Smith was not licensed by the CCB when it filed its counterclaims on April 10, 2009. There is no question that Smith cannot meet the requirement in Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(2)(a)(B) (2008) that \u201c[a]t the time the contractor ... commenced any proceeding subject to the provisions of subsection (1) ... the contractor was licensed by the board.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(2)(a)(B) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Additionally, Smith contends that it was not a \u201ccontractor,\u201d pursuant to Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.005(5)(a) (2008), because the \u201cBiological Wastewater Treatment Unit and Aeration Diffuser System\u201d (collectively, the \u201cTreatment Unit\u201d) it sold to and contracted to installed for Stellar \u201cis removable\u201d and, therefore, not \u201cattached to real estate.\u201d Smith\u2019s unsupported generalization that the Treatment Unit is removable does not alter the fact, as admitted by Smith, that the Treatment Unit was attached to the City of Rainier\u2019s wastewa-ter treatment facility. The district court did not err in concluding that Smith was a contractor. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.005(5)(a) (2008) (defining \u201ccontrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tor\u201d by whether person\u2019s work is \u201cattached to real estate\u201d); <em>L.H. Morris Elec., Inc. v. Hyundai Semiconductor Am., </em>187 Or.App. 32, 66 P.3d 509, 512 (2003) (holding question of person\u2019s status as a \u201ccontractor\u201d depends on whether work in question was attached to real estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Smith also asserts that the dismissal of its counterclaims should have been without prejudice. Smith maintains that, in order to file its counterclaims pursuant to Rules 12 and 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it was not able timely to avail itself of the exception in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(2)(a) (2008). Smith, though, has not provided this Court with any authority that Rules 12 and 13 may trump Oregon\u2019s substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Smith also maintains that Stellar is equitably estopped from raising Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) because it was on notice that Smith did not have a license. The minimum requirements for the application of equitable estoppel are not satisfied here. Smith has not shown the existence of evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Stellar falsely represented to Smith that it did not need a license, that Stellar did so with the intention that Smith would not act to obtain license, and that Smith was induced not to do so. <em>See Day v. Advanced M &amp; D Sales, Inc., </em>336 Or. 511, 86 P.3d 678, 682 (2004) (stating elements of equitable estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Lastly, Smith argues that it should be allowed to sever and proceed with its counterclaims to the extent they involve the manufacture and sale, but not installation, of equipment, based on a \u201cseverability clause\u201d in the parties\u2019 subcontract. The work in the subcontract\u2019s \u201cscope of work\u201d provision, however, constituted work as a \u201ccontractor.\u201d <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.005(5)(a) (2008) (defining \u201ccontractor\u201d). Additionally, contractors may not avoid Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) by defining covered \u201cwork\u201d in a \u201cpatchwork, pick-and-choose fashion.\u201d <em>Parthenon Constr. &amp; Design, Inc. v. Neuman, </em>166 Or.App. 172, 999 P.2d 1169, 1173-74 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Gaines, </em>346 Or. 160, 173, 206 P.3d 1042 (2009). The Oregon Supreme Court expects the state legislature to know this rule, and quoted (with approval) Representative Max William\u2019s statement that \u201cWe still have to mean what we say when we say it. We can\u2019t say, black and then * * * all agree that black meant white. That\u2019s not going to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173 n. 10, 206 P.3d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">Here, the text of section 701.131(1), as it existed in 2008, prohibits an unlicensed contractor from commencing <em>\u201ca court action </em>for compensation for the performance of any work or for the breach of any contract for work that is subject to\u201d the contractor licensing law. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2008) (emphasis added). Oregon state courts define the term \u201caction\u201d to mean the \u201cjudicial proceeding involving a demand for relief that must be independently commenced and adjudicated,\u201d <em>Abbott v. Baldwin, </em>178 Or.App. 289, 298, 36 P.3d 516 (2001), while the term \u201cclaim\u201d merely refers to \u201c[t]he aggregate of opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tive facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court,\u201d <em>Ram Technical Servs., Inc. v. Koresko, </em>346 Or. 215, 236, 208 P.3d 950 (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, the plain language of the 2008 statute prohibits unlicensed contractors from bringing independent court actions, but not from bringing claims or counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The 2008 statute amended an earlier version of \u00a7 701.131(1) that was broader in scope: it prohibited an unlicensed contractor from raising \u201ca claim\u201d in state court. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.065(1) (2006); <em>see also Splinters, Inc. v. Andersen/Weitz, </em>192 Or. App. 632, 639-41, 87 P.3d 689 (2004) (applying statute to unlicensed contractor\u2019s counterclaims). There can be no doubt that the 2008 amendments changed the law when it changed the word \u201cclaim\u201d to \u201ccourt action.\u201d As a state appellate court succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">[b]y changing the language of the claims bar to prohibit an unlicensed contractor from commencing a court action, rather ' than a claim, the amendments permit an unlicensed contractor to file any counterclaim or third-party claim, even if that claim seeks compensation for construction work, provided the contractor does not commence a court action for compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\"><em>Pincetich v. Nolan, </em>252 Or.App. 42, 48 n. 3, 285 P.3d 759 (2012). In other words, \u201cthe amendments had a substantive effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state legislature apparently agreed. In 2013, the legislature once again amended \u00a7 701.131 to return it to its original broader scope. Under the 2013 amendments, the \u201ccourt action\u201d language is gone, and the new version of \u00a7 701.131 now prohibits an unlicensed contractor from commencing a \u201cclaim\u201d for contractor work. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">In sum, while the 2008 statute was in effect, unlicensed contractors could bring counterclaims. The majority ignores the plain language of the 2008 statute by giving effect to what the majority thinks the legislature probably meant. Op. at 609-10. Under Oregon law, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s not going to work.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or. at 173 n. 10, 206 P.3d 1042. Though the legislature might have meant to prohibit \u201ccauses of action,\u201d that is not what it said. Because the 2008 version of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 701.131(1) does not apply to counterclaims, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.
