R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-28\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on August 13, 2013. The notice of appeal was filed on April 2, 2014. Because Solomon failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-17\"> Although a dismissal without prejudice generally is interlocutory and not appealable, we conclude that the order dismissing Solomon's complaint is an appealable final order as no amendment to the complaint could cure the defects identified by the district court. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
