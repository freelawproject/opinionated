We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing de novo questions of law, <em>Cordoba v. Holder, </em>726 F.3d 1106, 1113 (9th Cir.2013), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The agency correctly concluded that Morrison\u2019s 2011 conviction for solicitation to possess marijuana for sale under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 13-1002 and 13-3405 categorically constitutes a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude that renders him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), <em>see Barragan-Lopez v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 899, 903-05 (9th Cir. 2007), and that precludes him from demonstrating the good moral character necessary to qualify for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b) and voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b), <em>see Morales-Garcia v. Holder, </em>567 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2009) (cancellation of removal); <em>Lafarga v. INS, </em>170 F.3d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir.1999) (voluntary departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The agency also correctly concluded that this crime, as an undisputed eontrolled-substance trafficking offense, bars Morrison from establishing his eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See Negrete-Ramirez v. Holder, </em>741 F.3d 1047, 1056 (9th Cir. 2014) (\u201cTo be eligible for adjustment of status, an alien must ordinarily be admissible.\u201d); <em>Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 823 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cSection 212(a)(2)(C) [of the Immigration and Nationality Act] permits a finding of inadmissibility when the Attorney General has \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that the alien was involved in drug-trafficking.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Morrison waived review of the agency\u2019s conclusion that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) due to the insufficient length of his lawful residence and continuous physical presence in the United States. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152, 1157 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cIssues not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief are typically deemed waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">We do not consider the extra-record documents that Morrison appended to his opening brief. <em>See Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1284, 1290 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cWe may not consider any information beyond what the [agency] had before it at the time of its decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
