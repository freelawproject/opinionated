The case therefore is submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b702-4\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b702-5\">BOBBY R. BALDOCK, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In July 2014, Plaintiff Maurice Thompson, appearing pro se, filed what he labeled a \u201cNotice of Claim\u201d (NOC) in the federal district court. Plaintiff, who apparently was incarcerated and facing criminal charges of some sort in Colorado state court, complained of problems with Defendants Valerie Robison, Tasha Dobbs, and John Jones, a state judge, probation officer, and police officer respectively. In an \u201cAffidavit of Negative Averment\u201d attached as an exhibit to the NOC, Plaintiff wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">John Jones had no right to arrest me without a warrant issued which is a constitutional wrong. Tasha Dobbs has acted in quasi-judicial function under Pa. R.Crim. P. 702(3) is not authorized for parole officers to do.... Valerie J. Robi-son stated in open court that my charges are serious in a meaner unprofessional as if I didn\u2019t stand a chance of a fair trail in her court room. Plus she back\u2019s the two officers in whom she knows have committed lawful wrongs under color of law by allowing my current case to proceed. She also is acting as an unlawful debt collector by denying commercial drafts and other filiants which is a commercial injury of misapplication of the statute[,] the very grounds for this tort. She also denies my safety from the two members mention that I have veriest of complaints against due too their unpro-fessionalism with the federal level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">Rec. at 6 (errors in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">In the NOC itself, Plaintiff seems to indicate he originally wished to pursue his grievances in state court but the state judge would not permit him to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The record contains a state district court order issued by Judge Robison denying Plaintiffs claims based on his failure to serve his various filings on opposing counsel as instructed, as well as his apparent effort to pursue civil claims in the context of his criminal prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">[T]he most recent documents do not pertain to the instant criminal charges in this case and the case law cited has no relevance to the instant charges. There is no clear and concise request contained in the recent filings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">Therefore, any requests contained in the three documents are hereby denied. Not only has the Defendant failed to provide the Certificate of Mailing/Service, but the three documents are nonsensical and do not make any rational request of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">After reviewing Plaintiffs NOC, a federal magistrate judge issued an order directing him to \u201ccure deficiencies.\u201d Specifically, the magistrate judge instructed Plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-17\">Plaintiff shall obtain (with the assistance of his case manager or the [Mesa County Detention Fjacility\u2019s legal assistant) the Court-approved forms for filing a Prisoner\u2019s Motion and Affidavit for Leave to Proceed Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and a Prisoner Complaint, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>with the applicable instructions, at www. cod.uscourts.gov, and shall use those forms in curing the designated deficiencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 13. The order further admonished Plaintiff that failure to cure said deficiencies within thirty days would result in dismissal of his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">When Plaintiff failed to timely cure his deficient filings, the district court ordered his action dismissed without prejudice. The court further certified pursuant to \u00a7 1915(a)(3) that any appeal of the dismissal order \u201cwould not be taken in good faith and therefore <em>in forma pauperis </em>[IFP] status will be denied for the purpose of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Plaintiff nevertheless appealed, asking permission to proceed IFP. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Moya v. Schollen-barger, </em>465 F.3d 444, 450 (10th Cir.2006) (explaining that a dismissal without prejudice is final and appealable \u201cif a district court order expressly and unambiguously dismisses a plaintiffs entire action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Section 1915(a)(1) and (2) generally authorize us to allow an appellant to proceed on appeal \u201cwithout payment of fees or security therefor\u201d provided such party proves his indigent status. Where a district court certifies an appeal is not taken in good faith, an aggrieved party may still move for leave to proceed IFP \u201cpursuant to the mechanism set forth in [Fed. R.App. P.] 24(a)(5).\u201d <em>Rolland v. Primesource Staffing, L.L.C., </em>497 F.3d 1077, 1079 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cTo do so, however, the appellant must show not only \u2018a financial inability to pay the required filing fees,\u2019 but also \u2018the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Crownhart v. Muller, </em>575 Fed.Appx. 834, 835 (10th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (quoting <em>De-Bardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Even construing his various pleadings liberally, Plaintiff has not met this requirement. In his appellate brief, Plaintiff continues to complain in a conclusory fashion about \u201cwrongful arrest,\u201d \u201cdenial of fair treatment by way of the court,\u201d and denial of \u201cthe services that are provide[d] for all parolees.\u201d He also cursorily claims entitlement to monetary damages and release from incarceration. Nowhere in his brief does he address the district court\u2019s order directing him to cure deficiencies in his initial filings, or the court\u2019s subsequent order dismissing his action for failure to do so. Instead, Plaintiff tells us the district court erred by denying his motion to proceed IFP and dismissing his action despite an unidentified conflict of interest. He appears to ask us to decide the merits of his claims in the first instance which, of course, we will not do. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Eatman, </em>569 Fed.Appx. 626, 631 n. 6 (10th Cir.2014) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record in this ease, we have no choice but to conclude that Plaintiff fails on appeal to present a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts that would support setting aside the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, we deny Plaintiffs motion to proceed on appeal IFP and dismiss his appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. Plaintiff is reminded that he remains responsible for paying the full filing fee for this action as previously assessed by the Clerk of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Motion to proceed IFP DENIED; Appeal DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
