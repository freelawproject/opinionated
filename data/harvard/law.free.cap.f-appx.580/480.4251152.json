He was convicted by a jury in 2005 of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, using a telephone to facilitate a drug offense, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), conspiring to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), maintaining a drug-involved premises, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2), distributing marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), and aiding and abetting the distribution of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Johnson\u2019s appointed attorney asserts that the appeal, now Johnson\u2019s fourth, is frivolous and seeks to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel submitted a brief that explains the nature of the case and addresses the issues that an appeal of this kind might be expected to involve. We invited Johnson to respond, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but he did not. Because counsel\u2019s analysis appears to be thorough, we limit our review to the subjects he discusses. <em>See United States v. Bey, </em>748 F.3d 774, 776 (7th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">Johnson was initially sentenced, in this protracted case, to life imprisonment. We affirmed his convictions but remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 110, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>584 F.3d 731, 740 (7th Cir.2009). After the district court upheld the life sentence, we remanded again because the court did not appropriately account for the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>635 F.3d 983, 990 (7th Cir.2011). The court resentenced Johnson to 360 months. He appealed and we granted the parties\u2019 joint motion for remand so that the judge could address Johnson\u2019s argument for a reduced sentence based on the disparity in punishment between powder cocaine and crack. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>No. 12-3254 (7th Cir. March 7, 2013). On remand again the judge sentenced Johnson to 293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">Counsel first considers challenging the accuracy of Johnson\u2019s sentence, but properly concludes that such a challenge would be frivolous. Counsel correctly points out that none of Johnson\u2019s sentences exceeded a statutory maximum penalty and that Johnson waived any challenge to the calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>lation of his guideline range when he confirmed at sentencing that he had the opportunity to read the presentence report, knew of his right to object to its contents, and stated that he had no objections. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>685 F.3d 909, 915 n. 6 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Brodie, </em>507 F.3d 527, 531 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Counsel also properly determined that it would be frivolous to challenge the reasonableness of Johnson\u2019s sentence. A below-guidelines sentence, as Johnson\u2019s 293-month sentence was, is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>650 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2011). Counsel has not identified a reason to disturb that presumption, nor can we. The district court acknowledged \u201cthe improvement in [Johnson\u2019s] life, ... [his] attitude and [his] behavior in prison,\u201d but noted he was the leader of a long-lasting, extensive drug conspiracy and had continued his gang association in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
