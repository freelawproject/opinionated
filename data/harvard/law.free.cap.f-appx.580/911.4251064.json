Lupin Ltd., </em>No. 3:11-CV-05048, 2014 WL 202659 (D.N.J. Jan. 17, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Warner Chilcott Co., LLC (\u201cWarner\u201d) owns the '984 patent, which is directed to a method of contraception and covers the administration of Warner\u2019s oral contraceptive drug product, Lo Loestrin\u00ae Fe (\u201cLo Loestrin\u201d). The Defendants submitted Abbreviated New Drug Application filings to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of generic versions of Lo Loestrin. Warner then brought actions against the Defendants for infringement of the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) and the actions were consolidated into the case now befor\u00e9 us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Before the district court, the Defendants stipulated to infringement of all of the asserted claims, but challenged the validity of those claims on the ground of obviousness. <em>Warner Chilcott, </em>2014 WL 202659, at *1-2. The district court held a bench trial from October 7, 2013 through October 17, 2013 on the issue of obviousness. <em>Id. </em>at *1. In a detailed opinion issued on January 17, 2014, the district court held that the Defendants f\u00e1iled to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims of the '984 patent would have been obvious. <em>Id. </em>at *11, *23. The court then entered final judgment of infringement in favor of Warner. <em>See Warner Chilcott Co. v. Lupin Ltd., </em>No. 3:11-CV-05048 (D.N.J. Jan. 17, 2014), ECF No. 135. The Defendants timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Having considered all of the Defendants\u2019 arguments on appeal and found them unpersuasive, we conclude that on the basis of and for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion none of the asserted claims of the '984 patent was shown to be invalid for obviousness. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
