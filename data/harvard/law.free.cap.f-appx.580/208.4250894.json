Huggard pled guilty to travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with another person and was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals his conviction, asserting that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We find no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm Huggard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u201cA defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>348 F.3d 408, 413 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, once the district court has accepted a guilty plea, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion whether to grant a motion to withdraw it based on the defendant\u2019s showing of a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">When considering whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, the trial court must consider six factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or not voluntary, (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence, (3) whether there has been a delay between the entering of the plea and the filing of the motion, (4) whether defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel, (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government, and (6) whether it will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-14\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Although all of the <em>Moore </em>factors should be considered, the first, second, and fourth are the most important factors in making the determination of whether to allow withdrawal of the plea. <em>United States v. Sparks, </em>67 F.3d 1145, 1154 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">We have reviewed the record submitted on appeal and the arguments of the parties, and we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Huggard had the assistance of competent counsel throughout the proceedings, failed to offer credible evidence that the plea was not knowing or voluntary, and failed to credibly assert his legal innocence. Additionally, the district court did not err in determining that the three-month delay and the prejudice to the government counseled against granting the motion to withdraw the plea.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">In conclusion, we have determined that the district court properly weighed the <em>Moore </em>factors and did not abuse its discretion in denying Huggard\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw the plea and affirm Huggard\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\"> The district court determined that the final factor \u2014 inconvenience to the court and waste of judicial resources \u2014 was not a serious factor in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
