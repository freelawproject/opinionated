Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>848 F.Supp.2d 570 (D.Md.2012) (the <em>\u201cOpinion\u201d), </em>ECF No. 109.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">This litigation arose from the construction in 1999 and 2000 of CBF\u2019s headquarters facility, the Philip Merrill Environmental Center (the \u201cMerrill Center\u201d), on the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis, Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> SmithGroup designed the Merrill Center, and Clark oversaw its construction. SmithGroup\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d design called for exposed structural wood members outside the envelope of the Merrill Center, including some that penetrated the building\u2019s fagade. Under a March 3, 2000 purchase order that it entered into with Clark, Weyerhaeuser agreed to provide Parallam PSL columns and beams (\u201cParallams\u201d) for use as the exposed wood members.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Parallams, which have a rough-hewn appearance, are manufactured by bonding together strips of wood. The wood strips\u2019 lack of uniformity creates channels, or \u201cavenues,\u201d that run longitudinally through the Parallams. Thus, water is expected to inf\u00edltrate Parallams used outdoors. To protect against rotting, Parallams are pressure-treated with a wood preservative intended to fully penetrate the avenues. Its contract with Clark required Weyer-haeuser to treat the Merrill Center\u2019s Par-allams with the preservative PolyClear 2000. Weyerhaeuser engaged third party defendant Permapost Products Co. (\u201cPer-mapost\u201d) to apply the PolyClear 2000 treatment to a specified retention level, and Permapost provided certificates to Weyerhaeuser \u2014 later shared by Weyer-haeuser with the plaintiffs \u2014 verifying that such retention level had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Following completion of the Merrill Center in late December 2000, water began leaking through Parallams into the building. In 2001 and 2002, the leakage was investigated by two outside consultants hired by Clark; the first of those consultants, Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc., issued a report on May 8, 2001 (the \u201c2001 Report\u201d), and the second, Vaughn Woodwork Consultants, released a report on May 24, 2002 (the \u201c2002 Report\u201d). The focus of the 2001 and 2002 Reports was on the cause of the leakage into the Merrill Center: water travelling from the exterior to the interior of the building through the avenues in the Parallams.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The 2001 Report also mentioned that such water could cause deterioration or rot in the Parallams themselves if they were not properly treated with a wood preservative. Although the 2002 Report could have been read to similarly warn about Paral-lam deterioration, its author had not considered such a possibility because he believed that the Merrill Center\u2019s Parallams had been properly treated with PolyClear 2000. Indeed, three days before issuing the 2002 Report, he told the plaintiffs that Parallams were a \u201cgood durable product\u201d and \u201cas good as a [railroad] tie,\u201d and that their \u201cpressure treating [was] good,\u201d so they would \u201cnot rot for a long period of time.\u201d J.A. 671. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs worked closely with Weyerhaeuser on the leakage problem and shared with it the 2001 and 2002 Reports. In response, Weyerhaeuser assured the plaintiffs that the Merrill Center\u2019s Parallams had been properly treated with PolyClear 2000 and were not at risk of premature deterioration. Moreover, at least three Weyerhaeu-ser representatives examined the Paral-lams and failed to note the presence of rotting.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">After the leaking was stopped in 2004 with the use of sealants, the plaintiffs anticipated no further problems with the Parallams. During a routine inspection in July 2009, however, Parallams were found to be deteriorating. The plaintiffs subsequently learned that the Parallams had not been treated with PolyClear 2000 as certified, that PolyClear 2000 was not in any event well-suited to the job of preserving the Parallams, and that Weyerhaeuser had knowingly given false assurances to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The plaintiffs initiated this action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on December 3, 2010, and Weyerhaeuser filed a notice of removal in the District of Maryland on January 6, 2011. The complaint focused on the deterioration of the Merrill Center\u2019s Parallams and sought damages for, inter alia, the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures. According to the complaint, Weyerhaeuser breached its contract with Clark (Count I), owed common law indemnity (Count II) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and contribution (Count III) to Smi-thGroup and Clark, and was liable to CBF and SmithGroup for negligent misrepresentation (Count IV) and negligence (Count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On January 20, 2011, Weyerhaeuser answered the complaint, asserted counterclaims against the plaintiffs, and filed its third party complaint against Permapost. Following extensive discovery, Weyerhaeu-ser sought summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, invoking the applicable statute of limitations. Weyerhaeuser and Permapost also made separate summary judgment motions with respect to Weyer-haeuser\u2019s various cross- and counterclaims. By its <em>Opinion </em>and an accompanying Order of March 23, 2012, the district court granted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and thus denied as moot all other summary judgment motions. The plaintiffs timely noted this appeal, and we possess jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, viewing the facts and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Core Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Verizon Md. LLC, </em>744 F.3d 310, 320 (4th Cir.2014). A summary judgment award is appropriate only when the record \u201cshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">In awarding summary judgment to Wey-erhaeuser, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are time-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s statute of limitations provides that \u201c[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-101. Maryland follows the discovery rule, which provides that \u201cthe cause of action accrues when the claimant in fact knew or reasonably should have known of the wrong.\u201d <em>Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677, 680 (1981). Where \u201cthe knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that their claims did not accrue until they discovered the deteriorating Parallams in 2009, the district court ruled that the 2001 and 2002 Reports put the plaintiffs on actual and inquiry notice of their cause of action. Premised on those same Reports, the court further determined that the plaintiffs could not rely on allegations of fraud to toll the limitations period under \u00a7 5-203 \u2014 particularly since the parties were \u201ccosmopolitan commercial counterparts.\u201d <em>See Opinion </em>at 587. The court summarized that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>agree[d] that a factual dispute exists regarding whether the 2001 and 2002 Reports notified Plaintiffs that the wood was rotting <em>per se. </em>All the same, the rot is not a standalone injury lacking a meaningful tie to the cracks, voids, splits, water penetration, and potential for deterioration that the Report\u00f3 discuss. Rather, it is just the ultimate manifestation of this constellation of injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 585. The court thus calculated that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201caccrued no later than May 2002 and expired more than half a decade before they filed suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We disagree with the district court. The court \u201cconfused one harm \u2014 water infiltration through the exterior Parallams into the interior of the Merrill Center, that was known to everyone in 2001 \u2014 with another harm \u2014 potential wood rot in the Par-allams.\u201d Br. of Appellants 20. Additionally, the court relied on the premise that \u201c[a]ny ordinary person knows that, all else equal, wet wood rots.\u201d <em>See Opinion </em>at 582; <em>see also id. </em>at 585 (\u201cTo reiterate, just about anyone who has ever stained a deck knows that cracked, waterlogged wood stands to rot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, a genuine dispute exists as to whether knowledge of the water infiltration problem would have put a reasonable person on notice that the Parallams were susceptible to premature deterioration and that their PolyClear 2000 treatment would not preserve them. <em>See Bank of N.Y. v. Sheff, </em>382 Md. 235, 854 A.2d 1269, 1275 (2004) (\u201c[I]f there is any genuine dispute of material fact as to when the plaintiffs possessed that degree of knowledge, the issue is one for the trier of fact to resolve; summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d). The record is clear that, when they are used outdoors, Parallams are expected to retain water. The record also reflects that sealing a Parallam from leaks and protecting it from rot are distinct enough that evidence of water infiltration would not necessarily indicate a danger of deterioration. Furthermore, although the 2001 and 2002 Reports indicated that Parallams are subject to rot if not properly treated, the Reports did not expressly assert that the treatment of the Merrill Center\u2019s Parallams was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">To the extent that the 2001 and 2002 Reports nevertheless may have put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice of the Parallam deterioration, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the plaintiffs conducted a reasonably diligent investigation by seeking and receiving assurances from Weyer-haeuser that the Parallams were properly treated. <em>See Baysinger v. Schmid Prods. Co., </em>307 Md. 361, 514 A.2d 1, 4 (1986) (\u201cWhether a reasonably prudent person should then have undertaken a further investigation is a matter about which reasonable minds could differ, and it was therefore inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment.\u201d). Likewise, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Weyer-haeuser, through fraud or concealment, frustrated the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to discover their claims. <em>See Mathews v. Cassidy Turley Md., Inc., </em>435 Md. 584, 80 A.3d 269, 290 (2013) (\u201cWhether a plaintiff\u2019s failure to discover a cause of action was attributable to fraudulent concealment by the defendant is ordinarily a question of fact to be determined by the factfinder, typically a jury.\u201d (citing <em>O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>305 Md. 280, 503 A.2d 1313, 1320 (1986))). Finally, while the relative sophistication of the parties may be considered by the jury, it is a credibility issue that has no place in the summary judgment analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 289-90 &amp; n. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">.
