Selna, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b578-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">Eddie Frias, a California inmate, brought suit against a prison official, Gerald Marshall, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, challenging the reliability of the evidence used by Marshall to recommend that Frias be validated as a member of the \u201cMexican Mafia\u201d prison gang. As a result of this validation, Frias was transferred to the Secure Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d). After the evidence was presented to the jury and before jury deliberations, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law for Marshall. Frias brought this appeal, contending that the case should have been sent to the jury because there were material contested facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Assuming that the \u201csome evidence\u201d inquiry, <em>see Bruce v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.2003), was part of the procedural due process claim that Frias preserved for trial, the fact that neither the district judge nor the jury considered whether there was \u201csome evidence,\u201d bearing \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d to establish that Frias was an associate of a prison gang was error under <em>Castro v. Terhune, </em>712 F.3d 1304, 1314 (9th Cir.2013). But here, as in <em>Castro, </em>remand would be \u201cpointless,\u201d because there was \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the determination that Frias was an associate of the gang. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). For the same reason, we affirm the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>holding that Marshall was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">To the extent that the 24-hours\u2019 notice issue was preserved for trial and not resolved in the pretrial summary judgment order, Frias failed at trial to contest Marshall\u2019s sworn testimony that Frias waived the right to notice, and on appeal, points to no testimony sufficient to demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of material fact on this question requiring submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
