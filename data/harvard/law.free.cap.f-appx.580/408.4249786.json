(\u201cAi-damark\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Roll Forming Corporation, Inc. (\u201cRFC\u201d). Believing that it was owed unpaid sales commissions after RFC terminated a long-standing agreement between the parties, Aidamark filed suit alleging breach of contract, a violation of the Michigan Sales Representative Act (\u201cMSRA\u201d), Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961, and claims for accounting and declaratory judgment. Because the district court correctly determined that the undisputed evidence showed that Aidamark received all the sales commissions to which it was entitled under the parties\u2019 agreement, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Aidamark is a closely-held Michigan corporation with its principal place of business in Rockford, Michigan. Its sole shareholder is Rick Engvall (\u201cEngvall\u201d). RFC is a Kentucky corporation that manufactures roll-formed steel parts, and its principal place of business is Shelbyville, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">Aidamark and RFC entered into an agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) on May 27, 2003, under which Aidamark was to function as the \u201cexclusive sales representative\u201d of RFC for the sale of its products in Michigan and several Indiana counties. Under the Agreement, Aidamark was entitled to \u201ca commission of 5% on net billed sales of all roll[-]formed products\u201d that Aidamark sold in its sales territory and were \u201cshipped by\u201d RFC. Sales commissions were \u201cconsidered as earned on the date of payment by the customer for the products\u201d that Aidamark sold. Although Aidamark functioned as RFC\u2019s sales representative, the Agreement carefully defined the scope of the representation by placing restrictions on Aidamark\u2019s activity. For example, Aidamark could collect orders and submit them for approval to RFC, but could not \u201ccommit, obligate, or bind Roll Forming Corporation in any manner whatsoever, contractually, or otherwise,\u201d under the Agreement. Any price quote had to be obtained from RFC and \u201cformally presented on Roll Forming Corporation standard quotation form for delivery by [Aidamark] [to] the customer.\u201d The Agreement could be \u201cterminated in its entirety at any time\u201d by either party with ninety days\u2019 advance written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">On June 16, 2008, Engvall, on behalf of Aidamark, and Geoff Repp (\u201cRepp\u201d), on behalf of RFC as its Sales Manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>signed an addendum to the Agreement that identified the specific accounts assigned to Aidamark. Among the accounts listed were Steelcase, an office furniture manufacturer, and Interkal, a manufacturer of telescoping spectator bleachers. Ai-damark\u2019s claims of unpaid sales commissions arose from transactions between RFC and those two companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In 1998, RFC began manufacturing roll-formed metal products for Steelcase\u2019s \u201cAnswer\u201d line of office furniture and cubicle panel systems. Aidamark was not involved in the sales of the original \u201cAnswer\u201d line of products, but it functioned as RFC\u2019s representative to Steelcase on sales of other products. Steelcase began a redesign of its \u201cAnswer\u201d line, which ultimately became known as the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d line.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">After several years of negotiation, development, and meetings between Steelcase, Aidamark, and RFC\u2019s engineers, Steelcase decided to award the supplier contract to RFC for the roll-formed parts in the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d line in July of 2010. The parties memorialized the award in several agreements. They signed a \u201cMaster Purchasing Agreement\u201d on July 1, 2010, which set forth \u201csome of the terms and conditions\u201d that applied when Steelcase purchased RFC\u2019s products while acknowledging that other agreements would provide the pricing terms and other specifics for particular orders. The \u201cSchedule of Product,\u201d which took effect on December 8, 2010, was such an agreement. It provided for a \u201cfixed term\u201d of five years, and its provisions referenced a schedule that set forth the \u201cinitial prices\u201d for RPC\u2019s products and lead times before delivery. Under Section 5.9, RFC was described as \u201cthe sole supplier of all products listed in Schedule A, unless you are unable to reasonably meet [Steel-case\u2019s] quality and delivery requirements for the Products in Schedule A.\u201d The \u201cSchedule of Product\u201d also incorporated by reference the provisions of the \u201cMaster Purchasing Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiV\">Aidamark also serviced RFC\u2019s account with Interkal, a manufacturer of spectator bleachers. In 2000, Interkal and RFC entered into an agreement that designated RFC as the sole supplier of certain parts. Although the agreement specified an initial five-year term, the agreement stated that it would be \u201cextended indefinitely,\u201d but could be canceled by either RFC or Inter-kal with six months\u2019 advance written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">In early 2010, RFC and Aidamark began to discuss plans to engage Interkal in a new long-term agreement. Although a draft was submitted to Interkal, the parties were unsuccessful in getting Interkal to sign it, causing them to suspect that Interkal was shopping around for a new supplier. The suspicion was confirmed in May of 2011, when Interkal terminated its relationship with RFC. Engvall reminded Repp that Interkal was required to provide six months\u2019 notice before terminating the agreement, and Interkal agreed to honor the provision and continue to order from RFC for six more months.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Two weeks later, on June 2, 2011, RFC sent a letter to Aidamark stating that it was terminating the Agreement, thereby ending Aidamark\u2019s role as a sales agent for its products. RFC provided Aidamark with a sales commission statement on August 31, 2011, stating that Aidamark would be paid $26,529.90 for payments on invoices that it had received. The statement also listed $49,227.38 in commissions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>RFC considered not earned under the Agreement, as it had not received payment from its clients for those invoices before the effective termination date of the Agreement. On September 29, 2011, RFC paid Aidamark $26,529.90 in commissions for payments that RFC had received as of August 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND &amp; SUMMARY JUDGMENT DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Aidamark filed suit against RFC on February 29, 2012, in the 17th Circuit Court for Kent County, Michigan. In its complaint, Aidamark alleged that it had not been paid \u201cthree categories of commissions\u201d by RFC. First, Aidamark alleged that RFC owed it for the $49,227.38 of invoiced sales described in the August 31, 2011, commission statement. Second, Ai-damark alleged that it was owed approximately $50,000 in sales commissions for purchases made by Interkal. Third, Aida-mark alleged that it had not been paid any commissions that it was owed under RFC\u2019s agreement with Steelcase to supply parts for the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d product. According to Aidamark, it had \u201cprocured\u201d the sales to Interkal that had been ordered but not shipped by August 31, 2011. Aidamark also alleged that it had \u201cprocured\u201d RFC\u2019s sales to Steelcase for the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d product, as it had \u201cprocured an agreement between RFC and Steelcase with estimated sales ... of $5 million to $7 million per year.\u201d Aidamark alleged a claim for breach of contract and a violation of the MSRA, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961, as well as claims for accounting and declaratory judgment, and sought relief in the form of actual damages, penalty damages, and statutorily authorized attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">On March 27, 2012, RFC removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">RFC filed for summary judgment on January 11, 2013, which the district court granted on December 27, 2013. In its decision, the district court found the language of the Agreement between Aida-mark and RFC to be unambiguous, and read its terms to define Aidamark\u2019s commissions as \u201cearned\u201d only upon RFC\u2019s receipt of payment from a customer. The court also held that RFC had demonstrated that the undisputed facts showed that RFC had paid commissions on all orders for which it received payment prior to the August 31, 2011, termination date of the Agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The district court also held that because the Agreement did not contain a provision that addressed post-termination commissions, the procuring cause doctrine applied as a matter of law to its terms. Citing Michigan law, the court noted that the procuring cause doctrine allows an agent who was \u201cthe procuring cause of the sale\u201d to recover a sales commission, even if he or she did not personally conclude or complete the sale. However, according to the district court, the undisputed facts showed that Aidamark had not been the procuring cause of any of the sales in question. Although Aidamark had assisted RFC in procuring the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d account and agreement, the district court reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the Agreement only allowed commissions on the actual sale of- goods, not future sales from a procured \u25a0 account or customer. The district court also rejected Aidamark\u2019s argument that the Steelcase/RFC agreement was a requirements contract, and reasoned that even if it were, Aidamark would still have had to prove that it was the procuring cause of any order submitted under it to RFC. Furthermore, although the sole purchase order made by Steelcase was placed and paid for during the Agreement\u2019s ninety day post-termination period, both events occurred after the June 2, 2011, date that marked the end of Aidamark\u2019s representation of RFC to RFC\u2019s clients. Thus, there was no evidence to show that Aidamark was the procuring cause of that order. The same was true for the Interkal orders placed after June 2, 2011, because Aidamark pointed to no evidence to show that it procured those orders. Because Aidamark was not entitled to any post-termination sales commissions, its accounting and declaratory judgment claims also failed as a matter of law. Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Aidamark filed a timely appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Hawkins v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>517 F.3d 321, 332 (6th Cir.2008). A moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must assume as true the evidence of the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (citing <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Aidamark presents three main arguments on appeal. First, it argues that RFC\u2019s contracts with Steelcase and Inter-kal were requirements contracts that created \u201csales\u201d when they were entered into, and therefore the district court erred in holding that no sales occurred until RFC actually received payment for orders. Second, Aidmark argues that the district court incorrectly held that it was not entitled to receive commissions after the date that the Agreement was terminated, because the provision governing commissions only \u201cgoverns the <em>timing </em>of when a commission must be paid,\u201d not whether or not the commission is earned. Third, it argues that the district court incorrectly applied the procuring cause doctrine by requiring Aidamark to show that it was the procuring cause of individual sales, rather than the procuring cause of the contracts between RFC and its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Where, as here, an action arises under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, \u201ca court must apply the same substantive law as would have been applied if the action had been brought in a state court of the jurisdiction where the federal court is located.\u201d <em>Corrigan v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>478 F.3d 718, 723 (6th Cir.2007). Michigan law, therefore, applies to Aidamark\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">A. Regardless of whether the Steel-case and Interkal contracts were requirements contracts, Aidamark was not entitled to sales commissions on anything but net billed sales for products shipped by RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Aidamark insists that RFC\u2019s contracts with Steelcase and Interkal were require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ments contracts, which, by its definition, constituted \u201csales\u201d for which it was owed commissions under the Agreement. The district court concluded that none of the \u201cAnswer JT\u201d agreements with Steelcase required Steelcase to purchase any products from RFC, and, even if they did, Aidamark would only be entitled to commissions on purchase orders that it had procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A requirements contract, which measures the .quantity of goods sold according to the buyer\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d requirements, is a valid contract for the sale of goods under Michigan\u2019s statutory adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d). Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 440.2306; <em>see also Precision Rubber Prods. Corp. v. George McCarthy, Inc., </em>872 F.2d 187, 188 (1989) (recognizing the enforceability of requirements contracts under \u201celementary contract law principles of offer and acceptance, which state that a contract may be formed even before the specific details of the time, place, and quantity of delivery are fixed\u201d). The purpose of the UCC provision governing requirements contracts is to fill in the gaps of a vague or ambiguous contract for the sale of goods between a buyer and seller. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 440.2306, cmt. 1 (stating that the statute \u201capplies to such contracts of nonproducing establishments such as dealers or distributors as well as to manufacturing concerns,\u201d whose \u201ccommercial background and intent\u201d will be read \u201cinto the language of any agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">However, as the district court correctly pointed out, a determination that the contracts between RFC and its customers were proper requirements contracts would not have helped Aidamark\u2019s case. Even if the Steelcase and Interkal contracts were indefinite, vague, or failed to contain terms that allowed those parties to agree' that a particular sale of goods occurred without applying the Michigan statute, any such controversy would be irrelevant to the determination of whether Aidamark earned a commission on those sales. The Agreement between RFC and Aidamark allowed only commissions for \u201cnet billed sales,\u201d not any conceivable sale of goods that the UCC might recognize. The agreement placed specific conditions on what constituted \u201cnet billed sales\u201d for purposes of earning a sales commission. First, the products had to be \u201csold by you in your territory\u201d and \u201cshipped by\u201d RFC. Second, the products actually had to be paid for: \u201cAll commissions herein provided for shall be considered as earned on the date of payment by the customer for the products sold by you, and not before\u201d payment. Under the terms of the Agreement with RFC, Aidamark was only entitled to commissions on sales that RFC actually billed to its customers, received payment for, and shipped to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In <em>Precision Rubber, </em>we interpreted a termination clause in a manufacturer\u2019s representative agreement that allowed the representative to recover commissions \u201con all orders from the territory accepted within sixty (60) days following the effective date of termination and shipped by the Manufacturer within one (1) year subsequent to date of termination.\u201d 872 F.2d at 188. This language required a remand for a factual determination as to whether the orders in question had been accepted by the manufacturer, creating valid sales. <em>Id. </em>at 188-90. Here, in contrast, the Agreement contained language that limited, by definition, any sales commission to \u201cearned\u201d commissions based on payment RFC received for products that it had actually billed and shipped. Whether or not the contracts between RFC and its clients were \u201crequirements\u201d contracts is not determinative of whether Aidamark is entitled to sales commissions. Rather, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>is the Agreement between Aidamark and RFC that defines the parties\u2019 rights. The Agreement only entitled Aidamark to recover commissions on sales that had been billed, shipped, and paid for, and it received payment for all products that met those criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">B. Aidamark was not entitled to receive commissions on orders for which RFC had billed but not yet received payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Aidamark also argues that it was entitled to receive commissions after the termination date of the Agreement because, under its terms, the commissions had already been \u201cearned.\u201d This argument is directed at the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Agreement and the ultimate conclusion that Aidamark had not earned any commissions on sales as defined therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Under Michigan law, \u201c[a] party asserting a breach of contract must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there was a contract (2) which the other party breached (3) thereby resulting in damages to the party claiming breach.\u201d <em>Miller-Davis Co. v. Ahrens Constr., Inc., </em>495 Mich. 161, 848 N.W.2d 95, 104 (2014) (citing <em>Stevenson v. Brotherhoods Mut. Benefit, </em>312 Mich. 81, 19 N.W.2d 494 (1945)). The interpretation of contract language is a matter of law. <em>Wilkie v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>469 Mich. 41, 664 N.W.2d 776, 780 (2003). Courts \u201cexamine the language in the contract, giving it its ordinary and plain meaning if such would be apparent to a reader of the instrument.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cIf </em>the language of the contract is unambiguous,\u201d a court will \u201cconstrue and enforce the contract as written.\u201d <em>Quality Prods. &amp; Concepts Co. v. Nagel Precision, Inc., </em>469 Mich. 362, 666 N.W.2d 251, 259 (2003) (citing <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. of Mich. v. Nikkei, </em>460 Mich. 558, 596 N.W.2d 915, 919 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">According to Aidamark, the following language from Paragraph 2 of the Agreement demonstrates that the sale of a product was all that was required to trigger RFC\u2019s obligation to pay a sales commission: \u201cWe agree to pay you a commission of 5% on net billed sales of all roll[-]formed products sold by you____\u201d Aidamark also argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted Paragraph 6 of the Agreement to require payment from a customer for Aidamark to earn its sales commission, contending that its language simply \u201cgoverns the <em>timing </em>of when of a commission must be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In its entirety, the relevant sentence of Paragraph 2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">We agree to pay you a commission of 5% on net billed sales of all roll[-]formed products sold by you in your territory as above defined and shipped by us, except cases where the quantities are large and the competitive situation indicates a reduction in price, in which cases your commission will be the subject of discussion and agreement prior to our accepting the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">The relevant portion of Paragraph 6 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">The commissions on net billed sales, as provided for herein, are in full payment for all services rendered by you under this agreement. All commissions herein provided for shall be considered as earned on the date of payment by the customer for the products sold by you, and not before, and all commissions earned shall be payable on the 10th of the month following that in which payment is received from the customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">The district court correctly held that the language of the Agreement was unambiguous, and it correctly interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Paragraph 6 to require payment by a customer <em>before </em>Aidamark earned its sales commission. Aidamark\u2019s emphasis on the \u201ctiming\u201d of its receipt of a sales commission payment distracts from the contractual substance of Paragraph 6: the creation of a condition precedent to RFC\u2019s performance of sales commission payment. Although the district court did not expressly characterize the language of Paragraph 6 as creating a condition precedent, that is clearly what it considered \u201cpayment by the customer\u201d to RFC to be, and rightly so. \u201cA \u2018condition precedent\u2019 is a fact or event that the parties intend must take place before there is a right to performance.\u201d <em>Yeo v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>219 Mich.App. 254, 555 N.W.2d 893, 895 (1996) (citing <em>Knox v. Knox, </em>337 Mich. 109, 59 N.W.2d 108, 112 (Mich.Ct.App.1953)). The right to performance that Aidamark seeks to enforce is RFC\u2019s payment of earned sales commissions. Paragraph 6, however, requires the event of \u201cpayment by the customer\u201d to take place before a sales commission is earned. Sales commissions are \u201cearned\u201d only on the date that a customer pays, \u201cand not before.\u201d Once that condition precedent has been satisfied, \u201call commissions earned shall be payable,\u201d and Aidamark is then entitled to payment of the earned commissions. \u201cA condition precedent is distinguished from a promise in that it creates no right or duty in itself, but is merely a limiting or modifying factor.\u201d <em>Real Estate One v. Heller, </em>272 Mich. App. 174, 724 N.W.2d 738, 741 (2006) (quoting <em>Mikonczyk v. Detroit Newspapers, Inc., </em>238 Mich.App. 347, 605 N.W.2d 360, 362 (1999)). The event of \u201cpayment by the customer\u201d is not a promise or a duty in itself, but an independent event that triggers Aidamark\u2019s right to payment of the earned commission. Although \u201ccourts are not inclined to construe stipulations of a contract as conditions precedent unless compelled by the language in the contract,\u201d the language of Paragraph 6 is unambiguous and compels this conclusion. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mikonczyk, </em>605 N.W.2d at 362).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Finally, where a condition precedent \u201cis not satisfied, there is no cause of action for a failure to perform the contract.\u201d <em>Harbor Park Mkt., Inc. v. Gronda, </em>277 Mich.App. 126, 743 N.W.2d 585, 588 (2007) (citing <em>Berkel &amp; Co. Contractors v. Christman Co., </em>210 Mich.App. 416, 533 N.W.2d 838, 840 (1995)). The district court properly granted summary judgment to RFC on Aidamark\u2019s breach of contract claim where the undisputed evidence showed that RFC paid Aidamark for all of the sales commissions earned by receipt of customer payment before the August 31, 2011, termination of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Aidamark cites <em>Bailey v. Fast Model Techs., LLC, </em>No. 10-15118, 2012 WL 1560642, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61383 (E.D.Mich. May 2, 2012), in which the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan applied the MSRA to require the defendant to pay the plaintiff sales commissions that had accrued prior to the termination of the plaintiffs employment. As the district court in <em>Bailey </em>noted, the MSRA itself states that it is \u201c[t]he terms of the contract between the principal and sales representative [that] determine when a commission becomes due.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961(2). The only contract language examined in <em>Bailey </em>was a phrase stating that sales commissions had to be paid \u201cat the end of each month once our account receivable department has received payment.\u201d Here, in contrast, the Agreement defines payment by the customer as the event which determines whether a commission is actually earned. In <em>Bailey, </em>there was no discussion of payment as a condition precedent to earning a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>C. The district court correctly applied the procuring cause doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Under the procuring cause doctrine, an \u201cagent is entitled to recover his commission whether or not he has personally concluded and completed [a] sale, it being sufficient if his efforts were the procuring cause of the sale.\u201d <em>Kuzin v. A &amp; J Precision Tool Co., </em>No. 217895, 2001 WL 694089, at *4 (Mich.Ct.App. Mar. 30, 2001) (per curiam) (footnote omitted). The district court held that the procuring cause doctrine applied to the Agreement because of the Agreement\u2019s silence on post-termination commissions. This was correct, as indeed the Agreement is silent as to such commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Application of the procuring cause doctrine does not, however, resuscitate Aidamark\u2019s claims or entitle it to commissions on sales. At best, the contracts between RFC and Interkal and RFC and Steelcase demonstrated that Aidamark played some role in procuring those customers for RFC. However, Aidamark pointed to no evidence in the record of any individual sales, as defined by the Agreement, for which it had not received a commission. Accordingly, the district court properly awarded summary judgment to RFC on Aidamark\u2019s claim that it was the procuring cause of any such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">. Another agreement, the \"Statement of Work,\u201d was signed on October 5, 2010, pursuant to the Master Purchase Agreement. The \"Statement of Work\" concerned services RFC would provide in the \"Answer JT\u201d design process, rather than the production of roll-formed parts, and was not the subject of Aidamark\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. Aidamark also argued that any provision of the Agreement that would have eliminated its post-termination commission was void under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961(8), a provision of the MSRA that declares void any contract provision that purports to waive a right set forth by the statute. The district court rejected this argument, finding that provision of the MSRA inapplicable because the Agreement did not contain a provision that addressed post-termination commissions. Since Aida-mark did not raise this particular argument on appeal, same is considered abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
