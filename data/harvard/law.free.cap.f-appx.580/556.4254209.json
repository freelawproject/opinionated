We have jurisdiction to review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-22\">Solis-Flores argues that he was entitled to an additional one-point reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) for acceptance of responsibility, even though he did not waive his appellate rights. The district court, however, already awarded the additional one-point reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-23\">Solis-Flores also contends that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement for a prior conviction of a felony crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Although Solis-Flores conceded that the underlying conviction was a felony on its face, he now asserts that the facts supporting the conviction do not satisfy the requirements for the felony portion of the state statute. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.46.020(2)(b). This amounts to a collateral attack on his prior conviction that may not be maintained at sentencing. <em>United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 884-85 (9th Cir.1994). The district court did not err in imposing the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
