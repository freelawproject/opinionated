The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Tadesse\u2019s application because it found Tadesse not credible, and the BIA affirmed this decision by adopting the IJ\u2019s order and providing additional support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. On appeal, Tadesse argues that the IJ and BIA failed to consider Tadesse\u2019s explanations for inconsistencies in his testimony and seeks a remand so the IJ can determine whether, after consideration of the totality of the circumstances, Tadesse is credible. Because the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we DENY Tadesse\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-1\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Mat\u00edas Tadesse was never active in Ethiopian politics. Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) at 170 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 58). His father, however, was an active member of a political party called the Coalition for Unity and Democracy \u2014 a party that opposed the ruling government in Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 18-19); A.R. 246-51 (Hr\u2019g Exhibit C). Tadesse\u2019s father unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for political office in 2005, and following the election, was imprisoned by the government for almost two years because of his membership in the opposition party. A.R. 132 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 20). According to Tadesse, the government released his father from prison only because he became very sick. <em>Id. </em>Tadesse\u2019s father died on December 20, 2007, just weeks after his release from prison. <em>Id. </em>at 132,136 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 20, 24); A.R. 243 (Hr\u2019g Exhibit B).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Despite not being involved in politics himself, Tadesse testified that after his father\u2019s death the government began to harass Tadesse because it believed he was \u201cfollowing [his] father\u2019s path.\u201d A.R. 132-33 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 20-21). According to Ta-desse, police regularly followed him home from school, shoved and threw him to the ground, blocked his path with police vehicles, and threatened to kill him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">In addition to the government, Tadesse testified that an opposition group made up of guerrilla fighters known as the Patriotic Front began harassing him in early 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 134 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 22). This group wanted Tadesse to join their opposition movement to fight the government and avenge his father\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>Tadesse testified that he refused to-join. <em>Id. </em>at 135 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 23). As a result, Tadesse was abducted by the group and taken at gunpoint to a training camp in the jungle where he was forced to participate in training activities. <em>Id. </em>at 135-39 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 23-27). When he refused to train, Ta-desse testified that he was severely beaten with a stick. <em>Id. </em>at 139 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27). After about one week at the training facility, Tadesse and a man named Yusef, an individual Tadesse had known prior to his abduction, escaped from the camp. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 28-29). Following their escape, Tadesse hid in his house for days out of fear that his abductors were looking for him. <em>Id. </em>at 142 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30). Although the guerrilla fighters never came for him, Tadesse claims that Yusef was shot dead while on his .front porch just a week after their escape by the same guerrilla fighters who abducted them. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30-31). Tadesse did not tell the police about the abduction because he feared the government would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>think that he joined an opposition party. <em>Id. </em>at 143 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">After discussing the details of his abduction with his mother, Tadesse left his home to live with his aunt in the Ethiopian city of Addis Ababa to hide from the government. <em>Id. </em>at 142-44 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30-32). During that time, Tadesse helped serve as an interpreter for an aid worker from Boston, Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 144 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 32). Through sponsorship from the aid worker, Tadesse was able to come to the United States as a visitor on August 18, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 144^45 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 32-33). Tadesse testified that he stayed at his sponsor\u2019s home in Boston for about a month before moving to Columbus, Ohio. <em>Id. </em>at 145 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 33). In Columbus, Tadesse attended high school and lived with a man named Seifu Begashaw, who promised to help Tadesse apply for asylum in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 145^46 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 33-34). But, despite Tadesse\u2019s requests for help, Begashaw would not assist Tadesse with his asylum application. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 36-37).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In February 2010, Tadesse filed an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. A.R. 394 (1-589 Form at 1). In his application, Tadesse stated that he sought asylum and withholding of removal based on political opinion and the Convention Against Torture. <em>Id. </em>at 398 (1-589 Form at 5). Two months later, Tadesse was served a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings. A.R. 453 (Notice of Hearing). At his removal hearing, Tadesse did not contest that he remained in the United States without authorization and was thus subject to removal. A.R. 119 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 7); A.R. 454 (Notice to Appear). Tadesse testified, however, that he was seeking asylum in the United States because he believed that his father\u2019s political opinion had been imputed to hi m, and he was afraid to return to Ethiopia because the Ethiopian government would make him suffer, torture him, or \u201ceven kill [him.]\u201d A.R. 125, 152, 156 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 13, 40, 44). He testified that his family in Ethiopia is not safe, noting that his mother was recently arrested and his brother has been threatened by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 153-54 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 41-42).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) did not find Tadesse to be a credible witness. A.R. 95 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 16). The IJ determined that Tadesse\u2019s testimony \u201cwas internally inconsistent\u201d and \u201cconflicted with his supporting documentation,\u201d and his answers on cross-examination \u201cwere evasive and were non-responsive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 16-17). In support, the IJ presented \u201ca representative, but not necessarily exhaustive list of inconsistencies in [Tadesse\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 17). These included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(1) Tadesse testified that the Patriotic Front abducted him in September 2007 to \u201cavenge his father\u2019s death,\u201d but then \u201cchanged his testimony\u201d on cross-examination to state that he was abducted in late 2007 when it was noted that his father died in December 2007, <em>id. </em>at 96 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 17);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(2) Tadesse testified that he was beaten at the training camp, but this was not in his personal statement or asylum application, <em>id. </em>at 97 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 18);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">(3) Tadesse testified that when he arrived in the United States he stayed in Boston for one month, but then later testified that he went directly to Columbus, and his personal statement said he traveled to Atlanta, Georgia before moving to Columbus, <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>(4) Tadesse testified that when he lived in Columbus, Begashaw \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to have contact with other people or even leave the house,\u201d but Bega-shaw enrolled Tadesse in a public high school, <em>id. </em>at 97-98 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 17-19);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(5) Tadesse was \u201cevasive and non-responsive\u201d when asked about the physical harm he received from government agents or police, <em>id. </em>at 98 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 19);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(6) Tadesse testified that Yusef was killed by guerrilla fighters one week after they escaped from the training camp in 2007, but his mother wrote a letter stating that Yusef was shot for selling t-shirts during a peaceful demonstration in 2005, <em>id.; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(7) Tadesse gave conflicting testimony about the contents of his visa application \u2014 first, he stated that he knew the contents of his visa application, but then during cross-examination testified that he did not understand what a visa application even is, <em>id. </em>at 98-99 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 19-20).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Based on these findings, the IJ denied Tadesse\u2019s application. The IJ also found Tadesse\u2019s application untimely, and it determined that Tadesse had offered insufficient evidence to support his claim that he experienced past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on political opinion, or that he would be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>at 100-08 (Oral Decision of the IJ at 21-29).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and dismissed Ta-desse\u2019s appeal. The BIA held that the IJ based its credibility determination on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d and cited as examples a number of the above \u201cinconsistencies\u201d to support this holding. A.R. 3-4 (BIA Decision at 1-2). In addition to these inconsistencies, the BIA found that Tadesse\u2019s testimony that he lived with his aunt in Addis Ababa for one year before coming to the United States conflicted with his asylum application, which stated that he lived in Addis Ababa from March 2008 to August 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 4 (BIA Decision at 2). The BIA also found that Ta-desse had not provided sufficient evidence to show that he would be tortured if he returned to Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5 (BIA Decision at 2-3). Because it upheld the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, the BIA did not address whether Tadesse\u2019s application was timely. <em>Id. </em>at 5 (BIA Decision at 3). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">On appeal, Tadesse challenges the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s credibility determinations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the BIA reviews the immigration judge\u2019s decision and issues a separate opinion, rather than summarily affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination.\u201d <em>Khalili v. Holder, </em>557 F.3d 429, 435 (6th Cir.2009). \u201cTo the extent the BIA adopted the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning, however, this Court also reviews the immigration judge\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>All legal determinations made by the IJ or BIA are reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Credibility determinations are considered findings of fact and are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Hachem v. Holder, </em>656 F.3d 430, 434 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Cir.2011) (citing <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>888 F.3d 924, 925 (6th Cir.2004)). Under this deferential standard, \u201c[w]e -will reverse a credibility determination only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Pergega v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 623, 627 (6th Cir. 2005)). Thus, we cannot reverse the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s credibility findings simply because we would have decided the issue differently. <em>Abdramane v. Holder, </em>569 Fed.Appx. 430, 434 (6th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The issue on appeal is whether the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determinations are supported by substantial evidence. Because Tadesse filed his asylum application in 2009, the \u201cstricter review\u201d of credibility determinations provided by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, applies. <em>El-Moussa v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 250, 256 (6th Cir.2009). \u201cUnder the REAL ID Act, credibility determinations are based on the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 and take into account \u2018all relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). The statute includes as relevant factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhM\">the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u201cThe same credibility standard applies to claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and for relief under the torture convention.\u201d <em>El-Moussa, </em>569 F.3d at 256 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Tadesse argues that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determinations were improper because they ignored Tadesse\u2019s explanations for the \u201cperceived inconsistencies\u201d in his testimony, which is contrary to the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test set forth in \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Petitioner Br. 9-10. In particular, Tadesse claims that the IJ and BIA failed to consider \u201cthe difficulty Tadesse had in converting dates from the Ethiopian to American calendar or its role in the creation of inconsistencies in his testimony, though the explanation was raised by Tadesse, [witness Tsegaye] Negera, and counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. Instead, Tadesse argues that the IJ simply found his testimony not credible by \u201ccherry-picking\u201d facts that supported an adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 22-23. Tadesse argues that because the process by which the IJ arrived at his credibility determination was flawed, remand is necessary to determine Tadesse\u2019s credibility after proper consideration of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d Petitioner Reply at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Tadesse\u2019s arguments fail because they overlook the relevant standard \u2014 we must affirm an adverse credibility determination that is based on substantial evidence. <em>Hachem, </em>656 F.3d at 434. Contrary to Tadesse\u2019s position, this is true regardless of whether all of the bases for an adverse credibility determination have merit or were properly considered by the IJ or BIA. <em>See, e.g., Ndrecaj v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 667, 675 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the evidence compels a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>at odds with the IJ\u2019s [credibility] decision\u201d even though \u201c[m]ost of the inconsistencies that the IJ mentioned were, irrelevant or not even inconsistencies at all.\u201d); see <em>also Al Ameri v. Holder, </em>361 Fed.Appx. 641, 645 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201c[S]o long as one of the identified grounds [for the adverse credibility finding] is supported by substantial evidence, we must accept the IJ\u2019s determination\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Yang Lin v. Holder, </em>320 F. App\u2019x 428, 432 (6th Cir.2009)). Indeed, here the IJ and BIA specifically listed a number of inconsistencies in their credibility findings that have nothing to do with Tadesse\u2019s difficulty remembering relevant dates. Yet, Tadesse largely ignores these inconsistencies in his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For example, the differences between the Ethiopian calendar and the Gregorian calendar used in the United States do not explain the inconsistency between Tadesse\u2019s claim that Yusef was shot by guerrilla fighters in front of his home in 2007 just a week after their escape from a training camp, A.R. 142-43 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30-31), and his mother\u2019s letter, which stated that Yusef was shot in 2005 for selling t-shirts during a peaceful protest, A.R. 262 (Hr\u2019g Exhibit D). Tadesse did not testify that this inconsistency was based on the differences between calendars. A.R. 177 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 65). Moreover, there is little doubt that Tadesse and his mother were talking about the same person \u2014 Tadesse testified that he had one friend named Yusef, <em>id. </em>at 165 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 53), and he consulted with his mother following his abduction and told her \u201call the things that happened\u201d leading up to his move to Addis Ababa, <em>id. </em>at 142, 176 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 30, 64). Given the significance of a friend being gunned down on his front doorstep just days after escaping the abductors\u2019 camp, by the same guerrilla fighters who abducted Tadesse, we would expect that Ta-desse\u2019s testimony would be corroborated by \u2014 or at least not conflict with \u2014 his mother\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In addition, Tadesse fails to contest the IJ\u2019s finding that Tadesse was \u201cevasive and nonresponsive\u201d when asked about physical harm he suffered from the government. <em>See Preldakaj v. Keisler, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 79, 84 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cImmigration judges are better positioned to discern credibility and assess the facts with the witnesses before them\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does Tadesse explain why we should not credit the IJ\u2019s credibility assessment regarding: the seemingly minor inconsistencies surrounding Tadesse\u2019s testimony about Begashaw restricting his access to others; Tadesse\u2019s testimony about the length of time he lived with his aunt in Addis Ababa; or Tadesse\u2019s conflicting testimony about the contents of his visa application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (\u201crelevant factors\u201d include the \u201cresponsiveness of the applicant[,] ... the internal consistency of each such statement^] ... and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, <em>without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Based on these inconsistencies alone, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determinations are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See El-Moussa, </em>569 F.3d at 256 (credibility findings that \u201care supported by the record[] entitle the IJ\u2019s overall adverse credibility determination to deference, regardless of whether the inconsistencies bear on the heart of [petitioner\u2019s] claim.\u201d). In particular, the inconsistencies regarding Yusef s death and the IJ\u2019s citation to specific instances in which Tadesse was \u201cevasive and non-responsive\u201d support this finding. Given the above inconsistencies, which remain largely uncontested by Tadesse, no reasonable adjudicator would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>feel \u201ccompelled\u201d to find Tadesse\u2019s claims credible. <em>Hachem, </em>656 F.3d at 434. Thus, contrary to Tadesse\u2019s claim, even if the IJ and BIA failed to consider reasonable explanations for the other \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Tadesse\u2019s testimony, we must affirm the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 675 (affirming the IJ\u2019s credibility determination despite the fact that \u201c[m]ost of the inconsistencies that the IJ mentioned were irrelevant or not even inconsistencies at all.\u201d); <em>Lulonga v. Holder, </em>410 Fed.Appx. 897, 901-02 (6th Cir.2010) (holding that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding was based on substantial evidence even though \u201cother inconsistencies identified by the IJ do not provide such support\u201d); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 403-04 (6th Cir.2005) (affirming IJ\u2019s credibility determination despite the IJ \u201crely[ing] on a number of questionable assumptions and conclusions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Because the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we DENY Tadesse\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\">. Tadesse does not appeal the BIA\u2019s holding that he provided insufficient evidence that he would be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. And while Tadesse initially contested the IJ\u2019s ruling that his application was untimely, he dropped that challenge in his reply brief because the BIA had not rested its decision on timeliness. Petitioner Reply at 11-12. Thus, these issues are not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
