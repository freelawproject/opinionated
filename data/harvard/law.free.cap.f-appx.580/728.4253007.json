We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">On March 7, 2006, Howard was arrested for her participation in distributing narcotics. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 955, 957 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (providing the factual background for Howard\u2019s arrest). Following a jury trial, Howard was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), 846, and one count of possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). Based on her status as a career offender, Howard received concurrent 30-year sentences on each count under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">We affirmed on direct appeal, <em>Howard, </em>252 Fed.Appx. at 962. Howard challenged the use of a prior state conviction as a career-offender predicate crime. We rejected her argument and concluded, because she had failed to object to various presentence-investigation-report provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>sions, Howard had admitted facts sufficient to show the prior crime was a career-offender-predicate crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 959-61 &amp; n. 2. In 2008, Howard filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district judge denied. Both the district judge and this court denied Howard\u2019s requests for a certificate of appeala-bility.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Howard filed a petition under \u00a7 2241 in 2010. Under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) \u00a7 2a, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she argued she was actually innocent of her sentences, which were based on pre-FSA disparities between powder and crack-cocaine sentences. Howard further contended she was actually innocent of her career-offender status, because several of her prior convictions did not qualify as career-offender predicate crimes. She asserted her predicate crimes had been established with improper documents, in violation of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). She further argued her 30-year sentences had been improperly enhanced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, based on a prior non-felony marijuana conviction. Howard argued she was entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief under the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) \u201csavings clause,\u201d because (1) she previously had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion; (2) her claims did not rely on newly discovered evidence or new rules of constitutional law; and (3) therefore, a successive \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate to test the illegality of her detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The district judge characterized Howard\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as an attempt to cir-eumvent the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. The judge dismissed the petition and concluded (1) the FSA did not apply retroactively; (2) Howard could not satisfy the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, because her sentences did not exceed the statutory m\u00e1ximums for her convictions; and (3) her actual-innocence claim was misplaced, because she was not charged with, or convicted of, being a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">On appeal, Howard argues the district judge erred when he dismissed her \u00a7 2241 petition. She contends several recent Supreme Court cases established she was convicted of a nonexistent crime \u2014 her career-offender designation. She further argues barring her from \u00a7 2241 relief will violate the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">We review de novo whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). When a conviction has become final, a federal prisoner usually may challenge the legality of her detention only through a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1256. When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, she must apply for and receive permission from this court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (cross-referencing <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2244); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Section 2241 habeas petitions generally are reserved for challenges to the execution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, not the validity of the sentence itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>or the fact of confinement. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1288. Howard, however, may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if she meets her burden of showing that a \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [her] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Whether the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause may \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 petition is a jurisdictional issue that must be decided before addressing the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Bryant, 738 </em>F.3d at 1262 (citing <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337-40 (11th Cir.2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not render a \u00a7 2255 remedy \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. <em>See id. </em>at 1267 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To show a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of her detention, a petitioner asserting a sentencing-error claim must establish (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed the claim during the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (2) after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, a United States Supreme Court decision overturned that circuit precedent; (3) the rule announced in that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; and (4) as a result of that new rule, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress. <em>See id. </em>at 1274, 1281. The savings clause does not reach Guidelines-error sentencing claims brought by a prisoner whose sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1264 (citing <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1295, 1301-03 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions also do not violate the Suspension Clause, because they (1) simply transfer from the district court to the court of appeals a screening function that previously would have been performed by the district judge; and (2) do not deprive the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions. <em>See Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 661-62, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 2339-40, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (addressing successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petitions); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In her \u00a7 2241 petition, Howard sought to attack the validity of her sentence, and not its execution; therefore, \u00a7 2255 was the appropriate statute for her claims. <em>See Bryant, 738 </em>F.3d at 1288. To bring her claims via a \u00a7 2241 petition, Howard was required to show \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of her detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256, 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">After being convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), 846, and one count of possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), Howard was sentenced to concurrent 30-year imprisonment sentences on each count. The statutory maximum sentence for a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) committed, after one has sustained a prior conviction for a felony drug offense is life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Absent a prior felony drug conviction, the statutory maximum sentence for a \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) violation is 40 years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The statutory maximum sentences for violations of \u00a7 846, where the object of the conspiracy was a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), are the same. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Howard\u2019s 30-year sentences do not exceed her statutory m\u00e1ximums, regardless of whether the district judge erred when he determined she was a ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>reer offender, improperly subjected her to enhanced sentences for having a prior felony drug conviction, or violated <em>Shepard. See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 846. Therefore, the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause does not apply to her sentence-enhancement or career-offender claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1264 (\u201cWe [have] held definitively that the savings clause does not reach a guidelines-error sentencing claim when the prisoner\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum.\u201d (citing <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1295)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Howard\u2019s claims that she is actually innocent of being a career offender and was convicted of the \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d of being a career offender also do not change the result here. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1285 (\u201c[0]ne cannot be actually innocent of a sentencing enhancement.\u201d); <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1320 (rejecting the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was actually innocent of being a career offender, because he was neither charged with, nor convicted of, being a career offender). Howard\u2019s claim of a purported Suspension Clause violation likewise does not entitle her to relief, because the claim ultimately rests on the restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Felker, </em>518 U.S. at 661-62, 664, 116 S.Ct. at 2339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Even if a claim based on the FSA were cognizable under the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, the FSA does not apply to defendants, like Howard, who were sentenced before its August 3, 2010, enactment. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (affirming the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction). Accordingly, Howard has not shown the district judge erred in dismissing her \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. The FSA reduced the \"100-to-l crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-l.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-15\">. The Suspension Clause provides: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">. Howard also asserts this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>727 F.3d 1076 (11th Cir.2013), <em>vacated pending reh'g en banc, </em>(11th Cir. Mar. 7, 2014), and <em>Zack v. Tucker, </em>704 F.3d 917 (11th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 156, 187 L.Ed.2d 109 (2013), support her various claims. Contrary to Howard\u2019s arguments, our decisions in <em>Spencer </em>and <em>Zack </em>do not support her claim that she was sentenced above the statutory m\u00e1ximums. <em>See Spencer, </em>727 F.3d 1076 (addressing, in an initial, timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion, a claim that a new, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision rendered the petitioner\u2019s career-offender status erroneous, without any discussion of the applicable statutory maximum sentence): <em>Zack, </em>704 F.3d 917 (recognizing the statute of limitations for habeas petitions applies on a claim-by-claim basis, without any discussion of statutory maximum sentences).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
