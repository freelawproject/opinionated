We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In June 2006, Dixon pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine and 5 or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and 846 (Count 1); and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of, a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 2). Dixon\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which applied the 2005 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, assigned her a base offense level of 38 for Count 1, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), because she was accountable for 2.8 kilograms of cocaine base. The PSI awarded a 3-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, which yielded a total offense level of 35. The PSI assigned a criminal history category of I, which yielded a Sentencing Guidelines range of 168-210 months of imprisonment as to Count 1. Dixon was subject to a consecutive term of 5 years to life on Count 2, under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">The district judge adopted the PSI Guidelines calculations and departed downward from the Guidelines range, based on Dixon\u2019s substantial assistance to the government, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. On each count, the judge imposed consecutive 60-month sentences, the mandatory minimums, for a total sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">In 2008, Dixon moved to reduce her sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district judge denied Dixon\u2019s motion, because, based on the facts underlying Dixon\u2019s original sentence, including her substantial assistance, the judge would not have reduced her sentence below 120 months even after applying Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">In November 2011, Dixon filed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on appeal, based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Dixon asserted her \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction had resulted in an initial sentence 67% below her original Guidelines range. She requested a comparable reduction below her amended Guidelines range, and argued that denying a further reduction would effectively lessen the benefit of her prior substantial-assistance reduction. In her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Dixon also discussed her various efforts toward rehabilitation. The district judge denied Dixon\u2019s motion, because Amendment 750 did not result in a change to Dixon\u2019s Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">On appeal, we vacated and remanded for the district judge to reconsider whether Dixon was entitled to a sentence reduction comparable to the reduction she received under \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>507 Fed.Appx. 880, 881, 883 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam). We concluded the district judge clearly had erred, when she determined Amendment 750 did not have the effect of reducing Dixon\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 883. Had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time of Dixon\u2019s sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>her total offense level would have been 33, which would have yielded a 135-to-168-month Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>We noted that, on remand, the district judge could determine a further reduction below the sentence Dixon received for her substantial assistance was not warranted based on the facts of her case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On remand, the district judge again denied Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The judge noted she was \u201cimpressed by and applaud[ed]\u201d Dixon\u2019s \u201csubstantial and meaningful\u201d post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, and the judge encouraged Dixon \u201cto remain on a positive path toward reentry.\u201d ROA at 328. The judge acknowledged Amendment 750 reduced Dixon\u2019s guideline range to 135-168 months. The judge concluded, however, the facts and circumstances of Dixon\u2019s case, including those pertaining to Count 2, warranted a 120-month sentence, particularly after considering Dixon\u2019s co-conspirators\u2019 sentences. The judge further determined a 60-month sentence on Count 1 remained sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On appeal, Dixon argues the district judge erred by failing to consider Dixon\u2019s eligibility for both a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction and a reduction based on Amendment 750. According to Dixon, the denial of her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion dilutes her prior \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction and results in inequality between this circuit and circuits in which defendants received \u00a7 5K1.1 reductions resulting in sentences below the mandatory m\u00ednimums. Dixon also contends she was eligible for a sentence reduction based in part on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">We review a district judge\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (11th Cir. 2010). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a judge may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence she would have received if the Guidelines that applied at the time of her sentencing had been the same as after the amendment. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 340 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that eligibility for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on Amendment 750 turns on whether a defendant \u201cwould have had a lower guidelines range had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time he was sentenced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Where a Guidelines amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range, the district judge must decide whether, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the judge should exercise her discretion to impose a newly calculated sentence under the amended Guidelines. <em>Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337. A district judge need not articulate specifically the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, as long as the record shows the pertinent factors were taken into account by the judge. <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Amendment 750, which re-promulgated Amendment 748, effectively reduced the offense levels previously applicable to offenses involving various amounts of cocaine base. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750; <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2011) (assigning a base offense level of 36 to offenses involving at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2006) (assigning a base offense level of 38 to offenses involving at least 1.5 kilograms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>but less than 5 kilograms of cocaine base). The FSA, which lowered the statutory minimum sentences for various cocaine-base offenses, does not apply to defendants who originally were sentenced before its August 3, 2010, enactment. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Dixon has not shown the district judge abused her discretion in denying Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1074-75. The judge correctly concluded Amendment 750 lowered Dixon\u2019s guideline range to 135-168 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2011). The judge stated she had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the facts and circumstances of Dixon\u2019s case, her substantial rehabilitative efforts, and the sentences of her co-conspirators. Although the judge did not refer explicitly to Dixon\u2019s substantial assistance, the record does not suggest the judge did not consider this factor, given that the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was decided by the same district judge, who (1) imposed Dixon\u2019s initial sentence and (2) discussed Dixon\u2019s substantial assistance in the order denying her 2008 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Dixon has alleged no facts supporting her suggestion the denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion resulted in unwarranted disparities between her and other defendants with similar records who were convicted of similar conduct, in this or other circuits. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (instructing sentencing judges about \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Finally, Dixon\u2019s argument as to the FSA has no bearing on her case, because the FSA does not apply to defendants, like Dixon, who initially were sentenced before its August 2010 enactment. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Dixon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
