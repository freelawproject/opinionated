Johnson contends that this condition is greater than necessary and unreasonable in light of her financial circumstances. We review for abuse \u2022 of discretion, <em>see United States v. Batson, </em>608 F.3d 630, 632-33 (9th Cir.2010), and find, none. The restitution order is reasonably related to the goals of deterrence and providing just punishment, and it does not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3563(b)(2) and 3583(c), (d); <em>Batson, </em>608 F.3d at 636-37 (district court may order, as a condition of supervised release, restitution in the amount of loss caused by the offense of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
