R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-18\"> The Honorable Mark W. Bennett, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">John Arthur Walthall appeals (1) his convictions following a jury trial for multiple counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and for failure to appear, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and (2) his 168-month sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Because the facts and circumstances of this case are well-known to the parties, we repeat them only as necessary to explain our decision. We address his claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Joinder of counts is proper under Fed.R. Crim.P. 8(a) if the offenses charged were \u201cconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Jawara, </em>474 F.3d 565, 572 (9th Cir.2007). Here, the charges of fraud and Walthall\u2019s subsequent attempt to avoid prosecution by flight were so connected. <em>See United States v. Irvine, </em>756 F.2d 708, 712 (9th Cir.1985) (separate criminal conduct designed to avoid prosecution may properly be joined with the primary substantive offense). Moreover, evidence of flight is generally admissible to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. <em>See United States v. Guerrero, </em>756 F.2d 1342, 1347 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b638-22\">The evidence of Walthall\u2019s guilt of wire fraud was overwhelming to say the least. His \u201cpartnership\u201d claims are pure casuistry and require no elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-23\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b638-24\">The district court did not deny Walt-hall\u2019s requests for expert funds. To quote his attorney, \u201call we\u2019re ... asking for [are] subpoenas. We\u2019re not asking to pay any doctor.\u201d [G.E.R. 463] Moreover, we discern no prejudice to him from any of the district court\u2019s rulings in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-25\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b638-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Walthall\u2019s \u201ctheory of his defense\u201d instruction. The court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>regarded his proposed instruction as the equivalent of closing argument. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>991 F.2d 1493, 1497 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>72 F.3d 1370, 1380 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The district court properly denied Walt-hall\u2019s last minute request for a substitution of counsel. The court\u2019s findings that there was no total breakdown in attorney-client communications, and that the purpose for the motion was delay, are fully supported by the record. <em>See Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-15, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Given (1) the vulnerability of Walthall\u2019s victims, (2) his outrageous abuse of their trust as a purported financial advisor and partner, and (3) his massive use of their money for his personal expenses, Walt-hall\u2019s sentence, the award of restitution in the amount of $2,479,000, and a three-year period of supervised release were eminently reasonable. His apprehension in Nevada under a false name in possession of ten cell phones with different area codes, multiple weapons including a \u201csilencer,\u201d and a book entitled <em>How to Be Invisible </em>demonstrate not only that he is a confirmed criminal, but a dangerous one at that.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b638-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
