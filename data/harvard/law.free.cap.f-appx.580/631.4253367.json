We deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-29\">Mr. Evans was convicted of crimes in Kansas after a jury trial and sentenced to 620 months\u2019 imprisonment. 1 R. 4. The Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court of Kansas denied review. 1 R. 5; <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Evans, </em>\u2014 Kan.App.2d -, 154 P.3d 1184, 2007 WL 1042136 (Kan.Ct.App.2007). Mr. Evans unsuccessfully sought post-conviction relief in state court under Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-1507. <em>Evans v. State, </em>\u2014 Kan.App.2d-, 248 P.3d 281, 2011 WL 1004609 (Kan.Ct.App.2011). He filed his petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 on January 3, 2012. 1 R. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Mr. Evans raised eight grounds for relief in his habeas petition: (1) an English-speaking witness was impermissibly allowed to testify in Spanish through an interpreter; (2) insufficient evidence of \u201cforce or fear\u201d to convict him of rape and aggravated sodomy; (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (4) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; (5) failure to give a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense; (6) jury instruction error; (7) insufficient evidence related to an alternative charge; and (8) error in calculating his criminal history score at sentencing. 1 R. 8-17. The district court found that the first claim and parts of the third and fourth claims (ineffective assistance) were procedurally barred and that Mr. Evans failed to show any result contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as to the remaining claims. <em>Evans v. Kansas, </em>No. 12-3002-SAC, 2014 WL 839232 (D.Kan. Mar. 4, 2014). The district court found an eviden-tiary hearing was not warranted, and denied a COA. <em>Id. </em>at *14; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Evans challenges all of those determinations in his brief and request for a COA. Aplt. Br. 1-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">For this court to grant a COA, Mr. Evans must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As to the claims rejected on the merits, Mr. Evans must show that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. As to the procedurally barred claims, Mr. Evans must show both \u201ca valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">The district court\u2019s procedural rulings are not reasonably debatable. While Mr. Evans raised the propriety of allowing an English-speaking witness to testify in Spanish in his \u00a7 60-1507 motion, he abandoned that claim on appeal. <em>Evans, </em>2014 WL 839232, at *2. <em>See O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 848, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). He has not shown cause, prejudice, or a fundamental miscarriage of justice to overcome the default. Mr. Evans did not properly present his ineffective assistance claims\u2014 regarding trial counsel\u2019s advice not to testify and appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise ineffectiveness and the interpreter issue\u2014 to the state courts. <em>Evans, </em>2014 WL 839232, at *3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Nor do we think the district court\u2019s resolution of the remaining claims on the merits is reasonably debatable. There is no established constitutional right to a lesser-included offense instruction in non-capital cases. <em>See Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004). Mr. Evans has not identified any clearly established federal law that would contradict the state trial court\u2019s defining the word \u201centered\u201d during jury instruction in a way that comports with Kansas law. <em>See Evans, </em>2007 WL 1042136, at *2. Insofar as Mr. Evans\u2019s claims that there was insufficient evidence to find \u201cforce or fear\u201d or intent, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>court reasonably applied a legal standard consistent with <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>See Evans, </em>2007 WL 1042136, at *4. With respect to his ineffective assistance claims for both trial and appellate counsel, the state courts reasonably applied law consistent with <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>See Evans, </em>2011 WL 1004609, at *1-3. And as to criminal history, a prior conviction need not be proved by a reasonable doubt, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and the state court applied Kansas law consistent with <em>Apprendi. See Evans, </em>2007 WL 1042136, at *5. We perceive no federal right implicated by Mr. Evans\u2019 contention that the state court failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 60-1507 motion, and therefore the district court\u2019s rejection of this claim is not reasonably debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Mr. Evans\u2019s application for a COA is DENIED, the appeal is DISMISSED, and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
