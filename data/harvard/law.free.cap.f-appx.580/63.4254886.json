We appointed counsel, who has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that all potential grounds for appeal are frivolous. For the reasons that follow, we will grant the motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>withdraw and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In May 2003, Chambers was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and sentenced to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 3 years of supervised release. Chambers was released from prison in 2009 and began his term of supervised release at that time. In September 2011, Chambers was implicated in a shooting outside a nightclub in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. He evaded authorities until January 2012, when he was arrested in possession of a loaded firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Dauphin County officials charged Chambers with attempted homicide in connection with the September 2011 shooting. He was convicted after a jury trial, <em>see </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 4 n. 1, and in May 2013, he was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison for attempted homicide, to be followed by a consecutive 5-to-10-year sentence for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. (App.31-32.) Separately, Chambers was indicted by federal authorities under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) for possession of the aforementioned firearm in January of 2012. He was again convicted after a jury trial. On November 13, 2013, the same day as the revocation proceeding at issue here, the District Court found that Chambers qualified as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and sentenced him to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release. Chambers\u2019s appeal from that judgment remains pending before this Court at docket number 13-4577.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">On November 7, 2013, the United States Probation Office initiated revocation proceedings against Chambers on the grounds that these convictions constituted a violation of a \u201cGeneral Condition\u201d of Chambers\u2019s supervised release: namely, that he \u201cshall not commit another federal, state or local crime.\u201d (App.31.) Chambers, whose criminal history category was VI, initially faced a Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). However, because the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release at issue, i.e., the 2003 conviction under \u00a7 922(g), is a class C felony, Chambers faced a statutory maximum of 24 months on the revocation, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which is what the Probation Office ultimately recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">At the hearing on November 13, 2013, Chambers\u2019s counsel did not contest the basis for the revocation. Instead he argued that any additional consecutive term of imprisonment would be excessive. (App.51.) The District Court, noting that it had \u201cconsidered all [the] statements and the information contained in the violation petition and dispositional report,\u201d imposed a sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment to be served consecutively to the aforementioned state and federal sentences. (App.52.) Chambers filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this case under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3231 and 3583(e). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Counsel may seek to withdraw from representation if, \u201cafter a conscientious examination\u201d of the record, <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, he or she is \u201cpersuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit.\u201d 3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2(a). If we concur with this assessment, we \u201cwill grant counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, and dispose of the appeal without appointing new counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">When presented with an <em>Anders </em>brief, our inquiry is two-fold: \u201c(1) whether coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>sel adequately fulfilled [Rule 109.2(a)\u2019s] requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). The <em>Anders </em>brief must \u201csatisfy the court that counsel has thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d and also \u201cexplain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While \u201c[c]ounsel need not raise and reject every possible claim[,] ... at a minimum, he or she must meet the \u2018conscientious examination\u2019 standard set forth in <em>Anders.\u201d Id. </em>If we find that \u201cthe <em>Anders </em>brief initially appears adequate on its face,\u201d in the second step of our analysis we will \u201cconfine our scrutiny to those portions of the record identified by ... [the] <em>Anders </em>brief,\u201d as well as \u201cthose issues raised in Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Counsel here identifies three potentially appealable issues: (1) the jurisdictional basis for the District Court\u2019s revocation; (2) the adequacy of the Government\u2019s proof of the violations; and (3) the reasonableness of the sentence. Chambers has not submitted a brief on his own behalf. Our independent review of the record confirms that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">A. The District Court\u2019s Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Because the conduct underlying Chambers\u2019s 2003 federal conviction occurred within the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. In connection with Chambers\u2019s sentence in that matter, the District Court had the authority both to impose and revoke a term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583. Accordingly, there is no basis for a challenge to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">B. Sufficiency of Proof of the Supervised Release Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Before revoking a term of supervised release, the district court must \u201cfind[ ] by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). As noted by Chambers\u2019s counsel at the time of sentencing, it was uncontested that Chambers had been convicted of serious state and federal offenses during his period of supervised release. (App. 51 (acknowledgement by Chambers\u2019s counsel that \u201cwe obviously cannot have any argument about the Grade A violation in the revocation.\u201d)). We agree with counsel that any challenge to the evidentiary support for Chambers\u2019s revocation would have been meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">C. Reasonableness of the Revocation Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">We review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness, and the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc). First, we examine the record for significant procedural errors \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Here, the District Court correctly noted that Chambers faced a maximum term of imprisonment of 24 months, which was in fact below the advisory Guidelines range. The record of the November 13, 2013 proceeding further reflects that the Court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>including the nature of Chambers\u2019s violation and Chambers\u2019s long criminal history. (App.48^49.) Accordingly, we conclude that Chambers\u2019s sentence was procedurally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">If no procedural errors exist, we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The District Court \u201cmust demonstrate that it reasonably applied [the \u00a7 3533(a) ] factors to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d 540, 543 (3d Cir.2007). Our review is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[U]nless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence,\u201d we affirm. <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568. We have also noted that when a sentence at issue is for a violation of the conditions of supervised release, that sentence must \u201cprimarily ... sanction the defendant\u2019s breach of trust \u2018while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bungar, </em>478 F.3d at 544 (quoting <em>United States v. Dees, </em>467 F.3d 847, 853 (3d Cir.2006)). Imposition of a consecutive sentence, although not mandatory, falls within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>United States v. Swan, </em>275 F.3d 272, 281-82 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">. At the November 13, 2013 hearing, in connection with sentencing Chambers on his violation of \u00a7 922(g), the District Court noted that Chambers was a repeat felony offender with a history of firearms-related offenses and a recent conviction for attempted homicide. The Court found that Chambers had \u201cshown no respect for the law generally and no respect for society in his adult life,\u201d and further found that \u201crecidivism is likely in this case,\u201d given that Chambers \u201chas been undeterred by previous periods of incarceration.\u201d (App.48.) In light of these factors, which were equally as applicable to Chambers\u2019s sentencing on his revocation of supervised release as they were to his sentencing on the firearms charge, the imposition of a consecutive sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">In conclusion, we find that counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief reflects a conscientious examination of the record. Our independent review confirms that there\u2019 are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal. We will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
