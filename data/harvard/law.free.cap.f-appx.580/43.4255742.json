We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We review orders granting summary judgment de novo and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). We are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the nonmovant. <em>See Nationwide Life Ins. Co. v. Bankers Leasing Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>182 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">A plenary review of the record reveals that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned decision. Additionally, Uciechowski failed to raise any arguments either with respect to her state law claims or claims based on events occurring before March 3, 2008. She has therefore waived review of these issues on appeal. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">We have considered all of Uciechowski\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
