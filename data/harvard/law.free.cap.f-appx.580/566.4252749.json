(the \u201cDamages Award\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">The district court properly determined that JustMed could recover as damages the replacement cost of the computer source code that Byce converted. Byce does not dispute liability, and concedes that he converted all versions of the computer source he had developed for Just-Med. He likewise does not dispute that JustMed spent $41,250 developing new source code to replace the code he converted. Instead, Byce argues that Idaho conversion law, categorically, does not permit a plaintiff to recover the damages at issue \u2014 replacement cost of converted source code. We reject this narrow reading of the law. Idaho permits broad recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, <em>see Luzar v. W. Sur. Co., </em>107 Idaho 693, 692 P.2d 337, 342-43 (1984), as well as consequential damages that have been proven with reasonable certainty, <em>see Nora v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>99 Idaho 60, 577 P.2d 347, 351 (1978). The damages at issue here are clearly permissible under <em>Luzar </em>and <em>Nora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">The district court did not clearly error by finding that Byce\u2019s conversion caused JustMed to reproduce the code, nor that it cost JustMed $41,250 to do so. <em>See Tonry v. Security Experts, Inc., </em>20 F.3d 967, 970 (9th Cir.1994) (reviewing the district court\u2019s factual findings, including the calculation of damages, for clear error), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>7 Cal.4th 1238, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). Under Idaho law, damages must be proven with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Clear Lakes Trout Co., Inc., </em>143 Idaho 733, 152 P.3d 604, 611 (2007). Here, testimony at trial sufficiently supported the district court\u2019s damages award. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cReasonable certainty requires neither absolute assurance nor mathematical exactitude; rather, the evidence need only be sufficient to remove the existence of damages from the realm of speculation.\u201d). To the extent that Byce cites alleged inconsistencies in the trial testimony, the district court as trier of fact was tasked with resolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>these conflicts. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (stating that a district court\u2019s factual findings should be upheld if they are \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing the Damages Award as a supplemental order to its August 29, 2007 Memorandum Decision, rather than issuing a new judgment and order. <em>See Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, </em>365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.2004) (motion to vacate judgment reviewed for an abuse of discretion). Byce argues that this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>JustMed, Inc. v. Byce, </em>600 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir.2010), required the district court to vacate its prior judgments in' this matter. The decision, however, did not order that the prior judgments be vacated, <em>see id. </em>at 1131, and the district court\u2019s decision to supplement its prior order therefore did not violate this court\u2019s mandate. <em>See Herrington v. Cnty. of Sonoma, </em>12 F.3d 901, 904 (9th Cir.1993) (stating that \u201cthe rule of mandate allows a lower court to decide anything not foreclosed by the mandate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Byce argues for the first time on appeal that, because the district court failed to vacate its prior judgments, he \u201ccould well be made to pay continuing interest\u201d on the district court\u2019s prior damages award. Because Byce did not properly raise this argument before the district court, and fails to cite a single case supporting his assignment of error, the argument is waived. <em>See O\u2019Rourke v. Seabord Sur. Co. (In re E.R. Fegert, Inc.), </em>887 F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir.1989) (stating that an \u201cargument must be raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it\u201d); <em>see also Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 930 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that appellant bears the \u201cburden on appeal to present the court with legal arguments to support its claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">We deny JustMed\u2019s Motion for Attorney Fees on Frivolous Appeal. <em>See Grimes v. C.I.R., </em>806 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201can appeal that lacks merit is not always frivolous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
