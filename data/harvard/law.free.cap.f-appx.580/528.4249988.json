We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh could safely and reasonably relocate within India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), 1208.16(b)(1). The country reports indicate that the Punjabi police would not pursue a non-militant, rank-and-file AISSF member like Singh outside the Punjab region, and that the national authorities would have no interest in someone with Singh\u2019s background. Sikhs may practice their religion without restriction in every state, and there are substantial Sikh communities throughout India where Singh and his family could reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination regarding relocation, substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3)(ii), (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
