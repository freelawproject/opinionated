The International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 18 (the \u201cEngineers\u201d) \u2014 a local chapter of the International Union of Operating Engineers (\u201cIUOE\u201d) \u2014 alleges that members of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America (\u201cLIUNA\u201d) and its local affiliates (collectively, the \u201cLaborers\u201d) performed work that the controlling agreement between the two unions\u2014 the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d \u2014 allocates to the Engineers, breaching the terms of that agreement. We reverse the district court\u2019s 12(b)(6) dismissal, concluding that the district court erred in finding that the agreement did not meet the criteria necessary to allege an enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">As a threshold matter, we reject the Laborers\u2019 contention that the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) has ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>elusive jurisdiction over this case. Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d) grants district courts the power to entertain \u201c[sjuits for violation <em>of </em>contracts between ... labor organizations,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), covering any agreement that is \u201csignificant to the maintenance of labor peace between\u201d such unions. <em>Retail Clerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local Unions Nos. 128 &amp; 633 v. Lion Dry Goods, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 17, 28, 82 S.Ct. 541, 7 L.Ed.2d 503 (1962); <em>see also Equitable Res., Inc. v. United Steel, Paper &amp; Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied Indus. &amp; Serv. Workers Int\u2019l Union, </em>621 F.3d 538, 550 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201c[Mjatters primarily of contract interpretation ... remain within the federal courts\u2019 \u00a7 301 jurisdiction.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). But when a dispute involves \u201cprimarily representational\u201d matters under Sections 7 or 8 of the LMRA \u2014 which \u201cregulate the vital, economic instruments of the strike and the picket line\u201d \u2014 the NLRB has exclusive jurisdiction. <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 241, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">This case presents primarily contractual issues and thus belongs in federal court. The Engineers press only their rights under the Memorandum. The complaint, \u201cseeking damages for breach of an agreement between labor organizations,\u201d makes no reference to sections 7 or 8 of the LMRA, \u201cunlike a traditional <em>Garmon </em>preemption claim.\u201d <em>Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Trafftech, </em>461 F.3d 690, 694 (6th Cir.2006). Rather, this case resembles those involving primarily contractual issues. <em>See, e.g., Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers &amp; Helpers v. Olympic Plating Indus., </em>870 F.2d 1085, 1089 (6th Cir.1989) (federal jurisdiction proper when claims interpreted a union\u2019s constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Turning to the merits, the district court dismissed the complaint because, in its view, the Memorandum did not include the typical indicia of an enforceable contract under Ohio law. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal, <em>Miller v. Currie, </em>50 F.3d 373, 377 (6th Cir.1995), asking whether the complaint \u201ccontain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A claim arising under Section 301 is \u201cessentially a breach of contract allegation,\u201d <em>Schreiber v. Philips Display Components Co., </em>580 F.3d 355, 363 (6th Cir.2009), and we apply \u201ctraditional rules for contractual interpretation ... as long as their application is consistent with federal labor policies.\u201d <em>UAW v. Yard-Man, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 1476, 1479 (6th Cir.1983). The parties here dispute two key contractual elements: (1) manifestation of mutual assent; and (2) consideration. The Engineers\u2019 complaint alleges both elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Regarding mutual assent, the Memorandum unambiguously provides that members of the respective unions \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d perform certain types of work. <em>See 1 </em>Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1:2 (4th ed.) (\u201cA promise is a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promise in understanding that a commitment has been made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The Laborers contend that the Memorandum cannot constitute an enforceable agreement because it omits many \u201ctraditional\u201d contract elements such as the words \u201cagreement\u201d or \u201ccontract,\u201d various standard provisions (such as a choice of law provision), and language \u201cbinding] local unions, district councils, employers, or project owners.\u201d But \u201c[n]o form of words is necessary to create a promise or cove<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>nant; all that is essential is that on a fair interpretation, it appears that the purported promisor has agreed to do the act in question.\u201d 13 Williston on Contracts \u00a738:14.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Laborers\u2019 also maintain that the Memorandum is not enforceable against the local affiliates. Yet the complaint plausibly alleges that LIUNA acted as an agent of the Laborers in negotiating the Memorandum. Citing LIUNA\u2019s constitution, the complaint alleges that LIU-NA \u201cis authorized to establish, declare, decide and enforce all matters of policy for and on behalf of ... its subordinate bodies and members.\u201d Moreover, the Memorandum\u2019s division of duties among the \u201cmembers\u201d of the two international unions suggests that LIUNA in fact exercised this authority. The allegation that \u201cthe International Unions intended that their local affiliates would benefit from, and be bound by,\u201d the Memorandum is thus plausible, and the Memorandum may plausibly be interpreted to grant the respective international chapters the authority to settle jurisdictional disputes on the local affiliates\u2019 behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Laborers also challenge the Memorandum\u2019s enforceability for want of consideration, noting that it contains no language \u201cagreeing] to forego [sic] certain work.\u201d Yet we can infer that each union intended to agree to forgo performing work that the Memorandum allocates to the other \u2014 the bargained for benefits of the jurisdictional agreement \u2014 because the Memorandum\u2019s division of labor would be meaningless otherwise. <em>See Perlmuter Printing Co. v. Strome, Inc., </em>436 F.Supp. 409, 414 (N.D.Ohio 1976); <em>Kostelnik v. Helper, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1, 770 N.E.2d 58, 61 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Last, the Laborers ask us to affirm on the alternate ground that the Engineers lack standing as a \u201cthird-party beneficiary\u201d to initiate this action. As already explained, however, the Engineers allege that their international chapter intended to enter the Memorandum on their behalf, conferring rights (as well as obligations) on the Engineers. Because any \u201cprincipal can enforce a contract made by the agent,\u201d 12 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 35:46, the Engineers may bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">We REVERSE and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
