They assert that the county defendants are selectively enforcing the ordinance against them. They have not, however, alleged that there are any similarly situated non-Hispanic homeowners who are violating the ordinance but are not being cited. They therefore cannot make out a selective enforcement claim against the county defendants. <em>See Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, </em>68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir.1995). California state law concerning the effect of deed restrictions is not relevant to any federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">Plaintiffs, also allege violations of \u00a7 1983 by individual members of the homeowners association but allege no facts to support a conspiracy or any other theory of state action on the part of the homeowner association defendants. <em>See Franklin v. Fox, </em>312 F.3d 423, 441 (9th Cir.2002) (requiring conspiracy or joint action with a state actor to hold liable a private individual under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-21\">Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the complaint as failing to adequately allege any federal claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
