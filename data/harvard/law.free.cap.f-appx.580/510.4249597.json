After a change-of-plea hearing, Magistrate Judge Celeste F. Bremer recommended that the plea agreement be accepted by the district court. At the start of the sentencing hearing, District Judge Robert W. Pratt stated: \u201cthe agreed-upon sentence seems to me way too much. What am I missing?\u201d The prosecutor and defense counsel then provided substantial background information that was not part of the Presentence Investigation Report. After considering this information and giving Ms. Reekers an opportunity to comment on counsel\u2019s explanation, the court accepted the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement as being in conformance with the acceptance standards in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.2 and the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed the agreed 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Reekers\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable, and has moved for leave to withdraw. Upon careful review, we conclude that counsel\u2019s argument is without merit. Ms. Reekers agreed to a specific sentence in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. Once the district court accepted that agreement, it became binding on both the government and Ms. Reekers, like all plea agreements, and also on the district court. <em>See United States v. Kling, </em>516 F.3d 702, 704 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
