On appeal, Melchor contends that the district court erred by applying sentencing enhancements for abuse of a position of trust, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.3 (2012), and for the number of victims, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(i).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We review sentences for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe first step in this review requires us to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... improperly calculating ... the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2008). When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>Id. </em>The burden is on the government to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a sentencing enhancement should be applied. <em>See United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 628-29 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Melchor contends that he did not occupy a position of trust and therefore the enhancement was incorrectly applied to him. Section 3B1.3 applies if \u201cthe defendant abused a position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the commission or concealment of the [underlying offense].\u201d <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 1. However, in addition to a defendant in a position of trust from the perspective of the victims, the enhancement also applies to \u201c[a] defendant who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain ... any means of identification.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 cmt. n. 2(B). We have concluded that the enhancement applies to an individual in a case similar to Melchor\u2019s. <em>See United States v. Abdelshafi, </em>592 F.3d 602, 610-12 (4th Cir.2010). Therefore, because Mel-chor abused his position to obtain the means of identification that made his fraud possible, the district court did not err in applying this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Lastly, Melchor argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for the number of victims because only victims who suffered a financial loss may be counted for purposes of the Guidelines. Section 2B1.1 provides that \u201c[i]f the offense involved 10 or more victims ... increase by 2 levels.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(i). The application notes state that, \u201cin a case involving means of identification[,] \u2018victim\u2019 means ... any individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2) cmt. n. 4(E). Application Note 4(E) specifically states that this definition of victim exists independently from the general definition of victim in Application Note 1, <em>id., </em>which requires \u201cactual loss\u201d or \u201cbodily injury.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. Therefore, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>court did not err by considering the individuals whose identifying information was stolen by Melchor to be victims for purposes of the Guidelines, making the enhancement appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\"> Melchor\u2019s challenges pertain only to the fifty-month term imposed on the conspiracy charge. The consecutive twenty-four month term imposed on the identity theft charge was the statutory mandatory term.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
