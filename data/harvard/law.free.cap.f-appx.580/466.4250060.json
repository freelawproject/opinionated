Chalo PONCE, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b492-8\">No. 12-6013.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b492-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b492-11\">Oct. 21, 2014.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b492-13\">BEFORE: SILER, SUTTON and STRANCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Chalo Ponce challenges one of his two convictions and sentences for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Because Ponce knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">In 2012, Chalo Ponce pled guilty to several drug-related offenses, including two counts of distributing cocaine. R. 97 \u00b6\u00b6 5(c), (e). Ponce also pled guilty to two counts of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime \u2014 one count for each cocaine offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5(d), (f); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(a). Ponce\u2019s plea agreement stated that \u201cthe defendant agrees not to file a direct appeal of the defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence except the defendant retains the right to appeal a sentence imposed above the sentencing guideline range or any applicable mandatory minimum sentence (whichever is greater) determined by the district court.\u201d R. 97 \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">Before accepting Ponce\u2019s plea, the district judge conducted a colloquy in which Ponce expressly agreed that he was waiving his right to appeal his convictions and sentences. R. 194 at 581-82. Ponce also agreed that his two counts of possessing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) subjected him to two consecutive mandatory minimum sentences totaling thirty years. R. 194 at 579-80; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(C)(i). At sentencing, the court imposed the minimum sentences for both counts. R. 195 at 596-97. Ponce now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-19\">On appeal, Ponce claims that he should not have been convicted and sentenced for one of the two \u00a7 924(c) counts because the two underlying cocaine offenses were part of the same conspiracy. Appellant Br. at 9. This challenge, however, is \u201ca direct appeal of the defendant\u2019s conviction [and] sentence,\u201d R. 97 \u00b6 14, which Ponce waived the right to file.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">Ponce argues we should disregard his waiver because he retained the right to appeal a sentence above \u201cany applicable mandatory minimum,\u201d <em>id., </em>and his sentence for <em>two </em>\u00a7 924(c) convictions exceeds the mandatory minimum for <em>one. </em>Appellant Reply Br. at 3. But to reach Ponce\u2019s conclusion, we would first need to hold that one of his two convictions was wrongly imposed \u2014 which is exactly what he promised the government not to ask us to do. R. 97 \u00b6 14. We therefore may not set his plea waiver aside. <em>See United States v. Toth, </em>668 F.3d 374, 379 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-21\">For these reasons, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
