He argues that the court abused its discretion in revoking supervised release and in imposing a 9-month prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-26\">We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in revoking supervised release based on its finding that Halter had violated his release conditions, given Halter\u2019s admissions and the testimony of his probation officer, which the court was entitled to credit. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>400 F.3d 591, 592 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (given defendant\u2019s admission of violation, there was no clear error in fact findings supporting revocation, and no abuse of discretion in decision to revoke); <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003) (court\u2019s credibility determinations at revocation hearing are virtually unreviewable on appeal). We also conclude that the within-Guidelines-range revocation sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Petreikis, </em>551 F.3d 822, 824 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-27\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-23\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
