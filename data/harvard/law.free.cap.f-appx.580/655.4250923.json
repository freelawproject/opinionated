Four years and as many appeals later, Mr. Springer moved to undo the judgment, arguing that the government\u2019s attorneys lacked any authority to litigate the case. The district court denied the motion. Mr. Springer then moved to disqualify the presiding judge but the court denied this motion too. Mr. Springer now asks us to overturn both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Taking the first one first, Mr. Springer argues that he is entitled to relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) because the government lawyers who won the judgment against him were not statutorily empowered to do so. We cannot agree. Department of Justice attorney James C. Strong had litigating authority properly passed down to him from the Attorney General. The Attorney General has delegated civil litigation authority for actions arising under internal revenue laws to the Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 510. In turn, the Assistant Attorney General has delegated that authority to the Chiefs of the Civil Trial Sections of the Tax Division. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.13(b); <em>Dep\u2019t of Justice Tax Div. Directives </em>110, 143. And the Chief of the Civil Trial Section for the Central Region, the Region covering Oklahoma, assigned Mr. Strong to litigate Mr. Springer\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Because the Attorney General properly delegated authority to Mr. Strong to pursue this case, we have no need to resolve Mr. Springer\u2019s separate but related challenge to Thomas Scott Woodward\u2019s authority as acting and interim U.S. Attorney. Mr. Strong at all times possessed authority to litigate on the government\u2019s behalf\u2014 authority not dependent on Mr. Woodward\u2019s appointment. <em>See United States v. Suescun, </em>237 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cAn appointment of a United States Attorney that is not made as provided by the Appointments Clause does not affect the Government\u2019s power to prosecute.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gantt, </em>194 F.3d 987, 998 (9th Cir.1999), <em>partially overruled on other grounds by United States v. W.R. Grace, </em>526 F.3d 499, 506 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Neither did the district judge abuse his discretion in denying Mr. Springer\u2019s disqualification motion. Mr. Springer argues that the judge acquired improper personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts through three pleadings and should have recused himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(1). But \u00a7 455(b)(1) requires recusal when the judge gains knowledge about the case from sources <em>outside </em>the litigation, not when he learns about the case from pleadings <em>in </em>the litigation. <em>See In re Grand Jury 95-1, 118 </em>F.3d 1433, 1438 (10th Cir.1997). Mr. Springer\u2019s further contention that the presiding judge was involved in the disputed appointment has no basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">We deny Mr. Springer\u2019s several remaining motions as without merit. By way of example, Mr. Springer seeks from this court a show-cause order requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>attorneys who signed the government\u2019s appellate brief to explain their authority to do so. But the government is entitled to a presumption that the lawyers it identifies as working for it are acting -within the powers granted them by law, and Mr. Springer has not rebutted that presumption when it comes to the lawyers appearing in this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517; <em>U.S. Postal Service v. Gregory, </em>534 U.S. 1, 10, 122 S.Ct. 431, 151 L.Ed.2d 323 (2001); <em>Ron Peterson Firearms, LLC v. Jones, </em>760 F.3d 1147, 1164-65 n. 16 (10th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Mr. Springer\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>is denied. He is reminded that he must pay the filing fee in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
