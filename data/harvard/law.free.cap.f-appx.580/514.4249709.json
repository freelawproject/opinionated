His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the reasonableness of CanoLima\u2019s sentence. Upon careful review, we dismiss this appeal pursuant to an enforceable appeal waiver in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (describing the circumstances under which the appellate court should enforce an appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 997, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-25\">As for counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we conclude that allowing counsel to withdraw at this time would not be consistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s 1994 Amendment to Part V of the Plan to Implement The Criminal Justice Act of 1964. We therefore deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as premature, without prejudice to counsel refiling the motion upon fulfilling the duties set forth in the Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-26\">Judge Colloton would grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See United States v. Eredia, </em>No. 13-3538, 578 Fed.Appx. 620, 621 2014 WL 4920905, at *1 (8th Cir. Oct. 2, 2014) (unpublished) (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-22\">. The Honorable D.P. Marshall Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
