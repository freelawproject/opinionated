On appeal, Millares-Vera challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court did not adequately explain its decision to impose his sentence to run consecutive to his undischarged federal sentence. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>We review the imposition of a consecutive sentence for abuse of discretion, and the resulting sentence must be reasonable. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2009). Moreover, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing its unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">When a sentence is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the district court may elect to run the terms concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (providing that when imposing a sentence on a defendant subject to an undischarged sentence, the sentence for the instant offense may run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior sentence). Terms imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders them to run concurrently. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Regardless of how the court determines to run the terms, it must make the decision in consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b). We have recognized that \u00a7 3584 and \u00a7 5G1.3 evince a preference for consecutive terms of imprisonment when the sentences are imposed at different times. <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court should articulate enough to demonstrate that it \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court is generally not required to explicitly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 its consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments at sentencing and statement that it took the factors into account is sufficient. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 936 (11th Cir.2009). Furthermore, we may look at context and the record to determine the district court\u2019s reasoning in imposing a sentence. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 359, 127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in rendering its decision to impose Millares-Vera\u2019s sentence to run consecutive to his undischarged federal sentence, as it indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the presentence investigation report in making its decision. <em>See Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d at 936. Although the district court did not explicitly cite Millares-Vera\u2019s history of fleeing with charges pending against him and committing similar offenses upon fleeing, the record makes clear that this was a significant factor in its decision, as the government cited this factor alone in its argument in favor of a consecutive sentence, and the court repeatedly expressed its concern about this factor throughout the sentencing hearing. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 359, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. Because these considerations are relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need to promote respect for the law, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, the district court satisfied \u00a7 3584(b)\u2019s requirement that it consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding whether to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
