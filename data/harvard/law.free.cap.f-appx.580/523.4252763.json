We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">1. The BIA affirmed an adverse credibility determination by the immigration judge (IJ) because Chen\u2019s account at the hearing of the persecution he allegedly suffered in China differed materially from his written asylum application. Chen did not mention in his asylum application that he was part of a group that assaulted Chinese security officers as they sought to arrest the preacher of the underground church he attended; that he was home when security officers subsequently came to arrest him but escaped by jumping out of a window; or that his father was arrested and detained for two months. Although those events allegedly took place only four months before Chen submitted his asylum application, he did not disclose them until four years later near the end of his hearing before the IJ. When asked to explain the omission of his father\u2019s detention, Chen claimed that he \u201cforgot to write it.\u201d A letter submitted by Chen from his wife also contained no reference to an altercation with Chinese officials at the underground church or to his father\u2019s detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">\u201cTo support an adverse credibility determination, the BIA must have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any' stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Inconsistent testimony and contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>dictions between an applicant\u2019s testimony and other evidence may support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See, e.g., Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004). Because Chen filed his asylum application before the effective date of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, inconsistencies in testimony used to support an adverse credibility determination must go to the heart of his claims. <em>Desta, </em>365 F.3d at 745. '</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The inconsistencies in Chen\u2019s statements and his failure to submit corroborative evidence that would explain them went to the heart of his claim of persecution, because they concerned \u201cdramatic, pivotal event[s]\u201d that \u201cprecipitated his flight\u201d from China and formed the basis of his claim of persecution. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003). These inconsistencies provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">2: Even assuming the credibility of Chen\u2019s testimony, the BIA concluded that Chen did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. Persecution requires the infliction of severe physical or mental suffering on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-62 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). Chen did not claim that Chinese officials harmed, arrested, or threatened him at -the time of the incident. Rather, he testified that he was part of a group that shoved two unarmed Chinese security officers to the floor during an argument as they sought to arrest a preacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Although Chen testified that the authorities' thereafter went to his home looking for him and detained his father for two months, the BIA concluded that he had not demonstrated these actions were motivated by his religious beliefs. <em>See Chanco v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 298, 301 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cPersons avoiding lawful prosecution for common crimes are not ordinarily deemed refugees.\u201d). That conclusion was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Chen\u2019s family, which is similarly situated to him, continues to practice Christianity and to attend the same underground church without government interference, as it did for years before he was involved in the assault of the security officers. <em>See Zhao v. Mukasey, </em>540 F.3d 1027, 1031 (9th Cir.2008) (noting that the well-being of similarly-situated persons who remain behind is relevant to whether an alien credibly fears persecution on account of a protected ground). Moreover, Chen testified that the last time the authorities inquired about him was in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">3. Because Chen failed to meet the standard for asylum, he necessarily cannot satisfy the more stringent clear probability of persecution standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">4. The use of a Mandarin interpreter did not violate Chen\u2019s due process rights. Chen \u2014 who was represented by counsel \u2014 did not object to the use of a Mandarin interpreter, swore in his asylum application that Mandarin was his best language, and affirmed his understanding of Mandarin at the hearing. When Chen stated during the hearing that he could only answer the IJ\u2019s question in the Foo Ching dialect, the IJ rephrased the question and Chen answered. Neither the IJ nor the BIA relied upon Chen\u2019s response to that question in finding that Chen was not credible or that he had not suffered persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>F.3d 773, 780 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that a petitioner\u2019s due process rights are violated only if the mistaken translation affected the outcome of the proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
