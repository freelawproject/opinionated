The district court dismissed his complaint against BNYM, the holder of the security deed, for failure to state a claim, and it dismissed his complaint against Rubin Lublin for insufficient service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">On appeal, Fitzpatrick challenges the dismissal in several respects. As to his complaint against BNYM, he argues, first, that the district court erred in dismissing his claim under DIDMCA and NHA because he properly alleged that his loan was a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan,\u201d and thus, he sufficiently invoked those laws. Second, he asserts that the foreclosure was a debt-collection proceeding within the meaning of the FDCPA because one of the foreclosure notices that BNYM sent identified Rubin Lublin as the debt collector on its behalf. Third, he contends that the court erred in addressing his wrongful-foreclosure claim under Georgia law because federal law applied, but he does not otherwise address his state wrongful-foreclosure claim. Fourth, he asserts that the court improperly concluded that trespass required physical entry onto property. Lastly, he argues that his request for waiver of service showed that he substantially complied with the requirements for service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">The appellees respond, in part, that Fitzpatrick abandoned his FDCPA claim by failing to address the bases underlying the court\u2019s dismissal of the claims. We will first address dismissal of the complaint against BNYM by grouping the federal claims together and the state claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>together, and will then address the dismissal of the complaint against Rubin Lub-lin.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, taking the factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cDismissal for failure to state a claim is proper if the factual allegations are not enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, \u201c[a] complaint may be dismissed if the facts as pled do not state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Mohamad v. Palestinian Auth., </em>-U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1702, 182 L.Ed.2d 720 (2012). Moreover, we are not required to accept bare labels and legal conclusions in a complaint as true. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The pleadings of pro se litigants are entitled to a liberal construction. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Further, we liberally construe pro se briefs on appeal, but where a pro se appellant fails to raise a legal claim on appeal, he abandons that claim and we will not review it. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">\n<em>A. Federal Claims: DIDMCA/NHA, FDCPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">The term \u201cfederally related mortgage loan,\u201d refers to any loan that is: (i) a refinance loan, (ii) insured or made by any agency of the Federal Government, (iii) intended to be sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; or (iv) made by a creditor who makes or invests in residential real estate loans aggregating more than $1,000,000 per year. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602. Federally related mortgages are subject to provisions and protections of various federal housing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">Here, the district court properly concluded that Fitzpatrick failed to state a claim under federal law. Fitzpatrick did not adequately allege a basis for invoking DIDMCA or NHA because his complaint in this respect merely asserted that his loan was a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan,\u201d but did not further allege how the loan met the definition under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602. The district court was not required to accept that conclusory label as true. <em>Ashcroft, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. Thus, we affirm on the dismissal of Fitzpatrick\u2019s DIDMCA/NHA and FDCPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">Fitzpatrick\u2019s FDCPA claim also fails. An action under the FDCPA must be brought \u201cwithin one year from the date on which the violation occurs.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). On appeal, Fitzpatrick fails to offer any argument as to the district court\u2019s conclusion that his FDCPA claim was time-barred, the sole basis for dismissal. Therefore, he has abandoned the claim. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of his federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">\n<em>B. State-law Claims: Wrongful Foreclosure and Trespass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">To state a claim for wrongful foreclosure under Georgia law, a plaintiff must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that the foreclosing party breached a legal duty that it owed to the plaintiff. <em>DeGolyer v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, </em>291 Ga.App. 444, 662 S.E.2d 141, 147 (2008). In Georgia, a foreclosing party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>need only send a debtor one notice, at least 80 days in advance of a foreclosure sale, of the initiation of foreclosure proceedings. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-162.2. The notice must contain the name and contact information of the \u201cindividual or entity [with] full authority to negotiate, amend, and modify all terms of the mortgage with the debtor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">To state a claim for trespass in Georgia, a plaintiff must allege facts showing an <em>unlawful </em>interference with his right to enjoy his private property. <em>See Pope v. Pulte Home Corp., </em>246 Ga.App. 120, 539 S.E.2d 842, 843 (2000). Further, a party seeking to exercise a power of sale in a security deed in Georgia is <em>not </em>required to hold the promissory note as proof of the debt in addition to the security deed. <em>You v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, </em>293 Ga. 67, 743 S.E.2d 428, 433-34 (2013) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The district court properly dismissed Fitzpatrick\u2019s state-law claims. The district court properly concluded that Fitzpatrick failed to state a claim for wrongful foreclosure under \u00a7 44-14-162.2 because none of the deficiencies he identified with respect to the October 17 Notice \u2014 the failure to identify the Loan Reference Number, the secured creditor, the servicer of the loan, or the holder of the promissory note and security deed \u2014 are required under the statute. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-162.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Next, the district court properly dismissed Fitzpatrick\u2019s trespass claim because he failed to allege any fact showing that BNYM\u2019s interference with the property was unlawful. Specifically, none of the notice deficiencies he identified render a foreclosure invalid, and his assertion that BNYM needed the promissory note in addition to the security deed to initiate the foreclosure proceedings fails under <em>You. See You, </em>743 S.E.2d at 433-34. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Fitzpatrick\u2019s state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5) by applying a de novo standard to the law and a clear error standard to any findings of fact.\u201d <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 829 (internal quotation marks omitted). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of a plaintiffs complaint for failure to timely serve a summons and complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). <em>Lepone-Dempsey v. Carroll Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>476 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">The plaintiff to an action is responsible for having the summons and complaint served on the defendant within 120 days after filing the complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m); Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(1). A plaintiff may serve process on a limited liability company (LLC), like Rubin Lublin, by delivering the summons and complaint to an officer, managing or general agent, or other agent who is authorized to receive service of process, or by following state law for service of process. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Under the federal method of effecting service, service by mail upon an LLC may be accomplished where the plaintiff sends a valid request for waiver of service, and the defendant executes an acknowledgment of service indicating its waiver of personal service of process. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (providing that waiver request must, <em>inter alia, </em>be mailed to agent authorized to receive service of process, and include two copies of the waiver form). Similarly, absent substituted service, Georgia law requires personal service upon a defendant corporation unless the defendant executes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>a waiver of personal service. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9 \u2014 11\u20144(d) (S); <em>KMM Indus., Inc. v. Prof'l Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>164 Ga.App. 475, 297 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1982) (\u201cThere is no provision in Georgia law which authorizes a party to serve a defendant corporation directly by certified or registered <em>mail....\u201d). </em>A defendant is not required to waive formal service if requested, and \u201cif the defendant fails to respond to service by mail, the plaintiff must effect personal service pursuant to Rule 4(e).\u201d <em>Lepone-Dempsey, </em>476 F.3d at 1281; <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">A plaintiff must make proof of service to the court by submitting the server\u2019s affidavit. Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>4(1 </em>)(1). \u201cIf a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court \u2014 on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff\u2014 must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). If the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, however, \u201cthe court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Where a defendant challenges service of process, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing its validity. <em>Aetna Bus. Credit, Inc. v. Universal Decor &amp; Interior Design, Inc., </em>635 F.2d 434, 435 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA defendant\u2019s actual notice is not sufficient to cure defectively executed service.\u201d <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Here, the district court properly dismissed Fitzpatrick\u2019s complaint against Rubin Lublin for insufficient service of process. Fitzpatrick filed his original complaint on April 5, 2013, and never provided proof of timely service to the district or made any effort to show good cause for the delay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). His request for waiver of service was insufficient because it failed to comply with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P.4(d) \u2014 the waiver was addressed to the firm itself, rather than an authorized agent, and it provided only one copy of the waiver form. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d). More importantly, however, Fitzpatrick did not provide the district court any proof that Rubin Lublin agreed to waive service of process. On the contrary, Rubin Lublin expressly stated that it had not done so, which was within its discretion. <em>Lepone-Dempsey, </em>476 F.3d at 1281. Because Rubin Lublin did not respond to service by mail, Fitzpatrick was required to effect personal service. <em>Id. </em>A review of the district court\u2019s records shows that he did not do so, however, either by the time the magistrate judge issued a disposition report, or by the time the district court entered a final judgment in the case, both of which fell beyond the 120-day period. Moreover, he could not rely on actual notice, alone, to establish valid proof of service or waiver. <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 827, 829. Accordingly, Fitzpatrick failed to show that he perfected service of process upon Rubin Lublin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">. We adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-13\">. To the extent Fitzpatrick asserts that the court erred in ignoring his responses in opposition to the dismissal motions because they were timely, his assertion is meritless because he filed each response several weeks after service. LR 7.IB, NDGa. (providing that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>party opposing a motion must serve his response within 14 days after service of the motion); <em>Clark v. Housing Auth. of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir.1992) (\"[W]e give great deference to a district court's interpretation of its local rules\u201d).
