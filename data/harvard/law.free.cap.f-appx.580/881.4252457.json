The district court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Because we determine Morales lacks the standing necessary for us to adjudicate this claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We review the prior prosecutions before turning to Morales\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">A. The 1996 Murders</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">On February 24, 1996, the Cuban Air Force shot down two civilian planes in international airspace. Four men, all members of the Miami-based Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue (\u201cBTTR\u201d), were killed in the incident. The murders drew substantial media attention and widespread condemnation of the Cuban government. The shoot-down also resulted in civil litigation and criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">In 1997, the estates of three of the victims, all United States citizens, prevailed in a civil suit against the Republic of Cuba and the Cuban Air Force. <em>Alejandre v. Republic of Cuba, </em>996 F.Supp. 1239 (S.D.Fla.1997). The cause of action was based on provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 589, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605), which allows money damages against foreign states for the personal injury or death of American citizens, subject to additional restrictions. The estates were awarded a judgment of over $187 million dollars. <em>Alejandre, </em>996 F.Supp. at 1253. The order accompanying the final judgment quoted at length from the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996. <em>Id. </em>at 1247. That act of Congress, responding explicitly to the shoot-down, stated that \u201c[t]he [actions] chosen by Fidel Castro ... [were] a blatant and barbaric violation of international law and tantamount to coldblooded murder.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6046. Moreover, it called on President Clinton \u201cto seek, in the International Court of Justice, indictment for this act of terrorism by Fidel Castro.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">Criminal prosecutions followed, beginning in 1998. A federal grand jury indicted five Cuban agents for their involvement in the incident. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>419 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2005), <em>rev\u2019d en banc, </em>459 F.3d 1121 (11th Cir. 2006). One was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to murder the four BTTR members. <em>Id. </em>Other defendants were charged with and convicted of a range of offenses, including espionage. <em>Id. </em>This Court, sitting en banc, affirmed those convictions of the Cuban agents. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1126 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc) (rejecting venue objections); <em>see also United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 987 (11th Cir.2008) (subsequent panel opinion affirming all defendants\u2019 convictions over other objections and remanding for resentencing as to three defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">These were not the only criminal prosecutions. In 2003, a federal grand jury indicted three additional defendants \u2014 the head of the Cuban Air Force and the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>fighter pilots who actually shot down the .aircraft \u2014 with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. These defendants remain fugitives.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">B. The Presentation of Evidence to a Grand Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">That factual background brings us to the substance of this appeal. Petitioner Nelson Morales, the brother of Pablo Morales, a victim of the 1996 BTTR incident, seeks to compel the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida (or, in the alternative, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida) to present evidence to a grand jury implicating Fidel Castro and Raul Castro in the murders of the BTTR men.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Specifically, Morales wants the grand jury to be made aware that Fidel and Raul Castro \u201cclaimed responsibility over 17 years ago for ordering the murders of the four BTTR men.\u201d The evidence Morales seeks to have presented includes: (1) a Time Magazine interview from March 11, 1996, in which Fidel Castro stated that he \u201ctake[s] responsibility for what took place\u201d; (2) Fidel Castro\u2019s statement, in the same interview, that Raul Castro participated in the decision to attack the BTTR planes; (3) Raul Castro\u2019s recollection, in an interview with Cuban journalists on June 21, 1996, of a military meeting prior to the incident in which he agreed that it may be necessary to \u201cshoot [the BTTR men] down in the ocean when they appear\u201d; and (4) a September 3, 1996 interview of Fidel Castro by Dan Rather in which Castro acknowledged that instructions were given to the Cuban pilots, who \u201chad the authority\u201d to shoot down the planes. In that interview, Fidel Castro repeated his earlier statement, saying: \u201cI take responsibility for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Because Fidel and Raul Castro have never been indicted for the murders of the BTTR men, Morales seeks to compel the presentation of the above-described evidence as well as \u201cany evidence in [the U.S. Attorney\u2019s] possession, or previously submitted to any grand jury, which implicate the Castro brothers in the deaths of the BTTR men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">C. The Claim Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3332(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">Morales\u2019s mandamus action is based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3332(a). Morales argues that \u00a7 3332(a) guarantees that any person, such as Morales, can require the U.S. Attorney to present evidence of a federal crime to a special grand jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u00a7 3332(a) statute provides that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of each such grand jury impaneled within any judicial district to inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of the United States alleged to have been committed within that district.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3332(a). Next, the statute says that \u201c[s]uch alleged offenses may be brought to the attention of the grand jury by the court or by any attorney appearing on behalf of the United States for the presentation of evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">The next sentence in the \u00a7 3332(a) statute is the basis of Morales\u2019s claim. It says that \u201c[a]ny such attorney receiving information concerning such an alleged offense <em>from any other person shall, if requested by such other person, </em>inform the grand jury of such alleged offense, the identity of such other person, and such attorney\u2019s action or recommendation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). From this language, Morales asserts that \u00a7 3332(a) gives him a statutory right to require the U.S. Attorney to pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ent information \u201cconcerning [ ] an alleged offense\u201d received from any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">D. The Petition for a Writ of Mandamus and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On July 2, 2013, Morales filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming both the U.S. Attorney and the district court as respondents. Morales\u2019s mandamus petition alleges attorney Kendall Coffey made a request on April 14, 2010, that the U.S. Attorney present the above evidence to a special grand jury. The petition itself nowhere alleges that Morales ever made a request personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">On September 13, 2013, the U.S. Attorney filed a motion to dismiss. (Doc.13) The U.S. Attorney argued that the petition should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Morales did not have standing to request the relief sought and because his claim was constitutionally unripe. The U.S. Attorney also argued that, as a matter of law, Morales\u2019s mandamus petition failed to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">On October 22, 2013, Morales responded to the motion to dismiss. The response argued principally that \u00a7 3332(a) confers a legal right that Morales merely seeks to enforce through this mandamus action. The response also attempted to introduce a new factual allegation. In a footnote, Morales stated that Coffey appeared at the 2010 meeting \u201cfor the Morales family (and others), including his mother.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After establishing, in his view, Coffey\u2019s \u201crepresentative status,\u201d Morales hedged, requesting leave to amend his petition if the petition as written was \u201cdeemed not to sufficiently identify Morales.\u201d He filed no separate motion for leave to amend in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">The district court determined it was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claim and, on December 27, 2013, granted the motion to dismiss. The district court found: (1) that Morales lacked standing to invoke the power of the courts; (2) that his claim was constitutionally unripe because of his failure to make a specific request of the U.S. Attorney; and (3) that his claim failed as a matter of law for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Morales timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether it has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Gupta v. McGahey, </em>709 F.3d 1062, 1064-65 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2840, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2014). \u201c[Standing is a threshold jurisdictional question which must be addressed prior to and independent of the merits of a party\u2019s claims, and we review the district court\u2019s conclusion on this question de novo.\u201d <em>Dillard v. Chilton Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>495 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>558 Fed.Appx. 898, 900 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder, </em>379 U.S. 104, 111 n. 8, 85 S.Ct. 234, 239 n. 8, 13 L.Ed.2d 152, (1964) (referring to mandamus as \u201cgenerally a matter of discretion\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Morales petitions for a writ of mandamus that would compel either the U.S. Attorney or the district court to perform a specific act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d). Mandamus is appropriate only where: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available. <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIt is hornbook law that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which should be utilized only in the clearest and most compelling of cases.\u201d <em>Carter v. Seamans, </em>411 F.2d 767, 773 (5th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Before we consider the merits of Morales\u2019s petition, we first must determine if Morales has standing to \u201cinvoke the power of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Steele v. Nat\u2019l Firearms Act Branch, </em>755 F.2d 1410, 1413 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cThis is the threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>see also Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 616, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 1148, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973) (\u201cBefore we can consider the merits of appellant\u2019s claim or the propriety of the relief requested, however, appellant must first demonstrate that [he] is entitled to invoke the judicial process.\u201d). \u201cOne element of the case-or-controversy requirement is that plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue.\u201d <em>Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 1146, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">To establish standing, Morales \u201cbears the burden to show (1) an injury in fact, meaning an injury that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the causal conduct, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>CAMP Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, </em>451 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA proper deference to the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers means that a court may only reach the merits of those cases that present concrete and immediate injury.\u201d <em>Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1210 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">For several reasons, Morales\u2019s mandamus petition fails to allege a concrete and particularized injury, and thus Morales lacks standing. First, Morales\u2019s petition does not allege denial of any personal request by him that information be presented to a grand jury regarding the Castro brothers involvement in the 1996 BTTR shoot-down. <em>See Zaleski v. Burns, </em>606 F.3d 51, 52 (2d Cir.2010) (stating that \u201cfailure to make such a request [of the U.S. Attorney] would be fatal to [petitioner\u2019s] claim of standing.\u201d). Second, even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>accept Morales\u2019s allegation that Coffey\u2019s 2010 meeting with and request to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office was on Morales\u2019s behalf, Morales\u2019s petition still fails to allege \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">To show an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d Morales argues (1) that \u00a7 3332(a) gives him an implied private right of action to compel the U.S. Attorney to present evidence, and (2) that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s failure to present such information on request violates Morales\u2019s legal rights. Because Morales has no such private right of action, he has no injury and thus no standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The problem for Morales is the text of \u00a7 3332(a) nowhere creates a private right of action, express or implied, against the U.S. Attorney or the district court. \u201c[Pjrivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress\u201d rather than by the federal courts. <em>Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 </em>U.S. 275, 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 1519, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). We look to whether the text of the statute itself clearly \u201cdisplay[s] congressional intent to create new rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 121 S.Ct. at 1521. And Congress must \u201cdisplay[ ] an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 121 S.Ct. at 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">There is no \u201crights-creating\u201d language in \u00a7 3332(a). <em>See id. </em>at 288, 121 S.Ct. at 1521. Even if the language in \u00a7 3332(a) arguably implies some potential duty on the part of the U.S. Attorney to present information to a special grand jury, that is not a duty owed to Morales individually. <em>See id. </em>at 289, 121 S.Ct. at 1521 (\u201cStatutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Even if Morales could show that \u00a7 3332(a) creates a private right of action in some party under some set of facts, that would not confer standing on Morales in this particular case. The Article III requirements of standing persist, and Morales has not sufficiently alleged a cognizable injury. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The U.S. Attorney\u2019s denial of a request to present information does not invade any \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cparticularized\u201d interest of Morales or affect Morales any differently than it affects everyone else. The injury prong of standing analysis is designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ensure that such generalized grievances remain non justiciable. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 112 S.Ct. at 2144. A statutory violation alone will not suffice to create standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">And although Morales has an interest in the prosecution of those responsible for his brother\u2019s death, a private citizen\u2019s interest in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s criminal prosecution of another person is not a judicially cognizable interest for standing purposes. <em>Linda R.S., </em>410 U.S. at 619, 93 S.Ct. at 1149 (concluding that \u201ca citizen lacks standing to contest ... the prosecuting authority[\u2019s policies] when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution\u201d and \u201ca private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Likewise, Morales\u2019s demand that the U.S. Attorney present certain information to a grand jury in furtherance of a potential prosecution of the Castro brothers is nothing more than a demand that the U.S. Attorney prosecute them, which is a generally available grievance assertable by any citizen and not a concrete and particularized injury to Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We need not proceed beyond the injury prong of the Article III standing requirements. Because Morales fails to allege a sufficiently concrete, particularized injury, he is without standing to bring this mandamus petition, and we lack subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim. Moreover, though we decline to separately address the issue of constitutional ripeness, we note that \u201c[t]he ripeness problem in this case is much the same as standing.\u201d <em>See Elend, </em>471 F.3d at 1210. The absence of concrete injury undercuts Morales\u2019s claim that a clear, sufficiently mature, and sufficiently adverse issue was before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Morales\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\">.

We acknowledge the U.S. Attorney\u2019s defense that the 2010 request should not be considered, as no special grand jury existed in the district at the time the request was made, as well as Morales\u2019s response that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s failure to call a special grand jury as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331 should bar the U.S. Attorney from asserting such a defense. As we determine Morales fails to establish standing regardless, we need not decide these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\">.
