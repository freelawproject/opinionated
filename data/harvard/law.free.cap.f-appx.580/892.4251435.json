Hurley was a County Commissioner in Sumter County, Georgia who was convicted by a jury on one count of attempted extortion and one count of federal program bribery. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">1. ' Did the district court err by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was acting under color of official right, that his conduct had a potential to affect interstate commerce, and that he in-fended to be influenced as a County Commissioner when he solicited and agreed to accept multiple bribe payments; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">2. Did the district court err when it denied Hurley\u2019s motion for new trial and rejected his claim that the evidence established at trial materially varied from the allegations contained in the Indictment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">After de novo review and consideration of the briefs and the record, and having the benefit of oral argument, we find no error in the proceedings in the district court, and we affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s May 29, 2013 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
