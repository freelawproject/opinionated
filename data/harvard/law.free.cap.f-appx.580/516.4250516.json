R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b542-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">Arlanders Gibson appeals a district court order that reduced his sentence for Conspiracy to Engage in a Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (the \u201cRICO violation\u201d) from 198 months\u2019 imprisonment to 158 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">Gibson pleaded guilty to the RICO violation in 2006. Gibson\u2019s plea agreement stipulated that, for the purposes of sentencing, Gibson\u2019s conduct involved 462 grams of crack cocaine, yielding a base offense level of 35 under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines then in force. The district court granted Gibson two levels of downward adjustment, to 33, and sentenced him to 198 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-23\">The following year, Guidelines Amendment 706 (\u201c706\u201d) adjusted the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses downward by two levels for each threshold amount of cocaine, and provided for sentence reductions based on the new offense levels. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), after the promulgation of 706, Gibson and the government submitted a Joint Stipulation for Discretionary Relief (the \u201cJoint Stipulation\u201d). The Joint Stipulation incorrectly stated that Gibson\u2019s previous total offense level was 35, though after the reductions granted by the district court at Gibson\u2019s sentencing hearing in 2006, Gibson\u2019s total offense level was 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-24\">In the Joint Stipulation, Gibson and the government jointly recommended that Gibson\u2019s sentence be reduced to 158 months\u2019 imprisonment. By the terms of the Joint Stipulation, Gibson \u201cwaives any right to appeal any aspect of the revised sentence, <em>provided that </em>if the revised sentence exceeds the recommended term of 158 months\u2019 imprisonment, defendant may appeal that aspect of the revised sentence.\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-25\">The district court reduced Gibson\u2019s sentence to 158 months. Gibson appeals, arguing that the district court clearly erred in finding that Gibson\u2019s previous total offense level was 35, as stated in the Joint Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-26\">Because Gibson waived appeal, we do not consider the merits of Gibson\u2019s claim. However, we note that Gibson recommended the 158-month sentence below. Therefore, to prevail on his claim, Gibson would need to show that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>committed error that was plain, that the error affected the substantial rights of the defendant, and that the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Gibson could not show plain error, because if the parties had correctly calculated the offense level at 31, the guidelines range would have been 135-168 months. Gibson\u2019s 158-month sentence falls within that range. Further, the district court has clarified that its reduced sentence of 158 months\u2019 imprisonment was based on its acceptance of the parties agreement and that the \u201cdiscretionary reduction in his sentence of forty months was considered by the court to be the maximum favorable relief which would be imposed by the court.\u201d Because Gibson was afforded relief under the statute to the extent sought by the parties and accepted by the district court, his substantial rights were not affected, nor does the error affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-36,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As to the waiver of appeal, the district court imposed a sentence that did not exceed 158 months\u2019 imprisonment, so the waiver encompasses the present appeal. Nothing in the record shows that Gibson\u2019s waiver was anything other than knowing and voluntary. We enforce Gibson\u2019s waiver of appeal and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b542-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
