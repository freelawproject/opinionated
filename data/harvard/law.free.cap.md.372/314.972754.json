The principle question raised in the certiorari petition is whether the trial court erred in creating a remedy after finding a <em>Batson </em>violation. Unfortunately, because the trial court failed to make the necessary findings as to purposeful discrimination required by <em>Batson, </em>we are unable to answer the question. We shall therefore remand the case to the trial court to enable the court to evaluate the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations and to determine whether petitioner carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">As a predicate to petitioner\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges in violation of the strictures of <em>Batson, </em>he maintains that a uniform policy of exercising a peremptory challenge to all jurors with relatives who have been convicted of a crime, without regard to the particular circumstances of the case, is inherently discriminatory and violates the rubrics of <em>Batson. </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Jerome Maurice Edmonds, petitioner, was indicted by the Grand Jury for Baltimore County for first-degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, attempted robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the shooting death of a Caucasian youth. The State served Edmonds with a notice of intent to seek the death penalty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The trial commenced on February 6, 2001, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Petitioner is African American. The trial court conducted voir dire of ninety-nine potential jurors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and included in the voir dire the following question: \u201cIs there any member of the jury panel or any member of your immediate family who has been the victim of a crime or, conversely, have you or any member of your immediate family been convicted of a crime?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">At the conclusion of the voir dire, forty-two prospective jurors remained, six of whom were African American. Five of the six African-American venirepersons responded to voir dire questions. Juror number 704 indicated that her brother had been murdered by a drug dealer in New York City and that she believed the killer had received leniency because the defendant\u2019s brother was a police officer. Ms. Ashe, juror number 614, reported that, twenty years ago, her sister had used an alias, and had been convicted of a drug violation. Ms. Ashe stated that she could be impartial. Juror number 56 discussed pressing work obligations. Ms. Smith, juror number 719, believed her nephew had been convicted of attempted murder but thought that he had been treated fairly and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>she could be impartial as a juror. Ms. Nelson, juror number 66, indicated that she thought she recognized the defendant as someone she knew but then realized she had been mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Defense counsel objected to the State\u2019s- use of peremptory challenges against five potential African-American jurors on the grounds that the strikes were racially discriminatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the prosecutor exercised his first two peremptory challenges against African-American women, juror number 56 and Nelson, the defense raised a <em>Batson </em>challenge. The prosecutor explained that he had earlier attempted to strike juror number 56 for cause because of her work obligations and that he challenged Nelson because she had misidentified the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The next African American, Ashe, was acceptable to both parties and was seated. The parties agreed to two more jurors, and, with twelve jurors seated, the court asked whether the jury was acceptable. The State excused a Caucasian woman, and selection continued. When next asked whether the jury was acceptable, defense counsel exercised additional strikes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor then raised a <em>Batson </em>challenge on the grounds that defense counsel had stricken three Caucasian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>prospective jurors. The court overruled the State\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge, and defense counsel pointed out that the prosecutor was not consistently striking jurors with prior criminal records or relatives with criminal records because the State seated Ashe. In response, the prosecutor indicated that he would challenge Ashe later because she wore a religious symbol on her ear and her sister had a criminal conviction. The prosecutor pointed out that previously he struck two Caucasian jurors whose relatives had criminal records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor reiterated that uniformly he would strike persons whose relatives had criminal records but that he was not doing so because of race.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He assured the court that the jury panel would include African Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The jury was acceptable to the State but not to the defense; defense counsel exercised additional strikes. The parties reviewed more jurors and exercised additional peremptory strikes; the State then struck juror number 704, Ashe and Smith. The jury was acceptable to the State, but defense counsel objected because it included only one African American. The defense argued to the trial court that the State\u2019s use of five strikes against African-American jurors, in a case with a black defendant and white victim, constituted a premeditated effort to remove African Americans from the jury. Significantly, the judge, in response, remarked that he did not \u201cbuy the State\u2019s position\u201d that it was going to strike jurors -with relatives convicted of crimes but who stated they could be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The trial court asked the prosecutor his reasons for striking five African American venirepersons. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Nelson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Yes. That was the mis-identification. She thought she knew the Defendant, good, bad or indifferent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes. Bad, indifferent or silly, that\u2019s your reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: No, my reason is she could have been any race, creed or color, religion, I\u2019m going to strike with a mis-identification. She thought she knew him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: First of all, so the record is clear, she did not misidentify anybody. She came up here on her own and said that initially she thought that maybe she knew Mr. Edmonds but when she got up here she realized that she didn\u2019t know him, and she was perfectly candid about it. So you may not characterize that as a mis-identification because it was not a misidentification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: .... What about Ashe, number 614?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AER\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Prior criminal record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: She didn\u2019t have. Her family did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnQ\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Family, criminal record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Twenty years ago, her sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATh\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Her sister was convicted, had a drug charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: She thought she had been treated fairly. What about Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: What number is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apj\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: For attempted murder. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: What\u2019s that got to do with the price of eggs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: Are you asking the reason why we struck her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: You say she could not sit because her nephew is in jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: ... When asked her to state her \u2014 I wrote a question mark next to her \u2014 she said she could but her demeanor told me otherwise. 1 think we have a right to strike her. If the question is what she says, we don\u2019t know whether she is, whether she is telling the truth. We don\u2019t know if there is a bias. Demeanor told me she wasn\u2019t even sure if she could be unbiased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I didn\u2019t notice that. Her demeanor didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Defense counsel then asked the court to seat Smith, but the court did not rule on that proposal. Shortly thereafter, defense counsel requested the court to reseat Nelson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I say that I think Juror Number 66, Ms. Nelson, who was friends with the County Police, and was the one that [the prosecutor] has mischaracterized as misidentifying would perhaps be the most appropriate to reseat. It was inconceivable to me that she was strickeny.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: .... We have given race neutral reasons for striking that person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: But I have to agree with you, you know, that part of the deal the Judge has to buy, and the race neutral\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: I understand that but more important\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayz\">\u201cTHE COURT: You mischaracterize why you did it, though, why you struck her. She did not mis-identify anybody, and that was the reason you gave. I\u2019m having trouble with it because it\u2019s \u2014 it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">The court reseated Nelson as a juror.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Before the jury was sworn, defense counsel objected to the jury as impaneled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cI asked for the specific replacement of Ms. Nelson believing that it was the most untenable of all the State\u2019s objections but not giving any credence, with no personal rancor toward [the prosecutor], not accepting the neutral, the racial neutrality offered by the State .... I believe that the State has inappropriately created a pattern of striking African Americans and that their allegations of neutrality are insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cOkay. And so they are who they are. With regard to the five of the eight that \u2014 I guess nine that the State took, I just refuse to accept the reason that the State gave for Nelson. I just specifically reject that reason as being race neutral on its face. That\u2019s why when the defense asked that I put her back on there, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The jury was composed of nine Caucasians, two African Americans, and one South Asian American.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The jury convicted Edmonds of felony murder, attempted armed robbery,. and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He was found not guilty of premeditated first-degree murder. The court sentenced Edmonds on the felony murder to life imprisonment, with all but forty-five years suspended, and on the handgun violation, to a term of incarceration of five years \"without parole, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Edmonds noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court, he raised the single issue of whether the trial judge erred in fashioning a remedy for the State\u2019s <em>Batson </em>violation whereby one of the improperly stricken jurors was reseated but others were not. The State argued that because the trial court explicitly rejected the State\u2019s rationale for excluding Nelson, it <em>implicitly </em>accepted the State\u2019s reasoning respecting the other venirepersons in question. In response to that argument, the intermediate appellate court reasoned: \u201cWe do not necessarily accept that contention; but considering the totality of the circumstances, the comments made by the trial judge, and the remedy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>was pursued, the trial judge was correct.\u201d In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that the trial judge did not err in fashioning a remedy for a <em>Batson </em>violation by reseating Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We granted Edmonds\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in remedying a <em>Batson </em>violation by reseating one improperly stricken juror. We hold that the trial court failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Batson. </em>We shall remand the case to the trial court to make a determination, under <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step three, of the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking Ashe and Smith and therefore whether petitioner carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Petitioner asserts three arguments. First, he argues that, as a matter of law, the prosecutor\u2019s policy of striking jurors whose relatives had been convicted of a crime, without regard to the particular circumstances of the case, is inherently discriminatory and violates the rubrics of <em>Batson. </em>Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the State\u2019s policy was race-neutral, petitioner argues that the trial court found that the reasons given for striking jurors Ashe and Smith were pretextual under <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step three. As such, the trial court\u2019s determination is entitled to deference and therefore is not clearly erroneous. Finally, petitioner argues that the error in the case lies in the remedy created by the trial court for the <em>Batson </em>violations. Because the trial court found three <em>Batson </em>violations, the reseating of only one juror inadequately remedied the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The State argues, in response, that Edmonds waived his objections to the striking of Ashe and Smith by requesting the trial court to reseat only juror Nelson. On the merits, the State does not dispute the trial court\u2019s finding as to Nelson but argues that the trial court implicitly found that Ashe and Smith were struck for race-neutral, non-pretextual reasons, that the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>trial court appropriately remedied any harm by seating Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We turn to the State\u2019s argument that petitioner waived his <em>Batson </em>argument. The State contends that because petitioner asked for one remedy and received the relief he requested\u2014the reseating of Nelson\u2014he cannot now challenge the court\u2019s remedial actions. <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 545, 735 A.2d 1061, 1070 (1999)(holding there are no grounds to appeal when defendant receives the remedy he requested from the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We hold that petitioner did not waive appellate review of his <em>Batson </em>claims. Petitioner\u2019s comment that Nelson \u201cwould perhaps be the most appropriate to reseat\u201d did not constitute a waiver of his other objections. Petitioner objected repeatedly to the State\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude African-American venirepersons. Petitioner also asked the court to reseat Smith, but the court did not comply. Furthermore, petitioner excepted to the final composition of the jury and sufficiently pursued the <em>Batson </em>challenges. <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>237 Conn. 238, 676 A.2d 384, 386-87 (1996)(conclud-ing that a party timely raises a <em>Batson </em>objection if the claim is brought to the attention of the trial court before the jury is sworn). He did not waive his claims. <em>See Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 617-18, 667 A.2d 876, 881-82 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids the striking of a venireperson on the basis of race. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986); <em>Strauder v. West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 303, 310, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879). Peremptory challenges cannot be exercised to exclude members of a cognizable racial group from a jury. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69; <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 625, 667 A.2d 876, 885 (1995). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The underlying purpose of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny is to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, to protect the venireperson\u2019s right not to be excluded on an impermissible discriminatory basis, and to preserve public confidence in the judicial system. <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 404-10, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1367-70, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991); <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 85-88, 106 S.Ct. at 1716-18, 90 L.Ed.2d 69; <em>Jones v.

State, </em>340 Md. 30, 665 A.2d 223 (1995), we discussed <em>Batson </em>and the three-step process a court must follow in assessing a <em>Batson </em>claim. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cWhen a criminal defendant raises a <em>Batson </em>claim, the trial judge must follow a three-step process. The burden is initially upon the defendant to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination [step one]. If the requisite showing has been made, \u2018the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors [step two].\u2019 \u2018Finally, the trial court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination [step three].\u2019 <em>\u201c</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Whittlesey, </em>340 Md. at 46-47, 665 A.2d at 231 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Once the claimant establishes a prima facie showing of discrimination, step one, the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike to proffer a facially valid, race-neutral explanation, step two. <em>See Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 767-68, 115 S.Ct. at 1770-71, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. An explanation must be race-neutral, but it does not have to be persuasive or plausible. <em>Id., </em>514 U.S. at 767, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. Any reason offered will be deemed race-neutral unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834; <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. at 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. If the defending party offers a race-neutral reason, the challenging party must demonstrate that the offered explanation merely is a pretext for a discriminatory intent or purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The persuasiveness of the proffered justification becomes relevant at step three when the trial court evaluates whether the opponent of the strike has met his or her burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. A discriminatory purpose may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and relevant facts. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 363, 111 S.Ct. at 1868, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. Among the factors the court may consider to determine whether the proponent intended to discriminate are: the disparate impact of the prima facie discriminatory strikes on any one race; the racial make up of the jury; the persuasiveness of the explanations for the strikes; the demeanor of the attorney exercising the challenge; and the consistent application of any stated policy for peremptory challenges. <em>See id. </em>at 363-64, 111 S.Ct. at 1868-69, 114 L.Ed.2d 395; <em>Harley v. State, </em>341 Md. 395, 403-04, 671 A.2d 15, 19 (1996). \u201c[T]he decisive question will be whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>should be believed.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The ultimate burden of proving that a peremptory challenge was motivated by race always remains with the opponent of the challenge. <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834; <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 93, 106 S.Ct. at 1721, 90 L.Ed.2d 69; <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 626, 667 A.2d at 886. The trial judge\u2019s findings in evaluating a <em>Batson </em>challenge are essentially factual and accorded great deference on appeal. <em>Harley, </em>341 Md. at 402, 671 A.2d at 18 (citing <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 627, 667 A.2d at 886). Whether a reason is race-neutral rests in large part on a credibility assessment of the attorney exercising the peremptory challenge. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 364-65, 111 S.Ct. at 1868-69, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. The trial judge is in the best position to assess credibility and whether a challenger has met his burden. Accordingly, on appellate review, we \u201cwill not reverse a trial judge\u2019s determination as to the sufficiency of the reasons offered unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 627, 667 A.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A trial court has \u201cthe duty to determine if the [challenger of the peremptory strikes] has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98, 100, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d 69; <em>accord Parker, </em>365 Md. at 308, 778 A.2d at 1101 (quoting <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834). A trial court may not rule on a <em>Batson </em>motion without determining whether it credits the strike proponent\u2019s race-neutral explanation for each challenged strike. <em>See, e.g., Barnes v. Anderson, </em>202 F.3d 150, 156, 157 (2d Cir.1999). If a trial court determines that a reason given for a peremptory challenge is a pretext for purposeful discrimination and upholds a <em>Batson </em>motion, the court has \u201cthe discretion to fashion a remedy for a <em>Batson </em>violation that addresses and resolves the specific harm caused by that violation.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>343 Md. at 602-03, 683 A.2d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Turning to the merits of petitioner\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge, we note first that step one, whether petitioner has made a prima facie showing that the State\u2019s challenges were racially motivated, is not at issue in this case. The issue is moot because the State offered explanations for its peremptory challenges and the court ruled, in part, on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination. <em>See Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)(plurality opinion)(holding that once prosecutor makes race-neutral explanation for peremptory challenge and trial court rules on question of intentional discrimination, issue of prima facie case becomes moot); <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 628, 667 A.2d 876, 886 (1995)(same).</p>\n<p id=\"AbE\">We turn to step two under <em>Batson </em>to consider whether the State\u2019s reasons for striking jurors Ashe and Smith were inherently discriminatory as a matter of law. We hold that the prosecutor offered race-neutral explanations at step two for striking jurors Ashe and Smith; therefore, the trial court proceeded properly to step three of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">A neutral explanation has been defined as \u201can explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutral.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. at 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (plurality opinion). The question presented is the facial validity of the reasons offered by the State. Whether a reason is persuasive is not relevant at this stage of the inquiry. <em>See Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). The prosecutor\u2019s burden of production under step two is limited. The State had to produce a race-neutral reason, not a believable one. <em>Id. </em>at 768-69, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. A trial court meets its obligation under step two by requiring the proponent of the strike to offer a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Petitioner contends that the State\u2019s reason for exercising peremptory challenges against jurors Ashe and Smith is inherently discriminatory and therefore not facially valid and race-neutral. The prosecutor challenged jurors Ashe and Smith because they each had a relative who had been convicted of a crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On its face, this reason is race-neutral. Striking venirepersons who have been convicted of crimes or whose relatives have been convicted of crimes is not inherently discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Courts throughout the country have accepted as race-neutral reasons the fact that a venireperson\u2019s relative has been convicted of a crime. <em>See, e.g., Devoil-El v.

A criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>conviction or having a relative convicted of a crime is not a \u201ccharacteristic\u201d peculiar to any race. <em>See Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 769, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. Although striking jurors whose relatives have criminal records may produce a disparate impact on one racial group as opposed to another, disparate impact is not conclusive at step two of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry. <em>See Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 362, 111 S.Ct. at 1867, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (plurality opinion)(noting 'that principle of race neutrality not violated unless the government intended to cause the discriminatory impact).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>the petitioner argued that the prosecutor\u2019s basis for exercising peremptory challenges against two bilingual jurors was inherently discriminatory under <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step two. <em>Id. </em>at 359-60, 111 S.Ct. at 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. The Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s reason for striking the jurors \u2014 that the bilingual jurors might have difficulty accepting the translator\u2019s rendition of Spanish-language testimony\u2014 was race-neutral. <em>Id. </em>at 361, 111 S.Ct. at 1867, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. In doing so, the Court reasoned that even though the prosecutor\u2019s criterion might result in the disproportionate removal of Latino jurors, disproportionate impact on one racial group did not render the prosecutor\u2019s actions a <em>per se </em>equal protection violation. <em>Id., </em>at 361, 111 S.Ct. at 1867, 114 L.Ed.2d 395. Disparate impact should be weighed at step three when the court assesses whether the prosecutor acted with discriminatory intent, but disparate impact alone does not render a reason inherently discriminatory at step two. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 111 S.Ct. at 1868, 114 L.Ed.2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We find no merit in petitioner\u2019s argument that the timing of the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for his challenges somehow proves that his explanation was inherently discriminatory. Petitioner argues that the prosecutor\u2019s policy of striking people whose relatives had been convicted of a crime exhibits an inherently discriminatory intent because the prosecutor announced the policy after voir dire and during the jury selection process, when he was aware that the policy would have a greater impact on African-American venirepersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Unless challenged, a proponent of a peremptory challenge need not offer any explanation. <em>See Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 212-21, 85 S.Ct. 824, 831-36, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965)(discussing the history of peremptory strikes and strikes for cause). The prosecutor did not have to proffer <em>any </em>reason for the exercise of the peremptory challenges until petitioner\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. Moreover, no explanation was due until the judge ruled as to whether petitioner made a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination. In <em>Hernandez, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">\u201cAbsent intentional discrimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause, parties should be free to exercise their peremptory strikes for any reason, or no reason at all. The peremptory challenge is, \u2018as Blackstone says, an arbitrary and capricious right; and it must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full purpose.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">500 U.S. at 374, 111 S.Ct. at 1874, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)(quoting <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 378, 13 S.Ct. 136, 139, 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892)). The prosecutor\u2019s announcement of his criterion for exercising peremptories after voir dire was not inappropriate and does not suggest a discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Finally under step two, petitioner argues that a uniform policy that does not relate to the circumstances of the case or the qualifications of the particular juror is presumptively discriminatory in intent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Harley v. State, </em>341 Md. 395, 398, 671 A.2d 15, 16 (1996), the prosecutor told the court that she had a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of challenging jurors who were single and under thirty, a policy with no apparent connection to the circumstances of the case or the individual jurors. The prosecutor explained that she preferred to seat jurors over thirty years old and married because she believed that jurors with those characteristics were more stable and therefore more state-oriented. <em>See id. </em>at 402, 671 A.2d at 19. The trial court found the prosecutor\u2019s explanation race-neutral and non-pretextual. We affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>holding that we \u201ccannot conclude that the trial judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 671 A.2d at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Petitioner relies on <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>959 F.2d 820 (9th Cir.1992), to support his argument that uniform policies not tied to the particular circumstances of the case are inherently discriminatory. Bishop was indicted on narcotic trafficking charges. The prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to strike a black woman based primarily on her residence in a poor and high-crime community. He stated that she was \u201clikely to take the side of those who are having a tough time, aren\u2019t upper middle class, and probably believes that police in Compton in South Central L.A. pick on black people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that \u201cthe invocation of residence both reflected and conveyed deeply ingrained and pernicious stereotypes\u201d and, as such, was used as a surrogate for race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 825, 826. The court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s reason as inherently discriminatory. The court held that the exercise of the peremptory strike denied equal protection because it was based on racial stereotypes, not because'of any uniform policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s position, <em>Bishop </em>does not stand for the proposition that it is impermissible to exercise a peremptory challenge based on a uniform policy or general rule. Excluding a juror on the basis of a uniform policy is inherently discriminatory and impermissible if the reason proffered is a surrogate for race.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <em>Bishop </em>court, finding residence to be a surrogate for race, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201cThe difference between <em>Hernandez </em>[500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) ], <em>Mitchell </em>[877 F.2d 294 (4th Cir.1989) ] and <em>Briscoe </em>[896 F.2d 1476 (7th Cir.1990) ] on the one hand, and the present case on the other, is the difference between a reason \u2014 whether valid or not \u2014 and a racial stereotype. It is the difference between a criterion having a discriminatory racial impact, and one acting as a discriminatory racial proxy. It is, in short, the difference between what the Constitution permits, and what it does not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 826. A uniform policy may be facially race-neutral as long as it is not a mere proxy for race. Excusing a juror who has a relative with a criminal conviction is not a surrogate for race and thus is not an inherently discriminatory basis for a peremptory challenge. Concerns regarding the existence or application of a uniform policy for striking jurors may be relevant to a court\u2019s assessment of credibility under step three, but such considerations do not render an explanation <em>per se </em>invalid at step two.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We next address step three and petitioner\u2019s argument that because the trial court found the reasons for striking jurors Nelson, Ashe, and Smith to be pretextual under <em>Batson's </em>step three, the trial court failed to remedy the harm by reseating only juror Nelson. Petitioner argues that the proper remedy for the <em>Batson </em>violation is a new trial. The State contends that the trial court implicitly found no <em>Batson </em>violation as to jurors Ashe and Smith and that the court properly remedied the impermissible removal of Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We have perused the record thoroughly and cannot conclude that the trial judge properly fulfilled his obligations under <em>Batson. </em>The trial court made a determination only as to juror Nelson. The judge never made a determination, as he was required to do under step three, with respect to jurors Ashe and Smith.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The trial court explicitly discredited the State\u2019s explanation for striking Nelson. The judge rejected the \u201cmisidentification\u201d explanation and seated Nelson as a juror in the case. Because of the deference due this factual finding, we hold that the trial court was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">As to jurors Ashe and Smith, we cannot tell from this record whether the trial court believed the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. At one point during jury selection the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t buy the State\u2019s position that they\u2019re going to strike people who some distant cousin had been the victim of crime, when they came up here and told me that they had no problem being fair. I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d Later, he appeared to find the prosecutor\u2019s explanation plausible: \u201cIt\u2019s not that you couldn\u2019t consider other family [and their criminal records]. I don\u2019t have any problem with that. I can understand under some circumstances where that would be perfectly legitimate.\u201d Because of the judge\u2019s inconsistent comments, it is unclear whether the trial court found the prosecutor\u2019s explanation credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The record is unclear as to what, if anything, the trial judge may have ruled with respect to jurors Ashe and Smith. We cannot conclude that the judge implicitly found the prosecutor\u2019s strikes of those two challenged jurors to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>race-neutral. \u201cThe credibility of an attorney offering a race-neutral explanation is at the very heart of [the <em>Batson</em>] analysis.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Anderson, </em>202 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 1999). However difficult it may be, before ruling on a <em>Batson </em>motion, a trial court has an obligation under <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step three to evaluate the credibility of the race-neutral reasons offered by the lawyer and rule on purposeful discrimination for each challenged juror.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Galarza v. Keane, </em>252 F.3d 630, 639 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Jordan v. Lefevre, </em>206 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2000). Although some <em>Batson </em>steps are susceptible to resolution by an appellate court, see, for example, <em>State v. Donaghy, </em>171 Vt. 435, 769 A.2d 10, 12 (2000)(step one), <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 769, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (step two), on this record, we are not prepared to conduct the important factual analysis required under step three. <em>Batson\u2019s </em>final step is essentially a credibility assessment, and the parties are not before this Court to permit us to judge their credibility or to explore the validity of any arguments they may advance. We hold that the trial court failed to conduct a proper <em>Batson </em>analysis by not making a final determination regarding the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations and therefore whether petitioner established purposeful discrimination in the strikes of jurors Ashe and Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We turn next to the remedy. A trial court <em>Batson </em>error does not <em>ipso facto </em>entitle a party to a new trial. Under the circumstances presented in the instant case, remand to the trial court is the appropriate remedy. This Court has determined previously that unless it is impossible to reconstruct the circumstances surrounding the peremptory challenges, due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>perhaps to the passage of time or the unavailability of the trial judge, the proper remedy where the trial court does not satisfy <em>Batson\u2019s </em>requirements is a new <em>Batson </em>hearing in which the trial court must satisfy the three-step process mandated, by that case and its progeny. A limited remand was the procedure followed in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), <em>Mejia v. State, </em>328 Md. 522, 616 A.2d 356 (1992), <em>State v. Gorman, </em>324 Md. 124, 596 A.2d 629 (1991), and <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988). Although a limited remand may not always be practical, in this case neither the passage of time nor any other factor appears to limit the ability of the trial judge to conduct the <em>Batson </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In <em>Mejia, </em>the trial court failed to fulfill its obligations under <em>Batson. </em>The trial judge made no specific findings and did not explain his ruling against Mejia. On appeal, we found that Mejia had made a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. We noted that a new trial may be warranted if \u201cthere is no reasonable possibility that the circumstances surrounding the striking [of a juror] can be reconstructed fairly.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. at 541, 616 A.2d at 365. Writing for the Court, Judge Bell, now Chief Judge, stated that a limited remand to the trial court, following the procedure set out in <em>Stanley, </em>was the proper remedy under the circumstances. <em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. at 541, 616 A.2d at 365. In <em>Stanley, </em>following the course set out by other courts in the country, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cOne possibility, obviously, is to set aside Stanley\u2019s conviction by an arguably tainted jury, and to order a new trial. Quite understandably, that is the relief Stanley seeks. Another possibility is a limited remand under Rule [8-604], to permit the State to provide, if it can, racially neutral reasons for its use of peremptories. A Rule [8-604] remand may be appropriate \u2018to correct procedures subsidiary to the criminal trial, [but] it can never be utilized to rectify prejudicial errors committed during the trial itself.\u2019 Here, the peremptory strikes were exercised before the jury was sworn, and thus before the beginning of the trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>merits. Moreover, limited remand was the remedy applied in <em>Batson.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">313 Md. at 75-76, 542 A.2d at 1279 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">A limited remand ordinarily is the remedy applied by appellate courts throughout this country when a trial court fails to conduct a proper <em>Batson </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 100, 106 S.Ct. at 1725, 90 L.Ed.2d 69; <em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. at 540-41, 616 A.2d at 364-65; <em>Gorman, </em>324 Md. at 129-32, 596 A.2d at 631-33; <em>Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 75-77, 542 A.2d at 1279-80; <em>Galarza, </em>252 F.3d at 640-41; <em>Jordan, </em>206 F.3d at 202; <em>Barnes, </em>202 F.3d at 156-57; <em>Jones v.
