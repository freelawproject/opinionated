The statute in question, Maryland Code (1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article, \u00a7 3-8A-07 (Retention, termination, or waiver of [juvenile] jurisdiction),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> suggested interesting legal and policy questions concerning the contours bounding the juvenile justice and the adult criminal justice schemes in Maryland. Unfortunately, although our decision in the instant case may cast some light on the application of the pertinent statute in limited circumstances, more questions remain than are answered here. The unexplored areas seem worthy of timely legislative clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Section 3-8A-07 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u00a7 3-8A-07. Retention, termination, or waiver of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">(a) Duration.\u2014If the court obtains jurisdiction over a child under this subtitle, that jurisdiction continues until that' person reaches 21 years of age unless terminated sooner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">(b) Offenses committed after age of 18.\u2014This section does not affect the jurisdiction of other courts over a person who commits an offense after the person reaches the age of 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">(c) <em>Termination.</em>\u2014Unless <em>otherwise ordered by the couH, </em>the court\u2019s jurisdiction is terminated over a person who has reached 18 when he is convicted of a crime ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> How this statute applies to the facts of the present case will be explained. We encourage the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ture to consider at its earliest opportunity how it should apply to other foreseeable scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Tyrone Moore,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant, first entered Maryland\u2019s juvenile justice system on 23 July 1998 when the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County filed a delinquency petition charging Moore, then fifteen years old,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with misconduct amounting to first degree rape and related delinquent acts alleged to have occurred on 20 March 1998. The District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County as a juvenile court at the time, found Moore to be a delinquent child and committed him to the Department of Juvenile Justice (\u201cDJJ\u201d) for placement at the Charles Hickey School.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The juvenile court placed Moore on probation on 14 September 1999. On 18 January 2001, the juvenile court committed Moore to the DJJ for placement at the Family Advocacy Service Program and ordered his participation in the Electronic Home Monitoring Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Moore\u2019s eighteenth birthday occurred on 12 March 2001. The DJJ petitioned the juvenile court on 19 July 2001 to revoke Moore\u2019s probation alleging that \u201cTyrone went AWOL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>from the Family Advocacy Program on July 17, 2001, and has not been seen since.\u201d At an emergency hearing on 17 August 2001, the juvenile court issued a juvenile warrant for a writ of attachment of Moore. The court received from the DJJ another petition for revocation of probation on 19 September 2001 reiterating the allegations made in the earlier petition and adding that \u201cTyrone has not contacted his Juvenile counselor since July 20, 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The writ of attachment was served on Appellant on 17 September 2001. As a result of his misconduct during the execution of the juvenile court\u2019s writ, Moore was charged as an adult in the District Court with resisting arrest. He pled guilty to the charge on 2 November 2001, and was sentenced to eighteen months incarceration and a $500.00 fine, both suspended,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and placed on supervised probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The juvenile court then held an emergency hearing on 5 November 2001 regarding the status of Moore\u2019s probation in the juvenile case. At that hearing, Moore\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the petition for revocation of probation, arguing that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction had been terminated on 2 November 2001 by operation of law as a result of Moore\u2019s conviction, as an adult, for resisting arrest. The court denied the motion to dismiss<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and ordered that Moore be detained at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the Alfred D. Noyes Children\u2019s Center pending a violation of probation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Moore filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on the basis that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction had been terminated by Moore\u2019s conviction as an adult. The petition was denied without a hearing on 19 November 2001, and Moore took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on 26 November 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">On 20 December 2001, a violation of probation hearing was held in the juvenile court where, once again, Moore\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the petition for revocation of probation on the basis that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction had terminated. The juvenile court judge denied the motion to dismiss, found that Moore was in violation of his probation, and ordered that his detention at the Noyes Center be continued pending his return to the Hickey School.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Moore filed with the Court of Special Appeals a notice of appeal on 26 December 2001 from the juvenile court\u2019s order of 20 December 2001. Subsequently, on 28 December 2001, Moore also filed an application for leave to appeal from that order. The Court of Special Appeals consolidated the appeal and application for leave to appeal as a single application for leave to appeal. The newly consolidated application for leave to appeal was granted and the case was transferred to the court\u2019s regular docket. We granted certiorari on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Appellant contended in his brief that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction terminated by operation of law, under \u00a7 3-8A-07, when Appellant, who had attained previously his eighteenth birthday, was convicted in the District Court of the crime of resisting arrest. Appellant maintained that the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the statute clearly states that when two conditions are satisfied\u2014(1) the person turns eighteen, and (2) the person, after turning eighteen, is convicted of a crime\u2014the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction is terminated by operation of law \u201cunless otherwise ordered\u201d by the juvenile court. Any actions taken by that court subsequent to the 2 November 2001 conviction, he claimed, were extra-judicial acts exceeding the juvenile court\u2019s authority. Accordingly, the court did not have jurisdiction to revoke Appellant\u2019s probation or re-commit him to the DJJ for placement in the Hickey School.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">At oral argument, Appellant urged that the language of subsection (c) of the statute, providing the \u201c[ujnless otherwise ordered by the [juvenile] court\u201d exception, could be satisfied only by an order entered <em>prior </em>to the criminal conviction. This must be so, he continued, because once juvenile jurisdiction is terminated by the entry of a criminal conviction it can not be restored by an order of the divested juvenile court. Moreover, such an order, he stated, must contain an express determination by the juvenile court of its intent to continue its jurisdiction notwithstanding the possibility of conviction of the adult criminal charge. Appellant also contended that, even if the juvenile court does not know of the criminal proceeding, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction nonetheless automatically terminates upon entry of the conviction. Thus, despite the absence from the statute of a mechanism for providing notice to the juvenile court of a pending criminal charge prior to conviction, the juvenile court must issue the saving order prior to conviction. To permit otherwise, Appellant argued, would render subsection (c) meaningless. Appellant suggested various ways and means that a juvenile court could be made aware in timely fashion of a pending adult charge in order that discretion could be exercised intelligently under the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the present case, Appellant asserts that the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, which was responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ble for prosecuting Appellant for resisting arrest, had the opportunity, which it failed to take, to contact the DJJ to determine its wishes and, if appropriate, seek a collateral and timely order from the juvenile court asking it to retain jurisdiction over Appellant before Appellant\u2019s plea was accepted and the criminal conviction entered. Appellant denies that the \u201cunless otherwise ordered\u201d. provision of \u00a7 3-8A-07(c) was satisfied by the juvenile warrant/writ of attachment issued by the juvenile court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> prior to Appellant\u2019s arrest on the criminal charge. Appellant minimizes the significance of the juvenile court\u2019s writ here, noting that, for purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act, \u201c[i]t is clear that jurisdiction and custody are separate and distinct.\u201d <em>In re Johanna F., </em>284 Md. 643, 651, 399 A.2d 245, 249 (1979). The language of the writ, contends Appellant, merely orders that Appellant be taken into custody and detained pending a hearing, and that the writ be lodged as a detainer for his continued detention if he is detained or committed for another offense. There was no indication in the language of the writ as to whether the juvenile court contemplated retaining jurisdiction in the event of a possible conviction on the particular criminal charge involved in this case. Appellant argues, therefore, that there is no \u201corder\u201d contained in the writ reserving jurisdiction as contemplated by \u00a7 3-8A-07(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The State (\u201cAppellees\u201d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> contends that the juvenile court retained its jurisdiction over Appellant by its 17 August 2001 writ and related actions. Appellees assert that the juvenile court was not divested of its jurisdiction over Appellant and, therefore, the Circuit Court in the habeas action and the juvenile court properly rejected Appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Appellees link the language of subsection (c) and the language of the 17 August 2001 writ to conclude that the juvenile court correctly held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">the juvenile warrant, the writ of attachment, is an order by the Court, intending to exercise the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, commanding that he be taken into custody for having been AWOL and at the same time there was an outstanding petition for violation of probation. I think that is otherwise ordering by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The writ, Appellees urge, was an order re-asserting the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Appellant within the meaning of \u00a7 3-8A-07(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Appellees seek to undermine Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 783 A.2d 673 (2001) and <em>In re Johanna F., </em>284 Md. 643, 399 A.2d 245 (1979). <em>Franklin P. </em>held that once the juvenile court divested itself of jurisdiction by granting a motion to waive the case to the adult criminal court, the juvenile court lacked the power to reconsider its action and divest the criminal court of jurisdiction. In contrast, Appellees maintain that in the present matter the juvenile court, by issuing the writ of attachment that led to Appellant\u2019s arrest and resultant criminal charge, clearly exercised and re-asserted its jurisdiction and indicated its intention to continue its jurisdiction over Appellant at least for purposes of the alleged probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Appellees also fault Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Johanna F., </em>which examined the juvenile court\u2019s custody upon the expiration of an order for the custody of the juvenile. This Court held there that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, obtained by the petition, adjudication, and determination of delinquency, remained unaffected by the lapse of a subsequent juvenile custody order. Section 3-8A-07(a) permits the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction to continue until the person reaches twenty-one years old, \u201cunless terminated sooner.\u201d In the present matter, Appellees argue, \u201cit is equally clear that the juvenile court properly concluded that its jurisdiction continued.\u201d The amalgam of the juvenile court\u2019s writ of attachment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>various emergency hearings amounted to the juvenile court \u201cotherwise ordering]\u201d that the criminal conviction did not terminate juvenile jurisdiction. Finally, Appellees urge that it was \u201cincumbent upon the juvenile court, pursuant to \u00a7 3-8A-02(b),\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to \u201cliberally construe\u201d the operation of \u00a7 3-8A-07 so as to effectuate the purposes of the juvenile causes subtitle, including the treatment and rehabilitative goals of juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In response to Appellant\u2019s amplified arguments at oral argument, Appellees advocated that the statute would be unworkable if interpreted to require the juvenile court to act without prior notice of the cximinal charge that might lead to a conviction. They pointed out that the statute identified no mechanism to ensure the juvenile court or the DJJ would be notified prior to a conviction. The juvenile court, as it did in the present matter, might hear of the cximinal conviction oxxly after the conviction had been entered and juvenile jurisdiction terminated. Furthermore, Appellees suggested that the statute\u2019s legislative history indicated that the Legislature intended that the conviction of a juvenile for a relatively minor offense, such as occurred hex-e, not interfere with the general rehabilitative program fashioned by the juvenile court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Recognition of the Legislature\u2019s intent, Appellees argued, requix'es this Court to find the language of the writ of attachment sufficient to preserve the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">This Coux-t repeatedly has noted the Legislature\u2019s intent that the system of juvenile justice in Maryland is guided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>generally by principles of protection and rehabilitation of the individual rather than a societal goal of punishment and retribution. <em>See In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 90-91, 646 A.2d 1012, 1014-15 (1994) (discussing the historical development of the juvenile justice system in Maryland); <em>In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 522, 255 A.2d 419, 422 (1969) (stating that the concept underlying juvenile proceedings is protection of the juvenile). We have recognized the legislative intent of the Juvenile Causes Act \u201cto rehabilitate and treat juvenile delinquents so that they become useful and productive members of society.\u201d <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 72, 763 A.2d 136, 148 (2000). Although a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d is defined as a child \u201cwho has committed a delinquent act and requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation,\u201d Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-8A-01(l), the keystone of Maryland\u2019s disposition of juvenile delinquents is that \u201cthe moral responsibility or blameworthiness of the child [is] of no consequence,\u201d such that delinquency adjudication is seen as the opportunity for the State to provide needed rehabilitative intervention. <em>Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 91-92, 646 A.2d at 1015. <em>See Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524, 528, 140 A.2d 914, 916 (1958) (asserting that the juvenile system does not contemplate punishing children found to be delinquent, but rather requires attempting to correct and rehabilitate such children). Even when this Court has extended \u201ccriminal defendant\u201d type rights to juveniles, the cases explain that the overall proceedings maintain their focus on the special goals of delinquency adjudication. <em>See In re Thomas J., </em>372 Md. 50, 70, 811 A.2d 310 (2002) (holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights require that the right to a speedy trial apply to juvenile proceedings); <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. at 69, 763 A.2d at 146 (stating that despite the civil nature of juvenile proceedings a juvenile does not relinquish all rights a person would be entitled to in a criminal proceeding). The purposes enumerated for subtitle 8A of the Code addressing juvenile causes for children other than children in need of assistance and adults include balancing the competing objectives of: \u201c(i) Public safety and the protection of the community; (ii) Accountability of the child to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the victim and the community for offenses committed; and (iii) Competency and character development to assist children in becoming responsible and productive members of society ....\u201d Md.Code (1978, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(1)(i)-(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The statute addressing jurisdiction in the juvenile court was written mindful of the special goals of the juvenile justice system. Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-8A-03 comprehensively provides the juvenile court with exclusive original jurisdiction over children \u201calleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision or who ha[ve] received a citation for a violation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Once jurisdiction over the juvenile is vested in the juvenile court, that jurisdiction may be waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>generally and only pursuant to the procedures outlined in Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-8A-06. Once the juvenile court obtains jurisdiction over a child pursuant to subtitle 8A, that jurisdiction, unless waived, continues until the child turns twenty-one years old or is terminated otherwise. Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-8A-07(a). One of the \u201cotherwise\u201d situations, provided in \u00a7 3-8A-07(c), occurs when a person eighteen years old or older is convicted of a crime in adult court, <em>\u201cunless otherwise ordered by the [juvenile] court.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApU\">This Court has recognized as a general principle of criminal law that jurisdiction, once obtained, continues despite the occurrence of subsequent events the happening of which before jurisdiction attached would have prevented jurisdiction from vesting originally. For example, in <em>Franklin v. State, </em>264 Md. 62, 285 A.2d 616 (1972), Franklin was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of robbery with a deadly weapon. The crime was committed when Franklin was sixteen years old.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court found that Franklin, as a juvenile, and pursuant to then extant Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Supp.), Article 26, \u00a7 70-16, could not be tried in adult criminal court unless the juvenile court so ordered following a waiver hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We noted that because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Legislature expressly restricted the right of the criminal court to try a juvenile, without waiver by the juvenile court, Franklin\u2019s criminal trial was mere form lacking substance. The conviction produced by that trial, therefore, was null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>In re Darren M., </em>358 Md. 104, 747 A.2d 612 (2000), was another case where a trial court facially exercising criminal jurisdiction exceeded its jurisdiction. Darren M. was charged originally in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City, with one count of rape in the first degree, assault in the second degree, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, use of a deadly weapon with intent to injure, and carrying a handgun. 358 Md. at 106, 747 A.2d at 612. Before trial, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the counts of first degree rape, first degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and carrying a handgun. 358 Md. at 106-07, 747 A.2d at 613. Trial commenced in the District Court on the remaining counts. After receiving testimony from the first witness, it became apparent to all concerned, supposedly for the first time, that Darren M. was only seventeen at the time the alleged crime occurred. <em>Id. </em>At that point the State <em>nol prossed </em>the remaining criminal charges and subsequently filed a delinquency petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, sitting as the juvenile court. The Circuit Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the District Court possessed exclusive jurisdiction given Darren M.\u2019s age at the time of the conduct complained of and the nature of the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The jurisdictional determination in <em>Darren M. </em>was based on age; therefore, the age of the person at the time he allegedly committed the charge controlled. Finding that the juvenile court had jurisdiction over Darren M., we stated that \u201cif the jurisdiction once attached to the person and subject matter of the litigation, the subsequent happening of events, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>they are of such a character as would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance, will not operate to oust the jurisdiction already attached.\u201d 358 Md. at 109, 747 A.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">At the heart of the present matter is whether the juvenile court\u2019s pre-existing and actively-exercised jurisdiction (but not custody) over Appellant continued despite his subsequent criminal conviction in the District Court, the occurrence of which the juvenile court was informed only after-the-fact by Appellant\u2019s counsel at the 5 November 2001 emergency hearing on the petition to revoke Appellant\u2019s probation in the juvenile case. According to the statute, jurisdiction to adjudicate the probation violation petition and take commensurate action would continue in the juvenile court if that court \u201cotherwise ordered,\u201d the conviction notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">When interpreting statutes, the \u201cparamount goal ... is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute at issue.\u201d <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). The legislative intent can be divined through an analysis of the plain language of the statute itself and from consideration of the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001). Where \u201cthe words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning,\u201d we \u201cwill give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994). Where the language is ambiguous, however, we look beyond the language of the statute to discern the legislative intent. <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 711, 782 A.2d at 346. It is then appropriate to look to the legislative history and other relevant evidence external to the statute that may manifest intent or general purpose, such as \u201ca bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments ... and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal.\u201d <em>Anthony R., </em>362 Md. at 58, 763 A.2d at 140. Construction of a statute, however, that is \u201cunreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (quoting <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On its face, \u00a7 3-8A-07 is ambiguous or unclear in a number of ways. It does not specify, for purposes of subsection (c), what constitutes an \u201corder,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> what form or content the order is to take, or when in the course of events the order must issue. More importantly, there is no mechanism to ensure notice is given to the juvenile court before the adult court convicts the individual. Lack of timely notice prior to the entry of a criminal conviction places the juvenile court in the position of attempting to assert its jurisdiction after the purported terminable act has occurred. That has its problems. According to Appellant, the burden would be on the juvenile court to assert or re-assert its jurisdiction at a time when it quite possibly does not know it needs to do so. In the absence of both clear and unambiguous statutory language and any illuminating legislative history regarding \u00a7 3-8A-07(c), the legislative intent as to the operational mechanics of the enactment is unclear. Although the general purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act are clear, it is less apparent how the operation of subsection (c) was intended to advance or trump those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Considering the two extremes of the statutory interpretations offered by the parties, we reject both as unreasonable and inconsistent with common sense in their application, although, as we shall explain, a mitigated version of Appellees\u2019 approach influences somewhat the result in this particular case. Appellant argues that whether the juvenile court receives notice of the pending criminal charge prior to conviction is immaterial. His view of the statute requires the juvenile court to enter an order retaining jurisdiction over the juvenile before the conviction is entered. Appellant\u2019s solution to the absence of a formal notice mechanism in the statute is that the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney should step into the breach and bear the responsibility of providing notice to the juvenile court because it is involved in both the juvenile proceeding and the criminal proceeding. In many State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s offices in Maryland, particularly in the more populous jurisdictions, however, juvenile proceedings are handled by a separate group of attorneys than are criminal prosecutions (which usually are further broken into District Court and Circuit Court divisions). Thus, we are leery of Appellant\u2019s facile assumption of the logistical ease with which his proposal could be implemented. For Appellant\u2019s conception of a rational application of the statute to work, there must be a more certain mechanism studied and put in place than has been suggested here in order to allow the juvenile court to give timely consideration to whether to retain jurisdiction prior to the criminal conviction of the juvenile. If, as Appellant urges, the juvenile court is bound to meet the \u201corder\u201d requirement of subsection (c) to preserve its jurisdiction over the juvenile before a criminal conviction occurs, but without having received notice of the pending criminal proceedings, subsection (c) would be rendered virtually meaningless in operation. The \u201cunless otherwise ordered\u201d language becomes superfluous as the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, in practice, likely will be terminated upon conviction of the juvenile before the court has an opportunity to act. We do not perceive that the Legislature included a specific vehicle for the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction <em>not </em>to be terminated upon a criminal conviction only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>leave that vehicle to operate, if at all, through random chance. Furthermore, the application of subsection (c), according to Appellant\u2019s interpretation, risks arbitrary and inconsistent application in the absence of a consistent mechanism for providing notice. .</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Appellees\u2019 suggested operation of the statute, on the other hand, fosters, to an unacceptable degree, a different kind of arbitrariness. In order to avoid the loss of jurisdiction upon entry of a conviction, in the absence of a reliable notice mechanism in the statute, Appellees sanction the precautionary insertion in all orders issued by juvenile courts, before juveniles reach the age of eighteen, of boilerplate language to the effect \u201cif the juvenile involved in this case is charged subsequently with a crime, the juvenile court hereby expresses its intent to retain jurisdiction over the juvenile for any and all purposes relevant to the pending juvenile case, regardless of whether a conviction results.\u201d Although there is nothing apparent in the language of the statute that would prohibit the implementation of such a strategy by juvenile courts, we view such a practice necessarily as encouraging the risk of abuse of discretion when exercising totally in the blind the option to retain jurisdiction. Furthermore, the rehabilitative goals of the 'Juvenile Causes Act are furthered more likely by an interpretation that permits juvenile courts to exercise discretion intelligently in deciding whether to waive their jurisdiction over juveniles when adult courts also have exercised their jurisdiction appropriately over the individuals. The waiver provisions in \u00a7 3-8A-06 reflect the priority given to the juvenile court and \u00a7 3-8A-07(c) likewise should be construed in a manner to maximize the juvenile court\u2019s flexibility and ability to exercise its discretion when determining whether to continue its jurisdiction over a juvenile charged as an adult in the adult criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">With regard to the language of the writ of attachment in the present case, Appellant contends that the language of the writ in this case is not specific enough to constitute an \u201corder\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-8A-07(c). He argues that the language, \u201cif the Respondent [Moore] is detained/committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>for another offense, this Warrant is to be lodged as a detainer for the continued detention of the Respondent,\u201d pertains only to the physical custody of Appellant and not to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The blind spot in this argument is that the purpose of the writ was to bring Appellant before the juvenile court for a hearing and disposition on the probation violation petition. Just as jurisdiction without custody necessitated the issuance of the writ, custody without jurisdiction over Appellant would be equally futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Appellees proffer that the writ of attachment was sufficient indication of the juvenile court\u2019s specific and timely intent to exercise jurisdiction over Appellant. Appellees argue that the language contained in the writ was sufficient for the juvenile court, even upon the unforetellable (at least from the juvenile court\u2019s vantage) entry of the criminal conviction of Appellant, to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of adjudicating the pending petition to revoke probation and take appropriate action depending on that outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Although the language of the 17 August 2001 writ obviously could not speak specifically to Appellant\u2019s 2 November 2001 criminal conviction for resisting arrest on 17 September 2001, it contemplated the possibility of subsequent offenses. Resisting arrest certainly qualifies as an \u201coffense.\u201d The writ was issued before occurrence of the terminable act contemplated by the statute, even under Appellant\u2019s view of when the juvenile court must act. On the present record, we conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s issuance of the writ partakes sufficiently of the character of the \u201corder\u201d contemplated in \u00a7 3-8A-07(c) to satisfy the statutory pre-requisite for retention of jurisdiction by the juvenile court. The issuance and execution of the writ, vis a vis the commencement of the criminal process leading to the conviction at issue here, evidenced the juvenile court\u2019s active and contemporaneous intention to continue the exercise of its jurisdiction over Appellant, at least with regard to the alleged probation violations. As previously noted, the arrest giving rise to the conviction for resisting arrest resulted directly from service of the juvenile court\u2019s writ on Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Section 3-8A-07(b) acknowledges the adult court\u2019s jurisdiction over Appellant for committing a crime after reaching the age of eighteen. No one here challenges that proposition. But for the juvenile court\u2019s contemporaneous expression of intent, in its writ, to maintain active jurisdiction over Appellant for purposes of adjudicating and taking appropriate action regarding the probation violation allegations, even in the face of some future other \u201coffense,\u201d we would be faced with a more difficult question as to the application of \u00a7 3-8A-07(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Our holding is limited to the facts of the present matter. The language of the statute, as noted <em>supra, </em>is ambiguous and the legislative intent in many ways is obscure. It seems desirable, therefore, that the Legislature consider clarification of the statute to make clearer its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
