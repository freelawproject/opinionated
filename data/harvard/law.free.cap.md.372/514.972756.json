(Rylyns), this case presents an unusual situation where a land use restriction demanded by Montgomery County, Maryland, during municipal annexation proceedings by the City of Rockville required the City to impose improper \u201cconditional zoning\u201d on the annexed property. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, held that the municipality\u2019s imposition, at the insistence of the County, of a condition limiting the use of the newly annexed property more restrictively than allowed by the City zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the property was placed was tantamount to improper conditional zoning. The intermediate appellate court also held that the zoning reclassification, in light of the limitation, constituted illegal \u201cspot zoning.\u201d We shall affirm that judgment based on the Court\u2019s holding as to impermissible conditional zoning, although we shall employ somewhat different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The material facts of this case are not in dispute. They must be considered against the backdrop of Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Article 23A, \u00a7 9(c), which restricts the zoning classification into which a municipality may place newly annexed property for a period of five years following annexation unless permission is obtained first from the pre-annexation county. That restriction provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-8\">(1) ... no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years following annexation, place that land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plans or if there is no adopted or approved master plan, the adopted or approved general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation without the express approval of the board of the county commissioners or county council of the county in which the municipality is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">(2) If the county expressly approves, the municipality, without regard to the provisions of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.05(a) of the Code, may place the annexed land in a zoning classification that permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or general plan of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On 14 May 1997, Louis Fanaroff, Stanford Steppa, and Elaine Steppa (the \u201cOwners\u201d), owners of the subject property located in Montgomery County abutting the City of Rockville and situated in the northwest quadrant of the intersection of Gude Drive and Southlawn Lane, filed a Petition for Annexation (the Petition) of the property into the City. At the time the Petition was filed, the subject property was zoned 1-2 (Heavy Industrial) as defined in the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance. 1-2 was the zone recommended for the property in the County\u2019s approved and adopted Upper Rock Creek Master Plan (the \u201cCounty Master Plan\u201d). The Petition requested that, upon annexation, the property be rezoned to the City\u2019s 1-1 (Service Industrial) zone, consistent with the zoning of adjacent properties located within the City\u2019s boundaries. The Owners intended to erect and operate a gasoline service station on the subject property, a use allowed under the City\u2019s 1-1 zone with the grant of a special exception. The County\u2019s 1-2 zone did not allow a gasoline service station under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">At a public hearing concerning the proposed annexation and rezoning, held on 17 December 1997 by the Mayor and Council of Rockville, Richard Durishin, the controlling owner of Rylyns, testified against the proposed rezoning. Mr. Durishin claimed to oppose the proposed 1-1 rezoning because the loss of the 1-2 classification of the subject property would reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the \u201cscarce stock\u201d of 1-2 zoned property in Montgomery County, a concern also expressed later by some County authorities. Mr. Durishin acknowledged that he was the operator of a gasoline filling station located across Gude Drive from the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">On the day following the City\u2019s hearing, the City\u2019s Planning Staff issued a final report recommending annexation of the subject property and its placement in the City\u2019s 1-1 zone. The report pointed out that the City\u2019s 1993 Master Plan recommended that the property (should it be annexed) be placed in the City\u2019s 1-1 zone and that the surrounding properties within the City also were zoned 1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On 15 January 1998, the Montgomery County Planning Board considered the proposed rezoning of the subject property. It noted significant differences between the County\u2019s 1-2 zone and the City\u2019s 1-1 zone. Among other concerns, the Board fretted that a change in zoning might trigger the need to improve the intersection of Southlawn Lane and Gude Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The County Council\u2019s Planning, Housing and Economic Development Committee, on 13 July 1998, recommended, by a vote of 3-0, that the full County Council disapprove the request to rezone the subject property. In a memorandum, dated 18 July 1998, to the County Council, the County Planning Board indicated, based on its review of the proposed annexation and rezoning of the property, that the proposed use of the subject property for a gasoline station was not an appropriate use for the property, as it was not allowed under the County\u2019s 1-2 zone. Upon consideration of these recommendations, the County Council, on 28 July 1998, adopted Resolution No. 13-1384 disapproving the request of the Owners and the City to rezone the property to the City\u2019s 1-1 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Seven months later, in a 8 February 1999 memorandum to the County Council, its Planning, Housing and Economic Development Committee announced that, at the request of a County Council member, it had re-examined the Owners\u2019 petition for annexation and rezoning and concluded that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>would support the rezoning of the subject property from the County\u2019s 1-2 zone to the City\u2019s 1-1 zone, \u201cprovided the City restrict the retail use of the site.... \u201d On 23 February 1999, the County Council adopted Resolution No. 14-57 approving the City\u2019s proposal to rezone the property on condition that \u201cthe City prohibits the retail use of the site, except for a gasoline service station.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On 20 July 1999, the Mayor and Council of Rockville entered into a written annexation agreement with the Owners regarding the subject property. The agreement, among other things, provided that the property could not be used for any retail purpose, other than a gasoline service station. There was no mention in the agreement of the requirement in the City Zoning ordinance that a special exception was required in the City\u2019s 1-1 zone in order to operate a gasoline service station. The Mayor and Council adopted Annexation Resolution No. 13-99 on 26 July 1999, enlarging and extending the boundaries of the City of Rockville by annexing the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A week later, the Mayor and Council adopted Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99, placing the property in the City\u2019s 1-1 zoning classification. Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99 specifically stated that \u201cthe Mayor and Council of Rockville, having fully considered the matter, has.determined to place the annexed property in the City\u2019s 1-1 zone, under certain conditions to be set forth in an annexation agreement, so as to promote the health, security, and general welfare of the community of the City of Rockville.\u201d The annexation of the property and its placement in the City\u2019s 1-1 zone became effective on 9 September 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Upset with this result, Rylyns filed a petition with the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of City Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99. No direct judicial review of Annexation Resolution No. 13-99 was sought. On 17 March 2000, the Circuit Court reversed Rockville\u2019s adoption of Zoning Ordinance 10-99, holding that the manner in which the subject property was rezoned constituted improper conditional and spot zoning, and remanded the case to the Mayor and Council. The Mayor and Council, and the Owners, appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Mayor and Council of Rockville and the Owners petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which, on 22 June 2001, we granted. <em>Rockville v. Rylyns, </em>364 Md. 534, 774 A.2d 408 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Petitioners initially presented two questions to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">1. Does a limitation in an annexation agreement restricting certain uses on newly annexed property constitute conditional zoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">2. Did the placement of newly annexed property by the City, in a zone that permitted a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan of Montgomery County, with the approval of the Montgomery County Council pursuant to Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c)(2), constitute invalid spot zoning?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">After initial briefing and argument, we set the case in for reargument, on our own initiative, inviting the Maryland Municipal League, the Maryland Association of Counties and the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission to file amici briefs. We requested that the parties and amici address additional issues that we framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">3. Prior to 1975 there was no subsection (c)(2) of Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c) and subsection (c) had no provisions in respect to county approval. At that time Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c), as relevant to the case at bar, provided that a municipal corporation for a period of five years after annexation could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u2018place that (annexed] land in a different zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to annexation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aze\">In 1975, subsequent to two 1974 Court of Appeals\u2019s decisions in which the above language was mentioned, Senate Bill 864 was introduced. As introduced, the bill contained the same language above through the phrase \u2018current and duly adopted master plan or plans\u2019 but then added a provision at the very end of the subsection creating an exception based upon county approval i.e. \u2018without the express approval of the county.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The bill, however, was amended during its progress through the Senate. As relevant to the instant case, the amendment added immediately after the phrase \u2018duly adopted master plan or plans,\u2019 the phrase \u2018or if there is not an adopted and approved master plan, the adopted or approved general plan or plans\u2019 of the county.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">a) In view of the legislative history of Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c) (1 and 2) (and particularly Chapter 613, Laws 1975, and Chapter 450, Laws 1988), may a municipality which has planning and zoning authority and has a current and duly adopted master plan covering land within its jurisdiction, zone the annexed property upon annexation irrespective of the land use proposed for such property by the county\u2019s current and duly adopted master plans or general plans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">b) If the answer to the above question is yes, does Section 9(c)(2) apply in such cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">4. Under what circumstances do the provisions of Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 supp.), Art. 66B, Section 4.01(c) (\u2018may impose such additional conditions, restrictions, or limitations\u2019) (which was first enacted in 1970 subsequent to the <em>Carole Highlands Citizens Ass\u2019n, Inc v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Prince Georges County, </em>222 Md. 44, 158 A.2d 663 (1960) and <em>Baylis v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429 (1959) cases), and Rockville City Code (2000) Section 25-126 (\u2018may impose additional restrictions, conditions or limitations\u2019) (enacted after the enactment of the State statute) authorize conditional zoning by the City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">a) What is the effect, if any, of <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Collington Corporate Center 1 Limited Partnership, </em>358 Md. 296, 747 A.2d 1219 (2000), which upheld conditional zoning in Prince George\u2019s County, on this issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">b) Do the above provisions authorize the City\u2019s actions in the present case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">5. What zoning classification, if any, would the subject property have if the Court were to rule that the 1-1 Zoning was invalid? Is there a state or City statute covering the situation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">As a prelude to considering these questions, it may be useful to refresh our collective memories as to the core concepts, terms, and procedures underlying the planning and zoning principles potentially implicated by, or related to, the issues in this case. This framework of planning and zoning principles forms a \u201cflexibility continuum,\u201d a continuum within which the present controversy must be placed. Planning and zoning turns on the dynamic interplay between certainty and consistency in the application of land use plans and zoning ordinances on the one hand, and on the other the need for zoning authorities to have flexibility in applying those plans and ordinances to accommodate changing and/or unforseen circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">A. Planning and Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">There exists a distinction between zoning and what commonly is called land use planning, both as a practical matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>and as a function of different statutory grants of power and delegations of duties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the purposes of this case, the statutes controlling the exercise of the planning function are found primarily in Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 3.01-3.09 and those controlling the exercise of the zoning function are found primarily in Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 66B \u00a7\u00a7 4.01-4.08.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Plans are long term and theoretical, and usually contain elements concerning transportation and public facilities, recommended zoning, and other land use recommendations and proposals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Zoning, however, is a more finite term, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>primary objective is the immediate regulation of property use through the use of use classifications, some relatively rigid and some more flexible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Howard County v.

In those instances where such a statute or ordinance exists, its effect is usually that of requiring that zoning or other land use decisions be consistent with a plan\u2019s recommendations regarding land use and density or intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">B. Original, Comprehensive, and Piecemeal Zoning and the Police Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In <em>Harbor Island Marina, Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Calvert County, </em>286 Md. 303, 312-13, 407 A.2d 738, 743 (1979), we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u2018t]he purpose of the zoning law is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public, Md.Code (1957, 1978 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 4.03, and the Act vests in the counties the full measure of power which the State could exercise in pursuit of this objective.\u2019 See <em>Carney v. City of Baltimore, </em>201 Md. 130, 135, 93 A.2d 74, 76 (1952). \u2018The very essence of zoning is territorial division according to the character of the land and ... [its] peculiar suitability for uses, <em>and uniformity of use within the zone.\u2019 Heath v. M. &amp; C.C. of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 296, 305, 49 A.2d 799, 804 (1946)(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The exercise of these broad powers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is, in the main, through the implementation of what is known as the planning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>zoning process. In theory, and usually in practice, long study and consideration is given to the location of various human activities as they are distributed on the geographic plain, and analysis is made as to where particular types of growth are likely to occur, and where it would be best to allow growth to occur in reference to all of the other land use activities in the area or region in question. Ideally, growth then may be planned in a manner that allows for the expansion of economic activities and opportunities in the area or region for the benefit of its residents, while at the same time attempting to maintain the quality of life of the region, all without unduly disturbing the reasonable expectations of the citizenry as to the permissible uses they may make of real property. As is the case with most human endeavors, particularly those involving multiple and complex variables, the results of the planning and zoning process are sometimes less than perfect, particularly from the subjective point of view of the property owner who finds that his or her desired use for a property is different from that of the relevant planning and zoning authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Zoning authorities in Maryland implement their plans and determinations regarding appropriate land use zoning categories primarily through three processes: 1) original zoning; 2) comprehensive rezoning; and 3) piecemeal rezoning. As will be discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>a fundamental distinction between original zoning, comprehensive zoning, and piecemeal zoning is that the first two are purely legislative processes, while piecemeal rezoning is achieved, usually at the request of the property owner, through a quasi-judicial process leading to a legislative act. <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 711-13, 376 A.2d 483, 497-98 (1977); Richmarr, 117 Md.App. at 636, 701 A.2d at 893-94. The quasi-judicial process must observe the requirements of Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Because the power to regulate land use necessarily places the local government in the position of potentially circumscribing a citizen\u2019s rights or expectations as to the desired use for a given piece of real property, our appellate courts repeatedly have identified the source of those powers and set forth the minimum procedures necessary to insure that these powers are exercised in an appropriate manner. In <em>White v. Spring, </em>109 Md.App. 692, 696-97, 675 A.2d 1023, 1025 (1996), the Court of Special Appeals succinctly stated that, absent a confiscatory regulation or result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">[ojriginal zonings (including master planning) and comprehensive rezoning are limited only by the general boundaries of the ... appropriate procedural and due process considerations. A legislative body establishes zoning policy through its adoption of master plans, comprehensive zoning and comprehensive rezoning. So long as (1) the appropriate procedural criteria are met, (2) the due process limitations have been duly addressed, (3) the policy is designed to achieve a valid public purpose, and (4) the police power is not otherwise exceeded, comprehensive zoning and comprehensive rezoning-i.e., the conclusions of the legislative bodies, cannot be a mistake, except where it is proven by substantial evidence that the information relied upon by the legislative entity was wrong, i.e., a mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\"><em>See also Mraz v.

Generally, by means of Euclidean zoning, a municipality divides an area geographically into particular use districts, specifying certain uses for each district. \u201cEach district or zone is dedicated to a particular purpose, either residential, commercial, or industrial,\u201d and the \u201czones appear on the municipality\u2019s official zoning map.\u201d 5 Rathkopfs, \u00a7 63.01, at 63-1-2.

The Zoning Process in Greater Depth</p>\n<p id=\"AFT\">1. Original and Comprehensive Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>the act of zoning either may be original or comprehensive (covering a large area and ordinarily initiated by local government) or piecemeal (covering individual parcels, lots, or assemblages, and ordinarily initiated by the property owner). The requirements which must be met for an act of zoning to qualify as proper comprehensive zoning are that the legislative act of zoning must: 1) cover a substantial area; 2) be the product of careful study and consideration; 3) control and direct the use of land and development according to present and planned future conditions, consistent with the public interest; and, 4) set forth and regulate all permitted land uses in all or substantially all of a given political subdivision, though it need not zone or rezone all of the land in the jurisdiction. <em>Mraz, </em>291 Md. at 88-89, 433 A.2d at 776; <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. at 702, 376 A.2d at 492-93; <em>County Council for Montgomery County v.

Coleman, </em>251 Md. 6, 9-11, 246 A.2d 223, 224-25 (1968); <em>Grooms, </em>27 Md.App. at 277, 340 A.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The motives or wisdom of the legislative body in adopting an original or comprehensive zoning enjoy a strong presumption of correctness and validity, <em>Norbeck, </em>254 Md. at 65-66, 254 A.2d at 704-05. The zoning so established may be changed thereafter by the zoning authority only by the adoption of a subsequent comprehensive rezoning, or, in the case of a piecemeal Euclidean zoning application, upon a showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>there was a mistake in the prior original or comprehensive zoning or evidence that there has been a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood since the time the original or comprehensive zoning was put in place. <em>Stratakis v. Beauchamp, </em>268 Md. 643, 652-53, 304 A.2d 244, 249 (1973); <em>Anne Arundel County v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>32 Md.App. 437, 440, 361 A.2d 134, 136 (1976). As will be discussed <em>infra </em>when we address piecemeal zoning, the impact of this presumption often has been felt to be unduly harsh to the landowner who finds that planned uses of a property are no longer allowed under the zoning classification into which the land has been placed. The presumption performs, however, and perhaps somewhat ironically, a critically essential function to the benefit of the property owner. Because zoning necessarily impacts the economic uses to which land may be put, and thus impacts the economic return to the property owner, the requirement that there be uniformity within each zone throughout the district is an important safeguard of the right to fair and equal treatment of the landowners at the hands of the local zoning authority. Frankly put, the requirement of uniformity serves to protect the landowner from favoritism towards certain landowners within a zone by the grant of less onerous restrictions than are applied to others within the same zone elsewhere in the district, and also serves to prevent the use of zoning as a form of leverage by the local government seeking land concession, transfers, or other consideration in return for more favorable zoning treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Rigidity is not without its drawbacks. No planning and zoning scheme, regardless of how well-studied and designed, can accommodate all of the minute geographical differences found in a given region, or anticipate all of the future changes or desired uses to which the lands subject to zoning conceivably and appropriately may be put, or uses to which owners, in the free exercise of their property interests, may wish their land to be put. In response to the imperfect nature of planning and zoning and the need for greater flexibility in responding to the impacts of these imperfections, various mechanisms have been designed and incorporated into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>planing and zoning process to allow for changes in the uses allowed within a given zone while at the same time retaining the safeguards of the requirement of uniformity within zones. This is the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for floating zones, variances, conditional uses/special exceptions, and even non-conforming uses. Of some of these vehicles, the venerable scribe of Maryland zoning jurisprudence, Stanley D. Abrams, Esquire, notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">A special exception or conditional use refers to a permissive land use category authorized by a zoning or administrative body pursuant to the existing provisions of the zoning law and subject to guides, standard and conditions for such special use which is permitted under provisions of the existing zoning law. A variance refers to administrative relief which may be granted from the strict application of a particular development limitation in the zoning ordinance (i.e., setback, area and height limitations, etc.). The principle of a nonconforming use protects the vested rights of property owner against changes in the zoning ordinance which may impair or prohibit the owner\u2019s existing use of his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Stanley D. Abrams, Guide to Maryland Zoning Decisions, \u00a7 11.1 (3d ed., Michie 1992).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While these mechanisms give increased flexibility to zoning regulatory schemes, protection against abuse is provided by the fact that the specific requirements and available alternatives for each mechanism must be spelled out in detail as a part of the comprehensive zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ordinance, and thus cannot be \u201cmade-up\u201dout of convenience or expediency on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">2. Piecemeal Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">As was pointed out <em>supra, </em>the requirement that restrictions within a zone apply uniformly to all of the properties within that zone throughout the district serves to protect land owners from arbitrary use of zoning powers by zoning authorities. Though at first seemingly contradictory, it is for this reason that the motives or wisdom of the legislative body in adopting an original or comprehensive zoning enjoy a strong presumption of correctness and validity. <em>Norbeck, </em>254 Md. at 65-66, 254 A.2d at 704-05. As a consequence, the original or comprehensive zoning may be changed (unless by a subsequent comprehensive zoning) only by a subsequent piecemeal zoning, which in the case of a Euclidean zone may be granted only upon a showing of change or mistake as previously discussed. <em>Stratakis, </em>268 Md. at 652-53, 304 A.2d at 249; <em>Richmarr, </em>117 Md.App. at 635-37, 701 A.2d at 893-94. This requirement, known as the \u201cchange-mistake rule,\u201d like the rule of uniformity within zones, endeavors to serve the important function of preventing the arbitrary use and/or abuse of the zoning power.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The \u201cchange-mistake\u201d rule is a rule of the either /or type. The \u201cchange\u201d half of the \u201cchange-mistake\u201d rule requires that, in order for a piecemeal Euclidean zoning change to be approved, there must be a satisfactory showing that there has been significant and unanticipated change in a relatively well-defined area (the \u201cneighborhood\u201d) surrounding the property in question since its original or last comprehensive rezoning, whichever occurred most recently. The \u201cmistake\u201d option of the rule requires a showing that the underlying assumptions or premises relied upon by the legislative body during the immediately preceding original or comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>rezoning were incorrect. In other words, there must be a showing of a mistake of fact. Mistake in this context does not refer to a mistake in judgment. Additionally, even where evidence of a change or mistake is adduced, there is no reciprocal right to a change in zoning, nor is there a threshold evidentiary standard which when met compels rezoning. Even with very strong evidence of change or mistake, piecemeal zoning may be granted, but is not required to be granted, except where a failure to do so would deprive the owner of all economically viable use of the property. <em>See Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Stone, </em>271 Md. 655, 660-64, 319 A.2d 536, 540-41 (1974); <em>Burgess v. 103-29 Ltd.

The Prosser Co., Inc., </em>119 Md.App. 150, 179, 704 A.2d 483, 498 (1998); <em>The Bowman Group v. Dawson Moser, </em>112 Md.App. 694, 699-702, 686 A.2d 643, 646-47 (1996); <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Beachwood I Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>107 Md.App. 627, 638-59, 670 A.2d 484, 489-500 (1995); <em>Boyce v. Sembly, </em>25 Md.App. 43, 49-53, 334 A.2d 137, 141-44 (1975). In Maryland, the change-mistake rule applies to all piecemeal zoning applications involving Euclidian zones, including those involving conditional zoning.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The change-mistake rule does not apply, in any event, to changes in zoning made in a comprehensive rezoning, or the piecemeal grant of a floating zone.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>3. Special Exceptions/Conditional Uses</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Another mechanism allowing some flexibility in the land use process, without abandoning the uniformity principle, is the \u201cspecial exception\u201d or \u201cconditional use.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As was noted <em>supra, </em>the City of Rockville\u2019s I-1 zoning classification does not allow for the operation of a gasoline service station except upon the grant of a special exception. During the legislative process of defining zones and identifying the permitted uses for each zone, the local legislature also identifies additional uses which may be conditionally compatible in each zone, but which should not be allowed unless specific statutory standards assuring compatibility are met by the applicant at the time separate approval of the use is sought. \u201cThe special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative Board limited authority to allow enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible absent any fact or circumstance negating the presumption.\u201d <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 11, 432 A.2d 1319, 1325 (1981).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Put another way, a special exception use is an additional use which the controlling zoning ordinance states will be allowed in a given zone unless there is showing that the use would have unique adverse affects on the neighboring properties within the zone. <em>Rockville Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Board of Appeals of the City of Gaithersburg, </em>257 Md. 183, 188-91, 262 A.2d 499, 502-03 (1970); <em>Cadem v. Nanna, </em>243 Md. 536, 543, 221 A.2d 703, 707 (1966); <em>Anderson v. Sawyer, </em>23 Md.App. 612, 617-18, 329 A.2d 716, 720-21 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The disqualifying adverse effect or effects must be more than mere annoyance. Classifying such uses as special exceptions or conditional uses (as opposed to permitted uses) assumes that those uses will include some adverse impacts. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 7-11, 666 A.2d 1253, 1256-58 (1995). As we pointed out in <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d at 1325 (1981) \u201c[t]he appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Because special exceptions are legislatively-created within the comprehensive zoning regulatory scheme, they enjoy the presumption of correctness and are an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tool for the exercise of a local government\u2019s police powers. <em>Brandywine Enterprises, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County Council, </em>117 Md.App. 525, 700 A.2d 1216 (1997). Because of this presumption, special exception applications are not governed by the \u201cchange-mistake Rule.\u201d <em>Cadem, </em>243 Md. at 543, 221 A.2d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">4. Conditional Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Another important zoning mechanism is \u201cconditional zoning.\u201d At one time, in most States, conditional zoning was improper. This, as late as the 1950\u2019s, was also the case in Maryland. Some states, either by case law and/or statute, approved, however, some level of conditional zoning. Particularly illustrative for our purposes is the case of <em>Collard v. Village of Flower Hill, 52 </em>N.Y.2d 594, 600-01, 439 N.Y.S.2d 326, 421 N.E.2d 818, 821 (1981), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKp\">Probably the principal objection to conditional rezoning is that it constitutes illegal spot zoning, thus violating the legislative mandate requiring that there be a comprehensive plan for, and that all conditions be uniform within, a given zoning district. When courts have considered the issue (see, e.g., <em>Baylis v. City of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429; <em>Houston Petroleum Co. v. Automotive Prods. Credit Ass\u2019n., </em>9 N.J. 122, 87 A.2d 319; <em>Hausmann &amp; Johnson v. Berea Bd. of Appeals, </em>40 Ohio App.2d 432, 320 N.E.2d 685), the assumptions have been made that conditional zoning benefits particular landowners rather than the community as a whole and that it undermines the foundation upon which comprehensive zoning depends by destroying uniformity within use districts. Such unexamined assumptions are questionable. First, it is a downward change to a less restrictive zoning classification that benefits the property rezoned and not the opposite imposition of greater restrictions on land use. Indeed, imposing limiting conditions, while benefitting surrounding properties, normally adversely affects the premises on which the conditions are imposed. Second, zoning is not invalid per se merely because only a single parcel is involved or benefitted <em>(Matter of Mahoney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>v. O\u2019Shea Funeral Homes, </em>45 N.Y.2d 719, 408 N.Y.S.2d 470, 380 N.E.2d 297); the real test for spot zoning is whether the change is other than part of a well-considered and comprehensive plan calculated to serve the general welfare of the community. Such a determination, in turn, depends on the reasonableness of the rezoning in relation to neighboring uses-an inquiry required regardless of whether the change in zone is conditional in form. Third, if it is initially proper to change a zoning classification without the imposition of restrictive conditions notwithstanding that such change may depart from uniformity, then no reason exists why accomplishing that change subject to condition should automatically be classified as impermissible spot zoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">... If modification to a less restrictive zoning classification is warranted, then <em>a foHiori </em>conditions imposed by a local legislature to minimize conflicts among districts should not in and of themselves violate any prohibition against spot zoning, (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As we will address in more detail <em>infra, </em>it is clear that Maryland now approves of at least limited conditional zoning, as codified in Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.01(c).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we pointed out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Attman/Glazer P.B. Co. v. Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis, </em>314 Md. 675, 687, n. 8, 552 A.2d 1277, 1284, n. 8 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">Conditional zoning, once roundly condemned, appears to be in the ascendancy. In Maryland, the concept has evolved indirectly through the use of various zoning devices such as planned developments, and has found at least limited favor with the state legislature. <em>See </em>Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 4.01(b) permitting a county or municipal corporation to impose certain conditions at the time of zoning or rezoning land, under certain circumstances. <em>See also People\u2019s Counsel v. Mockard, </em>73 Md.App. 340, 343-45, 533 A.2d 1344 (1987); and <em>Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 574, 579-86, 501 A.2d 489 (1985) (holding that \u00a7\u00a7 4.01(b) of Article 66B authorizes the imposition of conditions applicable to structural and architectural character of the land and improvements thereon, and does not authorize conditional use rezoning). We need not, and do not, offer an opinion concerning the intermediate appellate court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of \u00a7 4.01(b).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">5. Spot Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Although we need not, and therefore shall not, decide whether the City of Rockville\u2019s grant of the 1-1 zone for the subject property constitutes illegal spot zoning because we decide the case on other grounds, we shall describe briefly the principles of spot zoning so that the potential nexus between it and conditional zoning may be appreciated. In <em>Tennison v. Shomette, </em>38 Md.App. 1, 8, 379 A.2d 187, 192 (1977), the Court of Special Appeals pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>[s)pot zoning occurs when a small area in a District is placed in a different zoning classification than the surrounding property ... Spot zoning is not invalid <em>per se. </em>Rather, its validity depends on the facts of each individual case .... while spot zoning is illegal if it is inconsistent with an established comprehensive plan and is made solely for the benefit of a private interest, it is a valid exercise of the police power where the zoning is in harmony with the comprehensive plan and there is a substantial relationship to the public health, safety and general welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>See also Mraz, </em>291 Md. at 88, 433 A.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We discussed the concept of \u201cspot zoning\u201d in the case of <em>Cassel v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>195 Md. 348, 73 A.2d 486 (1950), at one time considered a leading case on the topic. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Zoning is permissible only as an exercise of the police power of the State.

Contract Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A final zoning concept we shall mention briefly in this primer is \u201ccontract zoning.\u201d It occurs when an agreement is entered between the ultimate zoning authority and the zoning applicant/ property owner which purports to determine contractually how the property in question will be zoned, in derogation of the legal prerequisites for the grant of the desired zone. Absent valid legislative authorization, it is impermissible because it allows a property owner to obtain a special privilege not available to others, <em>Wakefield v. Kraft, </em>202 Md. 136, 142-44, 96 A.2d 27, 29-30 (1953), disrupts the comprehensive nature of the zoning plan, and, most importantly, impermissibly derogates the exercise of the municipality\u2019s powers. <em>Attman/Glazer, </em>314 Md. at 685-86, 552 A.2d at 1282-83; <em>Baylis v.

That is to say, the Owners\u2019 position is that the statutory consistency requirement is met if the new zoning is consistent with Rockville\u2019s own plan, and consistency with the plan or plans of the pre-annexation jurisdiction is not required.

Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360-61, 369 A.2d 82, 86-87 (1977), we set out the six principal tenets of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">[ 1 ' The cardinal rule of construction of a statute is to ascertain and carry out the real intention of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">/2] The primary source from which we glean this intention is the language of the statute itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">3 .] In construing a statute, we accord the words their ordinary and natural signification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>4 ,] If reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered surplus-age or meaningless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">(5] Similarly, wherever possible an interpretation should be given to statutory language which will not lead to absurd consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">+6] Moreover, if the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, the sections must be read together to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">As noted, absurd results in the interpretive analysis of a statute are to be shunned. This Court stated in <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990), that \u201cconstruction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d (citations omitted). <em>See also Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985) (\u201c[Rjules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results.\u201d); <em>Erwin and Shafer, Inc. v.

Baltimore Diamond Exchange, Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 316-18, 799 A.2d 1264, 1271-72 (2002), stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">In <em>Mayor of Baltimore v.

To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">We have acknowledged that, in ascertaining a statute\u2019s meaning, we must consider the context in which <em>a </em>statute appears. In this regard we have instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">When the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in that context. That means that, when interpreting any statute, the statute as a whole must be construed, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. Thus, statutes on the same subject are to be read together and harmonized to the extent possible, reading them so as to avoid rendering either of them, or any portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory. <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302-03, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001) (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On the other hand, \u201cwhere the meaning of the plain language of the statute, or the language itself, is unclear, \u2018we seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u2019 \u201d We recently explained the rules applicable when the terms of a statute are ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u2018When the words of a statutory provision are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, and we examine the circumstances surrounding the enactment of a legislative provision in an effort to discern legislative intent, we interpret the meaning and effect of the language in light of the objectives and purposes of the provision enacted. Such an interpretation must be reasonable and consonant with logic and common sense. In addition, we seek to avoid construing a statute in a manner that leads to an illogical or untenable outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">We defined the term \u201cambiguity\u201d as \u201creasonably capable of more than one meaning,\u201d and further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP3\">\u2018language can be regarded as ambiguous in two different respects: 1) it may be intrinsically unclear ...; or 2) its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>intrinsic meaning may be fairly clear, but its application to a particular object or circumstance may be uncertain.\u2019 Thus, a term which is unambiguous in one context may be ambiguous in another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">(Some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Although we shall conclude that no rational argument can be made to suggest that the language in Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c)(1) refers to plans other than those of the pre-annexation zoning authority, a plain meaning approach does not yield this conclusion as the ready answer. A fair reading of the statute in its historical development, however, supports no other conclusion. Applying the interpretational rules to the pertinent statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself. Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c) grants to the annexing municipality exclusive zoning powers, but then sets forth a number of threshold conditions or exceptions, the most important of which for our present purpose is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">that no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years following annexation, <em>place that land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plans or if there is no adopted or approved master plan, the adopted or approved general plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation </em>without the express approval of the board of county commissioners or county council of the county in which the municipality is located, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The language of the clause is arguably ambiguous. As written, there are two possible plain meaning interpretations of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Under the first of these, the annexing municipality is directed, as the Owners argue, to look to its own land use plans first, and only if it has none is it required to look to the plans of the pre-annexation jurisdiction. This interpretation is made \u25a0 possible theoretically by Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Article 66B \u00a7 3.05(a)(2)(ii), which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>vides that a municipality\u2019s master plan should \u201cinclude any areas outside of its boundaries which, in the commission\u2019s judgment, bear relation to the planning responsibilities of the commission.\u201d Without Art 66B, \u00a7 3.05(a), the annexing municipality would have no plan of its own to refer to, and it would be clear that the language in Art. 23A, \u00a7 9 refers solely to the plans of the pre-annexation jurisdiction. The Owners\u2019 literal interpretation is that if the annexing jurisdiction\u2019s plan includes a land use recommendation for an area originally outside of its jurisdiction in anticipation of its possible future annexation, then it may look first to its own municipal plan and is only required to look to the county plan if there is no municipal plan, or the municipal plan failed to make an anticipatory use recommendation covering the annexed area. For the reasons set forth <em>infra, </em>this interpretation is not persuasive as its logical support requires a degree of intellectual \u201ccherry-picking\u201d from both the overall pertinent statutory scheme and its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The second possible interpretation is that the General Assembly merely was acknowledging the hierarchy of local governmental planning and the differing terminology used to identify those various land use plans by the various jurisdictions. Under this interpretation, the language may be read to require the annexing municipality to look to the duly adopted \u201cmaster plan or plans\u201d of the county or other jurisdiction having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation, and if the county has no duly adopted \u201cmaster plan or plans,\u201d then the annexing municipality must look to the county\u2019s general plan or plans. Under this interpretation, the terms \u201cplan\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d always refers to the land use recommendations of the pre-annexation jurisdiction, and renders the land use plans of the annexing municipality, for purposes of determining zoning consistency at the time of annexation, not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Given the historical development of Article 23A, \u00a7 9, discussed <em>infra, </em>we conclude that the latter interpretation is correct. As we pointed out in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Mayor and Council of Rock-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>ville, </em>272 Md. 550, 561, 325 A.2d 748, 754-55 (1974), discussing the legislative purpose of this section as it existed at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASD\">A major objective of Chapter 116 [Laws 1971\u2014amending Art. 23A, \u00a7 9] is to preserve the integrity of the Master Plan adopted by the jurisdiction or commission having planning power immediately prior to annexation. In enacting Chapter 116, the General Assembly validly could have considered that the planning and zoning functions frequently involve large areas, and not merely the land being annexed; and, therefore, that a substantial change in the zoning of an annexed tract might well be disruptive to the planning for the surrounding areas. Thus, the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state objective, and is not arbitrary or unreasonable, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>See also Northeast Plaza Associates v. President and Comm\u2019rs of the Town of North East, </em>310 Md. 20, 28-31, 526 A.2d 963, 967-69 (1987).. Thus, we have held that the purpose of the section as previously enacted was to limit the power of municipalities and preserve the zoning of the pre-annexation jurisdiction for a period of five years,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and there is nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the subsequent history of this section to suggest the General Assembly subsequently intended otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The interpretation that the language in question is meant to limit, or to put it more precisely, delay, the exclusive zoning authority of an annexing municipality is buttressed when we view \u00a7 9 as a whole, and as part of the larger statutory scheme. It is \u201cwell settled\u201d that \u201cthe title of an act is relevant to ascertainment of its intent and purpose.... \u201d <em>MTA v. Balto. Co. Revenue Auth., </em>267 Md. 687, 695-696, 298 A.2d 413 (1973). Article 23A, \u00a7 9 is titled Definitions and limitations. As such, one legitimately may expect that the legislative intent is to define and limit the powers of annexing municipalities, rather than to expand them. Reinforcing this expectation is the fact that \u00a7 9(c) is specifically titled Limitations on charter amendments; effect of annexation. Again, one would expect that the contents of this sub-section are intended to set forth limits or to withhold from municipali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ties, under certain circumstances, the ability to exercise zoning power in certain annexation situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Further reinforcing the view that the pertinent language is meant to refer only to the plans of the pre-annexation jurisdiction is the fact that Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Article 66B, \u00a7 1.00(h)(2)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> specifically recognizes that a local government planning document may be called by different names when it states that \u201c \u2018Plan\u2019 includes a general plan, master plan, comprehensive plan, or community plan adopted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 3.01 through 3.09 of this article.\u201d Thus, in light of the above, when \u00a7 9(c)(1) is read together with \u00a7 9(c)(2), it becomes clear that the language in both sub-sections refers only to the plans of the pre-annexation county. As six Maryland counties<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> put it in their <em>Amici Curiae </em>brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">... [T]he \u201ccounty or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction\u201d modifier, contrary to [the Owners\u2019] suggestion, applies to <em>both </em>\u201cmaster\u201d plans and \u201cgeneral\u201d plans. While the sentence at the end of subsection (c)(1) might possibly be strained to say, as [the Owners] urge, that the \u201cmaster plan or plans\u201d language refers to any kind of master plan-including Rockville\u2019s, which extends beyond City boundaries-the sentence in subsection (c)(2) clearly means that the \u201cmaster\u201d plan or \u201cgeneral\u201d plan to be followed is that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201ccounty or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.\u201d (Brief at 18).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Reading the language of \u00a7 9(c)(1) as including reference to the plan of an annexing municipality, as urged by the Owners, renders the sub-section effectively a nullity, as any municipality wishing to avoid the five year rule could do so relatively easily by adopting its own contrarian plan, assuming that it was fully empowered to do so. We note, however, that this is not what the General Assembly said, and there is no indication that this is what it meant. Not even the City of Rockville endorses the Owners\u2019 argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We turn now to examine the relevant legislative history. As we pointed out in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Mayor and City Council of Laurel, </em>262 Md. 171, 177-78, 277 A.2d 262, 265-66 (1971), Chapter 423, Laws 1955, a progenitor of Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c), operated to prohibit municipalities in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties from exercising annexation or zoning powers if to do so would interfere with the powers exercised by the Maryland National Capital Park and Planing Commission. This balance of power briefly shifted toward the municipalities with the passage of Chapter 197, Laws 1957, when the Legislature created an exception to the prohibition created by Chapter 423, by providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">Except that where any area is annexed to a municipality authorized to have and having then a planning and zoning authority, the said municipality shall have exclusive jurisdiction over planing and zoning within the area annexed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGy\">This provision represents the highwater mark of municipal power under this section, and is the last instance where municipalities with zoning and planning authority wielded relative autonomy with respect to the initial zoning of annexed lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In 1971 this autonomy ceased. As we previously pointed out in <em>Northeast, </em>310 Md. at 28-29, 526 A.2d at 967-68; <em>MNCPPC v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, 272 </em>Md. 550, 561, 325 A.2d 748, 754-55 (1974); and <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Montgomery County, Maryland, </em>271 Md. 505, 511-13, 318 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>A.2d 509, 512-13 (1974), the General Assembly enacted Chapter 116, Laws 1971 <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to limit the power of municipalities to zone annexed property. The statute specifically stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">... no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years following annexation, place such land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for such land specified in the <em>current and duly adopted master plan or plan of the county or agency having planing and zoning jurisdiction over such land prior to its annexation, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">This language was modified by Chapter 33, Laws 1972, which removed the word \u201cplan\u201d and replaced it with the word \u201cplans.\u201d There can be no doubt, from the language of the statute as it existed in 1971 and 1972, that the terms \u201cplan\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d found in Chapters 116 and 33, respectively, refer to the plan or plans of- the pre-annexation county jurisdiction, and not those of the annexing municipality. That the clause \u201cof the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to annexation\u201d follows immediately after the terms \u201cmaster plan or plan (later \u2018plans\u2019)\u201d makes this point indisputable. The use of multiple terms for the concept of a plan merely indicates the General Assembly\u2019s recognition that the political subdivisions of the State use more than one term to identify their land use \u201cplan\u201d or their internal hierarchy of plans.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nothing in subsequent amendments to this section reasonably can be taken to have altered this meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Chapter 613, Laws 1975, made two relevant changes to Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c), First, language was added which clarified that the amendments of Chapter 33, Laws 1972, had been intended to acknowledge the different terminology used by the various jurisdictions to identify their land use \u201cplans.\u201d Second, apparently in response to our decisions in <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 325 A.2d 748 (1974) and <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Montgomery County, </em>271 Md. 505, 318 A.2d 509 (1974), where we held municipal rezoning actions invalid on the ground of inconsistency with county master plan recommendations, Chapter 613 provided a means where the five year limitation on the annexing jurisdiction\u2019s ability to change the zoning of the annexed property could be waived if express county approval were obtained. As a result of the adoption of Chapter 613, Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c), read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">... or if there is no adopted or approved master plan, the adopted or approved general plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation <em>without the express approval of the Board of County Commissioners or County Council of the county in which the municipality is located, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The last change that lead to the statute in its current form occurred in 1988 when Chapter 450 (House Bill (H.B.) 667 repealed and reenacted the statute with new subsection (c)(2)). It was a direct response to our opinion in <em>Northeast. </em>In <em>Northeast, </em>we held that the change-mistake requirements of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.05(a), applied even where county approval of the municipality\u2019s annexation and rezoning had been obtained. In <em>Northeast, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">By ch. 613 of the Acts of 1975, the General Assembly again amended \u00a7 9(c) to allow \u2018substantially different\u2019 rezoning of annexed land without regard to the five-year limitation, if the municipality obtained the express approval of the appropriate county. As amended, therefore, nothing in \u00a7 9(c) purports to preclude a municipality from rezoning annexed land when, as here, it obtains the county\u2019s express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>consent.... <em>But nothing in \u00a7 9(c) eliminates the requirement that the municipality comply with the pertinent provisions of Art. 66B, and with its own charter, when it engages in the process of zoning newly annexed land.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azeo\"><em>Id. </em>at 29, 526 A.2d at 968 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Chapter 450, Laws of 1988, added subsection (c)(2) to abrogate our holding in <em>Northeast </em>by making clear that county approval eliminated not only the five year limitation, but the change-mistake rule as well. There is, however, nothing in the changes made by Chapter 450 to indicate that the Legislature intended a change in its established position regarding consistency with a county\u2019s land use plan recommendation for annexed lands and thereby granting additional powers to annexing municipalities by redefining the meaning of \u201cmaster plan or plans\u201d to include, exclusively or otherwise, reference to the plan or plans of the annexing municipality. Given the history of the provision, such an interpretation would be cut from whole cloth and without support either in the language of the statute or its evolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">For example, the Floor Report of the Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee regarding H.B. 667, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">This bill addresses ... <em>Northeast ..., </em>which held that when a municipality rezones land as part of an annexation, a municipality must comply with the ... \u2018change/mistake rule\u2019.... Historically, the zoning of annexed property has been viewed as original zoning.... In 1975, the General Assembly passed legislation enabling a municipality to substantially alter the land use of annexed land with the express approval of the county....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In the course of proceedings leading to a favorable report by the Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee on the bill, the Attorney General, in a letter dated 18 March 1988, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">The bill is designed to overrule the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Northeast Plaza v. Town of North East, </em>310 Md. 20, 526 A.2d 963 (1987), which held that a municipality\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>power to rezone annexed land to a substantially different use was subject to the requirements of \u00a7 4.05(a) of Article 66B-the statutory embodiment of the \u201cchange or mistake rule\u201d for rezoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">As a result of House Bill 667, as amended, \u00a7 9(c) would establish two different regulations for municipal rezoning in annexed areas. If a county expressly approved the zoning change, the municipality would not have to show a change or mistake to rezone. If the county did not approve, the municipality would have to wait five years before it could change to a substantially different use in the annexed areas; and even after the five-year period, it would have to show a change or mistake, as provided in \u00a7 4.05(a) of Article 66B in order to rezone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We agree with the Attorney General. The proper interpretation of \u00a7 9(c) is that a municipality may not zone, for a five year period, newly annexed lands to a zone substantially different from the pre-annexation jurisdiction\u2019s plan recommendation, without the express approval of the pre-annexation jurisdiction. Where that approval is forthcoming, the municipality may zone without regard to the change-mistake rule, though it still must comply with the remaining provisions of Art. 66B and with its own local zoning ordinance. Where that approval is not forthcoming, the municipality must zone in compliance with the pre-annexation jurisdiction\u2019s plan and then wait five years before considering a substantially different zone, which zone will require, if a Euclidean zone, compliance with the change-mistake rule or, in the case of a floating or PUD zone, satisfaction of the applicable regulatory prerequisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">B.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">1.

In respect to the rule in effect at the time of <em>Montgomery County v. National Capital Realty Corp., </em>267 Md. 364, 374, 297 A.2d 675, 680-81 (1972), we quoted in that case extensively from 3 Rathkopf, <em>Zoning and Planning, </em>74-79:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">The general rule in these jurisdictions in which the validity of such covenants<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> has been litigated is that they are illegal. The basis of such rule is that the rezoning of a particular parcel of land upon conditions not imposed by the zoning ordinance generally in the particular district into which the land has been rezoned is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of \u201cspot zoning\u201d in its most maleficent aspect, is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan and is beyond the power of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Legislative bodies must rezone in accordance with a comprehensive plan, and in amending the ordinance so as to confer upon a particular parcel a particular district designation, it may not curtail or limit the uses and structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>placed or to be placed upon the lands so rezoned differently from those permitted upon other lands in the same district. Consequently, where there has been a concatinated rezoning and filing of a \u201cdeclaration of restrictions\u201d the general view (where the question has been litigated) is that both the zoning amendment and the restrictive covenant are invalid for the reasons expressed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">For additional cases discussing this older view in Maryland, see <em>Carole Highlands Citizens Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

The County Commissioners are not a Planning Board, nor have they a right to exact conditions, or promises of a particular use in return for deciding that the public interest justifies that an area should be zoned commercial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">... There seem to be three chief reasons for the rule stated in these cases: that rezoning based on offers or agreements with the owners disrupts the basic plan, and thus is subversive of the public policy reflected in the overall legislation, that the resulting \u2018contract\u2019 is nugatory because a municipality is not able to make agreements which inhibit its police powers, and that restrictions in a particular zone should not be left to extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">At the time <em>Wakefield, Baylis, </em>and <em>Carole Highlands </em>were decided, the sole State statutory authority granting zoning power to municipalities was found in Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, Sections 1-Grant of Power and 2-Districts. Section-2 provided, as relevant here, that \u201cAll such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout each district.... \u201d This provision is retained today, now codified as Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Subsequent to the <em>National Capital, Carole Highlands, Baylis, </em>and <em>Wakefield </em>cases, the Legislature, in 1970, enacted a new section 4.01 of Art. 66B, relevant to the issue before us, as a part of a general recodification. Chapter 672, Laws 1970 (Senate Bill 356). It granted to covered counties and municipal corporations the power to impose conditions upon rezoning. It, in effect, authorized \u201cconditional zoning\u201d in certain circumstances. It stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">(B) The local legislative body of a county or municipal corporation, upon the zoning or rezoning of any land ... may impose such additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations as may be deemed appropriate to preserve, improve, or protect the general character and design of the lands and improvements being zoned or rezoned, or of the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements, and may, upon the zoning or rezoning of any land or lands, retain or reserve the power and authority to approve or disapprove the design of buildings, construction, landscaping, or other improvements, alterations, and changes made or to be made on the subject land or lands to assure conformity with the intent and purpose of this article and of the jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance. The powers provided in 4.01(B) shall be applicable only if the local legislative body adopts an ordinance which shall include enforcement procedures and requirements for adequate notice of public hearings and conditions sought to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">These provisions remain the same to the present date, although rearranged as a part of another recodification in 2000. Section 4.01 was divided into several sections. Current subsection (c) (with its several subsections) contains the same provisions first enacted in 1970. Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.01(c). Accordingly, since at least 1970, Maryland has joined those states retreating from the across-the-board prohibition against conditional zoning, and, as a result, not all conditional zoning in Maryland is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">This conclusion is supported when the available legislative history is examined. In 1966, the General Assembly created a commission to examine the planning and zoning provisions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>to make recommendations. In 1969 the report was forwarded to the Legislature. As recommended, a new Art. 66B, Section 4.01, was to be created as a part of a general recodification of Maryland\u2019s planning and zoning provisions. Nevertheless, certain changes were intended to be substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Section 4.01 was clearly an intended substantive change to permit, so long as certain requirements were met, conditional zoning in those Maryland jurisdictions to -which Art. 66B applied, which, through the \u201czoning\u201d provisions of the Express Powers Act,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> applied to charter counties as well as municipalities. The recodification began with the Legislature creating the Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission. As we indicated, the Commission reported back to the Legislature in 1969. Accordingly, its recommendations were first considered in the 1970 Session.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In respect to the Commission, the records of the General Assembly reflect, in a document entitled REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF 1970 \u2014 PROPOSED BILLS-SPECIAL COMMITTEE REPORTS, VOLUME II, Minutes and Reports of Special Committees to the Legislative Council of Maryland, that the Commission report was presented on Wednesday, 12 November 1969, to the Legislative Council. It was described to the Council by the Study Commission Chairman, Senator Goodloe E. Byron, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">Under revised Article 66B, counties can have conditional zoning. Further, the Commission has attempted to provide for periodically updating of all plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">With the assistance of a research man, the Commission will prepare an analysis and .... a commentary explaining each change as revised Article 66B is in preparation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The report was referred, without change, to the Judiciary Committee. Whether Senator Byron misspoke when he mentioned only \u201ccounties,\u201d or did not realize that Art. 66B also applied to municipalities, or whether it was later decided not to limit its application to counties, is unclear. In any event, the analysis in the Commission\u2019s report made no distinction between counties and municipalities, nor did the resulting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">As did some of the commentators at the time, the Commission referred to the changing conception of the utility of conditional zoning. It stated, as relevant to the case <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\"><em>Paragraph 2 of Section 1.01 gives to the local legislative body the powers of \u201cconditional zoning. </em>\u201d <em>\u201cSince 1960, some courts have recognized that the attachment of conditions to zoning might be a highly desirable means of minimizing the adverse effects of zoning changes. Their decisions reveal a tendency to inject needed flexibility into the American zoning system.\u201d Shapiro, R.: The Case for Conditional Zoning </em>41 Temple L.Q. 267 (1968) at 287. <em>\u201cA distinction should be made between this type of zoning and that commonly referred to as contract zoning. \u201d The latter type of zoning was discussed in Baylis v. City of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429 (1959) <em>where \u201cthe ordinance made the reclassification conditional upon the execution of an agreement. </em>\u201d <em>Yokley clarifies this distinction in his commentary on Church v. Town of Islip, </em>8 N.Y.2d 254, 203 N.Y.S.2d 866, 168 N.E.2d 680 (1960), <em>where he concludes that'though \u201ccontract zoning will not be permitted, conditional zoning may be valid if not bargained for in the sense that zoning is granted in return for the condition. </em>\u201d 2 Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice (3rd edition 1965) 19-11. <em>Therefore, under conditional zoning the usual requirements for reclassification must be met before the powers enunciated in this section are available to the local legislative body. It is believed that this provision avoids previous constitutional pitfalls but still permits the planning commission to provide for the orderly development using controls similar to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>those already found in the subdivision regulations (Section 5.00). Several variations of this provision already exist at the local level, such as the Carroll and Frederick County provisions </em>.... (emphasis and quotations in the original. <em>See </em>Final Report-Legislative Recommendations, Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission, December, 1969, at 28-29.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">It is clear that conditional zoning is not prohibited in Maryland if local governments comply with the statutory requirements of Section 4.01. Article 66B applies to non-charter/home rule counties and to municipal corporations. Charter counties, should they choose to implement it, likewise have the power to do whatever is permitted under Art. 66B. Contrary to the argument advanced by the Dissent, it is also clear that allowing conditional zoning to limit otherwise permissible uses was not the intention, either of the Commission, or of the statutes as subsequently adopted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Commentary Notes of the Commission clearly state that <em>\u201cunder conditional zoning the usual requirements for reclassification must be met before the powers enunciated in this section are available to the local legislative body. It is believed that this provision avoids previous constitutional pitfalls but still permits the planning commission to provide for the orderly development using controls similar to those already found in the subdivision regulations (Section 5.00).\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original). This language indicates that the intent was to allow jurisdictions to fashion supplementary conditions in the placement of a given property in a Euclidean zone, not in derogation of the uses allowed in that zone. Corresponding to this language in the Commission\u2019s Report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the powers retained, by the zoning authority after zoning are clearly set forth in Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01. The statute now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">On the zoning or rezoning of any land, a local legislative body may retain or reserve the power to approve or disapprove the <em>design </em>of buildings, construction, landscaping or other improvements, alteration and changes made or to be made on the land being zoned or rezoned to assure conformity with the intent and purpose of this article and of the local jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">These powers to control design, layout, siting, and appearance are similar to those powers governing subdivisions, found in Article 66B, \u00a7 .5.03. Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01 provides that it is permissible to impose those conditions \u201cappropriate to preserve, improve, or protect the <em>general character and design of the lands and improvements </em>being zoned or rezoned, or the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements.\u201d (emphasis added). The statute says nothing about utilizing conditions to limit permissible \u201cuses,\u201d and therefore grants no such power. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly pointed out in <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 574, 582-83, 501 A.2d 489, 492-93(1985), conditional zoning which acts as a limitation as to otherwise permissible uses is not permitted under Art. 66B. Furthermore, municipal zoning authorities are not permitted under Art., 66B to enter into contracts which inhibit the proper exercise of the municipality\u2019s governmental powers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The Court of Special Appeals in its opinion in the present case was correct in relying upon <em>Rodriguez v. Prince George\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>County, </em>79 Md.App. 537, 558 A.2d 742 (1989). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the Court of Special Appeals found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">The applicant was offering a deal to the District Council: in order to induce the Council to approve its application for reclassification, the applicant would agree in advance to exclude from the scope of the approval certain uses expressly permitted in the approved zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">79 Md.App. at 553, 558 A.2d at 750. In response, the court in <em>Rodriguez </em>held that \u201c[although there appears to be no impediment to an applicant entering into private covenants with other parties to lessen their opposition to an application, or to garner their support for it, such offerings cannot be made to the legislative body authorized to grant or deny the application.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Although the reasoning in <em>Rodriguez </em>is apt to apply in the case at bar, a better predicate exists in <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019s of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 574, 582-83, 501 A.2d 489, 492-93(1985). <em>Holtz </em>involved the rezoning of a tract of land by the Board of County Commissioners of Washington County. As a condition of the rezoning, the Commissioners imposed restrictions prohibiting uses otherwise permitted under the zoning granted. In holding that the action of the Commissioners constituted illegal conditional zoning, the intermediate appellate court was required to interpret Art. 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 4.01(a) and (b) and 4.02, holding that \u201c[o]ur reading of \u00a7 4.01 (a) and (b) leads us to conclude that it does not authorize conditional use rezoning. This is further bolstered by the requirements of \u00a7 4.02.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 501 A.2d at 493. We adopt that interpretation insofar as Euclidean zones are concerned. The court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">Section 4.01(b) permits local legislative bodies to impose \u201cadditional restrictions, conditions or limitations\u201d on the design and construction of buildings and landscaping on the subject or adjacent tract. The plain meaning of this subsection is clear. The language referring to \u201crestrictions, conditions, and limitations\u201d applies only to the structural and architectural character of the land and the improvements thereon. \u201cConditions, restrictions or limitations\u201d on use are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>neither explicitly provided for in this subsection nor can they be implied therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 582, 501 A.2d at 492. The Court then noted that this interpretation was dictated by the language of \u00a7 4.02, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">Section 4.02 requires uniformity within the class or development in a district. Hence, it necessarily prohibits conditional use zoning. The allowance of conditional use rezoning by appellant flies directly in the face of this section and the mandated uniformity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">Section 4.02 must be construed in relation to \u00a7 4.01. Under the broad grant of power to (re)zone conferred under \u00a7 4.01(a), the local legislative body is permitted under \u00a7 4.02 to divide the county into divisible components, provided there is uniformity within those districts. The regulations and restrictions that must be uniform include the use of buildings and land. Hence, where, as here, the legislative body has predetermined the acceptable categories of uses in a given district, to conditionally restrict some of those uses violates the mandate of \u00a7 4.02. If we were to authorize the Board of County Commissioners through rezoning to limit or restrict the permitted uses of certain tracts within a zone, the Board would have the power to destroy the uniformity of that district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">65 Md.App. at 583, 501 A.2d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The dissenting opinion (Dissent, op. at 597-98) brushes aside the import of \u00a7 4.02, forgetting the very rules of statutory construction in whose name it laments. It bears repeating (see <em>supra </em>at 551) that in <em>Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exchange, Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 316-18, 799 A.2d 1264, 1271-72 (2002), we instructed, citing <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">We have acknowledged that, in ascertaining a statute\u2019s meaning, we must consider the context in which a statute appears. In this regard we have instructed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">When the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in that context. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>means that, when interpreting any statute, the statute as a whole must be construed, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. Thus, statutes on the same subject are to be read together and harmonized to the extent possible, reading them so as to avoid rendering either of them, or any portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory, (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Contrary to the assertions of the Dissent here (Dissent, op. at 607-10), the reasoning in <em>Manny Holtz </em>reflects the analysis required by the principles of statutory interpretation overlooked by the Dissent. Unlike the Dissent here, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Manny Holtz </em>recognized that \u00a7 4.02 remained unchanged by the Legislature, and that, had the Legislature intended the reach of conditional zoning to include uses, amendments to the uniformity requirements of \u00a7 4.02 would be required. <em>See, e.g. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Collington Corp. Center I Ltd. P\u2019ship., </em>358 Md. 296, 303, 747 A.2d 1219, 1222 (2000). Because the Legislature did not amend \u00a7 4.02, <em>Manny Holtz </em>correctly declined to extend the authority to zone with conditions to include uses where there existed no indication of such an intent on the part of the Legislature.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Planning Staff of the City, in its final report on the appropriate zone for the subject property upon annexation, noted that the Land Use Plan component of the City\u2019s 1993 Master Plan recommended service industrial uses for the subject property, consistent with uses permitted in the City\u2019s I-1 zone. Thus, at least facially, the imposition of the I-1 zone was consistent with the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Plan. Upon a further examination of the City\u2019s I-1 zone, however, one notes there are a number of commercial retail uses also permitted, as a matter of right. See n. 1, <em>supra. </em>Gasoline service stations, however, are only allowed in the I-1 zone with the grant of a special exception. It is because the City endeavors to foreclose, by limitation pertaining only to the subject property of this case, all of the otherwise permitted commercial retail uses, and impliedly those commercial retail uses, other than a gasoline service station, allowed by special exception, in the I-1 Zone that we hold City Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99 to be impermissible conditional zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in its opinion in this case, correctly noted as irrelevant the fact that the condition pertinent to this case was explicit only in the annexation agreement. City Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99 makes reference to the annexation agreement containing the land use limitation. That iS'sufficient to indicate that Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99 was passed with the intended legal effect that the use condition limit the 1-1 zone granted. <em>Carole Highlands, </em>222 Md. at 46-48, 158 A.2d at 664-66. As the Court of Special Appeals further pointed out, \u201c[t]he fact that the implicit conditions in the [zoning] ordinance were made explicit in the annexation agreement does not make them solely a part of that agreement.\u201d The court continued by observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">although municipalities are authorized to enter into annexation agreements that zone a subject property, they may not exercise that authority in a manner that violates the prohibitions set forth in Article 66B \u00a7 4.01 The applicants in <em>Rodriguez </em>offered to limit the permissible uses of the subject property in order to induce the council\u2019s approval of their application [citation omitted]. Here, the Mayor and Council eliminated all but one of the permissible retail uses of the subject property to accommodate Mr. Fanaroffs efforts to have a gas station. The effect in both cases is the formation of a distinct mini-district that undermines uniformity. (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 4.01 of Art. 66B, Rockville has enacted within its zoning ordinance only one provision to implement the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>power to zone with conditions, although in a form substantially different than the Prince George\u2019s County ordinance construed in <em>Rodriguez, </em>and then only in the context of the grant of \u201clocal amendment applications.\u201d That ordinance provision, now codified as Rockville City Code, Chp. 25 (Zoning and Planning), Article III (Amendments), Division 2 (Map Amendments), \u00a7 25-126 (Supplement 2002), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cSec. 25-126. Grant of local amendment application with conditions-Authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">The Council may impose additional restrictions, conditions or limitations upon the grant of any application for a local amendment to the zoning map pursuant to the authority contained in State law. (Rockville, Md., Code of Ordinances ch. 25, art. III, div. 2, \u00a7 25-126 (2002))</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The Dissent (Dissent, op. at 611, n. 17 and 634) seems to concede, as it must, that the City\u2019s act of zoning of the subject property at the time of annexation was an act of original zoning, insofar as the initial exercise of the municipality\u2019s zoning power is concerned.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In fact, Rockville City Code, Ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>25, Art. III, Div. 1 (Amendments\u2014\u201cGenerally\u201d), \u00a7 25-99, defines such zoning as original zoning. Further, \u00a7 25-99(c) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he provisions of <em>division 2 </em>[Map Amendments] of this article [III] shall not apply to procedures under this section [original zoning].\u201d (emphasis added). The section relied upon by the City, the Owners, and the Dissent to support the City\u2019s invocation of the conditional zoning power authorized by Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.01, \u00a7 25-126, is contained in <em>division 2. </em>Thus, it appears that the City does not purport, in acts of original zoning, to possess the authority to attach conditions of any kind, even if such were authorized by State law. Rockville City Code, \u00a7 25-126 applies only to local amendment applications, i.e., piecemeal zoning (Rockville, Md., Code of Ordinances Ch. 25, Art. III, Div. 2, \u00a7 25-116 (2002)), and does not apply to cases of original zoning upon annexation.(Rockville, Md., Code of Ordinances Ch. 25, Art. III, Div. 1, \u00a7 25-99(c)(2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Under our reasoning, however, it makes no difference how the City\u2019s action is characterized, piecemeal zoning (\u201clocal map amendment\u201d) or original zoning, because there is no grant of authority from the State for conditional use zoning.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The Dissent\u2019s focus on the language of municipal ordinances in its discussion of this and prior cases, such as <em>Rodriguez </em>(Dissent, op. at 604-06), in the absence of a grant of authority for imposing conditional use zoning from the State, places the statutory cart before the horse.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Absent a grant of authority from the State, the language of a local ordinance is irrelevant and therefore interpreting a local ordinance as properly authorizing conditional <em>use </em>zoning would be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Accordingly, we answer the first question posed in Petitioners\u2019 original briefs: \u201cDoes a limitation in an annexation agreement restricting certain uses on newly annexed property constitute conditional zoning?\u201d by saying \u201cyes\u201d; and, under the circumstances here present, such conditional zoning is impermissible conditional use zoning. While by this holding we make clear that any conditional use zoning is impermissible, we note also that, on the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is impermissible contract zoning as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In the case of <em>Attman/Glazer, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF8\">the mayor and alderman could not by agreement lawfully bind themselves to a future zoning or conditional use decision. We do so on the familiar premise that a municipality may not contract away the exercise of its zoning powers. <em>Baylis v.

This position was revisited recently by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Beachwood, </em>where the court noted that Maryland\u2019s treatment of contract zoning is consistent with the definition of \u201cillegal contract zoning\u201d set out in Arden H. Rathkopf and Daren A. Rathkopf, 2 <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 29A.03[b] at 29A-25, which the court quoted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">Illegal contract rezoning is said to involve the process by which a' local government enters into an agreement with a developer whereby the government exacts a performance or promise from the developer in exchange for its agreement to rezone the property. The developer may agree to restrict development of the property, make certain improvements, dedicate a portion of land to the municipality, or make payments to the municipality. Numerous state court decisions have held such express or implied agreement invalid as illegal contact zoning.

Additionally, we reiterate that in <em>Rodriguez, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201c[although there appears to be no impediment to an applicant entering into private covenants with other parties to lessen their opposition to an application, or to garner their support for it, such offerings cannot be made to the legislative body authorized to grant or deny the application.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>79 Md App. at 553, 558 A.2d at 750.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Upon examination of the record in the present case, it is clear that the City\u2019s action represents not only impermissible conditional use zoning, but- also impermissible contract zoning. The act of zoning was accomplished through the passage of City Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99, which, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>WHEREAS, the [County Council\u2019s Planning, Housing and Economic Development] Committee agreed to support rezoning of the site from the County\u2019s I-2 zone to the City\u2019s I-1 zone under certain conditions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2N\">WHEREAS, on February 23, 1999, the District [County] Council reviewed Annexation Petition ANX97-0124 and agreed with the comments and recommendations of the Planning, Housing and Economic Development Committee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 14-57, the County Council for Montgomery County, sitting as a District Council, approved City of Rockville Annexation Petition No. ANX970124, and its rezoning from the County\u2019s I-2 zone to the City\u2019s I-1 zone, under certain conditions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As0\">WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of Rockville, having fully considered the matter, has determined to place the annexed property in the City\u2019s I-1 zone, under certain conditions to be set forth in an annexation agreement, so as to promote the health, security and geneial welfare of the community of the City of Rockville.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As was pointed out <em>supra, </em>this language alone, referencing the use limiting conditions contained in the annexation agreement as a basis for the zoning action, is sufficient, in our view, to make this a case of impermissible conditional use zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">When we look to the annexation agreement, we note that the agreement is \u201cby and between Louis H. Fanaroff, surviving tenant by the entirety of a one-half interest in the subject property, Stanford C. Steppa and Elaine B. Steppa, hereinafter collectively called \u2018Owners,\u2019 and \u2018The Mayor and Council of Rockville, Maryland.. .. \u2019 This is the same \u2018Mayor and Council of Rockville, Maryland,\u2019 that passed Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99. Therefore, the Owners made a contract, containing an illegal condition, with the legislative body authorized to grant or deny the desired I-1 zone, making this a case of impermissible contract zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">It matters not whether the agreement was a part of the zoning or annexation processes. Our appellate cases consistently have held that it is the identity of the contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>parties that is the critical issue. As the Court of Special Appeals made clear in <em>Beachwood:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">The Maryland cases have treated \u201ccontract zoning\u201d narrowly as a situation wherein the developer of property enters into an express and legally binding contract with the ultimate zoning authority. In such circumstances, the Maryland cases have not hesitated to hold such contact zoning to be null and void. Part of the reason why the governmental authority may not enter into such a contract is because the governmental unit may not bargain away its future use of the police power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Beachwood, </em>107 Md.App. at 668-69, 670 A.2d at 505. <em>See also Attman/Glazer, </em>314 Md. at 686-87, 552 A.2d at 1283-84. On the facts of this case, the zoning of the subject property by the City of Rockville involved the placement of use limitations on the zoning which constituted impermissible conditional use zoning, and the mechanism used by the City of Rockville to place those impermissible conditions on the property further constituted impermissible contract zoning.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">What zoning classification, if any, would the subject property have if the Court were to rule that the 1-1 zoning was invalid? Is there a state or city statute covering the situation?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Having determined that the actions of the City of Rockville in zoning the land to the City\u2019s I-1 zone were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>improper, it remains to be determined what then is the current zoning classification of the subject property.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Our reading of the relevant statutes and case law indicates that the subject property retains the zoning classification it enjoyed prior to annexation, at least until such time as the City of Rockville acts properly to rezone it if it remains a part of the City. The Owners, the City of Rockville, and Rylyns, urge that the land be declared \u201cunzoned\u201d until further zoning action is taken by the City of Rockville.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we find this position unpersuasive and not supported by the statutes or our prior holdings in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The essential underpinning of their arguments is that the language of Art. 23A \u00a7 9(c)(1) provides, in part, that \u201cwhere any area is annexed to a municipality authorized to have and having then a planning and zoning authority, the municipality shall have exclusive jurisdiction over planning and zoning and subdivision control within the area annexed!.]\u201d Similar language appears in Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 23A, \u00a7 19. Apparently these parties feel that the foregoing statutory provisions dictate that the property will remain unzoned until Rockville takes action necessary to zone it properly, in compliance with Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c)(1) &amp; (2), because only Rock-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ville is empowered by statute to make a zoning determination now that it has annexed the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The parties attempt to bolster this argument by citing to our cases interpreting these statutory provisions and upholding the proposition that a county\u2019s zoning ordinances and regulations previously applicable to a property will have no effect on it once the area is annexed by a municipality authorized to have, and in fact having, planning and zoning authority, such as Rockville. <em>See Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 557-58, 325 A.2d 748, 753 (1974); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Mayor and City Council of Laurel, 262 </em>Md. 171, 190, 277 A.2d 262, 272 (1971); <em>Beshore v. Town of Bel Air, </em>237 Md. 398, 410-11, 206 A.2d 678, 685 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"ALj\">The argument is not compelling because it fails to recognize that the exclusive municipal powers to zone set forth in the relevant statutes are limited at the threshold by Art. 23A, \u00a7 9 and, when read together with other relevant statutes, a condition of \u201cunzoned\u201d land is not contemplated. Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">if the county expressly approves, the municipality, without regard to the provisions of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.05(a) of the Code, [the change-mistake rule], may place the annexed land in a zoning classification that permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or general plan of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">As set forth persuasively in the <em>Amici </em>briefs of the six counties and the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, \u00a7 9(c)(2) \u201cclearly sets forth the legislature\u2019s intention to relieve municipalities from the requirement of proving change/mistake to permit a land use substantially, different from the use for the land specified in the Master Plan applicable to the property prior to annexation <em>if </em>the municipality receives express county approval. The logical conclusion based on the plain language of this section is that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>express county approval is not received, then, after the five-year limitation period, the municipality must prove change/mistake,\u201d unless the municipality rezones the newly annexed piece of land to a floating zone or as a part of a comprehensive rezoning of a larger surrounding area. For the change/mistake rule to be relevant, and the statute makes clear that it is, then some form of prior zoning would have to be in effect, and as the statute clearly indicates, that zoning is the one assigned by the pre-annexation jurisdiction, which in this case is that of Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Nowhere does the relevant statutory scheme provide that an annexing jurisdiction\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 9 results in the property becoming akin to a \u201cstateless person\u201d for zoning purposes. On the contrary, as we stated in <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. May- or and Council of Rockville, </em>272 Md. at 561, 325 A.2d at 754, the whole purpose of this section is to \u201cpreserve the integrity of the Master Plan adopted by the jurisdiction ... having planning power immediately prior to annexation.\u201d Were we to find that the land became a zoning cipher, the five-year limitation under \u00a7 9 would be toothless and meaningless, as it would allow municipalities to undo indirectly that which they cannot accomplish directly. We think that this was not the intent of the Legislature. The language of \u00a7 9 clearly indicates that it is intended that the pre-annexation zoning remain in effect until: 1) the annexing municipality grants a new zone substantially consistent with the pertinent plan recommendation of the pre-annexation jurisdiction; or 2) the pre-annexation jurisdiction grants permission for the annexing municipality to establish a substantially inconsistent zone; or 8) the five year period expires. <em>Id.

A plan that is written purely as a static blueprint for future development will rapidly become obsolete when circumstances change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">Third, the plan must be based upon a determination of present and projected conditions within the area covered by the plan.

The local legislative body that makes zoning decisions divides districts within the locality into zones, and the legislative body defines, <em>inter alia, </em>the height, building size, lot size, population density, location, and use of buildings that are permissible in the particular zone.

In those states, the courts have been willing to divine a plan from the zoning ordinance itself.

This device is the creation of special use districts for these various uses, which at the time are unlocated districts, but which can be located by a petition of a property owner desiring to develop his specific tract for any of these special uses. Such unlocated special zoning districts are popularly referred to as 'floating zones,\u2019 in that they float over the entire municipality until by application of a property owner one of these special zones descends upon his land thereby reclassifying it for the special use. The zoning ordinance is carefully drawn so as to impose restrictive use limitation upon the owner in these special use zones in order to protect the adjoining residential areas. Usually there is a minimum lot requirement with large set-back restrictions for the structures, both from the streets and from the adjoining residences. Also in the case of light industry, limitations exist as to architecture of the buildings with requirements as to landscaping.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Professor Reno pointed out (pp. 118-19-20) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">In both the <em>Rodgers </em>case <em>[Rodgers v.

Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>214 Md. 48, 133 A.2d 83 (1957)] there was a complete system of established use districts covering the entire municipal area, with a single floating zone for a specialized use superimposed upon these established districts. Thus, in both cases where the floating zone device was upheld, there existed a comprehensive zoning plan for the municipality to which the floating zone was merely a special exception applicable to the entire plan, analogous to special exceptions applicable to individual zones. This raises the question as to whether the legality of the floating zone device is dependent upon the existence of an established Euclidean zoning system over which the floating zone is superimposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">From these cases we can conclude that the most liberal courts still interpret the zoning power to mean Euclidean zoning with the creation of established territorial use districts. The advent of the floating device creates a supplementary device similar to the special exception to give greater flexibility to the established use districts but cannot be used as a substitute for the accepted method of Euclidean zoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In order to prevent floating zones from becoming a tool with which to circumvent tire prohibition on illegal forms of conditional and spot zoning, we consistently have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">... the floating zone is subject to the same conditions that apply to safeguard the granting of special exceptions, i.e., the use must be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, it must further the purposes of the proposed reclassification, and special precautions are to be applied to insure that there will be no discordance with existing uses. These precautions include such restrictions as building location and style, the percentage of the area covered by the building, minimum green area, minimum and maximum area of the use, minimum setback from streets and other uses, requirement that a site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>plan be approved, and a provision for revocation of the classification if the specified restrictions are not complied with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>See also Bigenho v.

In <em>City of Gaithersburg v.

Chapter 116 was first introduced as House Bill 83 at the 1971 session of the General Assembly. After passing the House, it was read for the first time in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Judicial Proceedings. Throughout this stage, the bill\u2019s title provided in part (Journal of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland, Regular Session 1971, p. 146):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\"... to provide that a municipal corporation having planning and zoning authority shall assume exclusive jurisdiction over planning and zoning within an area annexed five years after the area is finally annexed by it over which the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission had jurisdiction prior to the annexation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, however, deleted the reference in the title to the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and re-wrot\u00e9 the title as follows (Senate Journal, <em>supra, </em>p. 1227):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\"to provide that no municipal corporation annexing land may, for a period of five years following annexation, place such land in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for such land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plan of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over such land prior to its annexation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The Committee's amendment was adopted, and the bill was finally enacted in that form. Senate Journal, <em>supra, </em>pp. 1260-1261, 1356, 1400, 1474-1475; Journal of Proceedings of the House of Delegates of Maryland, Regular Session 1971, pp.1976, 2156-2157. This action, re-writing the title and deleting the reference to areas \u201cover which the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission had jurisdiction prior to annexation,\u201d suggests a realization by the General Assembly that Art. XI-E of the Constitution required that the Act apply to all municipalities in the State. This legislative intent, disclosed by the title of Chapter 116, confirms the scope of the language of the Act itself. It is \u201cwell settled\u201d that \u201cthe title of an act is relevant to ascertainment of its intent and purpose....\u201d <em>MTA v. Balto. Co. Revenue Auth., </em>267 Md. 687, 695-696, 298 A.2d 413 (1973). In sum, principles of statutory construction, the language of Article 23A, \u00a7 9 as amended by Chapter 116 of the Laws of Maryland 1971, and the legislative history of the amendment, all lead to the conclusion that the enactment is a limitation upon the home rule powers of <em>all </em>municipalities subject to Art.

As we explained in some detail, <em>supra, </em>the purpose of the uniformity requirement is not to make development on every property in the zone look the same.

The Dissent erroneously conflates original zoning with the ''piecemeal\u201d rezoning process (Dissent, op. at 611-14). Worse, it implies (without benefit of citation to a location in the Majority opinion where such may be found) that the Majority mis-labels the City's zoning act as a \"comprehensive rezoning\u201d (Dissent, op. at 611, n. 17). Neither assertion is grounded in fact or law</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The City\u2019s piecemeal rezoning process for a single tract of property is, as described in Ch. 25, Art. III, Div. 2 \u00a7 116(1) of the City Code of Ordinances, the \"local amendment\u201d process. The procedure and standards for the processing and action on a local amendment application are prescribed in Divisions 1 and 2 of Article III. Within that framework, and specifically at \u00a7 25- 99, it is made clear, as noted <em>supra, </em>that the provisions of Division 2 governing local amendment applications do not apply to original zoning of land annexed to the City. It is also evident, from an examination of the record in this case, that the Owners did not apply for a local amendment, as that term and process are given substance by the City ordinance, but rather availed themselves of the process to seek original zoning at annexation as governed by \u00a7 25-99 and Articles 23A and 66B of the Md.Code. Accordingly, tire Dissent\u2019s characterization of the City\u2019s zoning of the subject property as having been accomplished through a piecemeal or local amendment process is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>At no place in the Majority opinion is the City\u2019s act of zoning in this case described as a \"comprehensive rezoning.\u201d This is merely a strawman constructed by the Dissent so it would have something to pounce on, in lieu of coming to grips with the actual attributions made in the Majority opinion. No one would describe the City\u2019s action in zoning the subject property as a comprehensive rezoning, given the definition of that term explained <em>supra, </em>at 535-38, and in \u00a7 25-116(3) of the City Ordinance (a \"comprehensive\u201d zoning amendment is defined as \"covering the entire City\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. Municipalities wield only such zoning powers as are granted to them by the Legislature. Here, the Legislature has specifically limited that power. In those cases where approval to the contrary is not forthcoming from the pre-annexation authority, the Legislature has dictated that the annexing municipality\u2019s initial zoning of the annexed property be in compliance with the pre-annexation jurisdiction\u2019s plan. As a result, despite the fact that the annexing jurisdiction is not free to zone the annexed property as it chooses, its initial act of zoning, though in conformity with the pre-annexation jurisdiction\u2019s plan, is an act of original zoning, as the Dissent concedes. As a result of this fact, dictated by the Legislature, the zoning which may occur after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>running of the five year period would be an act of piecemeal zoning, unless it is part of a greater comprehensive rezoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">.

The conditions in question in <em>Collington </em>were not imposed by Prince George's County as required pre-conditions for zoning, nor were they a part of an instance of impermissible contract zoning. Rather, they were limitations voluntarily placed on the property by a prior property owner as a part of his prior zoning approval. 358 Md. at 302 n. 4, 307, 747 A.2d at 1222 n. 4., 1224.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">.

The reasoning and holding of this opinion with regard to the impermissible contract zoning presented by this case should not be read to cast wider doubt on the traditional and legitimate contractual undertakings customarily entered into between a property owner desiring to be annexed and a municipality desiring to annex. It is normal for such parties to express in writing certain executory accords, for which they have bargained, governing the anticipated annexation, including the zoning to be assigned at the time of annexation. As long as the portions of such agreements relative to the anticipatory zoning action do not violate other legal requirements, such as the prohibition against conditional use zoning in the present case, the practice of entering into annexation contracts is otherwise unaffected by this holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">.

The majority essentially asserts that the enabling act that authorizes local governmental entities to pass statutes permitting \u201cconditional zoning,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was designed to permit only those conditions that would not result in limiting the uses that are otherwise permitted in a new classification.

As we pointed out in <em>Attman </em>.... \u201d <em>Attman </em>does not support the present position of the majority. Nor does it support the relevant parts of <em>Manny Holtz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <em>Manny Holtz </em>offers no precedential support, at this level, for the position of the majority. As I shall indicate, there is absolutely no prior support for the majority\u2019s position that the conditional zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>permitted by the statutes cannot be used during classifications to apply limitations on uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The majority also states in respect to the charter amendment issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201cAlthough we shall conclude that no rational argument can be made to suggest that the language in Art. 23A, \u00a7 9(c)(1) refers to plans other than those of the pre-annexation zoning authority, a plain meaning approach does not yield this conclusion as the ready answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In my view, it is sophistry to posit that a contrary rational argument cannot be made to the majority\u2019s position, and in the same breath admit that the plain meaning of the language of the statute does not support the majority\u2019s position. On top of that, the majority also states that: \u201cThe language of the clause is arguably ambiguous. As written there are two possible plain meaning interpretations of the language.\u201d Both statements are, in my view, clearly wrong. The position of the majority depends on what the word \u201cor\u201d is. In this respect, in my view, the majority adopts a \u2018Clintonism\u2019 of the highest order.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">I. Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">I first address the conditional zoning issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Part A. Conditional zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">The majority, in essence, states that to hold that the statute permits limitations as to uses, would adversely affect the uniformity or consistency of uses within a classification that is required, generally. I fail to perceive, utterly, how limiting a use, so long as the use to which the property is limited is a use otherwise permitted in a district, affects the uniformity of a district.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The history of the conditional zoning law of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>state, prior to the enactment of the enabling act that permitted conditional zoning, is directly and completely contrary to the majority\u2019s position as to use conditions. The prior conditional zoning cases exclusively involved instances where the conditions related to use limitations. It was exactly those cases, where the Court had disapproved conditional zoning as to uses, that caused the 1968-69 Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission (Commission) to recommend to the Legislature, and the Legislature to adopt, the enabling act permitting conditional zoning. If the prohibition on conditional zoning relating to limitations on uses was intended to survive the 1970 amendment and remain a prohibited practice because it adversely affected \u201cuniformity\u201d requirements within the districts, the 1970 amendment is completely meaningless. The pre-existing case law already so provided. Additionally, in Maryland, conditional zoning in respect to use limitations was what had been, <em>and the only thing that had expressly been, </em>prohibited by the prior Maryland cases. Nothing in the case law prior to the passage of the 1970 enabling act, or in the legislative history of the act, supports the position of the majority, that the intent of the Commission, and ultimately the Legislature, was to permit conditional zoning only as it relates to non-use matters. That is what the law already provided. There is absolutely no pre 1970 legal authority in Maryland for the position the majority now takes. The Maryland cases prior to that point in time relating to conditional zoning generally involved conditions as to uses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Although there was a suggestion of conditional zoning in the earlier <em>Wakefield </em>case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the earliest \u201cconditional zoning\u201d case, certainly the most cited (and quoted) conditional use case in Maryland, appears to have been the case of <em>Baylis v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429 (1959), although it can also be argued, as the majority posits, that it was a case of contract zoning. In reality, it was both.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Property owners sought to have their property in Baltimore City rezoned to a classification that would permit the property to be used as a \u201cfuneral home or undertaking establishment.\u201d The then current classification of the property in the district in which it was situated prior to the reclassification did not permit funeral homes. The local Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals recommended approval of the reclassification provided that certain restrictions be placed on the use of the property in the new district classification that limited its use to a funeral home. This recommendation was, in essence, a recommendation for conditional zoning imposing a limitation on <em>use </em>\u2014 not a yard type limitation. The Planning Commission recommended disapproval for several reasons, including that an ordinance that permitted reclassification, but only by restricting the property to funeral home use, would be \u201cspecial privilege legislation\u201d and that \u201clegislation should not be based upon trades or conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The ordinance that was subsequently adopted, while reclassifying the property, required as a condition that the property owners enter into a recordable agreement (such an agreement under certain circumstances might also be characterized as contract zoning), creating use restrictions running with the land that , bound the owners and their successors to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>property only as a funeral home. Such a restriction, required by governmental officials, limiting uses is conditional zoning however it is created, either by contract or by it being simply imposed. Thus, in <em>Baylis, </em>the provision constituted both contract and conditional zoning. The condition at issue in <em>Baylis </em>was clearly a condition as to uses, as opposed to other types of conditions, <em>i.e., </em>yard, height, density, etc. (commonly in variance law referred to as \u201cyard variances\u201d). The agreement was also to provide that at any time the property ceased to be used as a funeral home, it would revert back to its previous classification. The conditions attached to the rezoning were attacked as <em>ultra vires. </em>We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cThere is authority to the effect that reasonable conditions and restrictions may be imposed by a board in connection with a special exception or variance, at least where the power to do so is express, or may fairly be implied.... But these considerations disappear when we deal with a reclassification involving a revision of the comprehensive plan and a change in the district or zone by the legislative body.... Moreover, the Council, under the Enabling Act and Ordinance, has set up districts for Residential Uses, and First Commercial Uses. <em>If it were permitted in special cases to allow inconsistent uses in such districts, it would destroy the uniformity required by Sec. 2 of the Enabling Act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201c... [tjhere seem to be three chief reasons for the rule stated in these cases:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that rezoning based on offers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>agreements with the owners disrupts the basic plan, and thus is subversive of the public policy reflected in the overall legislation, that the resulting \u2018contract\u2019 is nugatory because a municipality is not able to make agreements which inhibit its police powers, and that restrictions in a particular zone should not be left to extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cIn terms of zoning, the primary objection is the effect of permitting additional districts which have little or nothing in common and are unlike the basic zones.\u201d <em>Baylis, </em>219 Md. at 168-70, 148 A.2d at 432-33. [Emphasis added.] [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Accordingly, <em>Baylis </em>is the first Maryland case that involved conditional zoning; it involved conditions as to <em>uses </em>\u2014 \u201cincon<em>sistent uses.\u201d </em>The problems the <em>Baylis </em>Court discussed as resulting from conditional uses, are, in all relevant aspects, similar to the problems the majority discusses- in the case at bar. <em>Baylis </em>can be said to stand for the proposition the majority adopts today. If the subsequent statute authorizing conditional zoning had never been passed, the majority\u2019s position here might be precedentially correct. However, by adopting the pre 1970 law in spite of the 1970 statute, the majority is resurrecting a dinosaur.</p>\n<p id=\"Atp\">The 1968-1970 Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission, in making its recommendations to the Legislature that ultimately resulted in the current statutory authorization for local governments to conditionally zone, was fully aware of the application of conditional zoning to \u201cuses.\u201d In fact, the only Maryland case mentioned in the Commission\u2019s report, albeit in its' contract zoning aspect, was <em>Baylis, </em>the then seminal case in respect to conditional zoning as to uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Just a year after <em>Baylis, Rose v. Paape, </em>221 Md. 369, 157 A.2d 618 (1960), became the second case in Maryland to squarely address, and then reject, the concept of conditional zoning in the pre 1970\u2019s era. The Court there described the proposed rezoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201c[T]he Board undertook to make the rezoning of the appellants\u2019 strip along the east, south and west sides of Rose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Haven Harbor conditional upon (a) the approval of counsel for the objectors and (b) a limitation of the uses which would otherwise be permissible under a Light Commercial classification. The latter condition was also sought to be made applicable to the harbor itself, whether that was sought to be done as a matter of original zoning or as a matter of rezoning.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>221 Md. at 376, 157 A.2d at 622.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArM\">We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cZoning powers in Anne Arundel County are derived partly from Ch. 388 of the Acts of 1947, as amended, and partly from \u00a7\u00a7 10-37 Article 66-B of the Code of Public General Laws (1957 Ed.). In neither of them ... do we find any power vested in the Board to attach special conditions to resolutions rezoning properties from one classification to another, or establishing original zoning, which are not applicable generally to all properties in the given classification in which the property in question may be placed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 157 A.2d at 621-22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>Rose, </em>as is evident in its conditional zoning aspect, concerned \u201cuse\u201d limitations or conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\"><em>Pressman v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>222 Md. 330, 160 A.2d 379 (1960), involved several rezonings to new classifications that would permit the construction of shopping centers. In respect to some of the reclassifications we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJJ\">\u201cTwo of them ... dealing with Tract One were approved by the Planning Commission on condition that Food Fair and Stewart\u2019s enter into an agreement [contract zoning] with the City relating thereto.... The Agreement itself recites that its execution was a condition to the approval of the Commission. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cThese ordinances ... were passed in April, 1959.... None of them make any reference to the Agreement. We think it reasonable to suppose that its purport was known to the City Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201cThe resolution of the Commission ... relating to the Agreement was, in substance, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u2018That this Commission\u2019s action of approval is based upon an agreement ... providing ... if it is subsequently determined that this project cannot be carried out as substantially proposed and in the event the City takes action to repeal the rezoning ordinance to the end that the property will revert to its present existing <em>uses </em>[conditional zoning], the transferees will not interpose objections to the passage of the repeal ordinance.... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201c... No matter how moderate, reasonable or even desirable these conditions may be we find no authority for their imposition by the Planning Commission. The State Enabling Act (Code 1957), Art. 66 B, Sec. 7(g)(4) authorizes a zoning board (except in two counties) to \u2018approve buildings, and uses limited as to location under such rules and regulations as may be provided by ordinance of the local legislative body,\u2019 but no such authorization extends to the Planning Commission....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201c... A purported grant of rezoning might be invalid because actually based upon conditions destructive of uniformity of zoning, even though the rezoning ordinance itself made no express reference to such conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341-44, 160 A.2d at 384-86. [Alterations added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As can be seen, <em>Pressman </em>also involved conditional zoning relating to uses, and was rejected, at least in part, because the Court felt that the conditions imposed were \u201cdestructive of uniformity of zoning.\u201d The same argument the majority makes in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The main condition imposed on the rezoning in the case of <em>Carole Highlands Citizens Association, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Prince Georges County, </em>222 Md. 44, 46, 158 A.2d 663, 664-65 (1960), was a \u201cprohibition against the erection of a gasoline station on the premises zoned C 2 [as in this case, a clear condition as to uses].\u201d (internal quotation omitted) (alteration added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We found the prohibition to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>then impermissible conditional zoning. Although we found that the allegations of conditional zoning in <em>Town of Somerset v. County Council for Montgomery County, </em>229 Md. 42, 181 A.2d 671 (1962), had not been proven, the conditional zoning there alleged also related to uses. My research indicates that there are no other pre 1970 Maryland cases of this Court relating to conditional zoning. All of the pre 1970 cases were cases involving conditions limiting the otherwise permitted \u201cuses\u201d for certain property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Thus, in respect to conditional zoning, the only situation with which the 1970 Commission Report was concerned arose out of prior zoning cases that exclusively involved limitations on uses, which is exactly the issue in the case at bar. The Commission, to the extent it believed that it was addressing prior Maryland cases relating to conditional zoning, and when suggesting a need that the case law be modified by statute, of necessity, had to be referring to conditional zoning as to use conditions. There were no prior Maryland cases that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>been decided based upon any other types of conditions attached to rezonings. Moreover, the controversy over conditional zoning, both prior to the 1970 statute, and since, has, related to conditions affecting uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In that respect, commentators have spoken as to the subsequent erosion of the prohibition against conditional zoning. In her article, <em>Moving Toward The Bargaining Table: Contract Zoning, Development Agreements, and the Theoretical Foundations of Government Land Use Deals, </em>65 N.C. L.Rev. 957, 981-86 (1987), Judith W. Wegner addressed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cThus, this Article adopts the neutral term \u2018contingent zoning\u2019 to describe all types of individualized rezoning arrangements, instead of the more traditional dichotomy \u2018contract\u2019 and \u2018conditional zoning\u2019 or the more recent references to \u2018unilateral contracts\u2019 or \u2018concomitant agreement zoning.\u2019 A final conclusion follows from the first two: To the extent that contingent zoning arrangements run the gamut between involuntarily imposed conditions and bilateral agreements, all are potentially affected by the presence of a bargaining process....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cOther courts, including many of the more recent cases, have upheld contingent zoning in the face of charges of per se invalidity. These courts have concluded that traditional zoning legislation provided ample authority, <em>and that textual restrictions designed to guide the implementation of other types of zoning simply did not apply....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201c... Contingent zoning merely promotes more finetuned accommodations, instead of all-or-nothing rezoning decisions, thereby facilitating compromises designed to approximate all interested parties\u2019 expectations.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Some states, either by case law or statute, have approved of some level of conditional zoning that are particularly illustra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tive. The cases include <em>Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, </em>117 R.I. 134, 151 n. 4, 364 A.2d 1277, 1288 n. 4 (1976), where that state\u2019s Supreme Court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cThis court has not passed upon the validity of conditional zoning either before or after the enactment of the provision here which expressly authorizes it. Although both <em>Arc-Lan Co. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, </em>106 R.I. 474, 261 A.2d 280 (1970), and <em>Nicholson v. Tourtellotte, </em>110 R.I. 411, 415, 293 A.2d 909, 911 (1972), involved conditional zoning, in each instance we expressly declined to rule whether the practice was valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Then, in the body of its opinion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cFirst, imposing differing conditions on the property in the same land-use category is not a wholly arbitrary differentiation per se. Owners of property in the same land-use category are not necessarily \u2018similaily situated\u2019 so that they must be treated identically under the equal protection clause. The particular <em>use </em>of one parcel, by virtue of the property\u2019s location, may have a greater impact on surrounding properties than that of another parcel in the same zoning district. In addition, two parcels may have been classified at different times when the needs of the municipality differed. Different pieces of property may also have physical characteristics which differ enough to require some minor differences in <em>use </em>restriction, while still permitting the land to be placed in the same general category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 364 A.2d at 1288-89. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Finally, the Rhode Island Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201cIn <em>Nicholson v. Tourtellotte, </em>110 R.I. 411, 293 A.2d 909 (1972), this court, while not reaching the issue of the validity of conditional zoning, noted the position of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aey\">i \u201c * * * An amendment to a zoning ordinance and a concomitant agreement should be declared invalid only if it can be shown that there was no valid reason for a change and that they are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, and have no substantial relation to the public health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>safety, morals, and general welfare, or if the city is using the concomitant agreement for bargaining and sale to the highest bidder or solely for the benefit of private speculators.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 415, 293 A.2d at 911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\"><em>Accord, Pecora v.

City of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429; <em>Houston Petroleum Co. v. Automotive Prods. Credit Ass\u2019n., </em>9 N.J. 122, 87 A.2d 319; <em>Hausmann &amp; Johnson v. Berea Bd. of Appeals, </em>40 Ohio App.2d 432, 320 N.E.2d 685), the assumptions have been made that conditional zoning benefits particular landowners rather than the community as a whole and that it undermines the foundation upon which comprehensive zoning depends by destroying uniformity within use districts. <em>Such unexamined assumptions are questionable. First, it is a downward change to a less restrictive zoning classification that benefits the property rezoned and not the opposite imposition of greater restrictions on land use. </em>Indeed, imposing limiting conditions, while benefitting surrounding properties, normally adversely affects the premises on which the conditions are imposed. Second, zoning is not invalid per se merely because only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>single parcel is involved or benefitted <em>(Matter of Mahoney v. O\u2019Shea Funeral Homes, </em>45 N.Y.2d 719, 408 N.Y.S.2d 470, 380 N.E.2d 297); the real test for spot zoning is whether the change is other than part of a well-considered and comprehensive plan calculated to serve the general welfare of the community. Such a determination, in turn, depends on the reasonableness of the rezoning in relation to neighboring uses \u2014 an inquiry required regardless of whether the change in zone is conditional in form. Third, if it is initially proper to change a zoning classification without the imposition of restrictive conditions notwithstanding that such change may depart from uniformity, then no reason exists why accomplishing that change subject to condition should automatically be classified as impermissible spot zoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c... If modification to a less restrictive zoning classification is warranted, then a fortiori, conditions imposed by a local legislature to minimize conflicts among districts should not in and of themselves violate any prohibition against spot zoning.\u201d [Citation omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Ronald S. Cope, in his article <em>\u201cAnnexation </em>Agreements\u2014<em>Boundary Agreements: Walking a Fine Line Into The Future</em>\u2014A <em>Map of the Dangers to the Unwary Land Use Traveler,\u201d </em>17 N. Ill. U.L.Rev. 377, 388 (1977), writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201cHowever, we do not believe it to be an absolute precept that any and all conditional rezoning in Illinois is forbidden. Without doubt, there is a suitable and proper place for utilization of the process. <em>Some conditional rezoning may be in the public good, subservient to a comprehensive plan, in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare and enacted in recognition of changing circumstances. Not all conditional rezoning is onerous, destructive or an abandonment of the power of the zoning agency nor does it stem from improper motives.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The controversy over conditional zoning prior to 1970, and even afterwards, has almost always focused on conditions constituting limitations on uses in the reclassified district, not \u201cyard\u201d type limitations. The position of the majority, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>my view, is neither legally nor intellectually supportable by the past legal history relating to the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Rockville\u2019s Planning Staffs final report noted that the approved Land Use Plan, part of the city\u2019s 1993 Master Plan, recommended that the subject property be for service industrial uses consistent with the 1-1 District\u2019s uses. Evidence to the contrary has not been brought to our attention. Accordingly, the zoning classification itself is consistent with the relevant city plans and goals. Thus, any use permitted within that district, in my view, would likewise be consistent. Gasoline service stations, the Court is informed, are permitted, as special exceptions, in the 1-1 District.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In respect to the rule that the Court apparently believed to be in effect at the time of <em>Montgomery County v. National Capital Realty Corporation, </em>267 Md. 364, 373, 297 A.2d 675, 680 (1972),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we initially stated, \u201cThe invalidity of conditional zoning in Maryland is not seriously open to question,\u201d citing <em>Citizens Association, Rose </em>and <em>Baylis, supra. </em>All of the cases cited in <em>National Capital </em>predated the 1970 amendment to Article 66B that, by its express terms, authorized conditional zoning.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We made no mention of the new 1970 amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that permitted conditional zoning in <em>National Capital. </em>To support our reliance on these prior cases, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201c \u2018The general rule in these jurisdictions in which the validity of such covenants has been litigated is that they are illegal. The basis of such rule is that the rezoning of a particular parcel of land upon conditions not imposed by the zoning ordinance generally in the particular district into which the land has been rezoned is prima facie evidence of \u201cspot zoning\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in its most maleficent aspect, is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan and is beyond the power of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c \u2018Legislative bodies must rezone in accordance with a comprehensive plan, and in amending the ordinance so as to confer upon a particular parcel a particular district designation, it may not curtail or limit the uses and structures placed or to be placed upon the lands so rezoned differently from those permitted upon other lands in the same district. Consequently, where there has been a concatinated rezoning and filing of a \u201cdeclaration of restrictions\u201d the general view (where the question has been litigated) is that both the zoning amendment and the restrictive covenant are invalid for the reasons expressed above.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Capital, 267 </em>Md. at 374, 297 A.2d at 680-81 (quoting extensively from <em>3 Rathkopf </em>Zoning and Planning, 74-79). [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At the time of <em>Baylis, </em>the sole Maryland statute that granted power to municipalities to create zoning districts was found in Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, Sections 1\u2014Grant of Power and 2\u2014Districts. Section 2 provided, as relevant here, that \u201cAll such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>district.\u201d As the majority notes, this provision remains in Maryland law, now codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Article 66B, Section 4.02. Now, however, unlike the <em>Baylis </em>era, there is a specific statute permitting that which <em>Baylis </em>stated was prohibited. Like the unqualified prohibition of our pre 1970 cases, the permissive language of the 1970 statute is also equally unqualified, although the majority seeks to qualify it. So long as local governmental entities adopt proper ordinances, as in my view Rockville has, the Maryland statute was not intended to, and does not, and cannot be construed to, limit the ability of local governmental bodies to attach conditions limiting uses during zoning reclassifications. To me, to construe the amendment any differently is to ignore all applicable precepts of statutory construction. Local governments do not have to permit conditional zoning, but they have the power to do so. And that power is not limited to imposing conditions on yard or area requirements. No intellectually correct construction otherwise is, in my view, possible. There is absolutely no historical support for the majority\u2019s position, nor can it be supported by the canons of statutory construction. Moreover, any jurisdiction that does not want to have conditional zoning can simply decline to pass an authorizing ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In 1970, subsequent to the <em>Carole Highlands, Baylis </em>and <em>Wakefield </em>cases, the Legislature, granted the power to impose conditions upon rezoning to municipal corporations. It authorized \u201cconditional zoning.\u201d It stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201c(B) The local legislative body of a county or municipal corporation, upon the zoning or rezoning of any land ... <em>may impose such additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations as may be deemed appropriate to preserve, improve, or protect the general character and design of the lands and improvements being zoned or rezoned, or of the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements, and may, upon the zoning or rezoning of any land or lands, retain or reserve the power and authority to approve or disapprove the design of buildings, construction, landscaping, or other improvements, alterations, and changes made </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>or to be made on the subject land or lands to assure conformity with the intent and 'purpose of this article and of the jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance. </em>The powers provided in 401(B) shall be applicable only if the local legislative body adopts an ordinance which shall include enforcement procedures and requirements for adequate notice of public hearings and conditions sought to be imposed.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The provisions above have remained through subsequent revisions. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(b). Current subsection (c) (with its several subsections) contains the same provisions first enacted in 1970. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(c). The City of Rockville has apparently enacted ordinances complying with the state statute. Therefore, the present conditional zoning is, in my view, not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Additionally, I believe my position is strongly supported when the available legislative history I refer to is further examined. In 1966, the General Assembly created the Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission to examine the planning and zoning provisions in State law and to make recommendations for changes by 1967. No such report was made in 1967 or in 1968. However, in 1969, the report was finally forwarded to the Legislature. As recommended, a new Article 66B \u00a7 4.01 was to be created as a part of a general recodification of Maryland\u2019s planning and zoning provisions. Nevertheless, certain changes were intended to be substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Section 4.01 was clearly an intended substantive change to permit, so long as certain requirements were met, conditional zoning of all types in Maryland, or at least in those jurisdictions to which Article 66B applied, which, through the \u201czoning\u201d provisions of the Express Powers Act, applied to charter counties as well as municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In respect to the Commission, the records of the General Assembly reflect, in a document entitled \u201cREPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF 1970-PROPOSED BILLS-SPECIAL COMMITTEE REPORTS, VOLUME II, Minutes and Reports of Special Committees to the Legislative Council of Maryland,\u201d that the Commission report was presented on Wednesday, November 12,1969 to the Legislative Council. It was described to the Council by Senator Goodloe E. Byron in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cUnder revised Article 66B, counties can have conditional zoning. Further, the Commission has attempted to provide for periodically updating of all plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cWith the assistance of a research man, the Commission will prepare an analysis and.... A commentary explaining each change as revised Article 66B is in preparation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The Commission\u2019s report in its analysis, and the Legislature\u2019s resulting statute, made no distinction between counties and municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">As had the commentators, the commission referred to the changing conception of the utility of conditional zoning. It stated, as relevant to the case <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqR\"><em>\u201cParagraph 2 of Section j.01 gives to the local legislative body the powers of \u2018conditional zoning.\u2019 \u2018Since 1960, some courts have recognized that the attachment of conditions to zoning might be a highly desirable means of minimizing the adverse effects of zoning changes. Their decisions reveal a tendency to inject needed flexibility into the American zoning system.\u2019 Shapiro, R.: The Case for Conditional Zoning\u2019 </em>41 Temple, L. Q <em>267 (1968) at 287. A distinction should be made between this type of zoning and that commonly referred to as \u2018contract zoning. \u2019 The latter type of zoning was discussed in Baylis v. City of Baltimore, 219 Md. 164, 148 A.2d 429 (1959) where \u2018the ordinance made the recldssification conditioned upon the execution of an agreement. \u2019 Yokley clarifies this distinction in his commentary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>on Church v. Town of Islip, 8 N.Y.2d 254, 203 N.Y.S.2d 866, 168 N.E.2d 680 (1960) where he concludes that though \u2018contract zoning will not be permitted, conditional zoning may be valid if not bargained for in the sense that zoning is granted in return for the </em>condition.\u2019 <em>2 Yokley, </em>Zoning Law and Practice <em>(3rd edition 1965) 19-11. Therefore, under conditional zoning the usual requirements for reclassification must be met before the powers enunciated in this section are available to the local legislative body. It is believed that this provision avoids previous constitutional pitfalls but still permits the planning commission to provide for orderly development using controls similar to those already found in the subdivision regulations (Section 5.00). Several variations of this provision already exist at the local level, such as the Carroll and Frederick County provisions. </em>\u201d [Emphasis and quotations exactly as in the Report. <em>See </em>Final Report-Legislative Recommendations, Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission, December, 1969, pgs 28 and 29.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">It is thus in my view crystal clear<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that conditional zoning is not prohibited in Maryland if local governments comply with the statutory requirements of Section 4.01. Article 66B applies to Commissioner counties and to all municipal corporations. Charter counties, should they choose to do so, have the power to do whatever is permitted under Article 66B. Additionally, there is nothing in the legislative history, including the Commission\u2019s recommendations, that indicates that there was ever any intent during the process to limit conditional zoning so as to continue the prohibition against conditions relating to uses. Certainly, there is no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Commission or Legislature intended to continue a prohibition which the amendment was intended to overrule.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">What type of conditional zoning the Law Study Commission was recommending depends upon what types of prohibitions as to conditional zoning the Maryland cases had established. All of the prior Maryland cases where this Court had found conditional zoning to be improper were cases where rezonings had been limited as to uses, not as to \u201cyard\u201d type limitations. The position the majority now adopts, the grafting of its own limitations on the concept of \u201cconditional zoning,\u201d is unsupported by anything the Commission found or did, or by any legislative history or by any proper legal authority. The majority is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Additionally, the Court of Special Appeals, in the present case, erred in relying on <em>Rodriguez v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>79 Md.App. 537, 558 A.2d 742 (1989). <em>Rodriguez </em>was correct law at the time it was decided in respect to the statute that court was then construing, even though that statute has now been changed and that holding is not correct in present circumstances, even in that particular county. The <em>Rodriguez </em>court was construing a Prince George\u2019s County ordinance that then permitted a limited degree of conditional zoning. That county ordinance had a provision then found in Prince George\u2019s County Code Section 27-195(c)(2) that, in respect to conditional zoning, stated: \u201c \u2018[i]n no case shall the conditions waive or lessen the requirements of, <em>or prohibit uses </em>allowed in, the approved zone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>79 Md.App. at 542, 558 A.2d at 744 (emphasis added). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the intermediate appellate court, relying on that emphasized provision in <em>Rodriguez, </em>stated the language of a local statute as if it was applicable, generally, throughout Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">As I have indicated, Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, Section 4.01(b), <em>\u201cSame</em>\u2014Additional <em>restrictions, conditions, or limitations \u201d </em>permits local governments to enact ordinances permitting conditional zoning. Pursuant to this subsection of Article 66B, Rockville enacted an ordinance substantially different than the former Prince George\u2019s Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ty<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> ordinance construed in <em>Rodriguez. </em>It is now codified as Rockville City Code, Sections 25-126 and 25-127 (Supplement 2000), and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cSec. 25-126. Grant of local amendment application with conditions-Authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cThe Council may impose additional restrictions, conditions or limitations upon the grant of any application for a local amendment to the zoning map pursuant to the authority contained in State law.\u201d (Rockville, Md., Code of Ordinances ch. 25, art. III, div. 2, \u00a7 25-126 (2002)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201cSec. 25-127. Same Procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Adoption of resolution proposing conditions. </em>If the decision of the Council is to grant a local amendment application, with conditions, it shall adopt a resolution proposing the restrictions, conditions or limitations upon which such application is to be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201c(b) <em>Hearing on proposed conditions. </em>The Council shall thereafter hold a public hearing on such proposed conditions, notice of which shall be given as in the case of an original local amendment application and in writing by first class mail to any person who has registered an appearance in writing prior to adoption of such resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201c(c) <em>Adoption of ordinance granting with conditions. </em>Following such public hearing on the proposed conditions, the Council may adopt an ordinance granting the application with the additional restrictions, conditions or limitations contained in the resolution required under subsection (a) hereof, or such modification thereof as is not substantially different therefrom. Upon the adoption of such ordinance, the letter and number of the classification of such property on the zoning map shall be followed by the letter \u2018C\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>designate the zoning classification as conditional, and the number of the ordinance imposing the conditions shall be placed, in parenthesis in the following manner; \u2018C-2C (Ord.21-78).\u2019 (Laws of Rockville, Ch. 6, \u00a7 6-211)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The laws of Rockville contain provisions relating to the enforcement of the conditions that comply with the requirements of Article 66B \u00a7 4.01(b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As can be clearly seen, there is no provision disallowing a condition limiting uses in the Rockville statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals in relying on <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>construed the wrong statute in arriving at its determination that the conditional zoning in the case <em>sub judice </em>violated conditional zoning standards because it prohibits uses otherwise permitted in the zoning classification in which the subject property was placed. There is no such applicable limitation in the local Rockville statute. Likewise, that standard in respect to prohibiting uses stated in <em>Rodriguez, </em>was case specific in respect to the local statute and not the applicable State statute, and, thus, should not have been construed in this case as a statewide standard. Article 66B \u00a7 4.01(b) (now 4.01(c)) imposes no such specific standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Moreover, as we recently stated in <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Collington Corporate Center I Limited Partnership, </em>358 Md. 296, 747 A.2d 1219 (2000), the statutory provision construed in <em>Rodriguez, </em>was modified in response to that case. It, as it was then written, no longer applies anywhere. Section 27-195(c)(2) of the Prince George\u2019s County Code now reads, as relevant to the specific provision at issue in <em>Rodriguez, </em>\u201cexcept as provided in subparagraph (a)(1), above.\u201d (emphasis in original). The relevant provisions of Section (a)(1) were amended to read: <em>\u201cWhenever an applicant designates a limitation of uses unthin an application, the District Council may approve specific land use types and their general locations ... in accordance with the applicant\u2019s designation, as a part of the approval of the Basic Plan.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(emphasis in original). At the present time, the specific <em>Rodriguez </em>standard relied on by the intermediate appellate court does not even apply in the Prince George\u2019s County jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">^Accordingly, I would answer the first question posed in petitioner\u2019s original brief: \u201cDoes a limitation in an annexation agreement restricting certain uses on newly annexed property constitute conditional zoning?\u201d by saying \u201cyes; but, under the circumstances here present, such conditional zoning was permitted.\u201d The lower court erred by relying on the wrong case and the wrong statute to declare the condition imposed in the present case to be impermissible conditional zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In its discussion the majority emphasizes the need for uniformity. While I suggest that uniformity concerns were well known to the Commission when it made its recommendations that resulted in the 1970 amendment, uniformity, while important, is not the conclusive factor in respect to \u201cconditional zoning\u201d under the statute. Any special condition, be it of the use type or the \u201cyard\u201d type, does not, by definition, promote uniformity. But the question really is, if uniformity is an issue in conditional zoning, does conditional zoning destroy uniformity? The Legislature has, in any event, the authority to compromise uniformity principles by statute. In fact, the Legislature can, if it chooses, abolish uniformity principles altogether, so long as it does not violate constitutional provisions in the process. The Legislature can abolish zoning if it chooses to do so. More important, in respect to the present situation, is the fact that so long as the condition imposed does not permit a \u201cuse,\u201d which is otherwise prohibited, it cannot cause lessening of uniformity in a district. To limit uses to a permitted use or uses, does not reduce uniformity. Uniformity, in Euclidean zoning, relates not to the quality of treatment of property owners-that is a 14th Amendment constitutional issue. Uniformity in Euclidean zoning relates to keeping uses uniform. To allow a prohibited use vrould reduce uniformity-a permitted use cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The first time this Court recognized the existence of the 1970 amendment authorizing conditional zoning by local governments was, as indicated previously, in the <em>Attmem case. </em>I reiterate what Judge McAuliffe, for the Court noted about the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <em>Manny Holtz </em>limiting interpretation of the scope of the statute: <em>\u201cWe need not, and do not, offer an opinion concerning the intermediate appellate court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of \u00a7 4.01(b).\u201d Attman, </em>314 Md. at 686 n. 8, 552 A.2d at 1283 n. 8 (emphasis added). In my view, that is a clear statement that this Court was not then accepting the interpretation placed upon the statute by the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In <em>Manny Holtz, </em>the writer of the opinion for the Court of Special Appeals undertook little legislative history surrounding the 1970 amendment and either failed altogether to find, or simply ignored, the Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission report and recommendations. Therefore, the case made no reference to the prior Maryland cases involving rezoning conditions relating to uses that the Commission\u2019s recommendations were intended to change. Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals failed to note the virtual absence of cases prior to 1970 in Maryland, where the decision was based on conditional zoning that did not relate to conditions as to \u201cuses.\u201d All of the cases decided on the then invalidity of conditional zoning had involved conditions as to uses. Even more important, however, is that the writer completely omitted any consideration of the primary provision of the amending statute (Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(b)), choosing instead to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>completely on a later ancillary provision in the statute. The Court of Special Appeals, as Judge McAuliffe noted, stated, as relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">\u201cSection 4.01(b) permits local legislative bodies to impose \u2018additional restrictions, conditions or limitations\u2019 on the design and construction of buddings and landscaping on the subject or adjacent tract. The plain meaning of this subsection is clear. The language referring to \u2018restrictions, conditions and limitations\u2019 applies only to the structural and architectural character of the land and the improvements thereon. \u2018Conditions, restrictions or limitations\u2019 on use are neither explicitly provided for in this [latter] subsection nor can they be implied therefrom.\u201d <em>Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 582, 501 A.2d at 492.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As noted in <em>Attman, </em>this Court expressly declined to accept the limiting interpretation, although the majority in the present case strains to join the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dicta from <em>Manny Holtz, </em>and, in the process, to metamorphose incorrect, previously rejected dicta in an intermediate appellate court opinion, into the law of Maryland. If one reads only the language of the section quoted by the <em>Manny Holtz </em>court without reading the statutory language it leaves out, it might be possible to arrive at that court\u2019s interpretation. Apparently, it is this <em>Manny Holtz </em>misinterpretation that has led the bar to accept the proposition that conditional zoning power under the statute does not apply to use issues. However, perhaps unrealized by the bar (but apparently realized by Judge McAuliffe), The writer of <em>Manny Holtz </em>left out most of the primary portion of the statute. She took the first part of the primary section, deleted completely what it referred to, and then attached the opening provisions of the primary section to a subsequent, completely unrelated, lessor, ancillary part of the statute. She completely changed the statute. In the process the correct meaning of the quoted language was concealed if it is considered in its complete and actual context. I reiterate the full, appropriate language of the section, in proper context, placing emphasis on the language utilized out of context by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Manny Holtz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201c \u2018The local legislative body of a county or municipal corporation, upon the zoning or rezoning of any land ... may impose <em>such additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations </em>as may be deemed appropriate to preserve, improve, or protect the general character and design of the lands and improvements being zoned or rezoned, or of the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements, and <em>may, wpon the zoning or rezoning of any land or lands, retain or reserve the power and authority to approve or disapprove the design of buildings, construction, landscaping, or other, improvements, alterations, and changes made or to be made on the subject land or lands to assure conformity with the intent and purpose of this article and of the jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance. </em>The powers provided in subsection (b) shall be applicable only if the local legislative body adopts an ordinance which shall include enforcement procedures and requirements for adequate notice of public hearings and conditions sought to be imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manny Holtz, </em>65 Md.App. at 581, 501 A.2d at 492 (quoting Md.Code (1957, 1983 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(b)) [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As the intermediate appellate court used the language it read \u201c... may impose such additional restrictions ... to ... approve or disapprove the design of the buildings.... \u201d What the statute actually states is \u201cmay impose such additional restrictions ... to preserve, improve or protect the general character of the lands ... being zoned or rezoned ... <em>and may reseme </em>the power to approve or disapprove the design of the buildings .... \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As can readily be seen, Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(b) actually has two provisions. The first, and I suggest the primary provision, states that local governments <em>in the present: </em>\u201cmay impose <em>such additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations as may be deemed appropriate to preseme, improve, or protect the general character and design of the lands and improvements being zoned or rezoned, or of the surrounding or adjacent lands and improvements.\u201d </em>(some emphasis added). It is this section that authorizes general conditional zoning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>whether it be \u201cuses\u201d or \u201cyard\u201d type conditions. The next section permits that which the first section does not specifically permit. It permits local governments to <em>\u201cretain or reserve the poiver and authority to approve or disapprove the design of buildings, construction, landscaping, or other improvements, alterations, </em>[in the future]\u201d (emphasis added). The <em>Manny Holtz </em>court improperly took the <em>\u201crestriction, condition, or limitation </em>\u201d language and separated it from what it applied to, and attached it to a section to which it was not relevant in the first instance. The second section permits the reservation or retaining of power in the local authority to, <em>in the future, </em>approve or disapprove \u201cyard\u201d type plans whenever in the future they are presented. This last language has absolutely nothing to do with the granting of the power to impose conditions on a current reclassification. It is totally unrelated to the first section-the section that authorizes, generally, conditional zoning as to uses <em>in present time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">It appears that the writer of <em>Manny Holtz </em>began with the idea that the Legislature in the 1970 amendment should have limited conditional zoning to the conditions she felt appropriate, and, accordingly, interpreted the language of the amendment in that fashion. By joining the two provisions and completely eliminating the language in between, she completely misapplied the statutory language. In order to arrive at the <em>Manny Holtz </em>interpretation of the statute that the writer apparently desired, the omitted language had to be deleted in order to conceal the actual context of the provision. In order to hold as the Court of Special Appeals held in <em>Manny Holtz, </em>the context of the statute had to be ignored. So it was. The majority of this Court, rather than summarily elevating the practice conducted in <em>Manny Holtz </em>to the law of Maryland, should condemn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">This Court has not heretofore construed Art. 66B \u00a7 4.01(b), but, in <em>Attman, </em>we were very careful not to accept the <em>Manny Holtz </em>interpretation. A fair reading of the statute simply does not support the limitations on its language placed there by the <em>Manny Holtz </em>court and that is now being placed there by the majority in this case. In my view the <em>Manny Holtz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>interpretation cannot be supported by the language of the statute, its legislative history, or the prior cases the statute was designed to redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Mockard, </em>73 Md.App. 340, 533 A.2d 1344 (1987), was also written by the <em>Manny Holtz author. Mockard </em>relies in all relevant respects on <em>Manny Holtz. </em>It fails completely to acknowledge the 1970 amendment, and cites only to one other Maryland case, a case I cited earlier, <em>National Capital. </em>As I have indicated, <em>National Capital </em>was a case decided during the period the 1970 amendment was being enacted and failed completely to discuss that amendment, but cited to the pre 1970 cases when it referred to the general invalidity of conditional zoning. As noted earlier, in <em>National Capital </em>the County Attorney had informed the court that Montgomery County had not authorized conditional zoning. As previously mentioned, our comments in <em>National Capital </em>were dicta in the first instance, and, because of the 1970 amendments which were not brought to our attention, inaccurate when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The combination of <em>Manny Holtz </em>and <em>Mockard </em>represents a primary example of how an appellate court makes law, as opposed to applying law. In <em>Manny Holtz, </em>the intermediate appellate court misinterpreted a statute; in <em>Mockard, </em>it relied on <em>Manny Holtz </em>without mentioning the statute that <em>Manny Holtz </em>misinterprets. Thereafter, the intermediate appellate court merely refers to <em>Mockard, </em>and the original misinterpretation of the statute is lost in time. Along now comes this Court, ignores its <em>Attman </em>reservations and describes the <em>Manny Holtz </em>misinterpretation as the law in Maryland. Through this device, the original misinterpretation of the statute can become transformed by case precedent into the law on the issue, unless the misinterpretation is promptly discovered. And that is what the majority is permitting to happen in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Subsequent to <em>Manny Holtz </em>and <em>Mockard, </em>even the Court of Special Appeals has recognized that a fuller analysis of \u201cconditional zoning\u201d might be appropriate. As dicta, in <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>ple\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Beachwood I Limited Partnership, </em>107 Md.App. 627, 674, 670 A.2d 484, 508 (1995), where, when citing to the series of cases decided under pre 1970 law, it also cites to the post 1970 <em>Manny Holtz </em>and <em>Mockard </em>cases, when it states: \u201cBecause it [contract zoning] is the only form of suspect zoning charged by Beachwood in this case, we have confined our analysis to contract zoning specifically and not to conditional zoning generally, a full analysis of which must abide some future occasion.\u201d (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The majority in its effort to justify the result, asserts that Rockville\u2019s conditional zoning ordinance does not apply in this case because its ordinance only applies to amendments to the local zoning map. The majority posits that the local map is not being amended because the zoning of the annexed area is original zoning.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The correct issue of whether conditional zoning applies under the Rockville statute is whether the zoning is upon a specific request <em>ie., </em>piecemeal or otherwise. If piecemeal, the Rockville ordinance applies because it is a request for a local map amendment. What the majority virtually ignores is that local zoning maps may be amended during the process of annexation by the zoning imposed on annexed property during that process. Prior to annexation the subject site was not contained within the area laid out by the zoning district map. After annexation the area is contained within the area laid out by the zoning district map. Ergo \u2014 the map of necessity has been modified during a non-comprehensive process. The map has been amended upon an individual application.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Moreover, there was a petition for zoning in this case. The brief of appellant points out specifically: \u201cWhen the petition [for annexation] was filed the property was zoned I-2 (Heavy Industrial) pursuant to the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance. <em>The petition </em>requested the property be placed within the city\u2019s I-1 (Service Industrial) zone....</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201cThe City of Rockville Planning Division staff recommended approval.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We long ago held contrary to the majority's position on this issue. In <em>Beshore v. Town of Bel Air, </em>237 Md. 398, 409, 206 A.2d 678 (1965) one of the issues present was explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARp\">\u201cThe appellant next contends that the resolution No. 20, providing for both annexation and zoning ... is invalid for four specific reasons.... The appellants argue that \u2018zoning changes and classifications for which there is a specific statute [Code (1957), Art. 66B] are not intended to be included in an annexation resolution under the guise of \u201cconditions and circumstances\u201d provisions of the annexation statute.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cResolution No. 20 in the case before us adequately describes the four tracts and provides for their annexation, and then fixes their zoning classifications....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cA municipality having an authorized planning and zoning authority has exclusive jurisdiction to zone annexed property.... To require such a municipality to annex and then later zone, in separate proceedings, would appear to be illogical and wasteful when the requirements of both Art. 23A and Art. 66B can be satisfied in one proceeding, as happened in the instant case.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>See also Northeast Plaza, supra </em>at 30, 526 A.2d 963: \u201cWe have also approved the combination of zoning and annexation in one resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Thus, I respectfully submit, the majority is again mistaken. The zoning here involved was not a comprehensive rezoning, it was upon a specific application; it was piecemeal and cannot be anything else, and that zoning amended the zoning district map. It is immaterial whether it was original or otherwise. It was piecemeal zoning, and the majority can point to no other piece or parcel of property zoned or rezoned at the same time. The majority can point to no other property owner who had filed a petition for zoning. The majority cannot possibly claim that it was a <em>comprehensive </em>rezoning. The majority\u2019s argument that the Rockville statute does not apply because annexation zoning is original zoning is an attempt at obscuration. The issue in respect to the Rockville ordinance is not whether the zoning is original or a rezoning, but whether it is upon specific application <em>i.e., </em>\u2018local zoning map amendment\u2019 or as part of \u2018comprehensive zoning.\u2019 The majority\u2019s position that the Rockville ordinance does not apply is grievously wrong. The Rockville ordinance states in clear, concise language \u201cThe counsel may impose .. . conditions ... upon the grant of any application for a local amendment to the zoning map.... \u201d The inclusion of zoning requests during individual annexations are applications for amendments to local zoning maps because, if granted, they amend the zoning maps by the inclusion of the annexation area.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Under the majority\u2019s theory newly annexed land would be unzoned because annexation could not amend the zoning map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>to include it. The Legislature specifically provided that conditional zoning authority was conferred \u201cupon the [original] zoning or rezoning of any land.... \u201d Anytime the area of newly zoned land, via annexation or otherwise, is added to an existing zoning map-that map is amended. With all due respect, there is nothing in the Rockville ordinance, or before this Court indicating that Rockville did not intend conditional zoning to apply to any land then, or thereafter, included in the zoning map.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Today, in regards to conditional zoning, the majority of this Court, influenced by a misinterpretation by the intermediate appellate court, creates new law, unsupported by the common law, any of this Court\u2019s cases, the statutes or the Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Part B. Annexation issue<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">(Whatever \u201cor\u201d is)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">One of the relevant statutes in respect to the annexation issues in this case is Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.), Article 23A, Section 9(c)(1) and (2). It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmJ\">\u201c(c) <em>Limitations on charter amendments; effect of annexation.</em>\u2014(1) A municipal corporation which is subject to the provisions of Article XI-E of the Maryland Constitution may not amend its charter or exercise its powers of annexation, incorporation or repeal of charter as to affect or impair in any respect the powers relating to sanitation, including sewer, water and similar facilities, and zoning, of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission. <em>Except </em>that where any area is annexed to a municipality authorized to have and having then a planning and zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>authority, the municipality shall have exclusive jurisdiction over planning and zoning and subdivision control within the area annexed; provided nothing in this exception shall be construed or interpreted to grant planning and zoning authority or subdivision control to a municipality not authorized to exercise that authority at the time of such annexation; and further provided, that no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years following annexation, place that land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified <em>in the current and duly adopted master plan </em>or plans or if there is no adopted or approved master plan [in the annexing municipality], the adopted or approved general plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation without the express approval of the board of county commissioners or county council of the county in which the municipality is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\u201c(2) If the county expressly approves, the municipality, without regard to the provisions of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.05(a) of the Code, may place the annexed land in a zoning classification that permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or general plan of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.\u201d [Some emphasis added.] [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Regardless of the agreement of the parties at the times of the oral arguments, I read the provision much differently than they did and much differently than the majority opinion. A careful reading of the statute and the proper consideration of its plain meaning, and I believe a fair consideration of the legislative circumstances in which it was first placed in a form similar to the present, supports a different interpretation if the annexing municipality already has the appropriate planning and zoning authority and procedures, as Rockville has in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The majority states on page 553 of its opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cThe Owners\u2019 literal interpretation is that if the annexing jurisdiction\u2019s plan includes a land use recommendation for an area originally outside of its jurisdiction in anticipation of its possible future annexation, then it may look first to its own municipal plan, and is only required to look to the county plan if there is no municipal plan.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The majority thus concedes that the owners\u2019 position constitutes a literal interpretation of the statute. I agree. It is literal and it represents the plain meaning of-this statute-and there is, contrary to the assertions of the majority, absolutely no relevant legislative history that conflicts with that literal and plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Additionally, the majority states on page 536 of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZx\">\u201cFrankly put, the requirement of uniformity serves to protect the landowner from favoritism towards certain landowners within a zone by the grant of less onerous restrictions than are applied to others within the same zone elsewhere in the district, and also serves to prevent the use of zoning as a form of leverage by the local government seeking land concession, transfers, or other consideration in return for more favorable zoning treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">I may be dense (the majority, and others, may well agree) but for the life of me, I fail to perceive how imposing more onerous restrictions, such as a prohibition as to uses upon property being annexed, not less onerous restrictions, constitutes favoritism towards the landowner who is being prohibit\u00e9d by the condition from doing that which he would otherwise have the right to do. The situation in the case at bar is one hundred eighty degrees from the situation the majority describes as \u201cFrankly put....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s intention, I believe, is, generally, to protect the rights of municipalities in respect to annexation and zoning. Accordingly, in respect to any ambiguity in language which the majority concedes has a literal meaning, ambiguity that I do not believe exists in the first instance, such dreamed ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the municipality, here Rockville. In respect to annexation stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>utes generally, we held in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Mayor and City Council of Laurel, </em>262 Md. 171, 277 A.2d 262 (1971), in respect to similar provisions relating to annexation and zoning conflicts between municipalities and Prince George\u2019s County and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, that the Legislature intended to protect the rights of municipalities as they extended their boundaries into additional territory, specifically holding that when Laurel extended its boundaries into the area of the Commission, the newly annexed property was no longer within the boundaries or jurisdiction of the Commission and thus the city zoning would control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cAt the time of the annexation and rezoning, the property in question was part of, and was situated within, the borders of the Regional District. Laurel\u2019s actions were the source of some dismay to the ... Commission ... both of which refused to give any recognition to the attempted rezoning. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201c... Again in 1957, as we have previously noted, the Legislature addressed itself even more precisely to the particular question presented, and granted pre-eminence in planning and zoning to certain municipalities (e.g. Laurel) over areas which they might annex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201c. .. the Legislature generally intended ... [to grant] protection to the zoning rights of certain municipalities over areas which they might annex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 182-83, 277 A.2d at 264, 268. [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In the case at bar, Rockville, as are all municipalities under the \u201cexclusive\u201d language of the statutes, is granted preeminence in zoning matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We additionally noted in <em>Laurel </em>the existence of a statute, then section 2 of Article 23A, similar to the present statute, which the Commission claimed limited the power of Laurel to exercise exclusive zoning power in the annexed area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201c \u2018The legislative body of every incorporated municipality ... shall have general power ... but nothing in this article shall be construed to authorize ... any incorporated municipality to pass any ordinance which is inconsistent or in conflict with any ordinance ... ordained or adopted by the ... Commission....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 181, 277 A.2d at 267 (quoting Md.Code (1957, 1966 Repl.Vol.) Art. 23A \u00a7 2) (emphasis omitted). We answered by holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cthe Legislature generally intended that where ordinances of municipalities and the Commission come into conflict the authority of the Commission shall prevail, <em>with the particular exception stated in the second half of Sections 9(c) </em>and 19(p) <em>granting protection to the zoning rights of certain municipalities over areas which they might annex.\" Id. </em>at 183, 277 A.2d at 268. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Later we noted what is also absolutely relevant in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cIt is further essential to keep in mind ... that the Town of Laurel is not within the Regional District....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">\u201cIndeed, if one were to reason that Laurel were exempt from the workings of the law <em>only </em>to the extent of its boundaries of April 24, 1961, and that when it annexed the acreage ... it became a municipal corporation \u2018within the area of the Regional District\u2019 by extending those boundaries into the Regional District, <em>one comes to the somewhat absurd conclusion that Laurel would thereby lose all of its zoning and planning authority because of the annexation. ... What the Legislature intended ... </em>was basically what it had earlier said in sections 9(c) and 19(p) of Article <em>22A-that the Commission is to prevail in matters of planning and zoning, except for instances of municipalities having a planning and zoning authority.\" Id. </em>at 185-87, 277 A.2d at 269-70. [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>By comparison, the majority\u2019s position in the case <em>sub judice </em>would lead to the same \u201csomewhat absurd conclusion that [ ] [Rockville] would thereby lose all of its zoning and planning authority [over the annexed area] because of the annexation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 277 A.2d at 270 (alterations' added) (emphasis omitted). In the conclusion portion of this dissent, I point out just some of the other land use absurdities that result from the position the majority takes on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We also noted in <em>Laurel:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201cThis serves to buttress the interpretation which we have given to Article 23A. As was noted by Judge Loveless in his opinion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u2018Consequently, considering Chapter 596 [of the Acts of 1957] with Chapter 197 of the Acts of 1957, we see an apparent clear legislative intent to permit municipalities in Montgomery County to retain and possess planning and zoning authority; and certainly from Article 23A, Section 9(c) and 19(p), these municipalities would have this power in Prince George\u2019s County areas which were not in the Regional District.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 183 n. 3, 277 A.2d at 268 n. 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL2\">Upon careful examination of the language of the primary statute at issue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>as it was enacted, the provisions at issue primarily provide that when a municipality having planning and zoning authority and approved master plans, annexes land, it shall have exclusive jurisdiction over planning and zoning within the area annexed, provided that for a period of five years land so annexed may not be placed in a zoning district substantially different from the original zoning district in which the annexing municipality first places the annexed property. In other words, it might limit the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the property owner whose property is annexed to seek a reclassification, or perhaps even a variance, for a period of five years. Once a municipality annexes property, that property, <em>for zoning purposes, </em>is outside the boundaries and jurisdiction of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The majority utilizes the legislative history of a prior statute in interpreting the subsequent statute that modifies the prior statute. It attempts to support its position by quoting from our case of <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Mayor and City Council of Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 561, 325 A.2d 748, 754-55 (1974). It proffers that the case supports the position the majority takes in the present case. It does; but only if one ignores the 1975 statute that presents the issue the Court is resolving today. The 1975 amendment was intended to change the thrust of the earlier statute that was at issue in <em>Maryland-National </em>The majority is particularly disingenuous to rely on the intention of the Legislature when it originally passed a statute, to determine what it means when it later substantively modifies that very statute in order to achieve a different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The majority also cites to <em>Northeast Plaza Associates v. President and Commissioners of the Town of North East, </em>310 Md. 20, 28-31, 526 A.2d 963, 967-69 (1987), for the same proposition. In <em>Northeast </em>the only thing this Court held was that zoning upon annexation was not original zoning and that such zoning had to satisfy the change/mistake rule. In 1988 the Legislature then immediately amended the statute to overrule our holding. The issue of county approval was only mentioned as dicta in the case. Neither <em>Northeast </em>nor <em>Maryland-National, </em>fairly read and construed, in my view, support the majority\u2019s position, and neither does <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Montgomery County, 271 </em>Md. 505, 318 A.2d 509 (1974). It was decided before the enactment of the amendment that raises the questions in this case. This Court\u2019s interpretation of the legislative intent in respect to the prior statute, offers little, if any, light on the legislative intent in respect to the 1975 amendment. If the majority is correct, the Legislature was just repeating itself when it modified the statute to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>either \u201cor\u201d type of statute. Such an interpretation of a substantive amendment is simply insupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Since 1975, the last clause of Article 23A \u00a7 9(c), and later (c)(1), has, as I read its clear and unambiguous language, only applied, and only applies, in instances where the annexing municipality has no planning and zoning authority and/or master plans and thus the prior zoning classifications in the county are relevant in such circumstances by reason of the last long clause in subsection (1) following the \u201cor\u201d I have bolded above.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In 1974, Judge Eldridge for the Court in <em>Gaithersburg, supra, </em>interpreted certain language of the statute as it then existed. At that time there was no subsection (c)(2), nor any provision relating to current master plans of annexing municipalities or county approval; all of the then provisions were contained in one subsection. The last several clauses, those relevant to our inquiry, then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201c(c) <em>Limitations on charter amendments; effect of annexation. ... </em>and further provided, that no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years following annexation, place that land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from the use for the land specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADf\">Md.Code (1957, 1973 Repl.Vol.), Art. 23A \u00a7 9(c). What the majority holds today is identical to that 1974 holding, which was prior to the 1975 amendment at issue in the present case. In the majority\u2019s collective mind, nothing has changed. In my view, that is incorrect. A mere reading clearly shows that the statute changed substantively in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The primary issue before the Court in <em>Gaithersburg </em>was whether the statute only applied in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery County, because if so, it might be subject to constitutional challenge in that such provisions are required to be uniform within a class of municipal corporations and the general assembly had only created one class; thus, a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that applied only to municipalities in two counties might be unconstitutional. The Court\u2019s opinion included language in respect to the then statute that provided that \u201cno municipality annexing land may, for a period of five years ... place such land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different from a use\u201d that existed under the County\u2019s master plan just prior to annexation. <em>Gaithersburg, </em>271 Md. at 512-13, 318 A.2d at 513. That is exactly what the language of the statute in effect <em>at that time </em>stated. Similar language was reiterated by this Court in October of the same year in <em>Maryland-National, supra. </em>At issue in that case was the constitutionality of that <em>prior </em>specific provision. Again, referring to the statute as it existed in October of 1974, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cThe question is whether the words \u2018prior to its annexation\u2019 modify only the phrase \u2018county or agency\u2019 or whether they also refer to \u2018duly adopted Master Plan.\u2019 ... In short, the city\u2019s new zoning must be compared with the Master Plans in effect prior to the annexation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\"><em>Maryland-National, </em>272 Md. at 557, 325 A.2d at 752-53. It is thus clear that under the circumstances of the provisions as they existed in 1974, the new zoning classifications imposed by the municipalities during annexation was, from 1970 to 1975, compared with the prior county zoning and master plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">However, in the 1975 Legislative session the Legislature modified the language of section (c) to read basically as (c)(1) currently does. The 1975 statute replaced the old statute and reenacted it with added language that changed the focus to the municipality\u2019s zoning from prior county zoning <em>if </em>the municipality had independent planning and zoning authority and master plans. The majority argues that interpreting plans to mean the plans of the municipality would render \u201cthe sub-section effectively a nullity.\u201d Actually, to construe the modification to the section as the majority interprets it, renders the statute modifying the section to be a nullity. The majority\u2019s position reverts the statute to its meaning before the 1975 amendment. From 1970 to 1975, the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>jurisdiction of a municipality was limited by the prior zoning in the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">However, the pertinent language added in 1975 created a two-step process. The added language changed the statute to entail a consideration of whether the municipality had zoning to be the first consideration. It recognized the exclusivity of existing municipal zoning. Prior to 1975, and even early in that year\u2019s legislative process, the provision that zoning not be changed for five years expressly referred to the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201cthat no municipality annexing land may for a period of five years ... place that land in a zoning classification which permits a land use substantially different for the use specified in the current and duly adopted master plan or plans[*] of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over the land prior to its annexation.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1973 Repl.Vol.), Art. 23A \u00a7 9(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">However, the provision was intentionally amended in the Senate Judiciary Committee to its final form by the insertion right at the point of the bracketed asterisk above, this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cor if there is no adopted or approved master plan, the adopted or approved general plan or plans of the county or agency having planning and zoning jurisdiction over....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Without the language of the Judiciary Committee amendment, the relevant plans were county plans. If it was the intention of the Senate to retain the requirement of conformance with county plans and county approval in all circumstances, that above amending language during the adoption process of the bill would have been totally unnecessary. <em>It would be meaningless. </em>Considering that the entire lengthy sentence preceding the asterisked language referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of a municipality if it had zoning authority and master plans, the \u201cor\u201d amendment can only be to provide for county consideration and approval <em>if a municipality has no zoning authority or </em>master plan or plans. Every known precept of applicable statutory construction supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>.the position that I take in reference to the meaning of the word \u201cor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The majority then construes another statute that is not applicable in this case. It states at 558: \u201cThere can be no doubt, from the language of the statute as it existed in 1971 and 1972, that the terms \u2018plan\u2019 or \u2018plans\u2019 found in Chapters 116 and 38, respectively, refer to the plan or plans of the preannexation county jurisdiction, and not those of the annexing municipality.\u201d If one is construing the law as it existed in 1972 that may very well be correct. In 1971 the Legislature had passed a statute that appeared to so provide. However, in 1975 it passed a new statute, amending that prior statute. The new statute provided just to the contrary. It is that 1975 statute, not the 1971 statute that is at issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The prior statute affords no support for the intentions of the Legislature in 1975; instead, the fact that the same statute was modified supports the position I believe to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">I find it unusual that the majority in explaining its position states, in part, on page 559 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cSecond, apparently in response to our decisions in ... [the cases above referred to], where we held municipal rezoning actions invalid on the ground of inconsistency with county master plan recommendations, Chapter 613 provided a means where the five year limitation on the annexing jurisdiction\u2019s ability to change the zoning of the annexed property could be waived if express county approval were obtained. As a result of the adoption ... [it] read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u2018... or....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Because it cannot explain the language preceding the \u201cor\u201d in such a fashion that it supports the majority\u2019s decision, the majority eliminates it. It <em>Manny Holtzed </em>it. In describing how the statute now reads, the majority intentionally leaves out the language preceding the \u201cor.\u201d By doing so it summarily deletes the qualifying language that requires the \u201cor\u201d in the first place. If that language, the language preceding the \u201cor,\u201d is included it would clearly indicate that the annexing authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ty\u2019s zoning, if it has any, is the relevant zoning and, only in the case of the absence of zoning in the annexing authority, does the county\u2019s previous zoning become relevant. Had I focused on the end that the majority wishes to achieve, I would have ignored the same language. However, I am completely unaware of any canon of statutory construction that allows a court to arbitrarily write out language of a statute if that language supports a position contrary to the position a Court wants to reach. It is wrong to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">I have examined the records in the Department of Legislative Reference, the Maryland State Archives and the Maryland State Law Library. The records merely indicate that Senate Bill 864 was introduced by Senator Malkus during the 1975 legislative session, and, as introduced, was in the original form that I indicated above. It was then amended as indicated. There was an additional attempt by Senator Malkus to limit its application to Dorchester County, but that failed to make its way into the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The legislative history I have found is, therefore, limited to the changes in language that occurred during the bill\u2019s passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">This Court has said that \u201c \u2018[t]he cardinal rule [of statutory interpretation] is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Liverpool v.

Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 715, 802 A.2d 1029, 1044 (2002), \u201cthat a \u2018statute [must] be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v.

(used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives).\u201d That portion of the complex sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tence at issue here that preceded the use of the word \u201cor\u201d referenced municipalities, and only municipalities; that portion of the sentence following the word \u201cor\u201d referenced counties, and only counties. To state otherwise is to create an unsupportable statement. It is the equivalent of stating that everything depends upon what \u201cor\u201d is.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In my view, \u201cor\u201d is \u201cor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">And I believe the unambiguous language of the statute lends itself to no other interpretation. Additionally, there is no available legislative history that indicates a different interpretation; one that would permit \u201cor\u201d to mean whatever a majority of this Court, from time to time, determines it to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The municipality\u2019s zoning and master plans, of necessity, had to be the zoning and plans described in the statute that preceded the \u201cor.\u201d Up until that point in sub-section (c) in the statute (the relevant provision of the statute), the only governmental entities that had been mentioned were municipalities. In other words, the language following the \u201cor\u201d presented an alternative to what preceded the \u201cor.\u201d Logically, the clause preceding the \u201cor\u201d referred to a municipality\u2019s zoning authority or master plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">That logic, in my view, is further supported by some of the language of the definitions section of Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.) Article 66B, Section 1.00(g)(1) and (2), which provides a generic definition of the term \u201cplans\u201d in respect to scope of the term in zoning matters applicable under that article. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">\u201c(g) <em>Plan.</em>\u2014( 1) \u2018Plan\u2019 means the policies, statements, goals, and interrelated plans for private and public land use, transportation, and community facilities documented in text and maps which constitute the guide for the area\u2019s future development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">(2) \u2018Plan\u2019, includes general plan, master plan, compr\u00e9hensive plan, community plan, and the like as adopted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 3.01 through 3.09 of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Section 3.05, referring to the powers of planning commissions in respect to a plan, refers to one plan, with multiple required elements such as a \u201cland use plan element,\u201d \u201ctransportation plan element,\u201d \u201ccommunity facilities plan element\u201d and so forth. The statute appears to define and require one plan, whether it is titled a general plan, master plan, comprehensive plan or the like, that must contain numerous elements. It may be the practice in some jurisdictions to satisfy the elements of the overall plan, however it is titled in a particular jurisdiction, by the method of adopting various transportation \u201cplans,\u201d land use \u201cplans\u201d and the like. Even so, there is only one plan that may incorporate the other plans as necessary elements of that one plan. Therefore, when Article 23A \u00a7 9(c) speaks in one place of \u201ccurrent and duly adopted master plan or plans\u201d and in a following clause \u201cor if there is no adopted or approved master plan, the adopted or approved general plan or plans of the county,\u201d it is really referring to the same type of plan-the single overarching plan, however tilted, of a particular jurisdiction (the municipality\u2019s plan, if it has one; the county\u2019s, if there is no municipal plan) that may be comprised of various \u201cplan elements.\u201d If the plans discussed in the current version of Article 23A \u00a7 9(c) preceding the \u201cor\u201d were meant to be the county plans, then the subsequent mention of plans following the \u201cor\u201d is redundant and the provisions preceding the \u201cor\u201d are meaningless. That construction, the one the majority adopts, is, in my view, incorrect. The better view, the only logical meaning of the language that modified the statute, is that if the municipality has no overall plan or plans at the time of annexation, then, but only then, is the county plan or plans relevant. The majority today holds that the law remains as it was before 1975, and in the process bastardizes the meaning of the word \u201cor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The last change that resulted in the statute in its current form occurred in 1988 Maryland Laws, Chapter 450 (House Bill 667), and it repealed and reenacted the statute. Whereas, the next previous form of the statute had provided in an undivided section that <em>ivhen a municipality did not have zoning authority or master plans, </em>the new zoning must not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>substantially dissimilar to the previous county zoning \u201cwithout the express approval\u201d of the county, the new 1988 statute created a new subsection (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The 1988 statute was a direct reaction to our opinion in <em>Northeast, supra. </em>It is somewhat difficult to determine where the misinterpretation of the prior 1975 amending statute began. In any event, a confusing situation resulted from <em>Northeast </em>and the Legislature\u2019s attempt to, in essence, reverse our holding. As I indicate elsewhere, there was dicta in <em>Northeast </em>that mentioned the language that had been originally contained in the statutes prior to 1975. In the <em>Northeast </em>case, the municipality had obtained county approval and our opinion was framed in that context-a presumption that county approval was necessary and was obtained. In that context, our discussion of the 1975 statute <em>as dicta, </em>contained this statement (indicated by our bolding):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cBy ch. 613 of the Acts of 1975, the General Assembly again amended \u00a7 9(c) to allow \u2018substantially different\u2019 rezoning of annexed land without regard to the five-year limitation, if the municipality obtained the express approval of the appropriate county. As amended, therefore, nothing in \u00a7 9(c) purports to preclude a municipality from rezoning annexed land when, as here, it obtains the county\u2019s express consent.... <em>But nothing in \u00a7 9(c) eliminates the requirement that the municipality comply with the pertinent provisions of Art. 66B, and with its own charter, when it engages in the process of zoning newly annexed land. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnV\"><em>Northeast, </em>310 Md. at 29, 526 A.2d at 968 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The italicized language, not the bolded language, was our holding. It was, however, the initial bolded statement, the dicta, that has contributed to the continuation of that statute being misconstrued. We failed to recognize in 1988, just as the majority fails to realize in the present case, that the 1975 change, in essence, made municipal zoning paramount if a city had zoning, and that the county zoning consideration under the 1975 statute was merely an alternate that applied only when a municipality did not have zoning and master plans. We were not asked to construe that part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>1975 amendment in <em>Northeast. </em>We assumed that county approval was required because it had actually been obtained in that case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our focus was not on county approval. We focused, instead, on whether zoning upon annexation had to comply with the change/mistake rule or whether it constituted original zoning. In that context the whole issue of whether county approval was required was completely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Local governments, prior to <em>Northeast, </em>had always assumed that the first zoning classification upon annexation was original zoning and that the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule did not apply. In the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Northeast, </em>we held the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule to apply, which led to the Legislature\u2019s attempt to modify our <em>Northeast </em>holding, but only as relevant to the applicability of the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule and the character of the initial zoning upon annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The new 1988 paragraph (c)(2), in my view, only provides an exemption from the provisions of the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule found in Article 66B \u00a7 4.05 and only in those instances where county approval <em>is necessary, </em>and obtained. Otherwise, it does not apply because the municipal zoning upon annexation is original zoning in the first instance, albeit,' as I have noted, it is a request for a local map amendment made simultaneously, as permitted, with a request for annexation. If the county zoning was, in such instances, the applicable zoning, any change upon annexation would not be original zoning, and the \u201cchange/mistake\u201drule would apply. The purpose of the 1988 statute was to make crystal clear that the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule did not apply to the zoning of annexed property because, as the municipality\u2019s zoning applied, it was original zoning and not a change in zoning. Its only purpose was to negate this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Northeast </em>that the \u201cchange/mistake\u201d rule applied in annexation situations because it was a change from prior county zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>It appears clear to me that the intention of the Legislature in 1975 was to restrict, for a period of five years, rezoning of annexed land by a municipality with planning and zoning authority and master plans, from its initial <em>original </em>zoning upon annexation. In the event that the annexing municipality did not have zoning authority or did not have master plans and planning, then, and only in that event, the provisions relating to the prior zoning in the county would be applicable. In either event, the annexed land\u2019s zoning would remain stable for a period of five years. Subsequent amendments have not, in my opinion, reordered that focus. My perception, I respectfully suggest, is further supported by a consideration of the relevant statutes concerning charter counties\u2019 relationships with zoning and planning generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.) Article 25A, Section 5, Express Powers, Paragraph (X) <em>Planning and Zoning, </em>enumerates certain zoning powers for counties in which it is applicable. Sub-paragraph (v)1 and 3 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c(v) The powers granted to the county pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201c1. To grant to the county powers in any substantive area not otherwise granted to the county by other public general or public local law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201c3. To authorize the county or its officers to engage in any activity which is beyond their power under other public general law, public local law, or otherwise.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">These limiting provisions are not found in any of the other twenty-nine express powers enumerated in the Express Powers Act. Only zoning powers are so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.) Article 28, Title 7, Maryland-Washington Regional District (sometimes referred to as the Regional District Act), Section 7-105, <em>Powers restricted in municipalities in Montgomery County, </em>provides in sub-section (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201cExcept as provided by agreement under this section, neither the Commission nor the Montgomery County Planning Board nor the district council may exercise any planning or zoning power or jurisdiction within any municipal corporation that existed as of June 1, 1957, as provided under subsection (a) of this section. A municipality that incorporates after June 1, 1957 may not exercise planning, zoning, or subdivision power unless expressly provided for in this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Rockville was an incorporated municipality prior to 1957. According to the Rockville office contacted by this member of the Court, Rockville was first incorporated in either 1802 or 1808. . Unless Rockville has agreed otherwise, the zoning powers of Montgomery County, <em>ie., </em>the District Council, in respect to areas within the boundaries of Rockville, including post-annexation boundaries, are limited to the provisions of sub-section (i), which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKk\">\u201cThe Commission or the Montgomery County planning board ... may submit recommendations to any municipal corporation with respect to any planning or zoning action ... and the recommendation ... shall be incorporated as a part of the record of the action by the municipal corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">This Court was not made aware of any agreement that exists that divests the City of Rockville of its zoning powers. Accordingly, in respect to zoning matters within its boundaries and jurisdiction, it is bound by the requirements, and only the requirements, of Article 66B.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We stated in <em>Laurel, </em>262 Md. at 179, 277 A.2d at 266, also a case involving annexation and zoning under predecessor statutes to those at issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201cA reading of sections 9(c) and 19(p) as they were originally enacted, coupled with the amendment added to each section in 1957, indicates that the Legislature intended to protect the zoning rights of municipalities having a planning and zoning authority and to extend their jurisdiction into areas which the municipality annexed or had authority to annex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>As to the five-year provision, I, likewise, see no other purpose for the 1975 amendment, other than to grant primacy to an authorized municipality\u2019s current zoning upon annexation, and only reserving a consideration of prior county zoning to those situations in which municipalities - have no zoning authority or master plans. The interest of the State is that newly annexed lands conform with the zoning in the particular district. If a municipality has no zoning, the State\u2019s interest is that the land retain the zoning it previously had. In other words, for a period of five years the State desires that the property be zoned. Its interests are served regardless of which entity\u2019s zoning is impressed upon the newly annexed land.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">I would hold that when a municipality has planning and zoning authority, and has duly adopted and appropriate master plans, the prior county zoning and county approval of annexation zoning is not relevant. Moreover, the initial municipal zoning upon annexation generally, is original, piecemeal zoning. The municipality, however, is limited in respect to changing the original zoning it first imposes on newly annexed land for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">I emphasize again that it is my view that under the statute, when municipalities have zoning authority and have adopted and approved master plans, the County, has no power to impose conditions. A municipality\u2019s desires in such instances should not be held hostage to county approval. Under the governance scheme in Maryland, a municipal corporation is not subordinate to county government, nor is a municipal corporation required to be subservient to the wishes of a county. Municipalities get their power directly from the State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In any event, the County Council for Montgomery County, sitting as the District Council for the relevant portion of the Maryland Washington Regional District in Montgomery County, approved of the annexation by Resolution No. 14-57, dated February 23, 1999, but conditioned its approval on the city prohibiting \u201cretail use of the site, except for a gasoline service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>station.\u201d Thereafter, Rockville entered into an Annexation Agreement with the property owner that provided, as relevant here, in a whereas clause that \u201cthe Owners and the City agree that the annexation of the subject property should be made subject to the conditions set forth in Resolution No. 14-57 of the Montgomery County Council as hereinafter set forth.\u201d The annexation agreement then contained several conditions, including the provision imposed by the County, that no retail uses other than a \u201cgasoline service station,\u201d could be conducted on the premises.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The annexation agreement was executed between the property owners and Rockville on July 20, 1999. The actual annexation resolution was enacted on July 26,1999 and, pursuant to statute, was to be effective forty-five days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A zoning ordinance, imposing 1-1 zoning on the annexed property, was finally approved on August 2, 1999, by the passage of Ordinance No. 10-99. As relevant to the case at bar, zoning ordinance No. 10-99 provided in certain whereas clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cWHEREAS, by Resolution No. 14-57, the County Council for Montgomery County ... approved City of Rockville Annexation Petition No. ANX97-0124, and its rezoning from the County\u2019s I-2 zone to the City\u2019s I-1 zone, under certain conditions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of Rockville, having fully considered the matter, has determined to place the annexed property in the City\u2019s I-1 zone, under certain conditions to be set forth in an annexation agreement.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Z\">The actual enactment clause of the zoning ordinance made no further reference to the conditions imposed by the annexation and zoning arrangement with the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">In this case it was ultimately determined by Montgomery County that the I-1 District, the city\u2019s heaviest industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>district, was not substantially the same as- the County I-2 District. If there were no \u201capproval\u201d exception to the annexation statute, and if that \u201capproval\u201d provision applied (which, in my view it should not) even when municipalities have planning and zoning authority and master plans, it would mean that the City of Rockville could never annex into the County where the property was county-zoned I-2. <em>Any County could then, by structuring its zoning ordinances to conflict with the city ordinances, be able to completely stymie the annexation process. </em>As we indicated in <em>Laurel, </em>262 Md. at 179, 277 A.2d at 266, and <em>supra, </em>the State\u2019s scheme appears to encourage municipal annexations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\u201cA reading of Sections 9(c) and 19(p) as they were originally enacted, coupled with the amendment added to each section in 1957, indicates that the Legislature intended to protect the zoning rights of municipalities having a planning and zoning authority and to extend their jurisdiction into areas which the municipality annexed or had authority to annex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADs\">I am unaware of any change in the Legislature\u2019s intent in the matter of annexation and the majority points to none.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The correct interpretation of the stated provisions of Article 23A \u00a7 .9, that I discussed and noted at the inception of this portion of the dissent, especially where it refers to qualified municipalities having exclusive zoning jurisdiction over annexed cases, is buttressed by the inclusion elsewhere of similar provisions in Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol), Article 23A, Section 19, which deals primarily with the procedures for annexation. Section 19(s) restates that \u201cwhere any area is annexed to a municipality authorized to have and having then a planning and zoning authority, the said municipality shall have exclusive jurisdiction over planning and zoning....\u201d The proposition that counties somehow retain some level of relevance to municipal zoning is inconsistent with the use of the word \u201cexclusive.\u201d Moreover, the thrust of the statutes, even under their former language, appears to attempt to encourage and further the enlargement of municipal boundaries by annexation. To read the last clause of the relevant portion of section 9(c)(1) to mean that upon annexation the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>annexed property\u2019s zoning must be substantially similar under all circumstances to the previous zoning in the County ignores, as I have repeatedly noted, the use of the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d and makes some of the prior language, and other language elsewhere, relating to municipalities having \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction if they have their own planning and zoning processes, completely meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Rockville has, in my view, expressly authorized conditional zoning by ordinance consistent with the power granted to it by the State. The condition imposed is not in conflict with the State statute or Rockville\u2019s ordinance. Accordingly, to the extent the condition constitutes \u201cconditional zoning,\u201d it would be authorized \u201cconditional zoning\u201d and, therefore, would be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">My last comments concern the result that occurs by reason of the holdings that the majority renders today. Because of it\u2019s holding, the majority actually is placing this property (and any property involved in annexation) in limbo. It is, according to the majority, still zoned County I-2. That holding, that upon zoning at the time of annexation municipal property remains in county zoning districts, will apply to all future annexations anywhere in Maryland. In many other municipal annexations, not just the present one, annexed property may remain designated in county zoning districts for up to five years even where the municipality has had its own zoning for decades. Nonetheless, such property remains annexed to, and is accordingly, within the city, in this case Rockville.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Does the zoning inspector (or equivalent enforcement official) of Montgomery County enforce the county zoning requirements in the area annexed to the city? If so, how does he have any power to enforce anything relating to zoning in respect to parcels in Rockville, which the State says has \u201cexclusive\u201d zoning powers within its boundaries? Conversely, how does the zoning inspector of Rockville enforce a statute or zoning district classification that does not exist within the municipality? When the county zoning administrator takes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>alleged violating property owner before one of its administrative bodies or into court the defendant will allege that he is within the city and thus.cannot violate a county zoning ordinance\u2019s district classification because the municipality\u2019s zoning power is, under State statutes, exclusive. If such a property owner is taken before the city\u2019s administrative bodies or to court by the city zoning inspector, the property owner will allege that the city zoning inspector has no authority to prosecute violations of county statutes and county district classifications and that he is violating no municipal ordinance. As importantly, how does a property owner in the annexed area seek variance or special exception relief from the constraints of the county I-2 classification? Does he or she apply to the authorities in the county in respect to property not within county jurisdiction because it is \u201cexclusively\u201d within the jurisdiction of the city? Does he or she apply to the authorities in the city for relief from the constraints of a zoning district not in the city\u2019s zoning classifications? If it can ever be figured out who to apply to for relief, which entity\u2019s procedural requirements control? If the county\u2019s ordinance says re-applications for relief after a denial of a request must wait two years and the city\u2019s ordinance says one year, how long does the applicant have to wait? If it is claimed that the provisions of the county I-2 district, in relation to a particular parcel in annexed territory, constitute a unconstitutional taking, which governmental entity is sued? The county or the city? Which one is \u2018taking\u2019 it. There may well be many other irreconcilable situations? Not only are the interpretations of the majority, in my view, incorrect, the result, by any reasonable standard, is, I suggest, clearly absurd. To go where the majority\u2019s opinion on this issue takes this court is, in my view, to ignore any reasonable interpretation of the words \u201cor\u201d and \u201cexclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">For all the reasons expressed herein, I would reverse the holding of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Chief Judge BELL joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">.

For over seventeen years we have avoided accepting its interpretation that prohibits conditions that limit uses. <em>See Attman, infra. </em>Today, with little independent analysis, the majority states that the Court of Special Appeals was correct and automatically elevates it to a holding of this Court. Because the writer of <em>Manny Holtz </em>failed to conduct any analysis and declined to even acknowledge the relevant statutes, a mere statement in that opinion, unsupported by anything, is now likewise declared by this Court to be the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\">. A gas station is a gas station. Without the reclassification/annexation condition, as a special exception, a gas station can be operated on the subject annexed property within the new district as a permitted use. With the condition, the identical gas station can be operated on the subject annexed property within the new district if it can qualify for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>special exception. In my view a permitted use of this nature cannot destroy the \"uniformity\u201d of uses within a district.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">It is, I respectfully suggest, logically impossible for a use permitted within a district to destroy ihe statutory uniformity of a district. Allowing a use not permitted within a district might adversely affect the uniformity of a district, but conditional zoning is not concerned with allowing uses not otherwise permitted, but with limiting uses that are permitted. Accordingly, a permitted use simply cannot destroy the uniformity which the statute requires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">.

The suggestion of conditional zoning mistakenly emanating from <em>Wakefield </em>probably results from the fact that there was a private purchase contract between the property owner and a prospective buyer that was \u201cconditioned\u201d on the property being rezoned. That language has apparently been improperly picked up in some of the subsequent cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">. The <em>Baylis </em>Court cites several Maryland cases. One, <em>Huff v.

Thus, at least arguably, <em>Baylis </em>is the first, and certainly (he seminal, pre 1970\u2019s case in Maryland on conditional zoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">. In the case at bar all retail uses except gas stations were prohibited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">. A Planning Commission recommended non-use conditions (limitations) in <em>Rohde v. County Board of Appeals for Baltimore County and Ortel Realty, Inc., </em>234 Md. 259, 263, 199 A.2d 216, 218 (1964), but the issue of conditional zoning was not raised before this Court, \"Despite some possible ambiguity in the order, it is not directly attacked as being conditioned with regard to the reclassification from one zone to another.\u201d In another case apparently decided after the 1968-69 Commission had completed its work and made its recommendations, and shortly after the statute was amended by the Legislature, this Court, in a case apparently decided below before the 1970 amendment was finally passed, upheld the denial of a rezoning that had included recommendations by a local commission for certain non-use conditions. However, the denial below, which we affirmed, had been based on reasons, other than the recommendation for conditional zoning. <em>Messenger v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>259 Md. 693, 271 A.2d 166 (1970). In any event, no notice of the new 1970 amendments was taken by the Court. This Court decided the case in November of 1970; the advance sheets may not have been published at that time. Even then, however, we recognized that \"In Prince George\u2019s County, conditional zoning is permitted by statute. See Sec. 59-839 of the Prince George's County Zoning Ordinance.\u201d <em>Messenger, </em>259 Md. at 707, 271 A.2d at 173. The Court noted that whereas the applicants had failed to establish the basic prerequisites for the rezoning in the first instance, it would have been \"a waste of time and effort\u201d to consider the matter of the conditions recommended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. The proceedings before the administrative agency in <em>National Capital </em>occurred prior to the enactment of the State enabling statute authorizing conditional zoning. Our opinion does not note the date of the lower court decision. But, it is clear that the statute authorizing conditional zoning was not presented to this Court in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. In <em>National Capital, </em>the Montgomery County Attorney had rendered an opinion that conditional zoning \"is not permitted in Montgomery County.\u201d The Court took note of that opinion but, as I state above, took no notice of the 1970 amendment to Article 66B, which, for the first time, expressly permitted conditional zoning by local governments that expressly and properly adopt such provisions. Apparently, even by the time of our decision, Montgomery County had not exercised the authority granted by the 1970 Article 66B amendment, and that amendment, if known by Montgomery County, was not brought to the Court\u2019s attention in that, with the county\u2019s failure to adopt such provisions, the Article 66B amendment, even if applicable because it was enacted while the case was in progress below, was not relevant to the case. More important, as I note, the Court\u2019s comments relative to conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>zoning were based on the Court\u2019s prior cases, the holdings of which, had been to a large degree superseded by (he 1970 amendment to Article 66B. Thus our language in that case, relative to the prohibition of conditional zoning in Maryland was dicta and, by 1972, inaccurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">. The concept of \"spot zoning\u201d always relates to uses of property; never to such things as set backs, design of buildings, height of buildings; <em>i.e., </em>\"yard issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">. In this quotation, I omitted the legislative editing marks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">. Because the language is so clear, I suppose that is why the majority could not get to the position it takes by a \u201cplain meaning\u201d analysis. Because a plain meaning analysis takes it where it does not want to go and because it would lead to a different interpretation than the land use bar in the suburban areas had given the language, the majority, essentially ignores the statute\u2019s plain meaning in this case of first impression for this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">. Generally, county zoning provisions do not apply within municipal corporations. While municipalities, other than Baltimore City, may be within the geographical boundaries of counties or regional entities, they are not, contrary to the opinions of some, subservient to county or regional governments unless the State has, by statute, otherwise dictated. Each local municipal entity gets its power directly from the State, not from the county or region in which it is located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">.

The availability of 'conditional zoning' that permits limitations as to uses is, in reality, a tool that can ease the burdens on property owners that seek reclassifications in order to engage in specific projects. Persons who are opposed to any development on a specific piece of property because they want the private property of others to remain open space, often use as a weapon a refrain to legislative bodies, that essentially states: \"If you permit the reclassification, there is nothing to prohibit the developer from using the property for any of the uses permitted in the district. Some of these uses could be very detrimental to our properties.\u201d Private property owners counter this argument by displaying a willingness to be limited to specific uses and projects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\">. The majority states that the dissent \"erroneous[ly] conflates original zoning with the \u201cpiecemeal\u201d rezoning process.\u201d This dissent to be sure, is a conflation of two tests into a new concept. That is because this is a case of first impression. If one assumes, as even the majority accepts, that there are only two types of Euclidean zoning-piecemeal and comprehensive-the individual application of one property owner for a zoning of one piece of property must be one or the other. It obviously cannot be comprehensive-it is an individual application for a zoning classification for a single, specific parcel. Unless the majority creates a completely new type of zoning, the process here was piecemeal, and the application would be an individual application for which the Rockville statute would have to apply. As to the majority\u2019s accusation that the dissent creates a strawman, the appropriate response is 'to ask.\u2019 What is it-this zoning upon an individual combined petition for annexation and zoning? It has to be subject to some characterization; two are available-piecemeal or comprehensive. Piecemeal is the characterization traditionally associated with individual applications. The majority\u2019s opinion rejects that characterization. There is only one left-comprehensive; but the majority knows that trying to characterize the process as comprehensive has as much chance of success as getting a pig to fly. Instead, the majority continues to avoid the real issue by insisting on the difference between \"original\u201d zoning and \"change/mistake\u201d zoning, arguing in essence that if it is not \"change/misfake\u201d zoning it is \"original.\u201d I agree. If (hat was ihe issue rather than a proposition obscuring the issue, the majority would be correct. In essence, the majority has created its own \"strawman,\u201d one that supports the position it wants to reach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">. I rely in this portion of my dissent on my perception that the plain meaning of the statute controls. If I believed that the statute was ambiguous, my opinion as to its meaning would constitute pure conjecture and would be no better than the conjecture of the majority. In that event, I would probably concur with the result the majority reaches on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. On page 553 the majority also states that a second possible interpretation of the statute is that \"the General Assembly merely was acknowledging the hierarchy of local governmental planning and the differing terminology used to identify those various land use plans by the various jurisdictions.\u201d There is no hierarchy as between county and municipal plans. They are on equal footing. Both get their zoning power directly from the Stale-neither gets its power from the other. There is no pecking order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\">. \u201cOn February 4, 1986, the Cecil County Commissioners passed a resolution approving the proposed zoning changes.\" <em>Northeast, </em>310 Md. at 23, 526 A.2d at 965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">.
