The issue before us is whether this conduct constitutes first degree \u201cescape\u201d under Maryland law. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On October 21,1999, a statement of charges was filed in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Wicomico County, charging Boffen with, among other things, two counts of allegedly \u201cunlawfully us[ing] and disclos[ing] a [credit card] number.\u201d Later that day, Boffen was arrested, and in a \u201cCommitment Pending Hearing,\u201d the Wicomico County Detention Center was \u201ccommanded to receive from any officer the body of [Boffen].\u201d About an hour later, in a \u201cRelease from Commitment,\u201d Boffen was ordered released on a $7,500.00 bond. That bond was later revoked, and in another \u201cCommitment Pending Hearing\u201d dated December 16, 1999, the Detention Center was \u201ccommanded to receive from any officer the body of [Boffen].\u201d Thereafter, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County where a criminal information was filed, charging Boffen with, among other things, the two credit card offenses with which he had been previously charged in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">On March 31, 2000, the Circuit Court conducted a bail review hearing and ordered that bail be set at $15,000. The next day, the Commissioner for Wicomico County signed a bail bond for that amount. On April 4, 2000, a \u201cRelease from Commitment\u201d was filed with the Circuit Court, commanding the Detention Center to \u201crelease [Boffen] subject to the following conditions/restrictions: NONE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>On August 21, 2000, after a jury trial, Boffen was convicted in the Circuit Court for two counts of unlawfully obtaining goods \u201cby falsely representing, without the consent of the cardholder that he was then and there the holder of a credit card.\u201d After the conviction, the court ordered that Boffen remain free on bond pending sentencing, which occurred on November 9, 2000. During sentencing, the Circuit Court Judge stated, \u201c[T]he sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction....\u201d Before the judge could continue, however, Boffen exclaimed, \u201cNo, Your Honor,\u201d fled from the courtroom, and ran out of the courthouse and onto the street in downtown Salisbury. During Boffen\u2019s absence from the courtroom, the judge continued with the sentencing, imposing an additional fifteen years imprisonment for the second count of his conviction, to run consecutive to the fifteen year sentence for the first count. Meanwhile, Boffen was arrested on the sidewalk adjacent to the Route 50 side of the courthouse by a deputy sheriff who had been in the courtroom and had pursued Boffen.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Boffen was later charged with having \u201cknowingly escape[d] from Wicomico County Detention Center, a place of confinement.\u201d Thereafter, a criminal information was filed with the Circuit Court charging Boffen with first degree escape, alleging that on November 9, 2000, Boffen \u201cdid knowingly escape from the Division of Corrections, a place of confinement\u201d in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 137 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Boffen was convicted of that charge on May 2, 2001, after a non-jury trial, and was sentenced to seven years and six months imprisonment to run consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>to his two consecutive fifteen year sentences for the underlying credit card offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The judge presiding over the escape trial noted that, although no statement remanding Boffen to custody had been made by the original sentencing judge, Boffen had been in the \u201cconstructive custody [of the Detention Center], at least from the time of his conviction forward,\u201d based on Maryland Rule 4-349(a) and (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and further concluded that the Detention Center is a \u201cplace of confinement\u201d under the escape statute. Alternatively, the trial judge concluded that Boffen was in the constructive custody of the Division of Correction when he fled. According to the judge who presided over the escape trial, Boffen was \u201clawfully under sentence,\u201d \u201ccommitted to a specific institution,[the Division of Correction]\u201d and subject to restrictions defining the boundaries of his freedom when the sentencing judge stated, \u201c[T]he sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Boffen appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>late court reasoned that Boffen \u201cwas in constructive custody [of the Division of Correction] from the instant that [the original sentencing judge] stated \u2018[t]he sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u2019 \u201d The court determined that, [w]hen [Boffen] fled the courtroom, he had been committed to the custody of the Division of Correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We granted Boffen\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari, <em>Boffen v. State, </em>369 Md. 178, 798 A.2d 551 (2002), to consider the following question, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACc\">Did the trial court err in concluding that Boffen had committed first degree escape when, on November 9, 2000, he appeared in a courtroom for sentencing for two counts of credit card offenses after having been free on bail, and when the judge stated, \u201c[T]he sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction,\u201d Boffen interrupted him and fled from the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that under the circumstances of this case, Boffen\u2019s flight from the courtroom did not constitute the crime of first degree escape under Article 27, Section 137, because he was not within the actual or constructive custody of a place of confinement within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Boffen contends that he did not commit the crime of first degree escape when he ran from the Wicomico County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>courtroom during sentencing. In support of that contention, Boffen claims he was not in the actual or constructive custody of a place of confinement when he fled. Specifically, Boffen argues that, contrary to the conclusion of the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals, no \u201cconstructive custody in the Division of Correction can exist where there has never been any imprisonment, that is, no <em>actual </em>physical custody in any of its \u2018placets] of confinement ....\u2019\u201d The State, on the other hand, asserts that \u201c[o]nce sentence is imposed, defendants like ... Boffen are in constructive custody until physically restrained by the authorities.\u201d Thus, the State maintains that Boffen committed first degree escape because he was in the constructive custody of the Division of Correction (hereinafter \u201cDOC\u201d) right after the original sentencing judge stated, \u201cThe sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u201d For the following reasons, we conclude that Boffen did not commit the crime of first degree escape when he fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">First degree escape is a statutory crime in Maryland, and at the time of Boffen\u2019s departure from the courtroom on November 9, 2000, it was set forth in Article 27, Section 137 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). Section 137(a) provides that \u201c[a] person may not knowingly escape from a place of confinement.\u201d A person violating Section 137 is \u201cguilty of the felony of escape in the first degree and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or both.\u201d The statute does not define \u201cescape,\u201d but Section 136(b) provides that \u201c \u2018[ejscape\u2019 retains its judicially determined meaning.\u201d The Committee to Revise Article 27,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in its annotation to Section 136, in explanation, suggests that \u201c[t]he definition of escape is intended to include the case law interpreting former Art. 27, \u00a7 139.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Hence, we turn to case law to determine whether Boffen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>committed the crime of escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">This Court had refined the \u201cjudicially determined meaning\u201d of escape in <em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 716 A.2d 237 (1998). There, we declared that, \u201cin order to come within the ambit of Article 27, \u00a7 139, the escapee must have been legally detained in \u2018the State penitentiary or a jail, house of correction, reformatory, station house, or other place of confinement in this State or ... to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration for examination or inpatient treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 716 A.2d at 240. Then, we explained that \u201c[t]he prisoner must ... \u2018escape.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u201cescape\u201d was not defined in the statute, we cited our prior decision in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>275 Md. 258, 273, 340 A.2d 290, 298 (1975), for the proposition that, \u201c[t]he physical act of escape is the unauthorized departure from lawful custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCustody,\u201d we observed, \u201cmay be actual or constructive.\u201d Id. We interpreted Section 139 to \u201cprescribe!] \u2018two modes of committing a single offence, i.e., escaping from the institution itself \u2014 from within, the walls of the prison \u2014 or escaping from the bounds where [the prisoner] had been assigned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 340 A.2d 290, 716 A.2d at 242 (quoting <em>Stewart, </em>275 Md. at 271, 340 A.2d at 297).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Thus, to commit the crime of first degree escape in Maryland, one must, without authorization, depart from the actual or constructive custody of a place of confinement. Consequently, we must determine whether Boffen was in the actual or constructive custody of a place of confinement right after the original sentencing judge stated, \u201cThe sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u201d It was at that moment that Boffen interrupted the judge and fled from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">A. Actual Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We begin our analysis by determining whether Boffen was in the \u201cactual custody\u201d of a \u201cplace of confinement\u201d for purposes of first degree escape. For the following reasons, we conclude that he was not. As we observed in <em>Farris, </em>\u201cactual custody\u201d exists when an individual is confined to \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>institution itself ... within the walls of the prison.\u201d 351 Md. at 33, 716 A.2d at 242. The institution within which one is actually confined, moreover, must be a legislatively designated \u201cplace of confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">There is no question that at the time of Boffen\u2019s departure, he was not within the walls of the Detention Center or any of the correctional facilities administered by the DOC. He was, however, \u201cwithin the walls\u201d of the Wicomico County courtroom. Whether he was \u201cconfined\u201d within the courtroom during sentencing is an issue we need not reach because, as we shall explain below, a courtroom, in any event, is ordinarily not a \u201cplace of confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A \u201cplace of confinement,\u201d as defined in Article 27, Section 136(c), is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">(1) A correctional facility as defined in \u00a7 1-101 of the Correctional Services Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">(2) A place identified in a home detention order or agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">(3) A facility of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">(4) A detention center for juveniles or a facility for juveniles listed in Article 83C, \u00a7 2-117(a)(2) of the Code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">(5) Any other facility in which a person is confined under color of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">A courtroom is not included within the first four listed places of confinement, and there is no indication in the language of the statute that the legislature intended to include a courtroom as \u201c[a]ny other facility in which a person is confined under color of law,\u201d at least under the facts presented in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to the rule of <em>ejusdem generis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>[W]here general words in a statute follow the designation of particular things or classes of subjects or persons, the general words will usually be construed to include only those things or persons of the same class or general nature as those specifically mentioned. This rule is based on the supposition that if the Legislature had intended the general words to be considered in an unrestricted sense, it would not have enumerated the particular things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 427, 722 A.2d 887, 900 (1999) (citation omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The particular places of confinement specified prior to number five in the General Assembly\u2019s list are of a different \u201cclass or general nature\u201d than a courtroom. A courtroom, unlike correctional facilities, detention centers, and the like, ordinarily is not intended as a place to hold, treat, or attempt to reintegrate prisoners into society. \u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that criminal statutes are to be construed narrowly so that \u2018courts will not extend the punishment to cases not plainly within the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farris, </em>351 Md. at 36, 716 A.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Tapscott v. State, </em>343 Md. 650, 654, 684 A.2d 439, 441 (1996))(internal citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c \u2018If the law is to be broadened ... it should be modified by the Legislature, not by this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 716 A.2d at 244 (quoting <em>Briggs v. State, </em>348 Md. 470, 483, 704 A.2d 904, 911 (1998)). Had the Legislature intended to explicitly include a courtroom within its definition of a \u201cplace of confinement,\u201d it certainly could have attempted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">B. Constructive Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\"> Nor are we persuaded that Boffen was in the \u201cconstructive\u201d custody of a \u201cplace of confinement\u201d when he fled from the Wicomico County courtroom. The judge presiding over the escape trial concluded that Boffen had been in the \u201cconstructive custody [of the Detention Center], at least from the time of his conviction forward,\u201d and further concluded that the Detention Center is a \u201cplace of confinement.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals declined to base its affirmance of Boffen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>conviction for escape on this theory, instead concluding that Boffen was in the constructive custody of the DOC when the sentencing judge discussed Boffen\u2019s sentence on the first count. Similarly, the State concedes that Boffen was not in the constructive custody of the Detention Center when he fled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The State does contend, however, that Boffen was in the constructive custody of the DOC. That custody, according to the State, was triggered when the original sentencing judge stated, \u201cThe sentence under count number one is fifteen years-to the Division of Correction.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Because escape is a statutorily prescribed crime, we shall employ canons of statutory interpretation to determine whether Boffen was in the constructive custody of a place of confinement when he fled from the courtroom. \u201c[T]he basic premise of statutory interpretation is to \u2018ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Ethics Commission v. Antonetti, </em>365 Md. 428, 450-51, 780 A.2d 1154, 1168 (2001) (quoting <em>Tipton v. Partner\u2019s Management Co., </em>364 Md. 419, 434, 773 A.2d 488, 497 (2001)). In discerning legislative intent, \u201cwe look first at the language of the relevant statutory provision or provisions.\u201d <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 106, 803 A.2d 518, 521-22 (2002). \u201c \u2018If the true legislative intent cannot readily be determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia \u2014 among other things ... the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it. <em>Goldberg v. Miller, </em>371 Md. 591, 602, 810 A.2d 947, 953 (2002)(quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525-26, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">We return to the Committee Note to Section 136, which, as previously mentioned, explains that \u201c[t]he definition of escape is intended to include the case law interpreting former Art. 27, \u00a7 139.\u201d As examples of such case law, the Note then specifically refers to our decisions in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>275 Md. 258, 340 A.2d 290 (1975) and <em>Best v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 633, 634, 201 A.2d 490-91 (1964), as well as the decision of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Beasley v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 7, 299 A.2d 482 (1973). A reading of those cases and others, in addition to viewing the evolution of the escape statute and its legislative history, reveals that the Legislature, in 1999, recodified Art. 27, Section 139 for the purpose, in part, of adopting the judicially defined concept of \u201cconstructive custody\u201d within the law of escape. We shall begin our explanation of this process by turning to a discussion of the cases referred to in the Committee Note \u201cinterpreting former Art. 27, \u00a7 139.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In <em>Best v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 633, 201 A.2d 490 (1964), Best was transported from the penitentiary to a hospital for medical treatment. At the hospital, while a guard that was accompanying Best went to make a telephone call to arrange for transportation back to the penitentiary, Best \u201cwalked off.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In his petition for post conviction relief to this Court, Best alleged that \u201che did not commit the crime of escape, as defined in Code (1957), Art. 27, Sec. 139, since he was left unguarded and the hospital was not a place of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>201 A.2d at 491. In rejecting Best\u2019s argument, we explained that <em>Johnson v. Warden, </em>196 Md. 672, 75 A.2d 843 (1950) was applicable, where we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">[A] prisoner was legally confined in the State Reformatory within the meaning of what is now Art. 27, sec. 139, even though he was allowed to work outside, unguarded, on a private farm, and that, when he escaped from the farm, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>was subject to punishment for escape from the Reformatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 201 A.2d at 491. \u201cThe same reasoning,\u201d we declared, \u201capplies to the instant case, and thus the applicant was properly convicted of escape under Art. 27 sec. 139.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634, 201 A.2d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Eleven years later, in. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>we addressed \u201cthe question of where venue may lie for the trial of the crime of escape under Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol. [1974 Cum.Supp.]) Art. 27, \u00a7 139.\u201d 275 Md. at 259, 340 A.2d at 290, 291 (1975). During the course of that inquiry, we surveyed a number of cases addressing the doctrine of constructive custody. One of those cases was <em>Taylor v. State, </em>229 Md. 128, 130, 182 A.2d 52, 53 (1962), in which the defendant pleaded guilty and was convicted of escape for departing from \u201ca work detail at the University Hospital .... \u201d Prior to his assignment at the hospital, Taylor had served 19 months of a three year sentence in the House of Correction, after which he was transferred to the Sandy Point Correctional Camp. <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 182 A.2d at 53. On appeal to this Court, Taylor argued that the facts were not sufficient to support his conviction for escape from the House of Correction under Section 139 because he was not confined at that institution when he departed. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 131, 182 A.2d at 53, 54. In rejecting that argument, this Court, although not using the term \u201cconstructive custody,\u201d nonetheless relied on that doctrine to find that, when Taylor departed from the hospital, he \u201ccontinued to be under confinement [at the Sandy Point Correctional Camp].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 182 A.2d at 53. Because the correctional camp was \u201cmerely an adjunct of the House of Correction,\u201d we then concluded that his \u201cescape []from [the correctional camp] ... constitute^] escape from the House of Correction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Another case addressing constructive custody discussed by the <em>Stewart </em>court was <em>Ford v. State, </em>237 Md. 266, 205 A.2d 809 (1965). There, the defendant was serving a sentence \u201cat Hagerstown\u201d for a motor vehicle offense when, under guard by a Maryland Correctional Institution Officer, he was transported to the Criminal Court of Baltimore to stand trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>burglary and larceny charges. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 205 A.2d at 810. When the officer released Ford from his handcuffs to get a drink of water, Ford \u201cbroke away from his guard and ran out of the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 205 A.2d at 810. He was later convicted of escape. <em>Id. </em>Appealing that conviction, Ford argued, among other things, that he could not be guilty of escape because he was not \u201cwithin the conf\u00ednes of the prison walls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 205 A.2d at 812. We rejected the argument that Ford had to be in actual custody. Although we did not employ the term \u201cconstructive custody\u201d in our opinion, we recognized its essence by declaring that \u201cMaryland draws no distinction between an escape from within the prison walls and one effected when the prisoner, while still in legal custody, was physically outside the prison area.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In addition to those prior opinions from this Court, the Committee Note to Section 136 of Article 27 also refers to the decision of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Beasley v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 7, 299 A.2d 482 (1973). There, Beasley was convicted of a narcotics violation, sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction, and then transferred to the Maryland Correctional Camp Center at Jessup. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 299 A.2d at 483-84. While on a work release program from the Camp Center, Beasley fled, was later apprehended, and was then convicted for escape under Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 139. <em>Id. </em>On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Beasley argued that, rather than being charged under Section 139, which is a felony, he should have been charged with a misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>under Section 700A of Article 27. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 299 A.2d at 483. That Section specifically concerned work release programs and stated in part that, \u201c \u2018if any prisoner released from actual confinement under a work release plan shall willfully fail to return to the place of confinement so designated at the time specified in such plan, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to the penalties provided in \u00a7 139 of Article 27.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 299 A.2d at 484 (internal quotations omitted). Relying on <em>Shifflett, 4 </em>Md.App. at 230, 242 A.2d at 184, the Court of Special Appeals explained that, \u201cthe escape of a prisoner while in constructive custody under a work release program constitute^] an escape from a place of confinement in violation of \u00a7 139.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em>17 Md.App. at 11, 299 A.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In addition to the cases referred to by the Committee to Revise Article 27 as cases \u201cinterpreting former Art. 27 \u00a7 139,\u201d more recently we engaged in an extensive discussion of constructive custody in <em>Farris, </em>a case also interpreting Section 139. The issue presented was \u201cwhether the failure to report to the Allegany County Detention Center for weekend service of a prison sentence constitute^] the crime of escape as defined by Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 139.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>at 27, 716 A.2d at 239. Farris was convicted in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Allegany County, of possession of a controlled dangerous substance. <em>Id. </em>He was sentenced to ninety days incarceration, all suspended, with two years probation. <em>Id. </em>After violating probation, Farris was sentenced to ninety days incarceration with sixty days suspended and three years probation, thirty days to be served on weekends. <em>Id. </em>According to the District Court\u2019s commitment record, the specific terms of his sentence were, \u201c[T]otal time to be served is 30 days, to run concurrent with any other outstanding or unserved sentence and begin on May 3, 1996. Weekend service of sentence from 11 a.m. Friday till 11 a.m. Sunday for 15 consecutive weekends.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Farris began serving his sentence on Friday, May 3, 1996, but on Friday, June 21, 1996, he failed to appear at the local detention center. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the State charged him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>with escape, and after a bench trial, he was found guilty of that charge. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 716 A.2d at 239. Farris noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 716 A.2d at 239. We granted certiorari and reversed, concluding that under the circumstances of the case, Farris\u2019s failure to report on that Friday for weekend service did not constitute the crime of escape. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 38, 716 A.2d at 239, 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">With respect to constructive custody, \u201c[o]ur cases have recognized,\u201d we noted, \u201cthat a person, lawfully sentenced and committed to a jail or other place of confinement, may commit the physical act of escape within the meaning of Article 27, \u00a7 139 even though he or she was actually beyond the physical confines of the institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 716 A.2d at 241 (discussing our holdings in <em>Johnson, Taylor, Best, </em>and <em>Ford).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Farris, </em>we gleaned from these cases the following conclusion regarding the concept of constructive custody within the law of escape: \u201c[WJhen a person remains in lawful custody, departure from the boundaries which restrict that person\u2019s movements may constitute an escape.\u201d 351 Md. at 32, 716 A.2d at 241-42. Stated more concretely, \u201c[a] penal institution maintains \u2018constructive\u2019 custody when an individual is temporarily permitted to leave while still lawfully committed to that institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 716 A.2d at 240. Further, \u201c[p]risoners who remain in constructive custody are, at all times,\u201d we stated, \u201clawfully under sentence, committed to a specific institution, <em>and </em>subject to restrictions that define the boundaries from which an unauthorized departure constitutes an escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 716 A.2d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Applying these principles to the circumstances that were before us, we declared \u201cLtjhe dispositive issue\u201d to be whether Fanis\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the Allegany Detention Center for weekend service of his sentence constitute^] \u2018custody\u2019 or legal detention in a place of confinement during the weekday period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 716 A.2d at 242. From the following facts, we concluded that such custody did not exist during the week. \u201cDuring the week, [Farris] lived at his home. He received no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>credit against his sentence for the time spent at his home, and ... he was free from any restriction on his activity or movements during the time he was away from the detention center.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-35, 716 A.2d at 243. \u201cIn short, there were no bounds or limits on his activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 716 A.2d at 243. Thus, \u201c[b]ecause [Farris] was not in custody, he did not leave or physically depart from any place of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, his \u201cfailure to report to the detention center ... for the weekend incarceration [did] not constitute \u2018escape\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Our decision in <em>Farris, </em>in part, prompted the Legislature to amend Section 139 of Article 27 in 1999. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee explained in a Floor Report to Senate Bill 355 (which was \u201cidentical to House Bill 463\u201d) that the 1999 revision \u201cwas prompted by two events.\u201d \u201cFirst, the Correctional Services Article Code Revision Committee requested the Article 27 Committee to revise the laws concerning escape as they applied to the individual counties concerning temporary leave and home detention.\u201d \u201cSecondly,\u201d the Committee explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_H\">the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 716 A.2d 237 (1998) held that in Allegany County the failure of an individual to report for service of a week-end sentence was not escape or any other violation of criminal law. This reasoning applies to many of the other counties as well. This bill solves these problems , by making one uniform provision applicable to temporary leave and home detention in all counties. Secondly, it solves the <em>Farris </em>problem by making the failure to report to a correctional facility as required by a court order an escape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The Floor Report goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">[House Bill 463] further codifies existing law concerning escape while on leave or otherwise not in a correctional facility. Although the current statute only refers to escape from a correctional facility, case law has adopted the concept of constructive custody to apply this statute to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>who escape while on leave or are otherwise outside of the correctional facility (e.g., in a hospital).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Finally, the Floor Report declares</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6T\">This bill explicitly covers persons on leave. By defining escape to retain its judicially determined meaning, it also includes those taken out of a correctional facility for other reasons, such as to a hospital or court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">By retaining the judicially determined meaning for escape and recognizing that individuals must have been within the \u201cconfines\u201d of a facility or outside the walls of a correctional facility while on leave, the Legislature recognized that in prior cases, the individuals convicted of escape under the doctrine of constructive custody were first committed to and physically confined within a place of confinement before being allowed to depart for limited purposes, such as for work release or to receive medical attention at a hospital. We, therefore, conclude that for an individual to commit the crime of first degree escape within the concept of constructive custody, that individual must have been initially committed to and physically confined within a place of confinement. In other words, we agree with Boffen\u2019s contention that a place of confinement must first have actual custody over a person before it can have constructive custody. Because Boffen was neither committed to nor physically confined within any of the institutions of the DOC before he fled from the Wicomico County courtroom, we conclude that he did not escape from the constructive custody of a place of confinement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The State, however, directs our attention to the decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Briggs, </em>48 P.3d 686, 687 (2002). There, Briggs appeared for a revocation of probation hearing, after which the hearing judge revoked his probation and ordered the imposition of his original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 686-87. The judge told Briggs, \u201cHave a seat in the hallway, Mr. Briggs, we\u2019ll call for an officer. Consider yourself in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. After those instructions, Briggs fled the courthouse, was recaptured, and eventually was convicted of \u201caggravated escape\u201d under KAN. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 21-3810(a)(1)(2001), which provides in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ggravated escape from custody is: (a) Escaping while held in lawful custody (1) upon a charge or conviction of a felony</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Briggs appealed from that conviction, and the Court of Appeals of Kansas affirmed. In so doing, the Kansas court stated that the issue was whether the hearing judge\u2019s \u201corder to Briggs, after revoking his probation, \u2018Have a seat in the hallway, Mr. Briggs, we\u2019ll call for an officer. Consider yourself in custody.\u2019 put Briggs in lawful custody for purposes of a conviction for aggravated escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688. According to Kansas case law, the court noted, \u201c \u2018[cjustody contemplates an intent on the part of prison officials to exercise actual or constructive control.... The key factor is that prison officials have not evidenced an intent to abandon or give up their prisoner, leaving him free to go on his way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688 (quoting <em>State v. Pichon, </em>15 Kan.App.2d 527, 811 P.2d 517, 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>(1991)). The court then concluded that \u201c[c]ertainly, [the hearing judge\u2019s] intention was to place Briggs in custody for transportation to the county jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. \u201cFurther,\u201d the court observed, \u201cBriggs was in the custody of the court for probation revocation purposes, and the court had never released him from that custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court concluded that the hearing judge \u201cexercised actual or constructive control over Briggs and restrained his liberty by ordering him to the hall to await law enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBriggs was in custody,\u201d therefore, under the applicable Kansas statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">That case is readily distinguishable because the Kansas statute includes a definition of \u201ccustody\u201d not found in Maryland\u2019s statute. KAN. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 21-3809(b)(l) defines custody broadly. It states in part that custody \u201cmeans arrest\u201d and \u201cdetention\u201d in or \u201ccommitment\u201d to various specified institutions such as \u201ca facility for holding persons charged with or convicted of crimes,\u201d a \u201cfacility for holding persons adjudicated as juvenile offenders\u201d or \u201ca hospital or other facility pursuant to court order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Custody also includes, according to the statute, \u201cany other detention for law enforcement purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Custody is also defined under the Kansas statutory scheme as \u201cthe restraint of a person pursuant to an arrest or the order of a court or magistrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22-2202(9). Under this broad statute, the trial court told the defendant that he was in custody. Therefore, the States\u2019s reliance on <em>Briggs </em>is misplaced; the provisions of Maryland\u2019s first degree escape statute are not so broad.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Another escape case, we note, dealing with a defendant who has fled from a courtroom after sentencing but before actual confinement in any penal institution is <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>592 F.2d 1035 (9th Cir.1979). There, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Peterson\u2019s conviction for escape under Title 18, United States Code, Section 751(a). <em>Id. </em>That statute stated in part that \u201c[w]hoever escapes or attempts to escape ... from any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate ... shall ... be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both .... \u201d Having pled guilty and having been sentenced for a violation of a firearms law, Peterson moved for a stay of execution of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1035-36. In denying that motion, the trial court declared, \u201c[h]e will commence his sentence now,\u201d and because no marshal was in the courtroom, the court ordered Peterson\u2019s counsel to accompany Peterson to the marshal\u2019s office immediately. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. While on route, Peterson fled, and was subsequently convicted of escape. <em>Id. </em>In affirming that conviction, the Ninth Circuit noted that custody \u201ccan result from the willful failure to comply with a lawful order to custody orally given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1037. The court also noted that in light of the trial court\u2019s announcement that Peterson would \u201ccommence his sentence now,\u201d a person of ordinary intelligence and understanding would know that he was not free to leave under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) because he was in \u201ccustody under or by virtue of Any process issued under the laws of the United States by [a] court, [or] judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Unlike the federal statute, however, Sections 136 and 137 of Article 27 do not include provisions for first degree escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>when a \u201ccourt, judge, or magistrate\u201d issues process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, as discussed above, a person does not \u201cescape\u201d under Maryland law unless he or she departs from the actual or constructive custody of a \u201cplace of confinement.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In conclusion, we hold that Boffen\u2019s actions did not constitute the crime of first degree escape under Maryland law. This is so because Boffen, at the time he fled the courtroom, was not in the actual or constructive custody of a place of confinement. We shall therefore order that his conviction for first degree escape be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

We need not address here whether a person, who flees from a courtroom after a sentence of incarceration has been fully and finally pronounced and the person has been remanded to the custody of the sheriff or other appropriate law enforcement officer, may be properly charged with and convicted of first degree escape. In this case those conditions have not occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">. The State and Court of Special Appeals, we note, wisely rejected the Circuit Court's conclusion that Boffen was in the constructive custody of the Detention Center when he fled. Prior to his conviction, Boffen had been free on bail. On March 31, 2000, the Circuit Court conducted a bail review hearing and ordered that bail be set at $15,000. The next day, the Commissioner for Wicomico County signed a bail bond for that amount. On April 4, 2000, a \"Release from Commitment\u201d was filed with the Circuit Court, commanding the Detention Center to \"release [Boffen] subject to the following conditipns/restrictions: NONE.\u201d When Boffen was convicted, the Circuit Court ordered that he remain free on bail pending sentencing. As mentioned above, the Detention Center had been ordered to release Boffen unconditionally. Thus, he was not in the constructive custody of the Detention Center when he later fled from the sentencing hearing in the Wicomico County courtroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">. The <em>Stewart </em>Court also discussed constructive custody cases from the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Shifflett v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 227, 242 A.2d 182 (1968)(affirming conviction of escape under Section 139 when the defendant was committed to the Baltimore County Jail under lawful sentence and assigned to work as a \u201ctrusty\u201d in the Baltimore County magistrate\u2019s court, from which he \u201ctook leave\u201d); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 438, 441-42 306 A.2d 624, 626 (1973)(stating that Section 139 \"is a broadly based statute embracing within its purview <em>all escapes </em>from lawful confinement, whether the escape was initiated from within or without the walls or other boundaries of a penal facility; whether the confinement was actual or constructive; whether it was effected with or without force, and without regard to the circumstances of confinement if the detention was under color of law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">. In addition, Boffen was not yet committed to the DOC when the original sentencing judge stated, \"The sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u201d As the judge presiding over the escape trial correctly observed, no statement remanding Boffen to custody had been made by the original sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Further, Boffen left the courtroom before sentencing was complete. Certainly, the original sentencing judge could have suspended the 15 year sentence. According to Maryland Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 639(a)(l)(1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \"[t]he courts may suspend sentence generally or for a definite time, and may make such orders and impose such terms as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>costs, recognizance for appearance, or matters relating to the residence or conduct of the convicts as may be deemed proper</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">Finally, Boffen was also not subject \u201cto restrictions that definefd] the boundaries from which an unauthorized departure [would] constitute \u25a1 an escape\u201d when he fled from the courtroom. <em>Farris, </em>351 Md. at 34, 716 A.2d at 242. The institution that sets such restrictions must be a \"place of confinement\u201d as defined in the statute. Here, that would include the Detention Center or the institutions of the DOC, but neither of those places had yet prescribed where Boffen could go, when he could go there, how he could get there, or any other such restraints on his freedom. As we stated in <em>Farris, </em>\u201c[w]ithout some limits, which may be very narrow or somewhat broad, there can be no custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 716 A.2d at 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\">. For second degree escape, which Boffen was not charged with or eonvicted of, the Maryland statute does contain similar language. Art. 27, \u00a7 137A (a)(2) declares that, \u2018\u2018[a] person may not knowingly fail to obey a court order to report to a place of confinement.\" This language was added by the legislature in 1999 in response to our decision in <em>Fanis. See </em>Floor Report, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, House Bill 463 (1999). The language is \u201cintended to apply to an order to report for service of a weekend or other periodic sentence.\u201d Note of Committee to Revise Article 27, <em>printed in </em>Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 137A. There is no such sentence at issue in the instant case. Moreover, the District Court in <em>Farris, </em>unlike the court in the instant case, issued a \"Commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ment Record\u201d declaring when he was to serve his weekend sentence. 351 Md. at 27, 716 A.2d at 239. Also, Farris actually began serving that sentence, and then stopped. <em>Id. </em>Unlike Farris, when Boffen fled, he was not yet committed, and had been released from the only place to which he had been confined, i.e. the Wicomico County Detention Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\">. <em>See, supra, </em>note 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">. ' The <em>Peterson </em>case is also helpful in determining whether Boffen <em>\u201cknowingly </em>\u201d escaped from a place of confinement\u201d under Section 137 of Article 27 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit, after observing that custody may result from \"the willful failure to comply with a lawful order to custody lawfully given,\u201d found that in light of the trial court\u2019s pronouncement that Peterson\u2019s sentence was to begin \"now,\u201d that \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence and understanding would know that he was not free to leave; that he was[,] [under 18 U.S.C. 751(a)] [,] in \u2018custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by (a) court, (or) judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1037. The same cannot be said of the present case, even if Maryland\u2019s escape statute provided that a person is in \"custody\u201d for purposes of escape when a \u201ccourt, judge, or magistrate\u201d issues process. The sentencing judge here merely stated that, \"[t]he sentence under count number one is fifteen years to the Division of Correction.\u201d That is not enough, in our opinion, for a person of ordinary intelligence and understanding to know at that moment that he or she was in custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
