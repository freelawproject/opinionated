The petitioner was found not guilty of second degree depraved heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, and child abuse. He was convicted, however, of reckless endangerment, for which he was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment. After unsuccessfully appealing his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, the petitioner filed a petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, which we granted. <em>Andrews v. State, </em>362 Md. 34, 762 A.2d 968 (2000). In this Court, the petitioner argues that the trial court erred by allowing a demonstration, using a doll that did not have the same characteristics as the infant child alleged to have been shaken, to be conducted before the jury for the purpose of showing the amount of force necessary to cause an injury associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome, and by permitting the expert witness, called by the respondent, the State of Maryland, to testify on the basis of that demonstration. We agree. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">As acknowledged by the State, the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>are largely undisputed. Kristin Andrews was bom prematurely, at a gestational age of 23&amp; weeks,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> weighing only one pound and eight ounces, in Mercy Hospital on May 6, 1997. As a result, she was plagued with severe health complications, including intraventricular brain hemorrhage, sustained at birth, patent ductus arteriosus (a hole in the heart), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Kristin required eight blood transfusions as a result of anemia of prematurity. In addition, Kristin suffered from periodic bouts of apnea, a cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or more, and bradycardia, a slowing of the heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute. Kristin was also treated for an e-coli infection and monitored for retinopathy of prematurity, a condition in which blood vessels to the eye develop abnormally, resulting in the eye becoming engorged, possibly leading to detachment of the retina. She was unable to self-feed and required an arterial line to the umbilicus for formula, antibiotics and fluids.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Kristin remained hospitalized for a period of 89 days after birth, requiring during that period, numerous medications and medical equipment. Due to the Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by the premature development of her lungs, she required an artificial surfactant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to prevent lung collapse; medication to stimulate the brain center to breathe; a diuretic to prevent pulmonary edema; a powerful steroid to decrease inflammation of the lungs; and supplemental oxygen to assist her breathing. Her first 28 days of life were spent in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The remainder of Kristin\u2019s hospital stay was spent in the Stepdown Unit, which was one level higher than a traditional newborn nursery. Throughout her hospitalization, Kristin was under constant monitoring as a result of apnea and bradycardia attacks. Some of those attacks required medical intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The petitioner and Debbie Young, Kristin\u2019s mother and the petitioner\u2019s fiance, visited their daughter daily while she was hospitalized. Testimony adduced at trial indicated that both parents bonded strongly with Kristin and that, the petitioner, Ms. Young, Ms. Young\u2019s seven-year old son and Kristin appeared to be a caring and loving family.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Kristin was discharged from the hospital on August 2, 1997, about the same time she would have been born at full-term. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Although she was allowed to leave the hospital, she continued to have health problems associated with her premature birth: Kristin was diagnosed as having bronchial pulmonary dysplasia, damage to the lungs associated with Respiratory Distress Syndrome in premature infants. Thus, Kristin was sent home with a 24-hour a day monitor and instructions for the continued administration of medication designed to stimulate breathing. Both of her parents were instructed in the use of the monitor and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of infants. The record indicates that the leads to the monitor sometimes became detached, which would trigger an alarm. In addition, the monitor would sound an alarm when the memory was full indicating that the monitor, required servicing. The alarms resulting from a loose lead or a full memory are different from the alarm sounded when triggered by an apnea event. Nevertheless, whenever an alarm sounded, the petitioner or whoever was caring for her would have to check on Kristin to determine whether the alert from the monitor was a false alarm or a true alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Kristin also required on-going medical evaluation. In one such followup examination, Kristin\u2019s doctor noted that she exhibited abnormally rigid muscle tone which suggested a brain injury that may become more apparent as Kristin developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">As a consequence of Kristin\u2019s need for heightened medical care and attention that her parents had been trained to provide, the petitioner and Ms. Young agreed that, because Ms. Young, a nursing assistant, earned a higher salary than petitioner, she would keep her job and the petitioner would quit his employment and care for their daughter full time. AlS a result, the petitioner acted as Kristin\u2019s primary caretaker from the moment she was discharged from the hospital until her death. The record indicates that the petitioner took Kristin to all of her followup examinations with her doctors. During this time, Kristin\u2019s weight increased to eleven and-a-half pounds, which was characterized as excellent weight gain. Kristin\u2019s last recorded apnea event took place on September 5, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In October of 1997, Ms. Young was offered a position as a medical assistant with Kaiser Permanente. Although the position was located in Towson, Maryland and the family resided in Baltimore County, acceptance of the job was dependent on Ms. Young traveling to Rockville, Maryland for a three-day training seminar. Ms. Young being unfamiliar with the Rockville area, the petitioner and Ms. Young agreed that the petitioner would drive Ms. Young to the training seminar. Due to financial difficulties, however, to avoid wasting gas making the return trip to Baltimore and back to Rockville to pick Ms. Young up at the conclusion of the training and concerned that no one would be available to pick up Ms. Young\u2019s seven-year old son after school, the couple also decided that the entire family would accompany Ms. Young to Rockville and would remain there the entire day while Ms. Young attended the training seminar.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The family left for Rockville at about 6:00 a.m. on October 27, 1997 and arrived at the Kaiser Permanente garage at approximately 8:00 a.m. The leads from Kristin\u2019s monitor detached several times that morning, causing the monitor to sound an alarm. The petitioner remained in the car with the two children. During a break in the training session, between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., Ms. Young returned to the car to check in on the family. She testified that all was well during this visit which lasted approximately fifteen minutes. Ms. Young returned to the car shortly after noon, when she received her lunch break. She testified that, once again, the entire family appeared fine and that no one seemed frustrated by the wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The petitioner fed Kristin a bottle and burped her at approximately 2:45 p.m. At the conclusion of the feeding, according to accounts given by the petitioner to medical personnel, Kristin began choking and stopped breathing. Testimony at trial also indicated that the petitioner informed the medical personnel that he had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate Kristin by performing CPR and shaking her gently. A passerby in the garage, flagged by petitioner, was able to place a call from the garage office to 911 at 2:54 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The log on Kristin\u2019s monitor indicated that between 11:05 a.m. and 2:59 p.m. the monitor had registered 20 \u201cloose lead\u201d alarms and 16 \u201cfull memory\u201d alarms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The last loose lead alarm occurred at approximately 2:47 p.m. and lasted until the monitor was turned off at 2:59 p.m. Emergency medical technician, Captain Michael Prete, arrived at the scene at approximately 2:59 p.m. Captain Prete noticed that Kristin was lying on the back seat of the vehicle, unconscious, not breathing with some blueness around her lips, indicating a lack of oxygen in the body. Captain Prete unsuccessfully attempted to arouse Kristin by tapping her on the feet. He then covered her nose and mouth with his mouth and blew two breaths of air into Kristin\u2019s lungs. At this point, Captain Prete noticed a rise and fall in Kristin\u2019s chest and that she began to vomit a milky substance. Unable to detect a pulse, Captain Prete then began CPR and proceeded to transfer her by ambulance to Shady Grove Adventist Hospital. During the ambulance ride, Prete noted that he was able to stimulate a spontaneous pulse in Kristin, however, she never breathed on her own and required the assistance of an \u201cambu-bag\u201d which contained 100 percent oxygen. Although, Kristin vomited a couple more times in the ambulance, the emergency technicians were able to keep her airways clear. The technician administered epinephrine, a medication designed to increase Kristin\u2019s slow ventricular heart rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Arriving at the hospital at 3:18 p.m., the hospital personnel immediately suctioned milk and vomitus from Kristin\u2019s airways. Kristin\u2019s eyes and body were unresponsive to light or touch. She was wheezing and her hands and feet were blue. Dr. Rebecca Salness, a pediatric emergency physician, and Dr. Allison Goodman, a pediatric intensive care physician, unsuccessfully continued CPR and the administration of various medicines for more than two hours. Nevertheless, Kristin never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 5:25 p.m. Dr. Salness recorded her diagnostic impression as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>electro-mechanical disassociation (pulseless electrical activity, and consequently, no circulation), aspiration vomitus (inhaled vomit, or milk in the breathing system blocked, totally or partially, the airway); complications of respiratory problems associated with premature birth, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (clotting problem caused by oxygen deprivation to the brain) and cardiorespiratory arrest (heart and breathing stopped). Dr. Salness testified at trial that the chances of survival for a child after a choking event similar to Kristin\u2019s was \u201cvery good\u201d if CPR is administered soon after. She further indicated that patients usually respond to the CPR quickly or would \u201cdie within 30 minutes or maybe an hour,\u201d and that it was unusual to perform CPR on a person for as long as they had on Kristin.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">An autopsy was performed on Kristin\u2019s body the day after her death. Dr. James Laren Locke was the assistant medical examiner on duty that day. The autopsy of Kristin Andrews was initiated by Dr. Ling Lee, a post graduate research pathologist with a special interest in research into Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS); however, it was completed by Dr. Locke.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Locke testified that a technician cut and removed Kristin\u2019s skullcap, and that \u201c40 to 50 milliliters of blood,\u201d in fluid form, escaped as the skull cap was removed, a \u201cvery little\u201d amount being captured in a specimen cup. Dr. Locke believed the presence of the blood to be evidence of an acute and recent subdural hemorrhage. He also noted a subarachnoid hemorrhage of the brain which he also thought was recent, and bruising along the optic nerve sheath. Dr. Locke did not obtain complete medical records for Kristin and was unaware that she had been diagnosed with intraventricular hemorrhaging in her brain while in Mercy Hospital. He was further unaware that Kristin was evaluated for retinopathy of prematurity and that there had been blood in a spinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tap (which can indicate blood in the subarachnoid space in the brain) done at Mercy Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">Having marked on the death certificate that the cause of death was \u201cpending,\u201d Dr. Locke consulted with two pathology specialists, Dr. Juan Troncosa, a neuropathologist and Dr. W. Richard Green, an ophthalmologic pathologist, advising them of what he knew and of his conclusions. On November 12, 1997, without obtaining Kristin\u2019s medical records or waiting for the reports from the pathology specialists, he changed the cause of death on Kristin\u2019s death certificate from \u201cpending investigation\u201d to \u201chomicide,\u201d \u201chead trauma as a result of shaking.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The petitioner was subsequently arrested and charged with the murder of his infant daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">At the petitioner\u2019s trial, Dr. Locke was accepted as an expert witness for the prosecution, over defense objections. He testified that he had determined the cause of Kristin\u2019s death to be consistent with \u201cShaken B\u00e1by Syndrome.\u201d He further testified that, in his determination, the cause of Kristin\u2019s death was inconsistent with any other findings. Although Dr. Troncosa, the neuropathologist, was not called as a witness, Dr. Locke did testify as to the contents of the report that he wrote. That report disagreed with Dr. Locke and, instead, concluded that there was no evidence of a recent subdural hemmorrhage, as Dr. Locke had concluded as a result of the autopsy he conducted. The neuropathology report further concluded that there was no evidence of a swelling, tearing or bruising of the brain or shifting of the brain tissue. Dr. Locke also acknowledged that the neuropathologist had examined the spinal cord and the cervical medullary junction (where the spinal cord meets the brain), two areas susceptible to injury from shaking, but found no signs of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Dr. W. Richard Green, the consulting ophthalmologic pathologist, testified at trial as an expert in ophthalmology and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>pathology. He stated that, based on the post-mortem examination of Kristin\u2019s eyes, he noticed evidence of internal and external hemorrhaging of the optic nerve, hemorrhaging of the retina, and bleeding in the circumferential macula folds of the eyes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Green testified that the specimen showed massive, diffuse hemorrhages in both eyes, which he believed occurred at least 6 days prior to Kristin\u2019s death, perhaps more. Concluding that Kristin\u2019s injuries could have resulted in two ways: (i) increased intervascular pressure as a result of chest compressions; or (ii) Shaken Baby Syndrome, Dr. Green\u2019s determined that the results of the examination were consistent with a diagnosis of Shaken Baby Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Dr. Green did not believe that the chest compressions used in CPR could result in the type of injuries sustained by Kristin, but acknowledged that some studies had shown that CPR compressions can cause retinal hemorrhages in children. Dr. Green discounted the possibility that hemorrhaging found in Kristin\u2019s sample were produced by CPR because he had never seen the degree or pattern of hemorrhaging found in Kristin\u2019s specimen with any of the cases he examined after \u201cvigorous CPR.\u201d Dr. Green acknowledged that in the cases he referred to, the CPR lasted about 30 minutes, whereas the CPR on Kristin lasted almost two and a half hours. He also acknowledged that none of the 76 child eye pathology exams he had done for the medical examiner involved premature infants, and none involved infants with a history of retinopothy of prematurity. Dr. Green further testified that the force of the chest compressions required to cause retinal bleeding would be less on the supple chest of a neonate.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The prosecution called Dr. Barbara Craig as its final expert witness. Accepted as an expert in pediatrics, child abuse and the anatomy and physiology of head injuries in children, Dr. Craig opined that Kristin\u2019s death resulted from Shaken Baby Syndrome. She testified that the minimal criteria to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the forensic medical diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome would be: (i) a baby who was well who suddenly became unconscious; (ii) the subdural hemorrhage described by Dr. Locke and the subarachnoid hemorrhage shown by the autopsy of the brain; and (iii) the absence of any major head injury, such as that caused by, for example, a car accident. She further stated that retinal hemorrhages are not a necessary factor in the diagnosis, but can result from Shaken Baby Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The defense called both fact and character witnesses and three expert witnesses. Dr. Michael Baden was accepted as an expert witness in the area of pathology, forensic pathology and child abuse for the defense. He testified that, in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Kristin\u2019s death was not the result of Shaken Baby Syndrome. Dr. Baden opined that Kristin\u2019s death was a result of choking on her formula resulting in an apnea and bradycardia event from which she did not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Dr. Baden\u2019s opinion was based on his review of Kristin\u2019s complete'medical history, including some 700 pages of records from her initial hospitalization at Mercy Hospital following birth, her pediatric records and ophthalmology records, the printouts from Kristin\u2019s monitor, the reports from the consulting specialists, the autopsy report, tissue slides, photographs and police reports. From these records, he concluded that Kristin suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth, severe anemia (Kristin had less than a third of the red blood cells that she should have had), abnormal blood vessels in the retina because of the prematurity, and severe episodes of apnea and bradycardia. Dr. Baden submitted that the physicians at Mercy Hospital were able to stabilize Kristin for 89 days and that she lived for an additional 85 days thereafter; however, he concluded that she was nevertheless still a very sick child. Dr. Baden agreed with the conclusion of the emergency room physician, that Kristin\u2019s death was a result of cardiac arrest and pulmonary arrest triggered by choking on vomitus. Dr. Baden\u2019s conclusions were also consistent with (i) the account given by the petitioner to the emergency room personnel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(ii) the treating physician\u2019s attempts to remove vomitus from Kristin\u2019s airways.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Dr. Baden expressly disagreed with the conclusion reached by Dr. Locke that Kristin\u2019s death was caused by the subdural hemorrhage. He opined that the blood that escaped during the autopsy of Kristin\u2019s brain was the result of post-mortem bleeding and not a subdural hemorrhage. Dr. Baden testified that he disagreed with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cthe transient observation of the pathologist who saw the subdural, and in no way documented it, and [in] ... my own experience [of] over 39 years, that it is a common mistake beginners make to misinterpret accumulations of blood in the back of the scalp with a subdural hemorrhage because of the post-mortem seepage of blood after the dura is cut.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\">Dr. Baden noted that subdural hemorrhages do not appear in liquid form at the autopsy, rather they appear as clotted blood, which can be photographed and examined. In addition, a death resulting from a subdural hemorrhage would show signs of swelling. The post-mortem examination, consistent with the obseiwations of the treating emergency room physicians, indicated no evidence of swelling. Dr. Baden concluded that the CPR efforts used to resuscitate Kristin could account for any abnormality in the brain and eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In addition to Dr. Baden\u2019s testimony, the defense presented an expert in ophthalmologic pathology and ophthalmological findings associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome and an expert in neurologic traumatic injury of the head and neck. Both experts agreed with Dr. Baden that Kristin\u2019s death was not a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, but rather, was the result of a lack of oxygen caused by choking.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Against this background of conflicting expert testimony, the prosecution was allowed to conduct an in-court demonstration. The demonstration \u2014 intended to show the force necessary to cause Shaken Baby Syndrome \u2014 was performed before the jury, using a doll designed for infant CPR training, by Dr. Barbara Craig. Defense counsel objected to the use of the CPR doll, arguing that the prosecution had not laid a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>foundation, either a showing of a sufficient similarity between the doll and Kristin or that Dr. Craig possessed the expertise to demonstrate the amount of shaking force required to cause the injuries. The trial court rejected defense counsel\u2019s request for an <em>in camera voir dire </em>of Dr. Craig. Deferring its ruling until the prosecution had established the foundation, it believed that Dr. Craig\u2019s basis of knowledge \u201cwould go to the weight rather than the admissibility of any demonstration,\u201d and, thus, should be challenged by cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Although the prosecutor argued that the foundation for the demonstration had been laid, offering two reasons: (i) the nurse from Shady Grove Hospital who testified had demonstrated a gentle shaking motion which Petitioner had shown her to explain how he had attempted to stimulate Kristin to begin breathing; and (ii) Dr. Craig had already laid a foundation by her testimony about her review of pertinent studies, her attendance at seminars, and her knowledge of biomechanics, the trial court informed him that he had \u201cto ask her how she is able to determine the amount of force, her basis of knowledge.\u201d This prompted the prosecutor to inquire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cQ [PROSECUTOR]: And now by way of kind of defining what you mean by violent shaking, I want to ask you a couple of foundational questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cWhen you talk about the shaking that is necessary to cause these injuries, I guess I am getting to the basis of your knowledge for how much shaking would be involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cSo let me start by saying is that issue, the degree of force necessary to cause injuries like the one you have listed, is that something that is within the literature in the field of child abuse and head injuries in children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201cA [DR. CRAIG]: Yes. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\u201cQ: Is that same issue, the degree of force necessary for these injuries, something that is a topic of scholarly publishing and conversation and debate in the context of national seminars as well as more localized seminars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">\u201cA: Yes. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cQ: Is it an issue that you discuss with your peers in the field?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cA: Yes. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cQ: Is it an issue that you have had some knowledge about from your treatment of surviving children from Shaken Baby Syndrome and the manifestation of injury that they have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cA: Yes. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201cQ: And have you had the occasion to review the findings of the autopsies and studies that stem from autopsies when it comes to the amount of force necessary to cause these types of injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cA: Yes. I have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The trial judge then ruled, based on this testimony, that Dr. Craig could demonstrate the amount of force necessary to cause Shaken Baby Syndrome by using the CPR doll. Defense counsel renewed his objection, reiterating at a bench conference that he did not believe a proper foundation had been laid. He detailed his reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There has been no evidence that this doctor has testified about that she is aware of actual studies that show how much force is necessary. \u201cAnd, in fact, the only study has [sic] been done again suggests that the force \u2014 simply a shaking is not sufficient to cause the injuries she has described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">\u201cShe has not testified that Kristin Andrews\u2019 physical condition is sufficiently similar to the doll that is going to be used both in her size, weight, and the relationship between her weight and size and her head, the development of the neck in the doll with the neck in Kristin Andrews \u2014 all of those factors she has not testified about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">\u201cShe has not talked at all about any principles of physics that would lead her to the basis to think that she could have an actual opinion of shaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">\u201cShe has not said that she had people who have shaken children describing how violently they are or that that has been described in the literature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cShe has not done anything [sic] of those things, and for that reason, I do not believe that it is an expert opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u25a0The trial judge reiterated her previous ruling: \u201cThat would go to the weight of [the expert\u2019s] opinion rather than the admissibility of the demonstration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Thereafter, the following colloquy occurred in front of the jury prior to the actual demonstration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u201cQ [PROSECUTOR]: Now we have used this doll, State\u2019s exhibit 6, for purposes of talking about CPR. And I want to ask you first of all \u2014 and this is compared to babies in general and then compared to Kristin Andrews \u2014 can you tell us what the similarities and differences are .by the way of weight and flexibility of this doll compared to an actual baby in the condition of Kristin Andrews?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cA [DR. CRAIG]: Can I pick it up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">\u201cQ: Yes please. Sorry. I did not mean to leave it there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">\u201cA: The doll is much lighter than 11/6 pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">\u201cA: This feels like [it] probably weighs about 3 or 4 pounds. So this doll is lighter, and it does not feel as heavy as a baby that would weigh 11/6, which is how Kristin weighed when she died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">\u201cQ: What about the neck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-13\">\u201cA: And this baby\u2019s neck does not really move when you\u2014 when you gently move it back and forth.

Specifically, Dr. Craig acknowledged that based on her \u201cadjusted age\u201d of 3 months, Kristin was in the 90th percentile for head circumference, the 5th percentile for height, and the 60th percentile for weight, signifying an \u201cextremely large disproportion\u201d between the size of her head and the length of her body, and a significant disproportion between the weight of her head and the weight of her body. Dr. Craig also agreed that there was considerable difference between the doll and Kristin in the strength of the neck muscles. Furthermore, Dr. Craig admitted that there had only been one study of Shaken Baby Syndrome using a bio-mechanical model (a doll with sensors in the head to measure the force of various trauma)-the 1992 study by Dr. Christina Duhaime, a neurosurgeon from the Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Dr. Lawrence Theobald, an expert in physics at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Craig admitted that the results of that study were that Shaken Baby Syndrome could not be caused by shaking alone, but rather it must coalesce with some impact trauma to produce such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Concluding cross-examination was the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cQ [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ...

This Court has applied these general principles to demonstrations involving objects and required that the party seeking to utilize the demonstration make a preliminary showing that what the demonstration is expected to establish is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the facts and circumstances at issue. <em>See O\u2019Doherty v.

As we see it, the \u201csubstantially similar\u201d requirement gives effect to the initial relevance determination required of all evidence by Md Rule 5-402. Without the substantially similar requirement serving as a gatekeeper to the admission of demonstrative evidence, the net effect would be the admission of all demonstrative evidence, whether relevant or irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">As the petitioner notes in his brief, the \u201capplication of the general principle of \u2018essential similarity of conditions\u2019 is more difficult when what is involved is not objects, but people.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 30). Illustrating the conflicting decisions, from other jurisdictions, with respect to this area of the law, he draws our attention to <em>United States v. Gaskell, </em>985 F.2d 1056 (11th Cir.1993) and <em>State v. Candela, </em>929 S.W.2d 852 (Mo.App.1996). The petitioner urges this Court to adopt the rule applied in <em>Gaskell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In <em>Gaskell, </em>a case with substantially similar facts to the case <em>sub judice, </em>Robert Gaskell, the accused, was alleged to have caused the death of his infant daughter, Kristen, as a result of, <em>inter alia, </em>Shaken Baby Syndrome. Over the objection of defense counsel, the government was allowed to have its expert witness conduct a demonstration, for the jury, of Shaken Baby Syndrome using a rubber mannequin designed for the practice of infant CPR techniques. On appeal, Gaskell argued that the demonstration using the rubber mannequin was \u201cirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\u201d 985 F.2d 1056, 1060. After stating the general principle that the \u201cdistrict court has wide discretion to admit evidence of experiments conducted under substantially similar circumstances,\u201d the court made clear that the \u201cburden is on the party offering a courtroom demonstration or experiment to lay a proper foundation establishing a.similarity of circumstances and conditions.\u201d <em>Id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>citing Barnes v. General Motors Corp., </em>547 F.2d 275, 277 (5th Cir.1977); <em>accord Jackson v. Fletcher, </em>647 F.2d 1020, 1027 (10th Cir.1981) (\u201cThe party introducing the evidence [of an experiment] has a burden of demonstrating substantial similarity of conditions. They may not be identical but they ought to be sufficiently similar so as to provide a fair comparison.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The 11th Circuit concluded that the government failed to meet its burden of establishing substantial similarity of conditions <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that the prejudice resulting from the demonstration outweighed any probative value it might have. <em>Gaskell, </em>985 F.2d at 1061. The court was not persuaded by the government\u2019s argument that cautionary instructions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>jury cured the prejudice and concluded that \u201cthe ability to cross examine is not a substitute for the offering party\u2019s burden of showing that a proffered demonstration or experiment offers a fair comparison of the contested events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In contrast to the ruling in <em>Gaskell, </em>in <em>Candela </em>an intermediate appellate court in Missouri held that a demonstration of Shaken Baby Syndrome using a rag doll was properly admitted, where the defense counsel had the opportunity to point out to the jury the differences between the victim and the doll. The Missouri court\u2019s ruling was based on the determination that the demonstration Was for illustrative purposes only and was not admitted for the purpose of showing what was alleged to have actually happened. <em>See Candela, </em>929 S.W.2d at 867. In a similar case, a Georgia court also adopted the rationale of <em>Candela, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cObviously, a demonstration of how shaken infant syndrome occurs would have to be done with a mannequin or a doll rather than a real infant. Such objects will differ in many respects from a real child. However, any dissimilarity between the conditions of the demonstration and the actual occurrence affects the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\"><em>Powell v. State, </em>226 Ga.App. 861, 863-864, 487 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1997). <em>See also Minor v. State, </em>780 So.2d 707 (Ala.Crim.App. 1999), in which, finding <em>Candela </em>more persuasive, the Supreme Court of Alabama distinguished <em>Gaskell </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cIn <em>Gaskell, </em>unlike this case, defense counsel specifically objected to the degree of force used in the demonstration; the witness said he based his presentation on a demonstration by a police officer whose knowledge was derived from a father in another case; the witness admitted he displayed a greater degree of force than that required to produce shaken baby syndrome; Gaskell had admitted shaking the child, though for.resuscitation purposes, making the issue of the amount of force actually used critical; and, the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tion was not reversed solely on the demonstration, but also on two other errors in the trial of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 763-764.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Apparently, agreeing with the reasoning of <em>Candela </em>and <em>Powell, </em>the trial court, as we have seen, admitted the demonstration. We decline to follow suit, believing the <em>Gaskell </em>holding and rationale to be consistent with Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">We have stated, <em>supra, </em>that before demonstrative evidence is admitted, \u201cthere must be <em>\u2018ample evidence </em>\u2019 that the item offered is <em>substantially similar </em>to the item that actually played a part in the events at issue.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 66, 702 A.2d at 722, (emphasis added), <em>citing Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 732, 506 A.2d at 603. The test is the same when, rather than an item, the subject of dispute is an event. Consequently, as a threshold matter, the trial court was required to determine whether the State had met its burden in establishing that the demonstration would be substantially similar to the event in question, namely approximating the amount of force \u201can adult would be required to use to inflict the injuries sustained by Kristin Andrews.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief at 8). The trial court abdicated its duty in determining the threshold issue and, instead, after consideration of the holdings in <em>Gaskell, Candela </em>and <em>Powell, </em>determined that the differences \u201cwould go to the weight of [Dr. Craig\u2019s] opinion rather than the admissibility of the demonstration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court allowed the State to proceed with the demonstration with a presumption and acknowledgment of <em>dissimilarity, </em>thus relieving the burden on the State to establish the demonstration\u2019s substantial similarity to the facts at issue. We conclude that the differences between the doll and the victim were not insignificant, but, rather, were substantially material to the determination of the amount of force necessary to constitute Shaken Baby Syndrome. The net effect of allowing the State to proceed with a presumption of dissimilarity was to weaken the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tioner\u2019s ability to challenge the demonstration on cross-examination. The exchange between the prosecutor and Dr. Craig, on direct examination, specifically highlighted and noted the differences of the demonstration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During cross-examination, defense counsel did manage to highlight more specific differences between the doll and Kristin\u2019s proportional ratio of head to body, both in weight and circumference; however, the jury had already been fully apprised of the fundamental differences on direct examination. We agree with the <em>Gaskell </em>court where it stated \u201c[t]he ability to cross-examine is not a substitute for the offering party\u2019s burden of showing that a proffered demonstration or experiment offers a fair comparison to the contested events.\u201d <em>Gaskell, </em>985 F.2d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Th\u00e9 Court of Special Appeals attempted to distinguish the case <em>sub judice </em>from <em>Gaskell </em>on the basis that the demonstration in petitioner\u2019s trial was \u201cnot [to] show Kristin\u2019s head or neck movements during the shaking, [r]ather, the doctor sought to illustrate the amount of adult force and degree of shaking that she contended was necessary to cause Kristin\u2019s injuries.\u201d We are not persuaded. That the \u201cfederal court based its ruling on the fact that the doctor had to display a greater degree of force than the level required to produce shaken baby syndrome <em>due to the characteristics of the doll that was used\u201d </em>rather than supporting the distinction the intermediate appellate court seeks to draw, actually supports the petitioner\u2019s argument. Dr. Craig testified on direct examination that the doll\u2019s neck \u201cdoes not really move,\u201d consequently, any amount of force used by Dr. Craig to conduct the demonstration was an unfair comparison when viewed in light of the alleged events.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Finally, the petitioner argues that the demonstration using the doll may have misled the jury. We agree. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>laying a proper foundation that the in-court demonstration would be substantially similar to the events related to Kristin\u2019s death, the demonstration was irrelevant as a matter of law. As the <em>Gaskell </em>decision noted, \u201cseveral circuits have recognized that demonstrative exhibits tend to leave a particularly potent image in the jurors\u2019 minds.\u201d <em>Gaskell, </em>985 F.2d at 1061 n. 2, <em>citing United States v. Wanoskia, </em>800 F.2d 235, 237-238 (10th Cir.1986); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 579 (5th Cir.1982). That the jurors may have relied upon this demonstration in their deliberation may have prejudiced the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">After taking notice of defense counsel\u2019s repeated objection to the demonstration, the trial court issued a cautionary instruction to the jury acknowledging that the demonstration was not an \u201caccurate re-enactment\u201d and only an opinion. We are not persuaded that the cautionary instruction cured any possible prejudice suffered by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred by allowing the demonstration conducted by Dr. Craig without requiring the State to establish the substantial similarity between the in-court demonstration and the event at issue. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The federal court stated \u201cthe conditions of the demonstration ... were not sufficiently similar to the alleged actions of the defendant to allow a fair comparison. As noted by defense counsel in her objection, due to differences in the weight of the doll\u2019s head as well as the flexibility and length of the doll's neck, a considerably greater degree of force was required in order to produce the head movement characteristic of shaken baby syndrome. As the party offering the evidence, the burden was on the government to show that the conditions of [the expert\u2019s] demonstration were sufficiently similar to the circumstances of the [victim's] death to afford a comparison. Based on the differences enumerated by defense counsel, the government failed to meet its burden. [The expert] admitted that the doll's neck was stiffer than that of a seven-month old infant and that this would affect the degree of force necessary to move the head in the required fashion. [The expert] explained that his presentation was based on a demonstration of shaken baby syndrome by a police officer whose knowledge was derived from the confession of a father in an unrelated case. Although an expert may rely upon hearsay as the basis for his or her opinion if the out of court statements are 'of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field,\u2019 the government did not establish that [the expert\u2019s] hearsay knowledge of this unrelated case provided any reliable or accurate basis upon which to draw conclusions regarding [the victim's] death. Further, although [the expert] repeatedly shook the doll before the jury, he was unable to state the number of oscillations required to produce the [victim's] injuries. The conditions of the demonstration were thus substantially <em>dissimilar; </em>the government failed to establish that either the degree of force or the number of oscillations bore any relationship to the defendant's actions.
