An injunction against the continuance of the-obstructions was. proposed by the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The essentia! question to be decided is Whether thie defendants are entitled to -interfer'e with the plaintiff\u2019\u00ae use of -alleys which -are alleged by the bill and admitted by the demurrer to have been in -existence -at the time of-the purchase of hi\u00ae lot and to have been represented by .the defendants to be appurtenianit ways passing under the conveyance. It is not necessary to- -discuss the -contention that such an eaisement cannot be created or transferred by -oral .agreement, or to determine that -the general grant of 'all appurtenant ways included the alleys iu litigation. It i\u00ae sufficient to inquire whether\u2019 a court of equity can ipiermit the defendants to obstruct an existing way upon -the use of which, as the bill avers, .they induced their grantee to- rely as a material consideration for his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Iu <em>Tiffany on Real Property, </em>sec. 366 (o) it is said: \u201cIf, in order to effect a sale of land, the intending vendor -states that there is a street or way adjacent to or near the land, or an easement 'appurtenant thereto, .and on the faith of such statement the purchase is made, the vendor is ordinarily estopped to deny the existence of the way, street or other easement, &gt;amd the sarnie 'effect ha\u00ae occasionally been given to the exhibition by the vendor to the vendee, before the sale, of a plat showing a particular street or way as existing in connection with the property.\u201d One of 'the cases cited in sup&gt;port of that statement was <em>Mattes v. Frankel, </em>157 N. Y. 603, where a purchaser of land relied upon a representation of the vendor that an existing way was appurtenant to the property sold, -and the vendor wais held to be estopped to deny the vendee\u2019s right to the use of the way. The fact that the question related to an interest in real estate was held not to prevent the operation of the estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The representation alleged in the bill of complaint in this case did not refer to the creation of any new way, but designated way\u00ae already iu existence. It would be inequitable, iu our opinion, to allow the grantors to destroy or obstruct .an apparent easement which they represented to be appurtenant to land purchased from them upon the faith of that assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The bill does not state that the defendants, when they m-ada their conveyance to the plaintiff, were -the owner\u00ae of the ground over which the alley\u00ae in question extended, or were themselves entitled te use the 'alley\u00ae for the benefit of the lot to which 'they are said' to be appurtenant. Because-of this omission it is argued that the disputed right, alleged to have been derived from the defendants, doie\u00ae not appear to- be maintainable. We are unaible to accept -that theory. If it be aEBumied that the defendant\u00ae had no interest in the-alleys which, as the bill state\u00ae, they .asserted to. be appurtenant -to the lot -they were conveying, it is nevertheless clear-that they would have no.- right to oppose the. use of the alleys-by a vendee of the lot who was induced by that representation to consummate hi\u00ae purchase. The principle of estoppel would he readily available and effective to defeat the attempted interference <em>under </em>-such conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The -allegiaitions of the bill present a ease in which relief by injunction will be -appropriate if the stated facts are-proved. <em>Duvall v.
