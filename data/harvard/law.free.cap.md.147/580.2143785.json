On default under the covenants and conditions of said mortgage, appellee, on Dteteember 22nd, 1923, instituted foreiafosiur\u00a9 proceedings, and on Eehruary 6th, 1924-, .-after due advertisement, slold to tibe International Blank of Washington, Dl -0., the -holder of a majority of the mortgage bond's!, for $65,000, \u201call of the real and' leasehold estate, plant, equipment, structures, improve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>meats, nmchinery, fixtures, patents and all other property covered by said mortgage, being, -and constituting the plant of 'the Delion Tire -and Eubber Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Included in the machinery and equipment w\u00e9re certain articles purchased after the date of the mortgage, which appellant claimed were personal Chattels, and which had subsequently been conveyed <em>to </em>the mortgagee, \u00a1and to these he publicly claimed title -at the sale and protested \u00a1against their sale by appellee. O-n the sale being reported he filed exceptions to- its ratification. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The trial court in its opinion -separated these articles into three Masses, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">1. Machinery and equipment physically affixed to the realty casting $2,628.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">2. Eings, molds -and cores, -costing $11,126.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">3. Furniture and -office fixtures -and equipment costing $419.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">The first and second classes the learned chancellor held to be fixtures, which went with the real estate under the mortgage. The third he held to be merely personal -chattels not subject to the mortgage, and he found the value thereof to be $315, and announced that if the purchaser at- the sale would pay or secure the payment of that sum\u00ed to- the trustee in bankruptcy he would overrule the -exceptions and ratify -the sale. This having been arranged, the sale wais ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">This -appeal is from the order overruling the exceptions and ratifying the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">It is conceded that the ruling, of the -chancellor was correct -as to the first and third Masses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The sole question is: Did title to the artieles in the second Mass pass under the mortgage or -did it go&gt; to- the- trustee in bankruptcy ? The determination of this question depends upon, whether -at the 'd\u00edate -of ithie institution of the bankruptcy proceedings these articles Were <em>fixtures </em>or metfely personal -chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">There is much discussion in the briefs .as to the effect of the -amendment of 1910 tot the Bankruptcy Act, Vesting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>trustee in bankruptcy \u201cwith all the rights, remedies and powers .of a creditor' \u25a0 holding a, lien by legal or equitable proceedings * * * and with raid the rights., remedies and powers of a judgment creditor holding an execration duly returned unsatisfied * *</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Giving that .amendment its utmost effect, the position of such trustee could not be better than, would have been that of a judgment creditor with an execution duly levied on the property in question at the date of the bankruptcy. And even if it were conceded, which we do. not decide, that the trustee in this easel held such a, position, our question would not be answered, because the relative positions of the mortgagee and such a judgment creditor, if there were any, would still depend upon whether the articles in question were covered by the mortgage of -an earlier date than that of the execution. It would be different if the controversy were between' .a trustee in bankruptcy and one holding .a defective mortgage. Most of the eases cited deal with situar tioms of that kind, and do not help, us in the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Here the question is the legal character of the articles in controversy as between the mortgagor and mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">There is no. subject as to. which the authorities are more hopelessly in conflict. But the law in Maryland on this subject was settled, in principle, by the ease of <em>Dudley &amp; Carpenter v. Hurst, Miller &amp; Co., </em>67 Md. 44. In the much earlier ease of <em>Kirwan v. Latour, </em>1 H. &amp; J. 289, it had been held that in order to constitute a fixture a chattel must be .actually fastened to the soil. In the later ease, this Court, in overruling the earlier one, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201cThis ease was decided in 1802. But since the decision of that ease the doctrina of <em>constructive </em>.annexation has been much discussed. From the general current of decisions, the following principle seems clearly deduoiblei.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">That where in the ease of machinery the <em>principal part </em>becomes a fixture by actual annexation to. the soil, such part of it as mlay be not so physically annexed, but which if re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>moved would leave rthe principal thing unfit for use, and would not of itself and \u00a1standing alone be well adapted for general us\u00a9 elsewhere, is considered constructively annexed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">Thus the key of a lock, the sail of a wind-mill, the leather belting of a saw-mill, although .actually severed from the principal thing, and stored elsewhere, pass by 'constructive annexation. They must bei .such as go&gt; to complete the machinery, which is affixed to the land, and. which, if removed, would leave /the principal \u00a1thing incomplete .and unfit for use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">And then, applying the principle .announced to the facts of that case, the Oourt continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cIn this ease there are some articles not actually annexed to the soil, such .as crates, dapping machines and work tables, but .are essentially necessary to the working -of the principal machinery, and pas\u00ae by constructive annexation. The main machinery would not be in working condition without them, and they are not adapted for general purposes. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">We are therefore of opinion that the whole machinery of the canning factory passed under the mortgage to Bowie, and consequently to hi\u00ae vendees under the mortgage sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">It was said in that case that the testa by which a fixture is determined are generally these:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">1. Annexation to. the realty either actual or .constructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">2. Adaptation to the pse of that part of the realty with which it is connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">3. The intention of the party making the annexation, to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold, this intention being inferred from the mature of the article annexed, the situation of the party making the annexation, the mode of 'annexation, and the purpose for which it was annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">This case hia\u00ae been cited with .approval in a number of later cases. <em>Warren Mfg. Co. v. Baltimore, </em>119 Md. 188; <em>Mt. Vernon Co. v. Continental Trust Co., </em>121 Md. 163; <em>Talbott v. Silcite Co., </em>144 Md. 645. See also <em>Ewell on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Fixtures </em>(2nd Ed.), star page 33; 26 <em>C. J., </em>page 722, and. note 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Attention, i\u00ae directed in appellants brief to&gt; the record in the <em>Dudley &amp; Carpenter </em>case, <em>supra,, </em>wherein it appears that the crates in that ease were integral parts, of certain kettles., into which) , they fitted, which kettles, conld not be taken up without tearing up the floor and removing the sleepers. Lut there is nothing in the record of that ease to show that the capping machines or tables were integral parts of 'any machinery physically annexed to the building or soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We think the .articles in controversy in the present case bear a relation to the general machinery of \u2019 the factory, similar in character to that sustained by those above mentioned to the canning factory in the <em>Dudley &amp; Carpenter </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">A description of the articles in question is found in the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cA pair constitutes a set of ringsi which are bolted around the bead of an uncured tire to hold the air-bag inside of the \u2022casing while being cured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">\u201cThe mold is the receptacle that holds the tire during the vulcanization which gives the imprint of the tread design and the lettering on the mold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In exhibiting a tire, one witness said: \u201cThis tire (indicating) is ready for the baking process now. It has been formed around an iron circular form by the tire builder* 'and is completely built on that. We call that (indicating) a core.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">This witness further testified that t\u00edrese articles are used by themselves and separate from 'any other machinery; but without them the machinery coiuld not turn out .any tires, nor could these .articles tum out tires by themselves unless they were used in connection with the particular machinery on the premises, or some other machinery of the same type; and, furthermore, they could not be used by any other company. This testimony wa\u00ae micomtradicfced.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">The testimony shows that their value was almost entirely in connection with the annexed machinery with which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>were used, and) that they would he of little value elsewhere. Part of them were patented, and the patent rights were conveyed to the mortgagee. They were made expressly for that plant and were essential to the manufacture of the larger size tires which it was important for the plant to produce in order to compete with its business rivals.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It remains to' consider the objection that these articles were installed after the date of the mortgage, and were not intended to be substituted for worn out or broken original parts. That would he a valid objection if appellee\u2019s rights depended upon the attempt in the mortgage to- convey .future acquired chattels. Such provision has no validity and no effect, except as it may have a bearing upon the intent as to the permanent use of such articles in connection with the work of the factory. Eor that purpose it may be relevant evidence. <em>Dudley &amp; Carpenter v. Hurst, Miller &amp; Co., supra.; In re Russell Falls Co., </em>249 Federal, 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In the <em>Dudley &amp; Carpenter </em>case the mortgage did not expressly convey chattels, but such as were constructively annexed were held to have passed under the clause, \u201cTogether with the buildings 'and improvements thereupon, and the rights, roads, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages thereto\u2019 belonging, or in anywise appertaining,.\u201d And fluey were held to pass because they were \u201cessentially necessary to the working of .the principal machinery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">It was there noted, that, in <em>McKim v. Mason, </em>3 Md. Ch. Dec. 186, Chancellor Johnson had decided that such articles as were fixtures passed to the mortgagee even when they were placed upon the land after the mortgage was executed. So that, having decided that the articles in controversy were fixtures, it makes no difference whether they were installed before or after the execution of the mortgage, any more than would the time of the erection of a building on mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Nor do we understand that \u201cessentially necessary to the working of the principal machinery\u201d means necessary to the mere physical movement of the machinery. It rather means. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>as shown by (the facte of the casia in which the expression was used, the <em>efficient </em>working of thei machinery in accomplishing the purposes for which it is adapted. Soi draft. if \u00a1the plant in the present ease was reasonably equipped otherwise for the manufacture of a larger .size tire than it was making art the d\u00edate of the mortgage, but had noit the articles now in controversy, the addition of such articles might well be necessary for die efficient working of the principal machinery. The testimony show\u00ae they Were purchased for that purpose. A fair test would seem to be, Would such 'articles be held to be fixtures if installed in 'an additional building, intended solely for the manufacture of tires of the larger size, erected after the date of the mortgage ? If so, there is no reason why they should not be so considered when installed in die original building for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We find no error in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
