P'rom that judgment the appellant has taken this appeal. The single exception contained in the record is to the action of the court below in refusing certain prayers of tbe appellant. At tbe close of the testimony in the case, the appellees, plaintiffs below, did not offer any prayers, and the appellant offered nine prayers designated as defendant\u2019s A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I prayers. The court rejected defendant\u2019s A, B, C, D, H and I prayers, and this action of the court constitutes the single bill of exception in the case. At the argument in this Ctiurt and in the brief of the appellant, the exception to the action of the court in rejecting defendant\u2019s C, D, H and I prayers was- abandoned, and the appellant, only asks that we review the action of the court- in rejecting its A and B prayers. These were the usual demurrer to the evidence prayers and ask fo-r an instructed verdict for the defendant-; so that our province in this- case is confined to-deciding the correctness of the action of the court below in refusing these prayer's. The appellant admits the ownership o-f the truck which caused the damage, the general employment of the driver o-f that truck, and his negligence as being the cause of the collision. He, however, contends that he is-not liable for the reason that the unoon'tradicted evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>in this case shows that Murphy, the driver of the truck, was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, or that at said time he was the servant of some' other person and not the servant of the appellant. In order to determine the soundness of this contention we are required to examine all of the evidence in the ease. Hpon a careful examination of the record we find these facts undisputed : That the appellant, Louis Salowitch, trading as the Salowitch Auto-Part Oompany, was engaged in the business of dealing in auto parts and used serviceable trueles, his place of business being Olifton Avenue and Monroe Street in the City of Baltimore; that he had been so engaged for five years prior to the accident; that he was the owner of the truck causing the damage complained of, and that the' truck at the time of the accident Was being driven by Murphy, who was in the general employ' of the appellant. There is conflict in the testimony as to how long Murphy had been 'employed by the appellant, the appellant himself testifying that he had engaged him about four days before the accident, and Murphy testifying that he had been employed about a month and a half. This, however, is immaterial for the purposes of this decision. That on the day of the accident the appellant was not at his place of business but had gone to Washington, going direct from his residence and not having been at his place of business at all that day; that the accident occurred at the corner of Lafayette and Pennsylvania Avenues, about 9.30 or 30 o\u2019clock A. M.; that at the time of the accident Morris Salowitch, brother of Louis Salowitch, was in the truck sitting alongside of Murphy'the driver; that Morris Salowitch lived with his and the appellant\u2019s father, who conducted a grocery business at 250 South Eden Street, and also lived at that place; that the duties of Murphy were tearing down machines and working in' the automobile shop of the appellant; that he had no operator\u2019s license to' drive a bar; that after the .accident Murphy drove the truck to the home of the appellant\u2019s father, the appellant\u2019s brother accompanying him, and left it at that place, going immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>thereafter out of the State and not returning until .apprehended and taken into* the traffic court. These facts are established by the testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff and the defendant and are uneontradioted. The evidence as to what occurred at the place of business of the appellant on the morning of and before the accident, as related by Murphy, who testified for the plaintiff, and the evidence of the appellant and his brother', Morris, is in direct conflict one with the other, and it is impossible to reconcile the two versions. The testimony of Murphy is, that on the morning of the accident, a little while after he went to work, \u201cMr. Salowiteh\u2019s brother came up' .and wanted a truck; Mr. Salowiteh was not there so his. brother went to the telephone to call him. up, then he called me to the telephone and I spoke to Mr. Louis Salowitch and Mr. Salowitch told me to take the truck and drive it for his brother; I took the trad!: and drove it and we were hauling some groceries, and on our way hack to Mr. Salowitch\u2019s place, I had a collision at Pennsylvania and Lafayette. Avenues.\u201d This was in Murphy\u2019s examination in chief, and on cross-examination he said: \u201cI was not employed to drive automobiles; it was .about half past nine or ten o\u2019clock that morning when Mr. Salowiteh\u2019s brother came to the place and, after a conversation with me, he went to the telephone to speak to Mr. 9alo&gt;-witoh, my employer; I recognized his voice and while I can\u2019t remember exactly what the conversation was, he told me to take the truck out and drive for his brother and I did it. * * * Mr. Salowitch told me to go with his brother and haul groceries for his father. Yes, I admit that immediately after this accident I ran away and went out of town; I went to Altoona, Pennsylvania, the same day.\u201d The above quoted testimony of Murphy was all of the testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff bearing upon the question of whether or not Murphy was the servant of the appellant at the timo of the accident, and was at that time acting within the scope of his employment. The testimony of the appellant in his own defense was that he had employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Murphy about four days before the accident and be Was employed ti tear down machines and work in the shop, and he had nothing to do with the driving or operation of machines ; that Murphy never had any authority from him to operate this machine; that the morning of the accident he, the witness, went to Washington, leaving Baltimore about eight o\u2019clock; that he did not go to his place of business at all on that day, hut neat morning went t\u00f3 the shop and his attention was called to damage tO' his truck by his foreman saying, \u201cLook what Murphy done,\u201d and showing him a little two-ton Packard with the bumper smashed and the radiator leaking. He further testified that he did not have such a conversation on the telephone as Murphy testified to here, and did not remember calling Murphy or anybody else that morning; that Murphy said it was between 9.30 and 10 o\u2019clock, and that he, the witness, was in Washington at 10 o\u2019clock. The witness further testified that Murphy had no authority to drive any machine belonging to the witness, and that Murphy had testified at the traffic court that he, Murphy, \u201cdid not have my permission to drive that car that morning.\u201d The witness Morris. Salowitch, brother of the appellant, testified as follows: \u201cThis is the way I came to he on the truck. On Sunday afternoon my brother, Louis, was visiting my mother with his wife and he told me he was to go to Washington Monday morning; I came up1 to his yard to see him before he left, hut he was gone already; I came up about half-past seven or eight <em>o\u2019 </em>clock; I must have got there quarter after eight. I told John, the colored man, that Louis wasn\u2019t there, I was going down town. I hung around awhile and I was watching them tear down cars \u2014 I liked to see how they did it; I told him I was going down town about half-past nine or ten o\u2019clock and the driver there, Murphy, he told me he could take me down, he said he was going that way and I went with him; no, I had not seen my brother that morning; I was down at the place for about an hour, some thing like that; John was boss there and giving orders, telling Murphy to tear down certain parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>of the truck, tearing certain parts away and put iron on a certain pile; I had seen Murphy around there once before; he was with one of the drivers from a big truck that came iu to be repaired; I told Murphy I was going down, town and of course Louis didn\u2019t come back; he said I can take you down and I went with him. ILe went from Clifton to Eulton, u)p Fulton to North, North to Pennsylvania and he turned down and he went down to near Lafayette, and I seen the big Republic truck; I recognized it with a lot of packages and right smart speed; I don\u2019t know how fast and Murphy turned in short and he hit him in the hack. * * * We didn\u2019t have any groceries on the truck and we didn\u2019t have any on the truck before this accident. I was only on the truck about five minutes, just as long; as it-takes to run down to that street there; we hadn\u2019t gone anywhere else between my brother\u2019s! place and the scene of the accident; Murphy was taking me home; I asked him where are you going, be said that is all right, he Was going down that way; I had not seen Murphy drive any car before for my brother.\u201d On cross-examination Witness testified: \u201cIt was about half-past nine when we left my brother\u2019s place and the accident happened in .about five minutes, just as long as it takes ns to get to this place; no, sir, I had not been around delivering groceries., Muripihy was taking me down town, he was taking me to my home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The law applicable to this class of cases is familiar and well settled by decisions of this Court, to the effect that where the ownership of the vehicle causing the collision is in the defendant and the driver thereof is in the general employ of the defendant, there is a reasonable presumption that at the time of the accident the driver is the servant of the defendant and acting within the scope of his employment. <em>Vonderhorst Brewing Co. v. Amrhine, </em>98 Md. 406; <em>Stewart Taxi Service Co. v. Roy, </em>127 Md. 70; <em>Dearholt Motor Sales Co. v. Merritt, </em>133 Md. 323. The most recent expression of this rule is the case of <em>Jordan-Stabler Co. v. Tankersly, </em>146 Md. 454, where the Court said: \u201cThis Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>has held, that in a collision caused by an automobile operated by the servant of <em>the owner there </em>is a reasonable presumpttion that tbe servant was acting in the scope of bis employment and upon the business of bis master, and that tbe burden of overcoming this presumption is upon the master by showing that the servant was engaged in business other than .his employer\u2019s.\u201d It is equally well established that this presumption is a rebuttable one and may be rebutted by tbe un- \u25a0 contradicted testimony offered on behalf of either the.defendant or the plaintiff, or both, and when so rebutted the case ought not to go to <em>the jury. Symington v. Sipes, </em>121 Md. 313; <em>State, use of </em>Bebelius, <em>v. Benson, </em>129 Md. 693; <em>Dearholt Motor Sales Co. v. Merritt, </em>133 Md. 323; <em>Pollock v. Watts, </em>142 Md. 403. Therefore, the present case presents one in which the unconitradicted evidence establishes the ownership of the truck by the appellant and the general employment by the appellant of Murphy, the driver, thus creating the presumption that he was- the servant .and agent of the appellant, acting within the scope of his employment, which, together with the negligence of Murphy, would be sufficient to entitle the case to he submitted to the jury, and such \"evidence upon which the jury might render a verdict for the plaintiff; hut if the record discloses that this presumption is rebutted by the uncontradioted evidence offered on behalf of either the appellant or appellee, conclusively showing that the driver Murphy at the time of the accident was. not acting within the scope of his employment, there wohld be no evidence upon which the jury could legally render a verdict for the plaintiff, for the reason that the presumption has \"been fully met and overcome. Whether or not the evidence, as disclosed by the record, is of such a character as will overcome the presumption, is a question of law for the court. If the evidence offered on behalf of the defendant, 'which in respect to this point is fully set out herein, is true, the plaintiff Would not be entitled to recover, because it clearly apr pears therefrom that Murphy took the truck of tbe defendant without any authority or acquiescence by tbe defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>at the time of the accident was using it for his own or some one other than the master\u2019s business. This proposition is fully sustained by the authority of <em>Symington v. Sipes, Debelius v. </em>Benson, <em>Pollock v. Watts, </em>and <em>Jordan-Stabler v. </em>Tankersly, hereinbefore cited. If the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover rested solely upon the presumption which the undispnted evidence of both plaintiff and defendant created and Was met by the evidence of the defendant-, we would have no hesitation in holding that the presumption had been fully rebutted and that the court Was in error in refusing to' grant the prayers of the defendant for an instructed verdict in his behalf. We, however, have additional testimony on behalf of the plaintiff from its witness, Murphy, the driver of the truck, and we must examine this testimony, because if it is in conflict with the testimony offered by the defendant to rebut the presumption, there would he presented a case for the jury and not for the court, .as it is the jury\u2019s province to pass upon the credibility and weight of the testimony. In making this examination we find that the testimony of Murphy, if true, although contradicted by the defendant, presents a case where the owner of an automobile has loaned it and the driver, his general servant, to another, for use in that' other\u2019s business, Wholly apart and distinct from the business of the owner, and not in any manner, directly or indirectly, in furtherance of the owner\u2019s business. Whether or not the law under such conditions relieves the owner of liability is an important question, and upon its decision this case must depend. In the case of <em>Symington v. Sipes, supra, </em>Judge Timer said: \u201cThe liability of the appellant, upon the ground that the chauffeur was in the service and pay of the appellant\u2019s brother during the trip to and from Virginia, was disputed. We do not find it necessary to pass upon these questions, as the point we have considered is conclusive of the ease.\u201d This direct point has never been passed upon by this Court, .although we have employed language in former cases which would tend to indicate our opinion, should the point he directly presented. In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of <em>Sacker v. Waddell, </em>98 Md. 43, Judge Boyd used this language: \u201cThe master may so hire or loan his servant to another for some special service, as that he will, .as to that particular service, become the servant of such third person. If the master has parted with all power of control over the servant and permits the third person to make such use of him as he may deem proper, he may <em>quoad </em>that service, be the servant of the third person, and not of the general master.\u201d In the more recent case of <em>Sugar Refining Co. v. Gilbert, </em>145 Md. 251, the Court, speaking through Judge Pattison, quoted with approval the language of Judge Boyd in <em>Sacker v. Waddell, </em>and added: \u201cIn 18 <em>R. C. L. </em>757, sec. 223, it is said: \u2018There is no doubt that the general servant of one person may become the servant of another by submitting himself to the control and direction of the other. In such a ease the servant becomes the fellow servant of the servants of the person under whose control he comes, and neither his general master nor his special master is liable if he is injured by the negligence of one of the other servants.\u2019 \u201d In the same case there was cited with approval the case of <em>Delory v. Blodgett, </em>185 Mass. 126, in which ease the court said: \u201cWhen one person lends his servant to another for a particular employment, the servant, for anything done in that particular employment, must be dealt with as the servant of the man to whom he is lent, although he remains a. general servant of the person who lent him. * * * The test is, whether, in the particular service, which he is engaged to perform, he continues liable to the direction and control of his master, or becomes subject to that of the party to whom he is lent or hired.\u201d There is nothing in the cases of <em>Sacker v. Waddell, </em>and <em>Sugar Refining Co. v. Gilbert, </em>which is in conflict with the opinion in the case of <em>Bentley, Shriver &amp; Co. v. Edwards, </em>100 Md. 653. In that case the owner of the automobile truck, Burmeisiter, was engaged in the business of hiring trucks, -accompanied by drivers, to various parties who needed such service. The particular truck was at the time of the accident being driven by Ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Wards, tlie plaintiff in that case, and' was engaged in hauling articles of merchandise for Bentley, Shriver &amp; Co., that company indicating to- the plaintiff what merchandise he was to haul and where he was to place same. The accident occurred while the plaintiff was unloading the truck in front of the defendant\u2019s place of business-, and was occasioned by the negligence of a general servant of the defendant. It was contended by the defendant that the plaintiff was a fellow servant of the servant of the defendant and therefore could* not recover against the common master. This contention was overruled by this Court, for the reason that the evidence conclusively showed that when Edwards was hauling merchandise for the defendant he was engaged directly in the business of Burmeister, bis general master, and his acts were in furtherance of- that master\u2019s business in furnishing trucks and drivers for hire-. This decision was in accord with the great weight of authority in respect to' the hiring of vehicles and drivers by livery-stable-keepers or garage-men, in which, although the passenger, or one who hires, has the authority to direct the driver when and where to- drive, it has been-practically universally held that the owner is liable for an accident occurring duringl the period for Which the vehicle- and driver are used by the passenger. The class of cases represented by Bentley, <em>Shriver &amp; Co. v. Edwards </em>is totally different from the present case, .and the principles therein, laid down have no application, because in that case the truck belonged to and the driver was in the general employ of a master whose business it was to- hire trucks and drivers to the general public, which while engaged in such service were-directly furthering the general master\u2019s business; while here,, according to the evidence of the plaintiff, we have the ease of a man loaning, without recompense, a truck and driver to his father for purposes iu no wise connected with the owner\u2019a business and purely for the benefit of the- person to-whom they have been loaned. It is uncOntradicted that the-business of the appellant Was dealing in auto- parts and buying, repairing and selling second-hand motor trucks, and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>that it was no part of Murphy\u2019s general duties, as the servant of the appellant, to drive motor trucks; therefore, if the evidence of the plaintiff is believed, when the appellant loaned the truck and driver to his father, the servant was in the special service of another, engaged in that other\u2019s business and subject to his control and direction. Murphy thus temporarily became the servant of some one other than the appellant and Was such other\u2019s servant at the time of the accident. This being true, the defendant was not liable for injuries resulting from such accident. In <em>Berry on Automobiles </em>(4th Ed.), page 1108, section 1225, it is said: \u201cThe rule is well settled that a servant in the general employment of one person may .also become the special servant of another, with all the mutual rights and obligations of master and servant between them for the time of, and in relation \u25a0to, the special service in which the servant is temporarily engaged. If an employer loans a servant to another for some special service, the latter with respect to that service may become liable as a master for the acts of the servant without any actual contract of employment between them or payment for service. This principle of law is so familiar Chat it scarcely needs the citation of authority to support it.\u201d And at page 1125 of the same work, section 1244, the author says: \u201cThe liability of one person for the negligence of another depends upon the contractual relation between the two of m\u00e1ster and servant. In the absence of such relation no one can be held responsible for the conduct of another. Gonsequently the owner of an automobile is not liable for an injury to a third person due to the negligent operation of his automobile by one to whom he has loaned the machine. * * * pPq same rlile applies * * * where he lends both his car and chauffeur to another.\u201d It will, therefore, be seen from what we have said that the presumption of the driver acting within the scope of his employment in this cas\u00e9 is fully rebutted, whether We consider the defendant\u2019s testimony or the evidence offered on behalf of the plaintiff, and 1 xs- ..I \u2022 ' TV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the same is true when we consider all of the evidence of both -parties, plaintiff and defendant, in combination. There is no evidence in this ease which would entitle the plaintiff \u2022fi) recover, except the presumption arising from ownership and general employment of the driver, and we have no hesitancy in saying that this presumption is fully and conclusively met and destroyed by the evidence produced in behalf of both the plaintiff and the defendant. The case should have been withdrawn from the jury, and there Was error in the refusal of the lower court to grant the defendant\u2019s A and B prayers-. For this error the judgment must be reversed, without a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, without awarding a new trial, the appellees to pay the costs of the appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
