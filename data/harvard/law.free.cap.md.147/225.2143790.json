In the course of his practice, extending over a number of years, he had considerable experience in the operation and management of banks and other financial institutions, and knows and is known to a number of persons connected with s.uch institutions in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">On October 14th, 1921, the Lafayette Bank of Baltimore, for reasons which need not be discussed here,.had fallen into serious financial difficulties, which threatened disaster un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>less speedily remedied. 'In that extremity it employed Mr. Penrose as \u201cspecial counsel\u201d to the bank, and authorized him <em>to </em>borrow from time to' time on its behalf such sums \u201cas may be needed.\u201d He entered upon that employment, and between the 14th &lt;jf October, 1920, and November 28th of the same year,'when a receiver for the bank was appointed, h\u00e9 rendered services to- the- bank for which this Court, in <em>Penrose v. </em>Page, 145 Md. 1; said he was entitled to be compensated.' The lower court, in' the decree from which this appeal' is taken, 'fixed his compensation at $10,400, and' the question' before us is whether that allowance is reasonable and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">; ''That' question'is embarrassed by the nature of the services.' Regarded as a whole, technically speaking they cannot be regarded as legal, although some of them may have been legal dr <em>quasi </em>legal in their nature, nor can they be regarded as the\u2019 services of a loan broker, although some of them partook of that character, too,' nor can they be said to be the ordinary services of a\u2019financial expert, although the element of ex-' p\u00e9rienc\u00e9 in dealing with financial matters also entered into some of them. Mr. Ptenrose was employed as a lawyer, and it is possible that his training and experience as a lawyer \"may have rendered his assistance more valuable to the bank, bu't it is difficult to point out any services rendered by him which' could not have'been rendered in ordinary course by \u00e1 capable \u00e1nd experienced bank executive familiar with the needs, operation and management of banks. Indeed, there is'great force in this suggestion of the learned and careful judge who heard this case in the lower court. In speaking of the 'difficulty of separating the services into more or less conjectural elements and valuing each element, he .said: \u201cThis method \u00f3f computation does not seem to me to be as satisfactory as to consider his services as those of an executive officer called in temporarily to' do the administrative work of the president and board of directors, inasmuch as all of the serv^ ices rendered by him would be rendered under ordinary circumstances by the executive officers of the company without compensation'other than their salaries. The object of'emW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ploying him was to maintain the hank as a going concern, in doing which the president and board of directors had failed.\u201d But the appellee was employed in the special capacity of a lawyer, for he was employed as \u201cspecial counsel.\u201d The bank, therefore, employed -a practicing lawyer to give up his practice ftar forty-two days and devote his entire time to its affairs, and while his services may not, and so- far as we can see were not, of a strictly -legal character, nevertheless, it is just that he should have been compensated for the services he gave at the same rate as he would have been had they been strictly legal in character. At the same time, because of the nature of the work he was to do and because it was uot such work as ordinarily required' the services of a lawyer, it must have been contemplated both by him and the hank that his employment as a lawyer covered not only such legal services as might be required, but also such services., as a hank executive might be required and expected to give, and that the compensation for his services as a lawyer would also cover such executive services as he might be called upon to render in an effort to- save the bank from failure. In fixing the compensation tibe lower court divided the services into three classes \u2014 brokerage, legal and executive. The only service which could reasonably he regarded as legal was the collection of some overdrafts, but as that service was -such as would ordinarily be rendered by any bank officer in the ordinary course of his duties, in our -opinion it fell within the scope of his general employment, and no allowance should have been made for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In the.decree appealed from the appellee was allowed one hundred dollars a day for his services under his general employment as \u201cspecial counsel.\u201d We are not prepared for several reasons to say that allowance was excessive. First, because the chancellor was familiar with the compensation for professional services allowed to lawyers practicing in his court, and in the absence of definite evidence to the contrary weight should be given his opinion; second, because it was supported by the testimony of the only witnesses who testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>on the subject; and third, because the services, even though unproductive, were substantial, arduous and between the dates referred to above occupied all the appellee\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">TVe cannot agree, however, with the value placed upon the appellee\u2019s services as a loan broker. He secured on behalf of tlie Lafayette Bank loans, from different banks aggregating $149,000. That the appellee was entitled to compensation for those sendees in addition to the allowance made him for executive services was decided in <em>Penrose v. Page, surpo'a, </em>and the only question open is what that compensation should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The loans appear to have been for short terms, and to have been amply secured by collateral, and there is no apparent reason why with the same collateral they could not have been readily secured by any banker from any institution having the money to lend. There is some testimony, vague and unsatisfactory in quality, that Mr. Penrose guaranteed some of these loans, but even if he did, the risk he assumed was negligible because the loans were amply covered by collateral security. That he did render services in securing these loans for which he should be paid is undeniable, but in valuing those services regard must be had to the circumstances to which we have referred. The impression sought to be conveyed by the appellee\u2019s testimony, that the loans were secured largely through the personal appeal of Mr. Penrose, and because of his standing and responsibility, is not borne out by the facts. One loan of fifty-two thousand dollars, part of the aggregate of $149,000, for instance, was secured by collateral aggregating approximately $130,000, and when the lender called the loan, Mr. George W. P'age, then the receiver of the bank, immediately arranged to borrow $50,000 on the same collateral and with no other security from the Union Trust Company. Considering that transaction, we cannot believe that the loan of $52,000 could not have been secured in Baltimore on that collateral without the personal undertaking of Mr. Penrose to secure its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Three witnesses testified to what in their opinion was. a reasonable charge for the services rendered by Mr. Penrose' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in obtaining these loans. Two of them were members of the Baltimore Bar, of standing aud experience, and one the vice-president of the National Bank of Baltimore. These witnesses valued the services at five per cent, of the amount borrowed. The witness himself had once before been allowed four per cent, for obtaining a. loan of $40',000 secured by the assignment of a $65,000 mortgage. The appellant argues that the appellee only received one per cent, for his services in. that transaction, because twelve hundred dollars of the sixteen hundred dollars was paid by him as a bonus to some one connected with the lender. But we do not think that is fair reasoning. The hank paid Mr. Penrose four per cent, commission for the loan, and it bad no more to1 do with the use he made of that commission than an owner who had agreed to pay $40,000 for the erection of a building would have to do with the use to which the contractor put the money paid to him under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The appellee himself expressed no opinion as to the value of his sendees, but said that in the opinion of hankers whom he had consulted two and onedialf per cent, on the amount of the loan was under the circumstances and conditions a reasonable charge. And after a very careful consideration of the testimony we can find no sound reason for going beyond that estimate. Considering the security given for the loans, the terms for which they were made, and the compensation previously paid to the appellee for procuring a, loan secured- by a mortgage, two and one-half per cent, of the amount borrowed would have <em>been not </em>only a fair but a liberal allowance for the sendee rendered by the appellee in procuring these loans. The testimony of the three witnesses referred to, while in our judgment admissible, was unsatisfactory and inconclusive, because their opinions were largely arbitrary and referable to* no precise' <em>or </em>definite oases in which compensation was allowed for services quite similar to those rendered under the circumstances of this ease. Their testimony was perhaps the best that could be had under the peculiar, conditions of this case, and what we say is not intended-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>in any way to reflect upon the witnesses, because their high personal and professional standing is unquestioned, but the instances cited by them from their own experience, while sufficient to qualify them to express an opinion, were not sufficient to give much weight to it. Por instance, one of -the witnesses referred to a case in which a five per cent.' commission was paid for securing a tbree-vear mortgage loan. But while such a charge might be reasonable for procuring such a loan, it does not follow that it would be reasonable for procuring a call loan secured by collateral having a face value of more than two and a half times its amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Eor can any conclusive effect-be given to- the fact that the bank paid the appellee four per cent, commission for securing the forty thousand dollar loan which was secured hy a mortgage. It is conceded that there was no definite agreement as to the rate of commissions in that or any' other instance in which loans were procured for the bank by the ap-pellee, and it is obvious from the appellee\u2019s own testimony that,he wpuld have made no such charge in that case had he not been obliged to- pay a bonus of twelve hundred dollars for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u2022 Without prolonging the opinion further, we find that the allowance made in the decree appealed from was excessive, and that the appellee ought properly be allowed for all services rendered by him to the Lafayette Bank the sum of $Y,925, that is, $4,200 for his executive services and two and one-half per cent, on the money he borrowed for the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\"><em>Decree reversed and cause remanded that a decree may he entered in accordance with the view's expressed in this opinionthe costs in this Court to he paid hy the appellee. </em>,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
