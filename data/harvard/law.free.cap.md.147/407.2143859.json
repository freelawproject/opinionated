It is contended with great force by plaintiffs that it is clearly provided that the parts set apart by this sub-division for <em>descendants </em>shall be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in trust for them; but that there is no direction that parts set apart for brothers or sisters of a <em>child </em>of the testator shall be held in trust; that through all the items of th'e will the testator differentiates between his children and more remote issue by using the word <em>child </em>or <em>children </em>in the one ease, and <em>descendants </em>in the other; that so far as it had any reference to the surviving children&gt; the sixth sub-division ends with the setting ap'art of the parts for them, and that the parts so allotted are absolute gifts to them, there being nothing to indicate that testator intended to impress a trust upon such parts; that the remaining part of the sub-division-in which the trust is declared expressly refers to <em>\u201cdescendants\u201d </em>the language being: \u201c1S0 far as the part of a share so as last aforesaid set apart for any <em>descendant \u201d </em>etc.; that there is no trust declared in any other part of the will with reference to children of the testator which could apply, the only trust declared which affects children of the testator, or what they get under the will, being that in the fourth subdivision of the fifth item, which applies only to shares directed to be set off to them in the preceding second and third sub-division, the declaration in said fourth item being that the trustee: \u201cshall hold any share or part set apart under the <em>foregoing </em>provisions of the will as the share of either of my children or of any descendants of .a child in trust for the use and benefit of the child or descendant for whom it was set apart, during his or her life, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is impossible to' dismiss lightly the exceedingly logical' and cogent argument of the solicitor for plaintiffs in which' the particular section in question and other relevant sections of the Will are analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">But it is not entirely clear thiait the word \u201cdescendant\u201d' was intended to mean issue more remote than children, in the section referred to. Literally, \u201cdescendants\u201d include \u201cchildren,\u201d and except for the differentiation in the use of these words in other parts of the will, it would not be difficult to give \u201cdescendant\u201d in that section the inclusive meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We think a solution of the whole difficulty may be found in the word \u201coriginally\u201d in sub-division five. There the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>tator is dealing with, the contingency of the death, of \u201ceither of my said children or of either of their descendants for whose benefit .a share or shares or a part or parts of a share shall be then held under <em>any </em>of the provision\u00ae of this will,\u201d leaving issue, and providing for the devolution to the descendants of the interest of the one so dying. And in providing for such devolution he continues the trust in <em>every case. </em>But in fixing the duration of the trust, he differentiates between the part which is \u201ca portion of the share or part which came to my child or descendants so dying <em>originally </em>and under the second sub-division of this fifth article of this will,\u201d and the part which did not come that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u25a0 Hoiw here he is unquestionably considering <em>children </em>as well as other descendants. And he isi talking about the devolution, of interests which already are held in \u2019trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cIn case, however, that the part so set apart as aforesaid shall not be a portion of the share or part which came to my child or descendant so dying <em>originally </em>and under the said second subdivision, etc. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The testator must have had the understanding that there might be other parts held in trust for bis children than those which were to come \u201coriginally.\u201d And the only way such other parts could come to any child was under said subdivision six.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">It therefore seems to follow that he intended the part or parts which might come to a child or children under this subdivision to be held in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">However, it is not necessary, and we do not desire,'to rest our conclusion in this case mainly on the deduction we have drawn from the expression above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">In considering 'the language used in the will, we dlo not find that the words \u201cpart of a share,\u201d in the expression, \u201cso far as the part of a share soi as last aforesaid set apart,\u201d etc., throw.any light on the situation. It seems dear that \u201cpart of a .share\u201d in this connection refers merely to part of the interest to he distributed. Hor is much help to be derived from a consideration of the use of the words \u201cchild\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cdescendants\u201d in other pants of the will, because they are generally used together and for the purpose of differentiation where it is necessary to distinguish between testator\u2019s children and the -children of deceased children; o-r separately, as one or the other may he necessary or apt; and when appropriate the- word \u201cdescendants\u201d is used alone comprehensively and to include children-. Indeed in this very sixth sub-division, in the expression \u201cif the one so dying leave no- descendants,\u201d the word \u201cdescendants\u201d includes children, and all through the first part o-f this sub-division the word \u201cdescendants\u201d is used to include children o-f a deceased brother or sister. In the part of this sub-division under consideration there is no occasion for differentiation, the only question being whose descendant is referred to- in the expression, \u201cso-far as the part of a share so- as last aforesaid set apart for any descendant,\u201d etc. Is it the descendant of the testator or that of a deceased brother or -sister of a child dying without issue? If the latter, it wo-uld certainly include a child of said brother or sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We think \u201cany descendant\u201d of the testator is meant, .and that in such case likewise \u201cdescendant\u201d is intended to- include a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">This construction is in accord with the general intent we have found in a careful consideration of the will as a whole. The purpose throughout is manifest to extend the trust as to. the entire residuary estate to- the utmost limit of the law. Under the construction contended for by appellants, if the daughters- had died without issue and the invalid son had survived them and their mother, this son, whom the testator was so solicitous to protect from all business cares, would have t-aken two-thirds of the residuary estate free and clear o-f the trus-t. Is it at all -probable that the testator intended, o-r that the careful draftsman of the will overlooked, such a possibility ?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">But it is suggested in argument by the solicitor for appellants tha-t testator, having by the trust safeguarded the -original interests of his children, might well have intended to leave unprotected such part -o-f the estate as should come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to any of them by reason of the death of others without issue. But if that was his purpose why did he distinguish in this respect between his children and his more remote descendants, all of whom were made beneficiaries of the trust estate ?' It could not have been because of any special confidence in the business capacity of his children, because be knew his son was without such capacity, and he was careful to provide even as to income against the control of \u2019 any husbands the daughtefs might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The decree appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, costs to he paid out of the estate.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
