J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUg\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">This is a case under the provisions of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. ' The deceased husband of the claimant was employed for six weeks or more by the appellant employer, driving a wagon and delivering cans of oil on sm'all sales about Baltimore. He died March 3rd, 1923-,' of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>lympho-sarcoma or leukemia, that is, of a malignant growth in the glands, and the widow,, his only dependent, has made claim on the ground that this was superinduced hy injury sustained from a fall .against part of the wagon. Oompens'ation was allowed hy the State Industrial Accident Commission, and on appeal to the Baltimore City Court was affirmed. The question of fact was referred to a jury, under section 56 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">All the physicians who attended the man during the last month of his life and at the time of his death at Johns Hopkins Hospital agree in their testimony that the cause of death was lympho-sarcoma or leukemia, with certain attendant conditions; and 'all 'agree that death invariably results from such an affection. The cause of it is unknown, and it is usually insidious at first, and may run for some time before the patient is aware of its presence. Sometimes it developes and progresses rapidly, but it is unusual for it to do' so. There is some difference in the testimony as to- possibility of acceleration or aggravation by an injury. Dr. John S. Bishop, who-first attended the man, said it was thought a blow or injury would have no- effect- on lympho-sarcoma, but that in all probability this man had some trouble with his spleen' (where the growth was located) before he had the fall alleged, and that ns the thing was in a bad shape a little injury might have hastened it a great deal, and he felt, taking the report of injury as true, that it did have something to do with increasing the rapidity of the thing. Dr. Bishop added that this lympho-sarcoma could have developed if the man had not had any injury, however. D-r. Lewellys F. Barker, on the other hand, testified that he had never known of lympo-sardoma affected by-injury in the region of the growth, and 'he had no idea that -such an injury could have hurried that disease, and he thought it very improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">There was no visible injury; no bruising or external mark. Evidence of injury consists entirely of reported statements of tbe man himself prior to his death, which, of course, is hearsay testimony in these proceedings; and all the except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tions arise from the 'acceptance of such testimony as a basis of compensation under the Workmen\u2019s 'Compensation Act. The man was first absent from his employment on January 20th, 1923. He made no report of injury then, but his wife testifies that she telephoned his superintendent that he was ill 'and had slipped and hurt his side on January 16th, and that her husband repeated this to the superintendent when the latter called a few days later. The superintendent says the case was reported to him as grippe or cold, and when he called at the house-the man himself said he had a cold and would he out in a few days, that in February be told tbe superintendent he h'ad been injured. And similar testimony of grippe or cold is given by other employees. The wife testifies that, when her husband came home on January 16th, he reported to her that he had slipped and struck his left side on his wagon that day, and had a feeling as if something-had tom 'and she felt a lump or \u201cbubble\u201d at tbe place indicated. The superintendent says the man later described to him such a fall against tbe wagon; and three physicians, who attended the man within a few weeks after the beginning of disability, say that when examined he gave each of them a history of such an occurrence. To Dr. Bishop he said it had occurred to him not once, 'but several times, and he paid no attention to it. Additional testimony of some of the workman\u2019s associates is to the effect that lie had been complaining of cold or grippe before bis employment with the Standard Oil Company, and h'ad secured this latter employment in hope of improving his condition by work in tbe open air.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Divergent views have been entertained in other jurisdictions on the relaxation by a Court of its ordinary rule for excluding -hearsay evidence on review of compensation eases. The commissions which administer the- laws in the first instance cannot be expected to adhere closely to- the rather complex rules developed for jury trials in judicial proceedings, and they are in many compensation laws expressly relieved from doing so-. Section 10 of the- Maryland act provides that \u201cThe Commission shall not be bound by the usual dom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>mjon law or statutory rules of evidence and technical or formal rules of procedure, but may make the investigation in such manner as in its judgment is best Calculated to ascertain the substantial right\u00ae of the parties and to carry out justly the spirit of this act.\u201d It i.s the view of some courts ' that, in the absence of a statutory provision relaxing the ordinary court rales (and there is none in Maryland!), a court, on -review, is expected to give the case its usual scrutiny, discriminating as to the evidence received according to its ordinary rules. An instance -of this is in Illinois. <em>Peoria Cordage Co. v. Industrial Board, </em>284 Ill. 90. <em>Inland Rubber Co. v. Industrial Commission, </em>309 Ill. 43. Wigmore, in la comment oar the latter case, in 18 Ill. Law Rev. 248, questions the propriety of \u201cthe- insistence -that every pant of the evidence shall be tested by the jury trial rales of admissibility,\u201d although he -agrees in the subsequent \u201cgeneral exercise of -the power- to- review the sufficiency of the evidence\u201d admitted. And see <em>Spiegel\u2019s House Furnishing Co. v. Industrial Commission, </em>288 Ill. 422. In England, where these statutory proceedings -originaited, hearsay is admitted only according to the established rale, as to- bodily or mental feelings, but not a-s to their causes. <em>Amys. v. Barton, </em>5 B. W. C. C. 117 (C. A.); <em>Gilbey v. Gt. Western Ry. Co., </em>3 B. W. C. C. 135 (C. A.); <em>Wolsey v. Pethick, </em>1 B. <em>W. </em>C. C. 411 (C. A.); <em>Langley v. Reeve, </em>3 B. W. C. C. 175. Other courts admit evidence, such as 'hearsay, which would be excluded in ordinary judicial proceeding's, but only within limitation\u00ae. In New York, where the statutory provision for the relaxation of rales of evidence before the commission is the same as thait in the Maryland act, hearsay testimony is received in court reviews, but an award is not permitted to be based on such testimony alone. <em>Carroll v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., </em>218 N. Y. 435; <em>Belcher v. Carthage Machine Co., </em>224 N. Y. 326; <em>State Treasurer v. West Side Trucking Co., </em>233 N. Y. 203; <em>Hansen v. Construction Co., </em>224 N. Y. 331. And to the same effect are <em>Kelley\u2019s case, </em>123 Me. 261; <em>Royal v. Hawkeye Portland Cement Co., </em>195 Iowa 534; <em>Reck v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Whittlesberger, </em>181 Mich. 463; <em>Garfield Co. v. Accident Commission, </em>53 Utah 133; <em>Rockefeller v. Same, </em>58 Utah, 124; <em>Valentine v. Weaver, </em>191 Ky. 37; <em>Riley v. Carnegie Steel Co., </em>276 Pa. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under section 5-6 of 'the Maryland Statute, in the \u201cinformal and summary\u201d proceedings \u201cin the nature of an appeal\u201d the court is required .to determine whether 'the commission has justly considered all the facts concerning injury. It has not been directed to relax its established rules of evidence in any degree, or\u2019 under any conditions. And it .seems unquestionably true that the mere 'allowance of an \u2019 appeal must intend a review of the 'decision of the com mission with- some advantages from the special training -and methods' of the judicial tribunal. Yet to test the award or decision of the commission strictly by-the rules of judicial proceedings must' often subject it to requirements which a commission would be unable to- meet, and might in effect make i-t to .some degree-impracticable for the commission to work effectively without surrendering the freedom given it in section 10. We conclude, therefore, that the courts are required to&gt; .adapt therm selves somewhat to the increased latitude allowed to the commission, and that this adaptation must at the same time, and as far as it can consistently be done, -avoid abandonment of cautions and' safeguards which seem necessary, not :ouly for constitutional due process of law, but also for the assurance of reliability in the basis of .adjudication. We conclude that the courts are not intended to withdraw from litigants- undter the act all the precautions\u2019 which in the course of time have been .worked out as essentials of orderly, certain justice. And whatever -foundation there- m'ay be for objections to- tbe rule-excluding helar say in its full extent, it must be admitted that there is still a large residuum of necessary precaution embodied in it. It is to- be remembered that, so- far as the courts might 'adjudicate upon second-hand' reports of a witi ness'\u2019 direct observation, they must usually .act upon statements reproduced in part only, not tested by questioning, or by an oath, and reproduced through a very fallible medium. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>It is by this same rule that Statements reproduced a.t third \u25a0or fourth hand \u00a1are harred out. And, too, while this is one effect of relaxation of the rules to accommodate courlt reviews to the nature and working of 'the \u00a1commission, -it must be borne in mind that, there are other effects. The rule requiring the production of a writing itself rather than a verbal statement of it's contents, for. instance, i,s affected just ns much as is the rule'excluding hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">With these considerations in mind, then, we have to decide whether it was proper for the court below to admit statements of a deeeaised 'workmian said to have been made'to his wife, and to his physicians, that ho had fallen and struck his .side at a spot where the malignant growth later developed, and to refer to the jury ifhe determination of the' question of fact whether death resulted from an accidental injury, when this is all the evidence there is of such an occurrence. Without extending the disetisision at this time in an attempt to work out final general principles, we have concluded that in this particular case .the action of the court in each respect was proper. The statements are reproduced by three or four witnesses who heard them at first hand from the workman. They refer to a \u00a1simple fact, and were such as to ldave no room for substantial misunderstanding, and it seems to us basing -a finding of fact on them is, after all, hardly any greater relaxation of wise caution than has long been malde in the admission of secondary evidence to establish the contents -of a Writing which cannot he produced. We hold, therefore,, .that-there was no reversible error either in the admission. of the evidence or in the refusal of the prayer directing a veirdict for the defendant because of insufficient \u25a0evidence to support the finding of fact; and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Pakkb, &lt;L, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
