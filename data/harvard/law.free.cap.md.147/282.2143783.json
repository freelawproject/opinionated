Tn May, 1923, Goldman undertook to use the basement of a'four story dwelling on that property for repairing, by hand and am ordinary sewing machine, for hire, used clothing for such patrons as had occasion to require his services. The business which he thu\u2019s carried on required no alteration or repair of the building, and in the opinion of Goldman no permit was necessary to use it for that purpose. He was however informed that by so using-it without a permit he was violating certain ordinances of the Mayor and City Council of Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>m,ore and shortly thereafter he Was arrested for such violation, and while that complaint against him was pending he applied to the inspector of buildings of Baltimore City for a permit to use the premises for the purposes referred to. The inspector of buildings refused to grant the permit, partly at 'least on t'he ground that he was compelled under the zoning law to disapprove applications for such a use of property in a residence district. Goldman .then filed in the Superior Court of Baltimore City a petition in which he asked that a writ of mandamus be issued against the building inspector of Baltimore City and the mayor of .said city, directing them to issue to him a permit for the use of his premises for the purposes referred to above. The defendants answered that petition, and in their answer they averred that the permit was refused not only upon the authority of the zoning ordinance, but as well upon tbe authority of other ordinances of the City of Baltimore vesting a discretion in the building-inspector as to the is'su'anee of permits in such eases, and that in refusing the permit in this case the building inspector acted in the exercise of that discretion. In connection with such issues of fact as were presented .by the petition and the answer thereto, an agreed statement of facts was filed, and from that statement and the admissions found in the pleadings it further appears that the re'al and substantial reason for refusing the permit was that Goldman\u2019s property is located in a residence district of Baltimore City, the outline's of which are fixed by the zoning* ordinance referred 'to. The verdict of the trial court was in favor of the defendants and the writ of mandamus refused, and from the judgment on that verdict this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The important and controlling, and indeed under the agreed statement of fact the only question presented by the appeal is whether the zoning ordinance of Baltimore City, known *as Ordinance No. 922, in so far as it affects the right of \u2019the appellant to use his property -in the manner we have described, is a valid and \u00bfn enforceable enactment, and in dealing with that question it can he said that there is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>in the record from which it can be inferred that such use is offensive to the eye, the ear, or the nose of a -person of ordinary sensibilities, or that it imperils the public health, welfare or safety, any more than would the Same character of Work if done by Goldman for himself and his family, except that possibly more of it is -done.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This question can be approached by either of two avenue's; one legal; the other political and sociological. If approached by the former the validity of the restraints and prohibitions of the ordinance must depend upon Whether they violate certain definite guaranties and assurances found in the Federal and State constitutions and the law of the land. If -apr proached by the latter, the question is to* an extent freed from the embarrassment of harmonizing any apparently repugnant provisions of the act with those guaranties, since in such case the end to be -accomplished and the benefit to be derived are the main factors to be considered, and the rights of mere individuals may be subordinated to tbe public convenience, upon the principle that such rights ara always subject to the paramount authority of the State to subordinate them to what is -conceived by those -speaking for it to be for the benefit of the State, as representing .all the citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\"Which one of these two methods of approach should be used in this case is a question which goes to the root of our system of government, but without referring\u2019 further to that, it is sufficient to say that in our opinion we are not at liberty to examine <em>the </em>quest,ion from any other than a legal standpoint, and therefore we cannot be controlled in our consideration of tbe validity of this ordinance by its possible benefit to- the public, if in point of fact that benefit i*s purchased -by-appropriating the rights and property of individuals to the public use without just compensation, -and by the violation of the guaranties of the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We will now examine the statute itself to ascertain just what it is and what it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">It first divides the City of Baltimore into various districts, classified according to tibe use to which property may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>put, the height of buildings which may he erected and the proportion of the whole area which buildings may occupy on lots on which they may be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The outlines of these several districts are fixed by certain m'aps accompanying the ordinance as a part of i'fc. By these maps the entire city is divided first ais to use into' (a) residence districts, (b) first commercial districts, (c) second oommereal districts, (d) industrial districts; and in those districts it is provided that \u201cno building shall be erected or used and no land shall be used for any purpose other than a purpose permitted in the tose\u2019 district in which such building or land is located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In a residence district no building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected which is arranged, intended or designed1 to be used except for one or more of these specified uses :</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">(1) Dwellings; (2) Lodging or boarding houses; dormitories or convents; (3) Hotels, which have more than twenty sleeping rooms; (4) 'Olubs, except clubs th'e chief activity of which is a service customarily carried on as a business; (5) Churches; (6) Libraries or public museums; (Y) Municipal recreation uses; (8) Railroad rights of way; (9) Farming, gardening, nurseries or green houses; (10) Apartment garages, without repair facilities or gasoline filling stations, each apartment of which shall not have over two private motor cars, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In the first commercial districts no land or building shall be used and no building shall be erected for certain specified trades.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">No building or l'and shall be used 'and no building erected in the second commercial districts' for any one of eighty-seven specified trades, industries or uses, and no building or land shall he used or erected for any trade, industry or use that is noxious or offensive, hut it permits street car barns, trouble stations, bus garages, electric sub-stations, gas holder stations, public utility distribution shops, telephone exchanges, or places of amusement.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The ordinance further provides that any building or land may be used in industrial districts for any purpose not prohibited within the city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">It also contains a general provision authorizing the board of zoning appeals, in appropriate cases, to determine and vary the application of the use district regulations herein efetablished in harmony with their general purpose and intent, and then sets out and limits the extent of the authority thus given the board of zoning appeals to vary the terms of the ordinance, hut authorizes it to permit in any use district: 1. Amusement parks. 2. Aviation fields. 3. Crematories. 4. Public utility plants. 5. Befnse dumps. 6. Sewage disposal plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Second. As to height the city is divided into' five height districts, in which the height of buildings erected is required to conform to certain ratios varying as to. the several districts from two and a 'half times the width of the street on which they front to forty feet in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Third. As to are'a, the city is divided into six area, dis1tricts, in which' no building may be erected which occupies more than a certain percentage, varying as to each district, of the lot on which it is located, and in which the number of families who may dwell on a given area is fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Tbe inspector of buildings of Baltimore City, called tbe zoning commissioner, is charged witb tbe duty of enforcing the ordinance, and a board of zoning appeals is established and authorized to hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement or decision of the zoning commission in carrying out the ordinances, and there may be an appeal from any order, requirement, &amp;o., of said boiard of zoning appeals to tbe Baltimore City Court, which is required to bear the case represented by tbe appeal <em>de novo </em>and authorized to pass such order in the premises as it may deem, right and proper. It also provides that: \u201cUpon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The board of zoning appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>iron appealed from, and shall make such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its Opinion ought to be made iu the premises, and to that end shall hare all the powers of 'the zoning commissioner in accordance with this ordinance. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance and the maps which .are a part here'of, the board of zoning appeals shall, with the concurring vote of five members, have the power in passing, upon appeals', to vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions of this ordinance, relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures of the use of laud, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. &gt;The rule that the hoard of. zoning appeals shall follow in deciding the various questions referred to in .this ordinance, shall be the protection of living conditions as far as reasonable or the prevention of serious injury to the appropriate use of neighboring property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">By this ordinance all <em>the </em>land in the Oity of Baltimore is subjected to restrictions which limit the number of families who may dwell on it, the use to&gt; which it may be put, the height of buildings which may be constructed ou it, and the proportion of each lot of ground which a building may occupy, except that in the \u201cindustrial use district\u201d the land or structures thereon may be used for any lawful purpose. Many of these restrictions relating to the use of property bear no apparent relation to the public health, safety or welfare, nor does the ordinance contain any definite or fixed standards by which the reasonableness or the necessity for the restrictions may be measured or determined, nor arc they necessarily uniform or definite in their application. For after specifying with the most meticulous particularity the nature, extent and application of the restrictions, the board of zoning appeals is .authorized in its discretion to disregard the \u201cstrict letter\u201d of the ordinance, and to vary or modify '\u2022any of the regulations or provisions contained in it relating \u25a0to \u201cthe use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land, so- that the spirit of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.\u201d This .sonorous hut vague and cloudy formula is to say the least of it a poor and uncertain substitute for those guaranties of the State and Federal Constitutions which .assure tot every citizen the right to hold and enjoy and use his property in any manner he pleases so long as he does not thereby injuriously affect the health, security, or welfare of his neighbor or the public, as the words health, security and welfare have hitherto been understood in this State. There may also he an appeal from the hoard of zoning appeals to the Baltimore City 'Court, hut that remedy, if anything, increases rather than lessens the difficulty and hardship- which the ordinance inflicts upon the landowner, for it only transfers the discretion from the hoard of zoning appeals, which would presumably have some special hn'owledge and training, to a jury which might have none and who, in the absence of any fixed -or definite rules o-r standards to guide them, .would naturally exercise that discretion vary-, iugly in accordance with the views of different juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\" Before dealing with the constitutionality of the ordinance in whole or in part, we will refer briefly to the territory upon which it is to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">From a small village containing a few scattered houses on the shores of the Patapsco in 1729, Baltimore City has grown into a great maritime city, with a population currently estimated in round numbers- at eight hundred thousand, occupying over eighty square miles. Within its confines are found an infinite variety of commercial and industrial enterprises and .activities. Its commerce is home over the world by great land and Water transportation systems which serve its people-. It includes within its boundaries property devoted to every variety of use, iueludiug residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, maritime and recreational. It is constantly expanding and -constantly with its growth and changing conditions the use of property in it changes, so that what was formerly residential property has become commercial property, .and property which was at one time most useful for commercial -o-r agricultural purposes is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>mow most valuable for industrial purposes. Heretofore these changes have been in response to conditions created by the growth of the city, the. increase of its population, the demands of new -enterprises, changes in transportation facilities, changing markets, and various other factors! which cannot be readily -anticipated or controlled. This ordinance at a stroke -arrests that process of natural evolution and growth, and substitutes for it -an artificial and arbitrary plan of segregation, under which the landowner may only use his property for certain designated purposes, and under which he may be forbidden to- use it for the only purpose for which it is adapted and most valuable.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The appellant contends- that in doing that the ordinance appropriates private property to- a public use without compensation to the owner; that it take\u00ae the property of the citizen without due process of law; and that it denies to the citizen and landowner of Baltimore City the equal protection o-f the law. It is also contended that it improperly delegates legislative and judicial powers to a municipal administrative agency, and that it illegally extends the jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In dealing with the questions raised by these objections, in so far as they involve a construction of the Constitution of this State, we are bound by tbe -decisions o-f this Court construing and giving effect to- the provisions of that instrument, relating to and affecting the consideration o-f these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Whether the ordinance is valid or not- depends- mainly upon whether there is any limit to the police power of the State, and whether any rights of the appellant, which are not within those limits but which are within the protection of the Constitution, Federal or State, are violated hv it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">While it is difficult if no-t impossible to- define precisely the limits of the police power, there- -must in the very nature of things he some limit to- it, for otherwise the guaranties of written constitutions- would be little more than mere precatory and directory suggestions without fo-rce o-r life, affording to the citizen only -a false and illusory protection against the invasion o-f his rights by the -State, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>security would depend not upon constitutional guaranties but upon the will of the State in exercising an unlimited police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In this State the courts have uniformly held that the police power is not unlimited, hut that wherever it is invoked in aid of any purpose or legislation, such purpose or legislation must bear some definite and tangible relation to the health, comfort, morals, welfare, or safety of the public which must define the farthest boundaries of its territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">While loose and indefinite expressions may no doubt be found in the books which appear to justify the contention that there is no definite limit to the police power, that contention has not been recognized in this .Court, but what We conceive to be the correct rule -has been stated in <em>Byrne v. Md. Realty </em>Company, 129 Md. 210, where it was said: i(It does not follow that because a statute has been enacted for the ostensible purpose of guarding the safety, health, comfort or promoting the general welfare, it must be accepted as ,a proper exercise of the police power of the State; nor can a statute which is, in fact, a proper exercise of such power, be declared void merely because it results in circumscribing limits of individual conduct to narrower bounds. Hecessarily there are limits beyond which legislation cannot constitutionally go in depriving individuals of their natural rights .and liberties. To determine where the rights of the individual end, .and those of the priblic begin, is a question which must be determined by the courts. The Constitution is the highest written law of the State. The courts must obey both the 'Constitution and the statutes, but iu case of conflict between the two, the Constitution must control, and the statute must give way. When there has been an attempt-to exercise the police power of the State by the law-making department of the government, .and the validity of such act is challenged as being an unreasonable invasion of private-rights, the courts must, upon their own responsibility, determine whether in the particular case the constitutional limits have been passed.\u201d Other jurisdictions have gone farther than that, and perhaps the broadest and most sweeping defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tioh. of the .power is to be found in <em>C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. v. Illinois, </em>200 U. $. 592, where it is said: \u201cWe hold that the police power of a state embraces regulations designed to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, as well as regulations designed to promote the public health, the public morals, or the public safety. * * * Private property cannot be taken without compensation for public use under a police regulation relating strictly to the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, any more than under a police regulation having no relation to such matters, but only to the general welfare.\u201d But in referring to the police power as thus defined, the same court, in <em>Eubank v. City of Richmond, </em>226 U. S. 142, said: \u201cBut necessarily it has its limits and must stop when it encounters the prohibitions of the Constitution. A clash will not, however, be lightly inferred. Governmental power must be flexible and adaptive. Exigencies arise, or even conditions less peremptory, which may call for or suggest legislation, and it may be a struggle in judgment to decide whether it must yield to the higher considerations expressed and determined by the provisions of the Constitution.\u201d By the first case the limits of the police power are extended to cover everything which the courts or the legislature may determine to- be in furtherance of the public convenience or general prosperity, but by the second case it is held that the power as thus defined has its limits and must. Stop, when it readies the prohibitions of the Constitution, and the rule as established by the two oases does not differ substantially or in effect from that stated in <em>Byrne v. Md. Realty Co., supra. </em>If it had any broader meaning, in so far as the guaranties of the State Constitution are involved, we would be inclined to accept the statement of the court in <em>Fitzhugh v. Jackson, </em>132 Miss. 585: \u201cWe doubt, but we do not here decide, that under our Constitution the state under the police power has the right to. pass regulations purely to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, to the disadvantage and detriment of the individual property holders,\u201d but in the view we take of the question it is unnecessary to decide that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>There is a theory which has obtained some recognition, that the guaranties of Written constitutions are not inflexible, and 'that 'the decisions construing them at one period of the state\u2019s history, under conditions existing then, ought not to bind the courts at some later period when conditions have changed, and when from economic, sociological or political considerations it is desirable that a different or more liberal construction be given. That theory is based upon the conception that any constitutional guaranty, no matter how plain and clear it may be, can be dissolved and avoided by the application of tbe police power of the state. That the police power is a real and essential element in the sovereignty of the state cannot be questioned or denied, and 'that written constitutions are presumed to have been made with conscious knowledge of draft fact must be admitted. But it has never been supposed in this State that the police power' is a universal solvent by which all constitutional guaranties and limitations can be loosed and set aside regardless of their clear and plain meaning, nor that it -is a substitute for1 those guaranties, for far-reaching and powerful us it is, it has its limitations. Just what those limits are have not been, 'and in the nature of things, cannot be clearly and definitely marked, except that any exercise of the power which interferes with some right protected by the leltter of .the Constitution must bear Some substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, comfort or welfare Eor while the existence of the police power may be invoked to determine what rights are guaranteed by the 'Constitution, it can never be invoked to justify an invasion of .those rights once they have been ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">And if in fact this ordinance does appropriate private property to a public use, or if it dloes deprive owners of their property without compensation, then such an invasion of private rights cannot be sustained under the police power unless tbe exercise of those rights menaces the public health, safety or morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The danger inherent in any departure from these prin-</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ciples is forcibly and clearly pointed out by Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 <em>U. S. </em>415, where speaking for the Court he said':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cThe protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in -the decision's upon the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Hairston v. Danville &amp; W. R. Co. </em>208 U. S. 598, 605. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe general rule, at least, is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far if will he recognized as a taking. * * * We are in danger of\u2019 forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving \u00a1the desire by a shorter cut than the cofistitutional Way of paying for the change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">And while every \u00a1one hold'sdiis property subject to the implied condition that his use of -it shall not injure others with equal rights, so long as his use of it does not interfere with or injuriously affect the public he'altb, morals \u00a1or safety, he will he protected -in his Use and ownership of it against the state or any 'agency or department thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Private us\u00a9 and ownership of property has always been regarded by the courts of this State as one \u00a1of the most valuable privileges guaranteed by its Constitution, as one of the most durable and solid foundations of its government, and as indispensably necessary to the prosperity and welfare of the people, and the substitution of communal or state ownership for that system has not heretofore been regarded as within the powers of the courts or the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In dealing with the validity of the ordinance before us, therefore, we will start with the premise, that if its purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>and provisions can only be justified by invoking the police power of .the state, that they must bear some substantial cognizable relation to the public health, the public security, the public morals, the public welfare, or the public comfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">'Within the last few years a veritable flood of so-called \u201czoning\u201d legislation has swept over the country, and in its Wake there has been litigation. In the many decisions of state and federal courts dealing with that litigation, there has been some conflict and some confusion, but since the principles by which w'e must be controlled in passing on the validity of this statute have been repeatedly considered and stated by this Court, we are not concerned in harmonizing those eases, for no ma,titer what the law may be elsewhere, this Court could not be justified upon any ground of expediency in departing from its construction of such fundamental and important constitutional provisions as those involved in this case, when they have been established by its uniform and unbroken .action since those provisions have been a part of ithe organic law of this State. Any other course would necessarily result in chaos, and would tend to substitute for the government of law under which we now live a government under which the rights of citizens would depend, not upon the plain terms of written constitutions, but upon the judgment and opinions of legislative majorities and .the officials composing the many boards, commissions and\u2019 other agencies clothed with executive, judicial, administrative and legislative powers, through which s'o large a part of our government is carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Before dealing with the provisions of this particular ordinance, we will review briefly some of the decisions of this Court bearing upon the questions which the attack upon its validity presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In <em>Moale v. Baltimore, </em>5 Md. 314, the particular question before the Court was whether a provision of chapter 118 of the Acts of 1817,, that no person \u201cshall be entitled to- damages for any improvement- unless the same shall have been made or erected before the laying out of such street\u201d was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>stitution'al. The act referred to' provided for the opening of East Biddle 'Street in the City of Baltimore. In dealing with the validity of that proviso this Court said: \u201cWhile it is clear that the sovereign power has the right * * * to' appropriate private property to- public uses, yet it cannot do the \u2019latter without making just compensation for it. The sacredness of the rights of property is everywhere recognized by the spirit of the common law, Magna Charta and our Bill of Bights. * * \" We held, therefore, that it was mot competent to the legislature to confiscate the property of the citizen, and we-regard the provision of the act of 1817, which 'denies to the proprietor the use of his land, as molthing short of -an act of confiscation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In <em>Commissioners of Easton v. Covey, </em>74 Md. 262, it appeared that the commissioners of the town of Easton had passed an ordinance regelating the erection of new buildings within the corporate limits by forbidding the erection of such'buildings without the obtention of a permit from the commissioners of the town. The Court sustained that ordinance Upon the ground that it was not only useful but essential to the welfare and prosperity of the town that the erection of buildings therein should be regulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Bostock v. Sams, </em>95 Md. 400, tbe validity of an ordinance of Baltimore City, providing that no new buildings should he erected in that city without a permit and that no such permit should be granted unless in the judgment of the judges of the appeal tax court or a majority of them, the size, the general character, and appearance of the building to he erected should conform to the general character of the buildings previously erected in the same locality, and should not in any way tend to depreciate the value of the surrounding improved or unimproved property, was questioned on the ground that it deprived persons affected of their property without due process of law and that it improperly delegated to the appeal tax court the .authority to refuse such permits. The Court in dealing with that contention in that case said: \u201cNow undoubtedly the proviso- in the ordinance here under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>consideration attempts to. confer powers that affect the citizen in his right of property and his common law right.

It was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>in that case that the ordinance was void because it placed unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive power in. the hands of the Mayor .and City Oounoil of Hagerstown, and the Oourt in so holding cited <em>Mayor &amp;c. v.

Stubbs, </em>128 Md. 129, an ordinance requiring that the assent of the mayor and city council should be obtained before the building inspector could grant an application for a permit to erect any building or structure for exhibiting moving picture shows, &amp;c., was a valid exercise of the police power, because it involved the protection of life .and .property from damage or destruction through fire and panic.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>Stubbs v. Scott, </em>127 Md. 86, there was an application made to the inspector of buildings of Baltimore City for a permit to erect a building on a lot described in the proceeding's and which was to he used as an automobile sales room and service station. The application was refused on the ground that in the opinion of the mayor and the inspector of building's no permit should be granted for a store building in that neighborhood- and a permit was refused. In reviewing that action this Oourt said: \u201cBut in our judgment that was not sufficient to justify .his refusal to grant the permit under the evidence in the record.\u201d And the Oourt further said: \u201cIt \u2022cannot\u2019 be denied that less pretentious buildings than those already in a particular neighborhood may be and often are obj ectionable, not only to the owners of those there, but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>other residents of the city, but if they comply with building, regulations having reference to protection against fire and other things which can be validly regulated, we know of no way of preventing their erection, unless possibly it be under some very peculiar circumstances, different from those in this ease,\u201d and in the same connection it said: \u201cOpening stores in some neighborhoods may be injurious to surrounding properties occupied for residences, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prevent an owner from converting bis residence into a store building, even in the most exclusive part of the city, if he saw proper to do so. * * * But it would be going very far to say that the owner of this lot could not erect stores on it, simply because there are now no stores there, and there are valuable properties of other kinds in the immediate neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In <em>State v. Gurry, </em>121 Md. 534, in dealing with an ordinance providing for the segregation of white and colored people in different residential districts of the City of Baltimore, although the ordinance was struck down by this Court on other grounds, it was held that it was a valid exercise of the police power on the ground that it tended to preserve peace and prevent conflict and ill-feeling between the white and colored races in that city and to promote its general welfare; but that conclusion was reconsidered in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>132 Md. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Osborn v. Grauel, </em>136 Md. 88, tbe Court dealt with the propriety of the action of the mayor of Baltimore City in refusing to approve an application for a building permit for the erection of a garage, and it was there held that the refusal was justified under the welfare .clause of the city charter, and the Court in sustaining such refusal referred to <em>Storer v. Downey, </em>215 Mass. 273, where a similar refusal Was justified.heoau.se of the increased fire hazard and the disagreeable incidents of a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Farmer &amp; Planters Co. v. Salisbury, </em>136 Md. 617, it was held that an ordinance,.of that municipality forbidding the erection of buildings without a permit was a valid exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>cise of the police power granted to it by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">These cases state no new law and the principles announced in them were formerly accepted as sound by the decided weight of authority. But for some time past there has been a steady and constant pressure on the courts to modify them so as to permit encroachments upon individual rights which would not have been tolerated in earlier periods of our history, which completely justifies the comment of Mr. Justice Holmes which we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">One of the miost striking manifestations of this tendency is the great volume of so-called zoning legislation which has in recent years been written into the laws of the \u00bfseveral states, of which the ordinance before us is an apt illustration and which subject private property to an infinite variety and number of restrictions limiting its use, many of which rest for sanction upon no more definite or substantial foundation than that they .are supposed to be in the interest of general prosperity or the public convenience. That the right to hold, enjoy and use property is not absolute but subject to the police power of the .State is axiomatic (6 R. <em>C. L. </em>194), and that that power may be affected by changing conditions is inevitable and unquestionable, for a use which at one time may be inoffensive and harmless may at another affect the \u25a0security or the welfare of others.with equal rights, and one \u25a0of the sources of the police power 'is the maxim, <em>\u201cSic utere tiuo ut .alienum, non </em>laedasiSo, property in a populous \u2022\u25a0urban community may be properly subjected to restrictions \u25a0which would be unreasonable and arbitrary in a thinly settled rural community, so long as the restrictions bear ,some definite relation to the protection of the public health, morals, safety or comfort. These principles are self evident and are almost universally accepted. But the question before us goes much further than that. It is whether the power tO' hold, use and enjoy property can be restricted or taken away by : the State under the guise of the police power for purely \u2022aesthetic reasons or for any such elastic and indeterminate object as the general prosperity without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Upon that question the authorities are in sharp conflict, and. the extent of that conflict may he illustrated by reference to some of the cases in which the validity of ordinances similar to that involved in this ease has been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Because of the high standing and wide learning of the court,which decided them the cases most frequently cited in support of the validity of such ordinance are those of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. 'The force' of those cases is to some extent affected by the fact that the ordinances involved in them were authorized by a specific provision of tbe state constitution, but they nevertheless illustrate the extreme length to which the police power must be carried to support some of these law\u00ae. In <em>Inspector of Buildings v. Stoklosa, </em>250 Mass. 52, decided October 18th, 1924, that court supported the right of .the City of Lowell to divide its territory into zones to- restrict the use of buildings-for trade industry, tenements and dwellings within such zones, and to require such buildings to conform to regulations as to their construction and use. In <em>Brett v. Building Commissioner of Brookline, </em>250 Mass. <em>73, </em>decided the same day, it was held that although Brett had been granted a permit by the proper authorities to build \u201ctwo family\u201d houses on lots in the City of Brookline, and had .actually begun their erection, that the permit could he revoked,aud their completion prevented under an ordinance passed after the contracts for building them had been 'made, and work .on them commenced. In <em>Spector v. Building Inspector of Milton, </em>250 Mass. 63, decided on the same day, the petitioner had bought land 'and located in Milton for the purpose of erecting a block of twelve stores. 'There was then a building code hut no zoning law in force there, and he applied fqjr a permit to build tbe stores. Tbis permit was withheld for tbe express purpose of delay until tbe selectmen could bave adopted a zoning ordinance declaring,the property to be within a-\u201cresidence\u201d district. The ordinance was adopted and the permit refused, and in sustaining 'that action the court in part said: \u201cThe circumstances that the land of the petitioner could he used more profitably for\u2019 commercial than 'for residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>purposes is of slight significance and of no consequence in the broad aspects of the case. Every exercise of the police power in respect to the use of land is likely to affect adversely the property interests of somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Other cases sustaining laws having some provisions similar to those in question here ara <em>State ex rel. Civello v. New Orleans, </em>154 La. 271; <em>Lincoln Trust Company v. Williams Building Corporation, </em>229 N. Y. 313; <em>Ware v. Wichita, </em>113 Kan. 153, in which this language is found: \u201cThe next contention is that the zoning ordinance and the statute which authorizes it have the effect of taking defendant\u2019s property or of diminishing its value without compensation. It often happens that a valid exercise of the police power has such effect. The most common examples of this are found in statutes and ordinances relating to the health, safety, or morals of the people. With the march of the times, however, the scope of the legitimate exercise of the police power is not so narrowly restricted by judicial interpretation as it used to be. There is an aesthetic and cultural side of municipal development which may be fostered within reasonable limitations.\u201d <em>State v. Harper, </em>182 Wis. 148, in which this interesting exposition of the modem doctrine of the police power is found: \u201cThe benefits to be derived to' cities adopting such regulations may be summarized as follows: They attract a desirable and assure a permanent citizenship; they faster pride in and \u2019attachment to the city; they promote happiness and( contentment; they stabilize the use and value of property and promote the peace, tranquility and good order of the city. * * * It is not necessary for us to' consider how far aesthetic considerations furnish i a justification for the exercise of the police power. But one case has been called to our attention which holds that aesthetic considerations alone justify the exertion of that power. * * * Perhaps the case of <em>State v. Houghton, </em>144 Minn. 13, 174 N. W. 885, 176 N. W. 159, goes nearly if not quite as far. Other cases hold that aesthetic reasons may be taken into consideration, but that they cannot furnish the substantial basis for the exercise of the power. * * * It seems to us that aesthetic considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>are relative in their naturia With the passing\" of time, social standards conform, tlo new id\u00e9ala As a race, our sensibilities are becoming] more refined, and that which formerly did not offend cannot now be endured. * * * Tbe rights of property should not be 'sacrificed to the pleasure of an ultra-aesthetic taste. But whether they should he permitted to; plague the average or dominant human sensibilities well' miay be pondered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Some of the provisions of several of the statutes reviewed in these cases bore no necessary relation to 'the public health, miorals, safety or welfare, and manifestly owed their existence to an intention to create certain areas within which persons might reside without fear of being annoyed by the proximity of other dwellings and business enterprises; which, while not affecting the public 'health, the public morals, the public safety, or the public welfare, were nevertheless repugnant to the aesthetic sensibilities of that part of the public in whose interest they were drawn. That such a purpose could not be effected if the usual constitutional guaranties are given their ordinary meaning is clear, since in such a case the purpose could only be effected through resort to the power of eminent domain, which would in practice he impossible, and hence it was necessary to support them by an extension of the police power, either in terms, or by some process of reasoning often tenuous and remote, to establish some relation between the laws and some recognized element of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">There are, however, eases in which the power of the state to adopt legislation impairing property rights for any reason less substantial than the protection of the public health, \u2022safety, morals or welfare, has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In <em>Fitzhugh v. </em>Jackson, 132 Miss. 585, 33 A. L. R. 279, the court was dealing with an ordinance making it unlawful for any one to start a new business enterprise within a residence district unless with the consent of the owners of more than one half the property within a certain distance from the lot affected and the city council. The petitioner in that caso .applied for a permit to erect a building for a grocery store. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>It was refused on the ground that such a use was forbidden by the ordinance. In passing upon the validity of the ordinance, the court said: \u201cThe proper operation of a grocery store cannot possibly be injurious to the public health. One of the ordinary uses of property is for personal gain, and in the lawful use of this property the individual is protected by the constitution. He must so use it as not to injure others. By using this property for the purpose of conducting a retail grocery store in a lawful manner, he does not injure, in the legal sense, the property of his neighbor. * <em>* </em>* We doubt, but do not here decide, that under our constitution the state under the police power has the right to pass regulations purely to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, to the disadvantage and detriment of the individual property holders.\u201d In <em>Spann v. </em>Dallas, 111 Tex. 350, 19 A. L. R. 1387, the question presented was stated by the court in this way: \u201cWhether under the authority of the police power the citizen may be denied the right to erect, and in effect the right to own, a storehouse in a residence portion of a city, for the conduct of a lawful, inoffensive, and harmless business.\u201d In discussing that question it said in part: \u201cProperty in a thing consists not merely in its ownership' and possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment, and disposal. Anything which destroys any of these elements of property to that extent destroys the property itself. The substantial value of property lies in its use. If the right of use be denied, the value of the property is annihilated and ownership is rendered a barren right. Therefore a law which forbids the use of a certain kind of property strips it of an essential attribute and in actual result proscribes its ownership. The police power is a grant of authority from the people to their governmental agents for the protection of the health, the safety, the comfort, and the welfare of the public. * * * While this is true, it is only a power. It is not a right. The powers of government, under our system, are nowhere absolute. They are but grants of authority from the people, and are limited to their true purposes. The fundamental rights of the people are inherent and have not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>yielded to governmental control. They are not the subjects of governmental authority. They are the subjects of individual authority. Constitutional power's can never transcend constitutional rights. The police power is subject to the limitations imposed by the constitution upon every power of government; and it will not he suffered to invade or impair the fundamental liberties of the citizen, those natural rights which are the chief concern of the constitution and for whose protection it was ordained by the people. * * * To secure their property was one of the great ends for which men entered into society. The right to acquire and own property, and to deal with it and use it as the owner chooses so long as the use harms nobody, is a natural right. It does not owe its origin to constitutions. It existed before them. It is a part of the citizen\u2019s natural liberty \u2014 an expression of his freedom \u2014 guaranteed as inviolate by every American Bill of Bights. It is not a right, therefore, over which the police power is paramount. Like very other fundamental liberty, it is a right to which the police power is subordinate.\u201d In <em>State v. </em>McKelvey, 301 Mo. 1, in dealing with a. comprehensive zoning ordinance regulating the use of property and dividing the the Oity of St. Louis into free use districts, the court held that it was not within the scope of the police power. A like conclusion was reached upon somewhat similar facts in <em>Ignaciunas v. </em>Risley, 98 N. J. L. 712, by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and upon appeal to the Court of Errors .and Appeals of New Jersey it was held that the mere erection of a store building within a residence district fixed by a zoning ordinance did not endanger the public health safety or general welfare. 125 Atl. 121. In <em>State v. </em>Houghton, 134 Minn. 226, it Was held that a zoning ordinance prohibiting the erection of any building except for residential purposes in a residence district could not he sustained under the police power, in so far as it applied to ordinary store buildings, and to the same effect is <em>Willison v. </em>Cooke, 54 Col. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">From what we have said, the cases last cited which deny to the state the right to restrict the use of private property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>unless the restriction bears some definite and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, or welfare, are in accordance with the views repeatedly expressed by this Court, and from which it will not now depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We will now apply the principles stated in these decisions and in the decisions of this Court to the matter immediately before us, which is, whether these provisions of ordinance FTo.'922 of Baltimore City, which regulate the use of prop* arty in residence districts in that city, are in so far as they apply to the use of the appellant\u2019s property a valid exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">From an examination of the maps which form a part of the ordinance, it appears that the residence zones or districts of Baltimore City comprise a number of separated areas varying in extent, irregular in outline, and located without apparent reference to any definite plan, hut which nevertheless in the aggregate include ,a very large part of the total area of that city. And by reference to the ordinance it appears that in those districts no land or building can he used and no- buildings erected except for one of fifteen specified uses, to- which reference has already been made, unless specially authorized by the board of zoning appeals. These restrictions are wholly arbitrary and have no logical relation to the public Welfare, hut rest solely upon aesthetic grounds. Under the provisions of sections 3 and 7d and <em>7g </em>of article 3 of the ordinance, a neighborhood drug store might he forbidden, and a crematory permitted, a bakery forbidden and a sewage disposal plant permitted, an office building prohibited and a refuse dump-permitted, a grocery store forbidden and an amusement park allowed. USTor is .there any rule or standard prescribed to' guide the discretion of those entrusted with the administration of the ordinance in deciding what shall he allowed or what forbidden any more definite than that, in any departure from the letter of the law, the spirit of the ordinance shall he preserved, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. But as the ordinance itself is based upon the theory that its prescriptions are in the interest of the public welfare, it is not clear how any departure from them can-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>be justified on that ground, for if the restrictions are not necessary to the public welfare, there can he no justification for them at all, and in fact there is none. Their only apparent purpose was to prevent the encroachment of business establishments of any kind upon residential territory, regardless of whether they affected in any degree the public health, moral\u00ae, safety, or welfare. In effecting that purpose they take from the property owner the right to use his property for any purpose not sanctioned by the letter of the ordinance or allowed by the practically unfettered' discretion of the hoard of zoning appeals, and deprive him of privileges guaranteed by the twenty-third article of the Maryland Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We have reached the conclusion, therefore, that so much of the ordinance as attempts to regulate and restrict the use of property in Baltimore City is Void: first, because it deprives property owners of rights and privileges protected by the Constitution of the State; second, because such deprivation is not justified by any consideration for the public welfare, security, health, or morals apparent in the ordinance itself; and third, because it does not require that the restrictions shall in fact he based upon any such consideration. But in reaching this conclusion we do not hold that the use of prop* erty in Baltimore City may not he regulated or restricted where such regulation or restriction - is based upon such consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u25a0 In view of this conclusion it becomes unnecessary to. deal with those provisions- of the ordinance which undertake to regulate the height of buildings and the areas of yards and open spaces adjacent thereto, as Well as the number of families who may dwell thereon. Whether those provisions are valid may depend upon facts, which are not before us, for this Court has decided that regulations of that, general character may be enforced where they are needed for the- protection of the public safety, health, or morals, and whether in a given case they are .so required must depend upon the circumstances of that case. And although there is no apparent relation between some of the provisions -of the ordinance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>which prescribe the area which buildings may occupy and limit the number of persons who- may reside upon a given area, and any legitimate exercise of the police power, nevertheless we refrain from passing upon the validity of those provisions, because it may he possible that conditions of which wa are not informed by the record may affect their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Another objection to the ordinance is that it improperly extends the jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Court, but we do not think that' that contention can he sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Article 4, section 39, of the Constitution of Maryland provides that \u201cthe General Assembly may reapportion, change or enlarge the jurisdiction of the several courts\u201d of Baltimore City. Article 11A of that Constitution provides that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore shall have full power \u2022to enact local laws of said city.\u201d That this is; a \u201clocal law\u201d can hardly he questioned, nor can there he any doubt but that the General Assembly could have provided for an appeal from the hoard of zoning appeals to- the Baltimore City Court. And since by the direct mandate of the people the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore is given the right to enact local laws, there seems to he no reason why they have not the same power which the General Assembly has to provide for such judicial hearings as may he deemed proper and necessary to the administration ,of such laws. Any other construction would tend to- nullify the purpose of the Home Rule Amendment, for if the city has not the power to provide for such judicial hearing and review as may he necessary to the proper administration of such laws as they may pass under that amendment, its power to legislate would he incomplete and abortive. And when it was given the power to- legist late it must necessarily have been given at the same time such powers as were essential to make that power effective. And since, in many instances a judicial hearing and review of questions arising under such legislation is essential to- the validity thereof, it must have been intended that it should have the power to provide therefor. Aud that such is .the construction which this Court has placed upon that provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the Constitution 'is intimated, if not expressly decided, in <em>State etc. v. Rutherford, </em>145 Md. 163. In reaching this conclnsion, however, we are not to he understood as deciding that the jurisdiction vested in the Baltimore City Court upon, appeal hy this ordinance is a valid. exercise of that power, nor that that court can he required to exercise any other than judicial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A further objection is that the power granted to the hoard of zoning, appeals to disregard and in effect set aside the provisions of the ordinance in particular cases is too arbitrary and indefinite to he sustained. From what we have said it follows that in our opinion the real objection to that delegation of power is not that it commits to that hoard a discretion, for that may he essential to any proper administration of the law, hut that it fails to provide any proper standards or rules hy which the exercise of that discretion must be guided and limited in so far as it applies to the \u201cuse\u201d provisions of the ordinance, and if it were necessary to decide that question in this ease, we would hold it to he invalid in so far as it applied] to those provisions. For reasons already given, however, we are not called upon to decide whether it is invalid in so far as it applies to the height and area restrictions, and we will not pass npon that question, further than to say that it does not necessarily follow that, because the standards and rules provided to control the exercise of the discretion vested in the hoard in passing npon the uses of property are too indefinite, that they are insufficient to limit and control that discretion when applied to the location and construction of buildings. For in the one case; the subject of the discretion is intangible, impalpable, and aesthetic, while in the other it is material and substantial, and its physical incidents and consequences are capable of being positively and definitely ascertained. \u201cPractical difficulties,\u201d and \u201cunnecessary hardships\u201d may have a definite meaning when applied to the construction of a building, but are quite meaningless when applied to the effect which the proximity of a small tailor shop may have on the aesthetic sensibilities of persons in its vicinity. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The record before us is unsatisfactory in that it does not show affirmatively that the petitioner has complied with all the requirements prerequisite to the issuance of the permit applied for, but from the agreed statements of fact we have assumed that he has, and that the permit was refused solely ou the ground that the business which he proposes to operate is in a residence district. If there was no other ground than that for its refusal it should have been issued, but because that does not clearly appear the order appealed from will be reversed, and the cause remanded for such further proceedings in accordance with the view? expressed in this opinion as may he proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\n<em>Order reversed, with costs, and came remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b364-6\">Bond, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYC\">filed the following dissenting opinion, in which Ubneb, J., concurred.-</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It is always well to remind ourselves how limited is the function of a court in such an inquiry as this. The- judges have not been commissioned by tbe people to survey tbe conditions existing in the State or city from time to' time and decide what governmental regulation is desirable and wise for the future. To the legislative branch of the giovernment, and in this connection to the officials of the city government, that function has been given in its 'entirety. And on any question of tbe desirability or wisdom of future regulation the conclusion of that branch of the government, and of that branch only, is called for. The courts can, in any instance, consider only the narrow question whether provisions of the constitutions of the United States or the (State prohibit the action decided upon by the legislative branch; and in this particular case, consider only whether the constitutional provision that individuals shall not be deprived of their property without due process of law, or, as -the State Constitution has it, \u201cbut by the law of the land\u201d (article 23 of the Bill of Rights), is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>contravened by the zoning ordinance which, the city government has decided upon and passed. And if that step, is one 'dictated by the judgment of the proper legislative officials in an attempt to exercise the function committed to them, with any foundation for their concluding that the health, morals, safety, or welfare of the community which they have to care for demand it, then there would be no ground for declaring the constitutional provisions violated. The ideas of the court on the reasonableness of the measure have no bearing. In the case of <em>State v. Hyman, </em>98 Md. 596, this Court had to consider the validity of an act of Legislature for the regulation of tailoring establishments, and Chief Judge MoSherry, in passing on the questions now raised, adopted this statement of the law: \u201c \u2018For it must now be considered as an established principle of law in this country, that there are no limits whatever to the legislative powers of the State, except such as are prescribed in their own constitutions or in that of the United States; consequently, that the courts, in the performance of their duty to confine the legislative department within the constitutional limits of its power, cannot nullify and avoid a law, simply because it conflicts with the judicial notions of natural rights or morality or .abstract justice.\u2019 <em>Parker &amp; Worthington, Public Health, &amp; Safety, </em>sec. 8, and cases cited in note 2. * * * The Legislature being the sole depository of the law making power, it is not for courts of justice to say that a given enactment passed in virtue of the police power, ,and having a direct relation to it, is void for unreasonableness, because if courts undertook to exercise such an authority they would in effect exert, a veto on legislation:\u201d \u201cIt is to be remembered,\u201d said the \u00a1Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, </em>239 U. S. 394, \u201cthat we are dealing with one of the most essential powers of government; one that is the least limitabla. It may, indeed, seem harsh in its exercise, usually is on some individual, but the imperative necessity for its exercise precludes any limitation upon it when not exerted arbitrarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">The development of city plans and zoning ordinances, is a recent one, and does involve a considerable extension of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>power to restrict an individual\u2019s use and control of his property. There have, of course, been restrictions imposed in the past, growing with the problems which have arisen as the city has grown. Disturbances have been repressed; noises, smells, smoke restricted for the comfort and convenience of other citizens, .and sanitary restrictions imposed. But this ordinance is concerned, not with any such injurious uses of properties. Other ordinances have already provided for those things. This one is concerned with a mere difference in the character of activity on the premises, business or dwelling, with the mere presence of the one or the .other in the specified areas. The portion of the ordinance with which we now have to deal is a deliberate effort to separate the business of the city from the dwelling\u2019s in so far1 as that is practicable in an old city. That is precisely what we are to consider, .and all we are to consider. And we are to decide whether the deprivation of any owners of ,so much of their freedom in the control or use of their properties in order to accomplish that end can he considered within the scope of the powers committed to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The first objection is based upon the supposition that, in respect to uses which are not nuisances-, the ordinance has for its object merely an aesthetic improvement. With time and the increase of general prosperity .and comfort, it has become increasingly difficult to draw any reasonable distinction between annoyance and discomfort through one sense, such as sme.ll, and that through some other senses that may he described .as aesthetic ones. And however it may be analyzed, there is .a widespread dislike of having business uses invade residence districts, to such a degree that the entry of any business use, with its threat of further business development, is a source of distress to many owners of homes\u2019, and tends to cause depreciation and sacrifice of the homes. The fact is that the conceptions of the people as to- the comfortable and desirable mode of living have been changing; the dwelling places generally desired by city dwellers now are those in more open areas, more or less gardened, and removed from business activities; in about the same conditions; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>indeed, as those which the present ordinance attempts to establish for homes .within the city limits. This modem preference is strong, and it will prevail to the extent of taking dwellers beyond the city limits to live if they cannot get the desired conditions inside the limits. Rapid transit enables them to live outside the city while continuing to .work in it, .and a greatly increasing number are doing so. Eor a long time now, efforts have been made in the development of new residential areas in the city to prevent the environment objected to by covenants in deeds, but this has not proved entirely successful; and, if successful, restrictions by this means are not entirely desirable, because they continue and bind the areas to which they axe .applied indefinitely in the future, in spite of almost all change, and so may become too burdensome to property owners there in course of time. In 1912 an act of assembly (chapter 693) was resorted to for: the protection .of an area being developed in the northwestern portion of the city by requiring that houses there be built entirely detached, ten feet apart, if built' of masonry, twenty feet apart if ,of frame; but this was held beyond the power of the State government, because there was no substantial reason for treating, the one kind of building or the other as'affecting the health or welfare of the citizens, which it was the duty of the State to protect, and the Legislature could not for purely aesthetic purposes invade property rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution. <em>Byrne v. Md. Realty Co., </em>129 Md. 202. The present general ordinance is, apparently, the next step.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">This aversion to the proximity of business uses may .all be without any basis in reason, but it is nevertheless real, and the law cannot disregard the real importance of the illogical in practical affairs. In <em>Baltimore v. Fairfield, 87 </em>Md. 352, in which relief was sought by neighbors from the proximity of a leper duly placed out to board among them by the city, Judge McSherry, for this Court, replying to an argument that the evidence showed the danger of contagion to be negligible, said: \u201cIt is not, in this case, so much a mere .academic inquiry \u00e1s to whether the disease is in fact highly or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>motely contagious; 'but viewed as it is by the people generally, its introduction into a neighborhood is calculated to do a serious injury to the property of the plaintiff there located.\u201d And the cases which have sustained ordinances against the opening of undertaking establishments in residence districts, or have without ordinance\u00ae held snob, a use properly enjoined, have proceeded upon a similar recognition of the materiality of some aversions which .are not based upon physical injury. <em>Saier v. Joy, </em>198 Mich. 295; <em>Meagher v. Kessler, </em>147 Minn. 182; <em>St. Paul v. Kessler, </em>146 Minn. 124; <em>Osborn v. Shreveport, </em>143 La. 932; <em>Beisel v. Crosby, </em>104 Neb. 643; <em>Cunningham v. Miller, </em>178 Wis. 22; <em>Tureman v. Kitterlin, </em>304 Mo. 221. And see note 23 A. L. R 745. The authorities are not in agreement on the power to- enjoin that use, however. <em>Westcott v. Middleton, </em>43 N. J. Eq. 478; <em>Koebler v. Pennewell, </em>75 Ohio St. 278. The upholding of ordinances directed against Chinese laundries affords another illustration. <em>Barbier v. Connolly, </em>113 U. S. 27; <em>Soon Hing v. Crowley, </em>113 U. S. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">If any kind o-r -degree of aesthetic regulation is ever to be .wi'thin the legitimate powers of government, the principle controlling it cannot be formulated as yet, and we are not authorized to declare it to be so-. This has been decided in <em>Stubbs v. Scott, </em>127 Md. 86; <em>Byrne v. Maryland Realty Co., </em>129 Md. 202; and <em>Osborne v. Grauel, </em>136 Md. 92. And see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>234 Mass. 597, and <em>St. Louis Poster Adv. Co. v. St. Louis, </em>249 U. S. 269; <em>contra, State v. New Orleans, </em>154 La. 271. But is the'Court at liberty to assume that an aesthetic purpose was the only one, or even that it. was the predominant purpose, in the enactment of the present ordinance? We have not, of course, heard any of the discussions which .are reported iu the agreed statement of the parties here to have led toi the adoption of the ordinance, and we are .not'informed of the problems- which may have been suggested iu the routine o-f the work of the various officials of the city, and which the present plan is expected to solve. We have only vague information of problems which have already .arisen in still larger cities, and for which B.alti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>more Should, therefore, he preparing. C\u2019an we 'Confidently say from our own experience that \u00a1there cannot have been any utilitarian or administrative ends which were thought by the promoters of the plan to demand the separation of business- .and dwellings as a larger method of handling the congested'population with which the officials will have to deal in the future ? May not the rapid changes in city traffic problems be met more easily by some such plan <em>? </em>And with the increased difficulty -of suppressing crime brought about by the use of automobiles for sudden arrival and flight, may there not be some aid for the meeting of police problems in the zoning plan ? Or, more accurately, could not the officials of the city have thought so? And may it not bp that the stresses and strains of living in a large modem city, with all its complex activities, have grown to a point where the separation of business from dwelling places offers a material, or even necessary, .aid in the maintenance -of the health and vigor of the city population? May it not be that in tbe growth of our predominantly industrial civilization we have arrived at a point where special protection is needed for the mere business of living ? And is it not permissible to make some arrangement for a crowded city population which promises an improvement over the haphazard jumble which may now result from the uncontrolled wills and interests of neighboring owners ? A city is a joint enterprise, and oo-operation is almost the first law of its population if their joint living place is to be kept tolerable as the congestion of affairs in it increases. And if we regard property owners as holders of abstract rights, the same in the country as in a city, we may reverse the process to which they commit themselves as residents or beneficiaries of the city. In <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 234 Mass. 597, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said on this point: \u201cWe do not think it can be said that circumstances do not exist in connection with the ordinary operation of such kind's of business 'which increase the risk of fire, and which render life less secure to those living in homes in close proximity. Health and security from injury of children and the old and feeble and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>otherwise less robust portion of the public well may he thought to be promoted by requiring that dwelling houses be separated from the territory 'devoted to trade aud industry. The suppression and prevention of disorder, the extinguishment of fires and the enforcement of regulations for street traffic, and other ordinances designed rightly to promote the general welfare, may he facilitated by the establishment of zones or districts for business as distinguished from residence. Conversely, the actual health and safety of the community may he aided by excluding from areas devoted to residence the confusion and danger of fire, contagion and disorder, which in greater or less degree attach to the location o-f stores, shops and factories. Regular and efficient transportation of breadwinners to and from places of labor may be expedited. Construction and repair of streets may he rendered easier and less expensive if heavy traffic is confined to specified streets by the business there carried on.\u201d And to the same effect are the subsequent decisions in <em>Inspector of Buildings of Lowell v. Stoklosa, </em>250 Mass. 250, and <em>Spector v. Building Inspector of Milton, </em>250 Mass. 63. And to the same effect is <em>State v. New Orleans, </em>154 La. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">When we come to examine the previous decisions in Maryland, we find that in <em>Easton v. Covey, </em>74 Md. 262, the denial of the permit to establish a livery stable, because it was unsuitable to its surroundings in Easton, was upheld in an opinion by Judge Miller. In <em>State v. Hyman, </em>98 Md. 596, the Court found an act for regulation of tailoring establishments to be within the police power of the Legislature; and that case was upon closely similar facts. It prohibited tailoring in dwellings except where licensed by a public official, and vested in that officer a discretion in granting or refusing permits which, on the face of the act, was almost unlimited. And the grounds of attack were also closely similar to those in the present case. Many other occupations have likewise been lawfully subjected to regulation; and public utility regulation is a familiar recent exercise of the police power. <em>Gregg v. Public Service Commission, </em>121 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Md. 1. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld a prohibition of the continued manufacture of bricks in a restricted district <em>(Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, </em>239 U. S. 394); of a livery stable <em>(Reinman v. Little Rock, </em>237 U. S. 171) ; and of bill hoards <em>(Cusack Co. v. Chicago, </em>242 U. S. 526). And somewhat in advance, of most of .these decisions is that in the case of <em>Cochran v. Preston, </em>108 Md. 220, in which a restriction on the height of buildings to he erected on Mt. Vernon Place in Baltimore City was held valid; and that in <em>Osborne v. Grauel, </em>136 Md. 91, which upheld a refusal to issue a permit for a garage because the Mayor did not \u201cthink garages ought to be built in that community; that it Was a very nice class of property out there and that these garages would depreciate the value of the property * * * and that the 'character of the proposed buildings did not conform to the other improvements in the neighborhood.\u201d In the case of <em>Cochran v. Preston, supra, </em>the Court found that the \u25a0statute might he justified as necessary to meat a fire hazard of special seriousness, hut the propriety of the restriction if intended to accomplish a purely aesthetic purpose was discussed, and in denying it the Court, page 229, said, \u201cSuch is undoubtedly the weight of authority, though it may he that in the development of a higher civilization, tire culture and refinement of the people has reached the point where the educational Value of the fine arts, as expressed in architectural symmetry and harmony, is so well recognized as to give sanction, under some circumstances, to the exercise of this power even for such purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Upon these considerations, the conclusion of Judge Umer and myself on <em>the </em>first and main question, whether this ordi- ' nance can he said to have a purpose which it is the function of the government to effectuate, is that it can be. We take the view that the possibilities pointed out for improvement in living conditions, and in the handling of administrative problems^ may well have justified the adoption of the separation of business and the dwelling places for the future, uuder the police power, and that this measure of co-operatiou required of the citizens is one which the judges cannot say is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>arbitrary or unnecessarily oppressive. And, proceeding from this conclusion, we tbink, further, that the vesting of so wide a discretion in the hoard of zoning appeals by the provisions of the ordinance cannot properly be held an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The nature and magnitude of the undertaking do, as the majority opinion points out, give rise to difficulties in accomplishing it, of legal as well as of practical importance. Discrimination .among the many thousands of situations, of particular properties, and of possible uses, is, of course, impracticable, so- that the work can be done only by broad classifications, with inevitable disregard of some differences, and presumably with inevitable hardship and injustice in some cases\u00bb And as tbe conditions to be dealt with in such a living city are transitory, no fixed arrangement can he- made for them. An agency with little limitation upon its discretion and freedom of action must be set up, and might soon become the chief immediate source of the law .and of its administration. But it seems sufficiently clear that the effort is to make necessary adaptation within the limits of the plan and purpose indicated in the ordinance, and it is restrained by a provision for appeal. There is nothing novel in the device, nor in the breadth of the discretion delegated. Legislation which has to provide for a large number of special eases of varied facts, or for unforseeable conditions present or future-, mus-t be supplemented by the action of administrative officers with piower to adapt and v-ary the rule as the special cases come before them, one by one. If this were not permissible, then the legislative branch of the government could not deal with some -of the needs of the country or of the community at all, for it can be done in no other way. As early as 1794, O\u2019ongre-s-s passed an act which gave the President p-ower to lay an embargo on shipping! \u201cwhenever in bis opinion, the public safety shall so require,\u201d and under regulations to be continued or revoked \u201cwhenever he shall think proper.\u201d So another act later conferred upon the President authority to reduce revenue and equalize duties on imports, and for other purposes to suspend by proclamation tbe free introduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, when he is satisfied that any country producing such articles imposes duties or other exactions upon the agricultural or other products of the United \u00a1States which he may deem to he reciprocally unequal or unreasonable; and it was held a valid delegation of power. <em>Field v. Clark, </em>143 U. S. 649. A statute which declared its purpose to exclude the lowest grades of tea from importation, .and then left it to the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the standards to.be applied, was held valid. <em>Buttfield v. Stranahan, </em>192 U. S. 470. Chief Justice White, in the opinion of the Court in that case, said: \u201cCongress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable, and from the necessity of the case was oompelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing about the. result pointed out by the statute. To deny the power of Congress to delegate such a duty Would, in effect, amount but to declaring that the plenary powers vested in Congress to regulate foreign commerce could not be efficaciously exerted.\u201d And again, in <em>Union Bridge Co. v. United States, </em>204 U. S. 387, the Court said: \u201cIndeed, it is not too much to say that a denial to Congress of the right, under the Constitution, to delegate power to determine some fact or the state of things upon which the enforcement of its enactment' depends would be To stop the Wheels of government\u2019 and bring about confusion, if not paralysis, in the conduct of business.\u201d And SO', it was held constitutional for Congress to authorize the Secretary of War to fix and change harbor lines <em>(Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, </em>223 U. S. 605, 635, 638) ; and to empower the Secretary of Agriculture to make substantive rules .and regulations covering forest reservations, and to make criminal the violation of those rules (<em>United States v. Grimaud, </em>220 U. S. 506). All this may be found in conflict, with expressions, and, indeed, decisions, in earlier cases; but there has been an enforced growth and change in constitutional Conceptions as to proper delegation of power to governmental agencies. Senator Elihu Boot, who speaks with the authority of a most profound understanding of our institutions, and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>law, said to the American Bar Association in 1916: \u201cAs any community passes from simple to complex conditions the only way in which government can deal with the increased burdens thrown upon it is by the delegation of power \u00a1to be exercised in detail by subordinate agents, subject to the control of general directions prescribed by superior authority. The necessities of our situation have already led to an extensive employment of that method. The Interstate Commerce' Commission, the iSfcate Public Service Commissions, the Federal Trade Commission, the powers of the Federal Reserve Board, the health departments of the states, and many other supervisory offices and agencies1 are familiar illustrations. Before these agencies the old doctrine prohibiting the delegation of legislative power has virtually <em>retired </em>from the field and given up&gt; the fight. Thera will be no withdrawal from these experiments. We shall go on; we shall expand them, whether we approve theoretically or not, because such agencies furnish protection to rights and obstacles to wrongdoing which under our social and industrial conditions cannot be practically .accomplished by the old and simple procedure of legislatures and courts as iu the last generation.\u201d And he then proceeded to emphasize the necessity -of having the agencies themselves held under rule. There may be more fight left iu the doctrine prohibiting the delegation of legislative power than is here conceded, but that there has been at least .a change of line seems unquestionable. The discretion under the zoning ordinance is, after all, little or no greater than that vested in the Public Service Commission for its work. We must assume a disposition on the part of the board. to act justly, and if it fails to do so, there is a remedy by appeal, with a jury trial if desired. <em>State v. Rutherford, </em>145 Md. 363. Therefore the danger of oppression seems sufficiently guarded against. The possibility of differences in the standards of different juries does not make the appeal objectionable or unsatisfactory to the individual property owners in whose interest the constitutionality of the ordinance is questioned. In <em>State v. Hyman, supra, </em>to which reference has been made several times because of its points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of similarity, Judge MelSherry, for the Court, answered much the same objection on' the breadth of the administrative discretion thus: \u201cTested by the principles hereinbefore announced we find nothing in the Act of 1902 which indicates that its design, its purpose or its details have not ,a real .and substantial relation to the police power. It may be conceded that some of those provisions, if harshly administered may be or become oppressive, but it by m&gt; means follows that the law itself is therefore not a legitimate exercise of the poliee power. It is not to be .assumed that the public functionary will act in an oppressive or unlawful manner. Discretion must be reposed somewhere. If an official should transcend the legitimate limits of the authority with which the statute clothes Mm, the injured party is not without redress. Laws are to be upheld rather than stricken down. Every intendment must be made by the courts in favor of the constitutionality of .a statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It is for these reasons our conclusion on the constitutional objections raised has differed from that of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
