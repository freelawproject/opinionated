A verdict was found against appellant for $150. On motion of appellants a new trial was granted, and on a second tidal a verdict was found by a jury against appellants-for $250. This appeal is from a judgment on that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The one bill of exception is to the ruling of the trial court \u201cin granting the plaintiff\u2019s second and third prayers, and in rejecting the defendant, Nettie Goldstein\u2019s, first, second and third prayers', and in rejecting the defendant, Oscar Oeoil\u2019s^ \u2018defendant\u2019s prayer\u2019 and his third and fourth prayer. The reporter is- requested to set out plaintiff\u2019s granted prayers and all the prayers of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We find no- error in the ruling on any of the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s second prayer simply defines \u201cprobable cause.\u201d ILer third is the usual measure of damages prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The- defendant Nettie Goldstein\u2019s first rejected prayer, and the rejected prayer of OsCar Oeeil marked \u201cprayer of the defendant, Oscar C'eeil,\u201d are demurrers to the evidence. These will he- discussed later.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The third prayer of the defendant Goldstein was properly refused because it is argumentative, and so far as it is a demurrer to the evidence, is covered by her first prayer:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Her second prayer is a variance prayer and does not set out in what the variance consists.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">Defendant Oscar Cteeil\u2019s first prayer -was withdrawn and his second prayer was granted as amended. His third prayer was properly refused because it sought to have submitted to- the jury only the fact as to whether of not the said defendant swore out the warrant of arrest, basing the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>on the finding as to that fact, and omitting all reference to his participation otherwise in the prosecution. As the second prayer of this defendant, as amended (there appearing on the record no objection or exception to the amendment), submitted the omitted fact to the jury, it was a concession that there was evidence .as to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">His fourth prayer was properly refused because it is argumentive and diseussess the law in general without submitting specific facts to be found by the jury. This leaves for consideration the demurrer prayers above referred to'.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">These prayers axe based on the contention of appellants that there was no evidence legally sufficient to show want of probable cause for the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In suits for malicious prosecution, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that the prosecution complained of was instigated by the defendant without probable cause and that it terminated in an acquittal, dismissal or .abandonment. Malice is also a necessary element but, When not negatived, it may be inferred by the jury from the absence of probable cause, though no express malice be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Where probable cause is shown, no suit will lie for malicious prosecution, whatever the <em>actual motive </em>for the prosecution may appear to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Probable cause, as defined in a number of eases, is: \u201cSuch reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves as to warrant a cautious man in believing the party .accused to be guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Whether the evidence in any given case is legally sufl&gt; cient to show want of probable cause is a question-of law; or, as said in <em>Thelin v. Dorsey, </em>59 Md. 545, \u201cwhat will amount to the want of probable cause, in any Case, is a question of law for the court.\u201d Sea <em>Jordan v. The James &amp; Holstrom Piano Co., </em>140 Md. 201, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The testimony on behalf.of the plaintiff tends to prove that in February, 1921, she Was living with her father, George G. Eau, and her brother, \u2022 George D: Eau, Jr:, 2130 Walbrook Avenue, and was keeping house for her father; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that her brother owned the dog of whose barking complaint was made; that the license was issued in the name of George G. Bau, 2130 Walbrook Avenue; that the dog had been there for .about four years prior to February, 1921, and no complaint was made of bim until the early part of that year; that in September, 1920, plaintiff complained to tbe defendant, Mrs. Nettie Goldstein, that her daughter was entertaining \u201cher fellows\u201d on plaintiff\u2019s front steps, \u201cand it made her angry, and then that following week she made the remark she was going to see that I got rid of the \u2018D\u2019 dog\u201d; that Mrs. Goldstein called plaintiff a \u201cskinny old maid\u201d and her father \u201can old cadger\u201d; that after that, some time in January, 1921, \u201cthey started a dispute about the dog, and then February they had me arrested on account of the dog\u201d; that the dog was a pet of the family; that it did not bark more than dogs ordinarily do; that plaintiff was arrested and taken to the police station; that both of the defendants were at the police station, hut she prayed a jury trial and the case was sent to the Criminal Court of Baltimore City, where she was tried by a jury and acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Officer John D. .Schmidt, testifying for plaintiff, said: \u201cThat 6.10 P. M. Jnlia Bau was charged with violating Article 138, disturbing a certain neighborhood in Baltimore City, State of Maryland, on or about February 23, 1921; under the proper headings the following appeared; name and address, Julia Bau, 2130 Walbrook Avenue; sex, female; age, 29; occupation, house'keeper; single; complainant\u2019s name, Cbra Berryman, 2136 Walbrook Avenue; witnesses\u2019 names and addresses, Oscar Cecil, Nettie Goldstein, Carrie Goldman; disposition, jury trial prayed, released on bail for court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">This officer further testified, on cross-examination, that two complaints were made to him, one by Oscar Cecil and one by a Mr. Byers Bidgewood; that Cecil asked him for information as to1 what he could do with reference to the dog annoying the neighborhood. \u201cI said I would take the matter up at once and see What I could do. I went then to see Miss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Rau and she said she would comply with my request and try to keep the dog quiet\u201d; that this was about ten days before the arrest; that when he told her that Mr. Cecil was complaining about the dog she said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see where the dog barks so much\u201d; she said, \u201cThey are all complaining in the neighborhood\u201d; that Mrs. Goldstein never made any complaint to her with reference to the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">B. Bayly Chapman, testifying for plaintiff, said that he was a.t the time of the arrest .a police magistrate at the Northwestern Police 'Station; that he issued the Warrant for the arrest of plaintiff on February 24th, 1921; that the warrant showed that the complainants were Cora Berryman, Oscar Cecil, Nettie Goldstein and Carrie Goldman. On cross-examination the witness said that he could not say from personal recollection that Oeoil was there, but would say from the warrant that he was there, and made complaint and asked for .a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The testimony offered on behalf of defendants tends to show that the dog was a nuisance to the neighborhood; that the plaintiff not only did not try to stop the dog from harking, but that she encouraged him to do so; that she said to \u00e1 number of witnesses, including the defendant, Nettie Gold-stein, \u201cMy dog don\u2019t have to stop barking, he can hark as much as he pleases\u201d; that to one witness who had a baby, and asked plaintiff if she didn\u2019t pity the child, she replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t stop my dog for any darn Jew\u201d; that to Joseph Goldstein, husband of one of the defendants, plaintiff said, \u201cMy dogs\u201d \u2014 it appears there were two for awhile\u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t have to stop harking for yoti or anybody else, they have licenses and they can hark all they want\u201d; that on one occasion when this witness \u201chollered\u201d at the dogs, plaintiff\u2019s father said, \u201cI wish you would leave them dogs alone, these dogs have license to hark and will hark all they want.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor her father deny that they made the remarks attributed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The testimony is conflicting as to what part the defendants took in the.prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>.It is urged by appellee that she discharged her burden of proving want of probable cause when she proved that the offending dog did not belong to her, and that this fact would have been disclosed to appellants if they had taken ordinary 'precaution to look up the license records-. On the other hand appellants contend that they were justified in relying upon the representations of ownership made by plaintiff herself in referring to the dog as \u201cmy dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">, But that is such a common expression when used in reference to -a household pet by .any member of a family (especially the one who feeds and takes care of it) in speaking to a stranger, that it Should not have been taken as- conclusive without further inquiry, by one about to take s-uch a serious 'step as instigating a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u201cEven if there were circumstances of suspicion in the mind of the defendant which might, have been readily removed or explained by reasonable or proper inquiry, and there was no- inquiry made, such circumstances cannot be made the -ground for showing the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Johns v. Marsh </em>52 Md. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u2022 This case was twice tried, and in each instance was permitted, by the trial judge to go to- the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">As presented by the present record, the .question is not entirely free from doubt. We therefore feel constrained to affirm the ruling of the trial court refusing to withdraw the case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
