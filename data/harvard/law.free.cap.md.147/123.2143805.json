Of these, Fannie (married to Andrew Oarle) died October 20th, 1904, and left to survive her an only child, Marie (now married to Lewis J. Emery); Mathilda (married to Henry J. -Carle) died August 10th, 1902, and left to survive her an only child, Mathilda (now married to Jo-hn Miller); while William H. and-Albert -Stahl survive. The testator died August 20th, 1908, and his wife, the life tenant, died January 23rd, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Marie Emery and Mathilda Miller and their respective husbands, on the theory that they have an interest therein, filed in -Circuit Court Ho. 2 of Baltimore City their bill of complaint for the sale of certain real property included in the estate in lieu of partition, and in that bill they also ask that a deed, under which the title to two lots of ground which were part of the estate became vested in William H. and Albert 'Stahl, be set aside. The two- Stahls, William H. and Albert, in their answer to that bill denied that the complainants had any interest in the estate, and asked that the- -bill be dismissed on that ground, and that question was submitted to the court on testimony supplemented by an agreed statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The lower court determined by its decree that the estate is now vested in the two surviving children of William Stahl, William H. and Albert, and in his two grandchildren, Marie Emery and Mathilda Miller, in equal shares, and from that decree the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The controlling question -presented by the appeal is whether Marie Emery and Mathilda Miller have any interest in the estate which William Stahl, their grandfather, disposed of by that clause of his will, to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The contention of the appellees is: \u201c(1) that the language-in question does not constitute a devise to a class, and (2) if it he a devise to- a class the interests of the two- daughters, are saved to the appellees by virtue of section 326 of article 93 of Bagby\u2019s -Code. The appellants on the other hand contend that the devise is- to a class -and that the rule of survivor-ship applies-, and that section 326 of article 93 0. P. G-. L.. of Md. has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In 1 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>(6th Ed.), p. *232, it is said: \u201cA number of persons are popularly said to- form -a class when they can be designated by some general name, as \u2018children/ \u2018grandchildren,\u2019 \u2018nephews\u2019; but in legal language the question whether a gift is one to- a class depends not upon these considerations, but upon the mode of gift itself, namely, that' it is a gift of an -aggregate sum to a body o-f persons uncertain in number at -the time of the gift, to be ascertained at a future time, and who- are all to- take in -equal or in some other definite proportions, the -share of each being dependent for its amount upon the ultimate number of persons.\u201d That definition of the word was approved in <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 77, and also in <em>Re Henderson\u2019s Estate, </em>161 Cal. 353, and cited in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Morehous, </em>74 N. J. Eq. 658. There is in <em>Re King, </em>200 N. Y. 189, a very careful and clear analysis -of it, in which the court says: \u201cThe exact converse of this definition is well stated by Vice-Chancellor Kindersley in the English case of <em>Cruse v. Howell </em>(4 Drewry, 217) : \u2018If there is a bequest to- certain persons <em>nominatim, </em>or so described as to he fixed at the time of the gift, so that there can be no fluctuation, then, if one of them dies in the lifetime of the testator, his share lapses.\u2019 These two- antithetical definitions clearly mark the line which must be followed in construing -the will now before the court. If the gift were to the nephews and nieces of the deceased husband of the testatrix generally, without designation, restriction, or limitation, it would be a gift to a class, because the ultimate number of the beneficiaries would have remained uncertain and incapable o-f ascertainment until the death of the testatrix. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that event the survivors would, of course, represent the class and take the whole gift. But that, as we have seen, is not this case. The gift of the testatrix was not To a''body of persons uncertain in number at the time of the gift, to be as-certained at some future time,\u2019 but to certain persons To described as to 'be fixed at the time of the gift.\u2019 The bequest was to the nephews and nieces of the deceased 'husband of the testatrix who were living at the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In 34 <em>L. R. A. N. S. </em>945, in a note to the ease last cited, the editor, after referring* to the cases \u201csufficiently similar to render their presentation useful\u201d in couueotiou with that \u25a0principle, says: \u201c'Such decisions, however, lend themselves \u25a0to the generalization that whei*e the element of description referring* to existence at a certain time is to be taken merely \u25a0as signifying an intention that persons corresponding to the general description, but who subsequently come into existence, should not participate in the testamentary provision, the gift is one to a class; but that where such element may fairly be taken in its ordinary descriptive signification, the gift is not to a class, but to the individuals answering the description at the time referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Accepting* that definition, as sound, the question is reduced to this, did the testator by the expression \u201cour children\u201d mean to describe his children living when the will was executed, or did he mean that term to embrace only such persons as would answer that description at some future time. If he intended by it to refer to his children living at the time the will was executed, then the devise was not to a class, but to individuals, because their number was known and certain, but if he intended it to apply to such of his'children as might be alive at some future time, the devise was to a class, because in that event the number of persons who would take would remain uncertain until the time arrived* at which the distribution was to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">There is nothing to he found in the four corners of the will which in any way defines, explains, interprets or qualifies the words \u201cour children.\u201d Unexplained and given their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>customary and technical meaning, they would refer to- children living at the date of the death of the testator, or the termination of the life estate. <em>Alexander on Wills, </em>par. 880. And the appellant contends that since the language of the will is simple, plain and unambiguous, the intention of the testator must be ascertained from it alone, but the question is not quite so simple as that. For, as stated in <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>64 Md. 188, the situation of the testator, and the relations existing between him and the objects\u2019 of his bounty, \u201cmust therefore be considered in connection with the language of the document itself in order that we may be fully enlightened in regard to the real motives and intent\u201d by which he was controlled in the execution of the will. Because the circumstances surrounding its execution may have been such as to make it obvious that the words used, while plain enough, did not express the real intent of the testator <em>(Jarman on Wills </em>(6th Ed.), p. 394), but such evidence, while admissible to place'the court in the situation of the testator, could not be \u201callowed for the purpose of affecting the construction of a will where the language is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Alexander on Wills, </em>par. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In construing the words \u201cour children\u201d as used in this will we are not altogether governed by settled, definite, fixed and invariable rules, for, as said in the King case, <em>supra, </em>\u201cno will has a twin brother,\u201d and many of the cases interpreting similar phraseology turn upon circumstances peculiar to themselves-, and naturally there is some apparent conflict and much real confusion in the decisions, as to the co-nstruction to be placed upon -those or similar words. But while that is so, there are certain rules which, while subject to exception and subject to the cardinal and controlling' principle that the intention of the testator must be given effect, are generally accepted, which are not only of assistance, but must be considered in interpreting such an expression. One is that the will \u201cshould be construed to speak and take effect as if executed immediately before the death o-f the testator.\u201d 28 <em>R. C. L. </em>234. Another is that the word \u201cchildre\"simpliciter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cis a 'technical word, primarily one of purchase, not of limitation, and imports only immediate descendants.\u201d A third is that where the gift is to a class', the objects composing the class take as joint tenants and not as tenants in common, and hence it is subject to the incident of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The application of these rules' has been under discussion in this Court in a number of cases involving facts not wholly dissimilar to those found in this ease, to several of which we will refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In <em>Merowitz v. Whitby, </em>138 Md. 222, property was given in trust for the children of a niece of the testatrix to be equally divided when the youngest child reached the age of eighteen years, \u201cshare and .share alike between said children or those surviving.\u201d One of the children died after the tesr tatrix, but before distribution. In holding that a child of such deceased child was not entitled to share in the distribution, this .'Court said: \u201cIt is true that there are instances to be found in the books where the term 'children\u2019 has been so broadened as to include grandchildren, but these will be found to be limited to cases where the language of the deed or will showed a clear intent on the part of the creator of the trust that such course was in accord with the intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In <em>Burden v. Burden, </em>130 Md. 551, the gift was to the \u201cchild or children\u201d of Evelyn Byrd Burden surviving her, and it was held that children of a deceased child of Evelyn Byrd Burden, who had predeceased her, were not within that description and did not take.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In <em>Dawson v. Akers, </em>127 Md. 585, the gift was in trust for the \u201cuse and benefit of all the children\u201d of Harry B. Akers \u201cuntil the time arrives when there shall be no child of\u201d the said Akers \u201cliving and under twenty-one years of 'age.\u201d Akers had two children, both of whom were living when the youngest became twenty-one, and they applied to have the estate distributed to them discharged of the trust. In dealing with that question this Court said: \u201cThe gift is to Leonora A. Akers in trust, 'for the use and benefit of all the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of ray brother, Harry R. Alters.\u2019 The duration of the trust as fixed by the testator is the time 'when there shall be no child of my said brother Harry\u2019s living and under twenty-one years of age,\u2019 at which time he declared the trust should cease and the distribution of the property made in accordance with the terms of the will. It is therefore a gift to a class of persons, and the mere use of the word 'all\u2019 preceding the word 'children\u2019 does not change the legal effect of the rule applicable to gifts of this character. <em>In re Dellinger\u2019s </em>Estate, 170 <em>Pa. State </em>104; <em>Appeal Hunt et al., </em>19 Atlantic Reporter 548.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">A similar question was considered in <em>Shotts v. Poe. </em>47 Md. 513, where it was .said: \u201cThe only other question is. whether <em>the </em>term 'children,\u2019 used in the declaration of trust, includes children of the son that may be bom after the death of the testator. And upon this question there can be no doubt whatever. If there be any question that may be regarded as ineontrovertibly settled, in the construction of wills or testamentary papers, it is that an immediate gift to children simplieit-er, without additional description, means a gift to the children in existence at the death of the testator; provided there be children then in existence to take.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In <em>Demill v. </em>Reid, 71 Md. 175, it is said: \u201cThe word 'children\u2019 does not ordinarily denote 'grandchildren,\u2019 and' is not to- be <em>so </em>construed, unless the will clearly manifests' that such was the intention of the testator. It is quite impossible to say in this case that the testator meant that grandchildren as well -as children -of his son should share in 'the estate when the contingency which he had prescribed fell out. Ho-r is there any necessity for putting -such .a construction on his language, for there are children here to take, and in such a case Sir William Grant -said, 'I never knew an instance where there were children to answer the proper description, \u2022that grandchildren were permitted to share along with them; although where there is a total want of children, grandchildren have been let in under a liberal construction of the word children.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In <em>Taylor v. </em>Watson, 35 Md. 519, property was devised in. trust for the benefit of Henry Wilmer, and at his death \u201cto his children and their heirs equally; share and share alike.\u201d Although the court held that the language used in other parts of the will manifested an intention on the part of the testator to include in the term \u201cchildren,\u201d a grandchild of Henry Wilmer, whose mother, a daughter of the testator, had died between the execution of the will and the death of the testator, it was said: \u201cAll the \u2022authorities we have consulted</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">establish the proposition that the word \u2018children7 is to be construed as the \u2018immediate offspring,7 ,and not inclusive of \u2018grandchildren,7 unless where there .are no children, or necessary implication requires it. 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>70 <em>marg. </em>and authorities in note (1); 2 <em>Wms. Ex\u2019rs, </em>802.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We find nothing in the Maryland cases cited by the appellee which qualifies the statements of this Court in the cases to which we have referred. In <em>Chase v. </em>Lockerman, 11 G. &amp; J. 185, the Court was dealing with the distribution of certain income which was to be \u201cdivided amongst my children, share and share alike, 'and paid to each of them for the use of their respective children, and by each- of them, so applied,\u201d and it was held that from the whole will an intent was manifested to treat all of his children equally and in that connection it was said\u2019: \u201cWhere the testator stands in the relation of parent, a bequest to children generally will be-presumed, in legal construction, to embrace all who answered that description at the period of his death. A court of equity is always solicitous to adopt and enforce such a construction, because it is conformable to the dictates of nature, and in accordance with the best affections of the heart.\u201d And in <em>Taylor v. Watson, supra, </em>the court, in holding 'that the word children as used in the will under consideration there included a grandchild, expressly stated1 that it found \u201cin the will itself\u201d evidence that the testator intended it to have such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">These statements of the law applicable to the question before us found in these eases is so generally recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>any further citation of authorities seems superfluous, but we will refer to one other case, <em>Trenton Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. v. Sibbits, </em>62 N. J. Eq. 131, in which language of similar import to that under consideration here was construed. The bequest in that case was to \u201cthe children of any sister Diademma Doughty, share and share alike.\u201d One child died before the testator, leaving two children to survive him. In construing those words under those circumstances, the Court of Chancery of New Jersey .said: \u201cThat the bequest to the children of Diademma Doughty wias a gift to a class is entirely dear. <em>Gordon v. Jackson, </em>58 N. J. Eq. 166. Nor will the direction that tire gift shall <em>go </em>to the children, share and share alike, destroy the class. The gift is to such of - the children as are alive -at the death of the testator, no other date for ascertaining the members of the class having been fixed by the testator. It is therefore those who survive the testator who are to take, share and share aike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In determining the time at which the members of a class to share in a gift are to be ascertained, where it is not fixed 'by the will itself and where the gift is immediate, the time is fixed at the death of the testator <em>(Demill v. Reid, supra), </em>and- where it is postponed pending the determination of a preceding estate, it is fixed at the distribution of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Applying these rules to the facts bejfore us we must hold that the devise in this case was to the children of the testator as a class, the members of which were to 'be ascertained at the time of the death of the life tenant. There is not a word in the will aside from what we have quoted which in any way refers to the children of the testator, \u2019and the words used are as clear; unambiguous and plain as language can be. The testator devised his property to be equally divided at the termination of the life estate among \u201cour children\u201d share and share alike. Those words had a definite technical meaning Which the .testator must be presumed to have known, when he executed the will. To depart from that meaning, and supply 'by conjecture based upon humanitarian considerations another meaning, so as to extend the benefits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>will to persons who might justly aud. naturally expect to share in the estate would not be to- construe the will but to make another one. There is nothing in the will and nothing extrinsic to the will which can give to the words we have quoted any other than their legal and technical meaning, or indicate any intention on the part of the testator that they should have any other meaning, unless we can infer such an intent from the mere fact that the testator was on pleasant terms with his children and his grandchildren, and if that were -sufficient, the meaning of wills would depend not upon their language but upon the situation of the testator when they were executed, no matter how\u201d clear and plain that language might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Ho-r do we think article 93, section 326, C. P. G. L. of Md. applies to the facts of this case. ' This is not the case of a legacy which has failed or lapsed, because there was uo legacy to the appellees at -all, -since the legacy was to a class- and there were in being at the death of the life tenant members of the class who were entitled to take the gift to the class, and what was said in <em>Young v. Robinson, </em>11 G. &amp; J. 341, we regard as conclusive of that question. The Court there, iu discussing this section, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">\u201cIt is presumed, that those persons of the described class, who -survived the testator, were the only objects of bis bounty, so that if an individual answering the description of the \u25a0bequest, who, if living at the death of the- testator, would have been entitled to participate in \u2018the bequest, happen to die before 'him, that event, from the above presumption, will not occasion a lapse of any part of tbe -fund. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">It is supposed that this latter act makes the case before tbe Court, as there are legatees described in the will, who- died before the testator. But we apprehend it was not the design of the Legislature to- change or alter any of the existing rules in the construction of wills, but simply to provide for such cases o-f legacies and devises as by -the rules of law lapsed, o-r failed to take effect, by tbe death of the devi-see or- legatee in the life time oif the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>From what we have said it follows that in our opinion the appellees have no interest in the estate of William Stahl, and the bill oif complaint in this case should have been dismissed, and in view of that conclusion it becomes unnecessary to discuss the exceptions to the evidence found in the record. The decree appealed from will therefore be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed with costs, and hill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">Urner, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
