The appeal is not from the award of costs, but from the final judgment that the appellant had no cause of action. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>70 Md. 472, 478, 479; <em>Emersonian Apartments v. Taylor, </em>132 Md. 210, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The action of the lower court in sustaining the demurrer to appellant\u2019s- declaration raises the remaining question.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The controlling facts admitted by the demurrer -are that, during the occurrence of the matters set forth in the declaration, Charles M. T. Soulsby wa-s the sheriff -of Talbot County, with the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland as his surety on a bond conditioned upon the said sheriff\u2019s well -and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>truly performing in all -things the duties appertaining to- the office that were required by law by -the sheriff to be performed ; and the breach alleged is that a certain Isaiah Fountain was under a sentence of death iand in the sheriff\u2019s custody in the jail of Talbot County to he hanged on the 23rd day of July, 1-920, when, through the negligence of the sheriff, Fountain made his escape on July 5th, and while the escaped felon was at large, the sheriff, without warrant or commitment, tools Isabella Brooks into his custody and imprisoned her for a period -of thirty days in the jail o-f Talbot County, Which was in his keepi, on the charge of having aided' and abetted in the escape of Fountain; and that during this period of confinement and for the purpose of forcing her to disclose to him the hiding place of the convict, and information which would show the manner -of his escape, and lead to his re-capture, the- sheriff caused the hands and wrists -of the appellant to be bound with a strong rope with which she was suspended from the ceiling of the jail, clear of the floor and all other support, and while s-o hanging was questioned, mistreated' and tortured by the sheriff, although the appellant was innocent of any crime and was not possessed o-f the imputed knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">For the acts set out in the declaration the sheriff was indictable for .an offense against the State, and was responsible in a civil action to the appellant for his tort, -hut whether or not the surety on his official bond was answerable in damages in a separate and distinct proceeding against a third party is a different question which, in Maryland, depends upon whether the wrongs done were within the prescribed statutory condition of, the sheriff\u2019s bond that \u201che shall well and faithfully execute the office o-f sheriff' of\u201d Talbot C-ounty, \u201cin all things appertaining thereto, and shall well and truly perform all the duties required hy law to he hy him performed.\u201d Code of Public -'General Laws, art. 87, sec. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The obligation of a surety on an official bond is contraefinal and is not to be extended beyond the meaning of its terms, sensibly and reasonably construed. As was- -said by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>this Court, and since consistently applied: \u201cIt is familiar law that the contract of \u00e1 surety upon an official hond is subject to the strictest interpretation. They undertake, in the language of Judge Cooley, Tor nothing which is not within the strict letter of their contract. The obligation is <em>strictissimi juris, </em>and nothing is to he 'taken by construction against the obligors. They have consented to be bound to a certain extent only, and their liability must be found within the terms of that consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard County v. Hill, </em>88 Md. 111, at p. 120; <em>Wilson v. Fowler, </em>88 Md. 601, 605; <em>Southern Md. Bank v. National Surety Co., </em>126 Md. 290, 293-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">An application of this sound canon of construction limits the liability of the surety to the acts of the sheriff in the execution of all the duties of his office, whether they arise at .common law or are imposed by statute. This is indicated by the form of the bond that the Legislature has specified under the mandate of the Constitution, and by the further provision that if the sheriff\u2019s annual bond should not be regularly filed before January first, but be filed within the ninety days\u2019 period of grace following the first day of January, it shall contain the condition that the obligors of the bond shall be \u201c\u2019responsible also for all official acts of said sheriff committed or done by him from the said first day of January np^ to the date of the filing of the said bond as well as thereafter.\u201d Constitution of Maryland, art. 4, sec. 45; Code, art. 87, secs. 2, 4. The surety\u2019s obligation,- therefore, is co-extensive with the duties of the sheriff\u2019s office, but does not extend beyond this single limitation on the scope of the bondsman\u2019s contractual liability. In the ascertainment of whether the wrong complained of is within the stipulations of the bond, the Maryland rule, which was adopted after careful consideration of the opposite view and of the authorities supporting it, is that if the -act is done by virtue of the authority of the office the surety is liable, but if the thing committed is merely by color of his office,- the surety is not responsible under the terms of the bond. <em>State, use of Vanderworker, v. Brown et al., </em>54 Md. 318, 324-326; <em>State v. Timmons, </em>90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Md. 10, 12; <em>State, use of Williams, v. Dayton, </em>101 Md. 598; <em>Wilson v. Fowler, </em>88 Md. 601, 604-609; <em>Cocking v. Wade, </em>87 Md. 529, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The rule thus laid down in <em>State, use of Vanderworker, v. Brown et al., </em>54 Md. 318, was under review in <em>Wilson v. Foivler, </em>88 Md. 601, where this Court, after again weighing the conflicting views of the courts of other jurisdictions, reaffirmed its own doctrine and said: \u201cIn <em>Lammon v. Feusier, </em>111 U. S. 17, where a conclusion was reached different from that of 54 Md., many of the cases were cited and reviewed. When such eminent judges1 as Chief Judge Grreen of Mew Jersey, Judge Cowen of Mew York, and Judge Eluffin of Month Carolina, are found in accord with the view expressed in 54 Md., and Chief Judges Shiaw of Massachusetts, Tilghman of Pennsylvania, Bronson of Mew York, and Thurman of Ohio; with Judge Miller of the Supreme 'Court, are found opposed to that view, it is apparent that the question is one of much difficulty. We think, however, that the view expressed by Judge Barfcol must he admitted to he in accord with the principles announced in the eai-lier Cases in this State when trespasses hy sheriffs have been considered, and to be supported by some practical considerations of public policy, and we have, therefore, no1 disposition to question or weaken its legitimate authority in similar cases'.\u201d The subsequent cases cited in briefs on tbis appeal bring nothing to the controversy but the weight of repietition.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In the later cases of <em>State v. Timmons, </em>90 Md. 10, and of <em>State, use of Williams, v. Dayton, 101 </em>Md. 598, the accepted Maryland view was again recognized ,and applied, .and nothing remains for the Court but to enforce, with its full ap^ proval, the established rule of this tribunal. The criterion, therefore, of the surety\u2019s liability is whether the wrongful acts 'by the sheriff were done <em>virtute officii </em>or <em>colore officii. </em>The former are \u201cwhere a man doing an act within the limits of his official authority exercises that 'authority improperly, or abuses the discretion placed in him. The latter are where the act committed 'is of such nature that the office gives him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>no authority to do it; in the doing of thait act he is not to be considered as an officer.\u201d <em>Supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">According to tbe admitted averments of the declaration, the sheriff, without reasonable grounds to suspect that Isabella Brooks was accessory in any way to the escape of Fountain o&lt;r had any information to impart that might lead to his recapture, arrested her without warrant, and did not take her at all before a magistrate for her there to be dealt with comformably to law, according to the exigency of the case, but imprisoned and detained herj without commitment, for thirty days in the county jail, where she was questioned and tortured to make her reveal information, which she did not possess, in reference to the escape, flight and refuge of Fountain. 1 <em>Bishop on Crim. Law, </em>secs. 181-183; <em>Mitchell v. Lemon, </em>34 Md. 176, 181; <em>Kirk &amp; Sons v. Garrett, </em>84 Md. 380, 405, 407; Code, art. 87, sec. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">These acts were unjustifiable, and in the commission of them the sheriff was neither executing a writ nor was he acting in pursuance of the duties of his office, but in clear and unmistakable violation of its primary and fundamental inhibitions. He. is disclosed as a trespasser <em>vi et armis </em>from the start, and as such, but not in his official character, an action lies against him. As was said of this bond in <em>Cocking v. Wade, </em>87 Md. at p. 544: \u201cThere is no clause to cover au abuse or usurpation of power \u2014 no negative words that he will commit no wrong by color of his office, nor do anything not authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In our view of the case the judgment of the lower Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss appeal denied, with the costs of the motion to the appellant; and judgment affirmed, with other costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
