There is noi statutory -or constitutional provision requiring thei city to pay these feesi, except when iam -accused person i-si -acquitted, but it has been the immemorial cu-stom -of the, city to pay thiem iu every case of conviction in which the. defendant does not pay -them, and in the case of the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. </em>Pattison, 136 Md. 64, where the question of fees paid by the city in criminal oases to -the, clerk of the Criminal Court of' Baltimore- was involved, this Court held that the custom h.'aid \u201cbeen soi long 'and ,sio universally recognized and acted upon ais, to- b acomia .a, part -of the common law of the State.\u201d It, is conceded in the .briefsi in the present case that the decision abo-vei cited .also applies -to the .appearance f ees paid to- the State\u2019s attorney by the city in- oas-eis of conviction, and that, prior to -the, enactment of. chapter 576, the city wasi required, by the common law -of the -State-, to pay those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Under thei provisions of .section, 1 of article 15 of the Constitution -of Maryland, .the clerks: -of thei courts, register of wills,, \u00a1sheriff, and the State\u2019s attorney of Baltimore City are required -annually' to- remit to- the State treasurer whatever surplus o-f their receipts remains after the payment of the salaries and expenses of their respective -offices. For a ease hloilding -that, the sheriff -of Baltimore- -City is subject to the provisions -of this section' -o-f the Constitution, see <em>State v. Green, </em>120 Md. 681, 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Chapter 576 of the- Acts of 1924, which went into'effect Tune 1st, 1924, undertook, among other thing's-, to- relieve the City of 'Baltimore of its common law liability to pay tbe fees above- mentioned, and when -the 'State\u2019s attorney presented \u25a0a bill for the fees earned by his -office during Tune, 1924, amounting to $2,440, payment was refused .and this suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>followed. The declaration originally mnltiainad the common counts &gt;and \u00a1a special count, hut, hy agreement,' -tihe common counts were withdrawn, a demurrer inteaposed to the special count, and it was stipulated and agreed by counsel \u201cthat all technical errors and irregularities in the pleadings * * * are hereby waived to the 'end that the only question intended to he liaised by these proceedings, viz: The constitutionality wZj <em>no*n </em>of chapter 5l6&gt; of the Acts of 1924, may he submitted to the court for determination.\u201d It was conceded that if chapter 516 was Valid1, the \u00a1special count was had .and the suit could not he maintained, hut the learned court below held Aapter 5P6 invalid, on the ground that it changed the office of State\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City from a fee office \u00a1to a, salaried office in violation of \u00a1section 9 of article 5 of the Constitution. The demurrer to -the special count Was accordingly overruled, and, the defendant, the Mayor \u2018and City Council of Baltimore, declining to plead further, judgment was entered against 'it, .and it took this appeal. In the argument .before this Court, four aonstitutional 'objections were urged against the act in question, hut in the view which we take of the matter it will only he necessary to consider two of these, the alleged violation of the provisions of section 52 of article 3 of the Constitution, commonly known as -the Budget Amendment, and the one sustained hy th\u00a9 court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Omitting the title and enacting \u00a1clause, chapiter 516 reads as fallows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aur\">\u201c351-A. The Treasurer of the State is hereby directed to credit to one account all sums of money which may be received by him in pursuance of section 1 of article 15 of the Constitution, from all of the officers connected with the administration of justice in Baltimore City, viz: clerks of courts, sheriff, State\u2019s attorney and register of wills; and is hereby directed to pay out of the money in his hands, from time to time, to the credit of said account, whatever sums may be necessary to meet any deficiency or deficiencies between the amount of fees collected by any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>or more of said officers and the amount of the salaries and other expenses authorized by the law of such officer or officers. The amounts expended for salaries and other expenses shall be subject to the approval of the Comptroller. The Comptroller of the State shall, from time to time, draw warrauts upon the State Treasurer, payable out of the monies in the hands of said Treasurer to the credit of said account, for the payment of any such deficiency or deficiencies to any one or more of said officers, not at any time to exceed the amount to the credit of said account. In the event that the amount due to the credit of said account should not be sufficient at the end of any year to meet the deficiency or deficiencies of any one or more of said officers, the additional sum necessary to meet such deficiency or deficiencies shall he paid by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to such officer or officers, and, except as provided in this section, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore shall not be liable for any of the salaries or expenses of any of said officers, and shall not he liable for the fees or costs of any of said officers, except in cases where said Mayor and City Council of Baltimore is a party litigant, and is chargeable therefor as such party litigant. In the event that the amount to the credit of said, account shall he more than sufficient to meet said deficiency or deficiencies, then the excess to the credit of said account shall be a part of the general revenue of the State available to meet the appropriations in the State budget.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Prior to the adoption of -the Budget Amendment by the people <em>of </em>the <em>State in </em>1916, <em>there </em>was <em>no </em>\u2019Orderly plan or system wihidhi tibe 'General Assembly Was required to follow in 'disbursing <em>the State\u2019s </em>revenues, 'and a\u00ae a result appropriations! were more or less unciorrelaited and deficits in tbe State treasury were not un/usuail. <em>The </em>purpose <em>of the </em>Budget Amendment was to remedy this situation by providing an intelligent and definite method of estimating and 'appropriating the income of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>It provides that \u201cthe General Assembly shall not appropriate any money out of the treasury\u201d .except by \u201ceither a budget bill, or a supplementary appropriation bill, .a\u00ae hereinafter mentioned.\u201d It .also provides that, -within a designated time after the convening; of the General Assembly, the Governor shall -submit to that body two budgets, one for each of the ensuing fiscal years., containing a, complete plan of estimated revenues, and proposed expenditures for the particular fiscal year to which it relates, and .showing the estimated surplus .or deficit -of revenues at the end of such year*. The -Governor -also submits a bill for .all the proposed appropriations of the budgets clearly itemized and classified, which is known as the budget bill. After this bill has been introduced, the Governor may .amend or supplement it, and the General Assembly, subject to certain exceptions, may \u201cstrike out .or\u2019 reduce the items therein,\u201d but, save as regards the General Assembly -and the judiciary, it cannot add to or increase the items in the bill. \"When passed by the General Assembly, the budget bill becomes a law without further action by the Governor. As defined in the Budget Amendment, a \u201csupplementary appropriation hill\u201d is \u201ca sep\u00a1arat-e bill limited to. some single Work, object or purpose therein stated,\u201d which provides \u201cthe revenue necessary to pay the appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to. be laid and collected 'as shall be. directed in said bill,\u201d and -it must be passed in each house on a roll call vote by a majority of the whole number of the members elected, .and must be presented -to the Governor for bis action as provided in section 11 of .article 2 of the 'Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">It was suggested in the argument before this Oourt thait the sole purpose of .the Budget Amendment was. to. do away with \u201ccontinuing appropriations,\u201d Which, under the. old system, contributed .so largely to the confusion 'and uncertainty which attended the disbursement of \u00a1the State\u2019s revenues. But this contention is obviously tmsonnd. A few words would bave sufficed toi abolish Isuch .appropriations; the amendment goes much further. It establishes .an intelligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>and. accurate method of gauging the S\u00edtate\u2019\u00a9 financial condition rand of spending it\u00a9 money. Under it the Governor is required to present to' each General Assembly a balance sheet of the State\u2019s finances, together with an estimate of the \u2018annual income of the State and also his own views as to \u25a0how the -available portion of that income should he \u00a9pent in maintaining the State\u2019s governmental agencies, 'and in carrying on the various activities in which the State i-s engaged. And tire General Assembly, though 'authorized to' reduce or strike out many of the it\u00e9mis in the bill, is. prohibited, except in the two instances heretofore mentioned, from adding, to or increasing the various expenditures suggested by the Governor, unless at the same time it provide\u00a9 the revenue needed to meet its new or increased appropriations; and' observes the other constitutional requirements relating to \u201csupplementary appropriation bibb.\u201d The amendment is the expression of the direct will of the people; it is .a clear instruction from them to apply to the financial \u2018affairs of the State some of the principles of efficiency which private business has long been \u25a0accustomed to practise, and it i\u00ae the duty of the courts to give effect to this expression, and to. safeguard it whenever\u2019 necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Chapter 576 of the Acts of 1924 specifically provides that money in the State treasury 'shall be paid out to meet any deficiencies between income 'and expenses which may arise in .any of the offices mentioned in the act. It is true that the act cloie\u00a9 provide for placing the excess fees received from any of .the-se offices in one account in the treasury, and limits the appropriation for d\u00e9ficits toi the balance in that account, but this cannot be held to exempt the appropriation from the pro vision\u00a9 of the Budget Amendment. Once these excess fees are paid info the treasury, ais contemplated by the .act itself, they must remain in the treasury until withdrawn therefrom in accordance with the provisions of the amendment. If the General Assembly can, by the simple expedient of directing that certain S\u00edtate revenue he placed in special accounts in the treasury, .secure the right to. .appropriate it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>without reference to .the requirements of the Budget Amendment, then the General Assembly has tire power to nTiBify the amendment. Suoh a proposal carries its own refutation; but aside from this consideration, the plain and unambiguous language of the amendment itself clearly prohibits the General Assembly from \u201cappropriating any money out of the treasury except in \u25a0accordance with\u201d tibie provisions of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The -appellant relies on certain language used by Judge Trner in deciding the case of <em>Baughman v. </em>Riggs, tried before the Circuit Gour-t for Montgomery Oounty, and reported in the Daily Record of January 12th, 1923. That case involved the oonstitutiouaJity of chapters 259 and 263 of the Acts of 392-2, which sought to create a special police force for Montgomery Oounity, -and to provide for its maintenance from funds derived from convictions in that county under the motor vehicle law. The only question before the Court w-a's the validity of the titles to the acts, and in the course of his opinion, holding tih-at the titles were in part defective, Judge IT-mer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201cThe Legislature undoubtedly bad power to pass just, such acts as these we are considering. It could have, provided that funds derived from convictions under the motor vehicle law in Montgomery Oounty should thereafter be paid to the county commissioners instead -of to the motor vehicle commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We cannot -agree with the contention of the able counsel for the appellant that this statement is any (authority for chapiter 576. The acts before Judge Umar did not appropriate any money from the State treasury; ,tihey simply sought to divert to certain local uses money which would ordinarily have gone to the commi'sisioner of motor vehicles, -and part of which would no -doubt have -eventually reached the treasury. This is quite different from appropriating money after it has been paid into the State treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Bnder the provisions of section 1 of article 15 of the Constitution, the excess fee\u00ae from the offices mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>chapter 576 must be paid into the S\u00edtate treasury, and, in obedience to this constitutional provision, the act itself .assumes that these excess fees mil be paid to the State treas\u00a1urer. It thus appears that this particular part of the .State\u2019s revenue could not be diverted before it reached the State treasury, ,and hence the above quotation from an opinion given in a case involving acts -which sought to. divert money which the Constitution 'did not require should be paid into the State treasury doe\u00ae not. and could not have any application to. the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It is .also, contended by the appellant that chapter 576 is authorized by that part of section 1 of 'article 15 which provides that the excess fees paid to. the treasury under that section shall be \u201csubject toi .such disposition thereof .as the General Assembly may direct,\u201d and it is urged that the ease of <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Pattison, supra, </em>deckled this.. The question in that case, as we have seen above, was the liability <em>n&amp;l non </em>of the City of Baltimore for certain \u25a0clerk\u2019\u00ae fees., and in commenting\u2019 on -the argument that the payment of the excess of these fees to. the State treasurer for general use constituted an inequality in taxation, the Court said: \u201cThis contention might be made the basis of .an appeal to. the Legislature toi correct \u00a1any inequalities of the nature complained of which may be produced by the operation of the present .system. Thei General Assembly has power to accomplish the -purpose of such -an appeal under the authority reserved to it by the Ooustitutiou (section 1 of \u00a1article 15), to direct the .disposition of the excess funds received by the State treasurer from the clerks.\u201d The General Assembly undoubtedly has this power, but since the passage of the Budget Amendment it must exercise its. power in the manner prescribed by that amendment. The amendment was not involved in any way in the <em>Pattison </em>case, and it is not mentioned in the \u00a1Court\u2019s opinion, but even if it bad been, there is nothing in the language used to. intimate that this -Court meant to .-hold \u00a1that the General Assembly could appropriate money out of .the State treasury without complying with the plain provisions o-f the Budget Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Nor is it\u00a1her\u00bf any conflict between section 1 of article 15, and the amendment. The former 'authorizes the General Assembly to 'dispose of the) excess fees, and the 'latter pro* vides the method by which this must be clone. The provision that thei General Assembly could dispose of these excess fees did not mean that they could be disposed of without regard to the other constitutional requirements regulating the passage 'and enactment of appropriation bills, and upon the adoption of the Budget Amendment the appropriation of these fees became .subject to' its provisions just as, did the appropriation of all other money in the State treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Erom wha,t we have \u00a9aid it is obvious that, since the money which chapter 576 seeks Ito appropriate is in the State treasury, it cannot be gotten out of the treasury except in the manner provided in the Budget Amendment, and under that 'amendment the appropriations provided for in chapter 576 would be invalid unless made by the budget bill itself, or by a supplementary appropriation bill. It is not contended that chapter 576 is a .supplementary appropriation bill, or that the money it attempts to appropriate is. \u00a9pecitioally .appropriated by the budget bill, but it iis urged that the appropriation made by the act in question is authorized by the budget bill passed by the -last Legislature (chapter 176 of the Acts of 1924),section 9 of which provides: \u201cThat all moneys received -by any department, board, commission, officer or institution of -the State', from sources other than appropriations made in the budget, and dedicated by any Act of Gongress or laws] of this State to some specific purpose or purposes, .and which have been accounted for to the comptroller and paid into the treasury, may be disbursed by the treasurer, upon warrant of the comptroller, to&lt; such department, board, commission, officer or institution, for the purpose or purposes for which the same .are .dedicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It is contended' that chapter 576 fulfills, ,all the requirement\u00a9 of this section, .and that hence, the appropriations provided for by this act are appropriations authorized in the budget bill, but to this we cannot assent. We are advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>by tbe Attorney General in ibis brief in this ease th-alt the purpose of the above section was to malee possible a centralized bookkeeping system showing) -all monies .spent by the State. It seams that fund\u00eds, received as federal aid, county matching appropri-aitionsi, 'and from certain other source\u00ae, which were dedicated -to. special purpose\u00ae -and not considered in making up itkei budget or the budget bill, were newer paid into the .State treasury because of the fear of the various department\u00ae receiving these funds 'that, under the Budget Amendment, they could not he gotten out of the treasury. As a result the comptroller's office, had no record of these fund\u00ae, and! hi-s. books, failed to show all the money -spent each year by the various .State- departments, and section 9- was passed; to remedly this difficulty. Without expressing any .opinion as to. the validity of .section 9 for any purpose, it is. dearly invalid .as .an authorization of the appropriations, isought to be made by -chapter 576. These appropriations are- contingent, and uncertain -as to- amount, and, as, they -are made from money which the. Constitution requires to be piaid into the treasury, Itihiey might, under some cireu.msitan.ces, be held to violate the spirit if not the letter of the Budget Amendment, because they create uncertainty as to. the money available for general .appropriation\u00ae. They are in a .sense con turning .appropriations', because there is nothing in chapter 576 which limits its effectiveness to. any particular period of time. Hence, if the -act was held good now because of section 9 of the current budget bill, and the next budget bill did not contain a, similar* section, we would have the -absurd .situation of a law. becoming unconstitutional because, of the failure of thiei Legislature to. pass another law making it valid. And finally, if chapter 576 were held valid because'of section 9, it would mean that the Governor cou-ld delegate, to the General Assembly the power to fix the items .and amount\u00ae of the budget Hill, and the Budget-Amendment would be destroyed. We accordingly find that tire act in question is. not a, budget bill, nor are the appropriations contained in it authorized by the present budget bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Since chapter 576 is neither a budget bill nor a suppfe- \u25a0 mentary, appropriation bill, it fallow\u00ae, from what we have heretofore said, that in soi far a\u00ae it attempts to appropriate money from the State treasury for -the payment of deficit\u00ae in the offices of the State\u2019\u00ae ia,ttorney, register of wills, clerks of courts, 'aind sheriff of Baltimore City, it contravenes the proivisiouis of the Budgtet Amendment .and -is unconstitutional .and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">- The lower court held chapter 576 invalid on the ground that it changed the office of State\u2019s attorney for Baltimore \u25a0City from a fee office to a salaried office in violation of section. 9 of article 51 of -the Constitution. Thd's' section concludes .as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\u201cThat the State\u2019\u00ae attorney for Baltimore City .shall releerte an annual salary of $5,400, and shall appoint one deputy at .an annual salary not exceeding $4,000; and .such other assistants at such annual salaries not exceeding $2,500 each, as the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City may authorize and! approve; all of isaid salaries, to be paid out of the fees of the said State\u2019\u00ae attorney\u2019\u00ae office, as; has heretofore been (practiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Chapiter 576 provides that the salarie\u00ae and expenses .of the office of the State\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City shall be paid from the fees of that office, but it .also provide\u00ae that, in case the fees of that office prove insufficient to pay the salaries and expenses; the deficit shall be paid from the excess fees derived from -the other office\u00ae mentioned in the act. The Constitution requires <em>\u201call of said salaries to- he paid out of the fees of the said State's attorney\u2019s office, </em>as has heretofore been practicad.\u201d The conflict between these provisions is obvious and unescalpiable, 'at least in so far a\u00ae the salaries of the .State\u2019\u00ae atitoraey\u2019s1 -office are concerned. \"Whether or not a, valid distinction could be' drawn between \u201csaLaries\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d it is unnecessary for us to decide, because no drt tinctiou is made between \"(them in chapter 576, but so far as the \u201csalaries\u201d of the States\u2019 attorney\u2019\u00ae office are concerned, the learned court below was clearly right in holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>fey must be paid from the fees of that office, and. that the \u25a0act in question was invalid in 00 far \u00a1ais it 'attempted. to change this constitutional requirement by providing 'that any deficit in that office \u00a1should be paid from excess fees derived from other\u2019 office\u00ae. Eor the \u2019siamei reasons the act is void in regard to the payment of deficits in the offices of the clerks of courts alud register of -will\u00ae, section 45 of article 3 of the Constitution providing that the \u201ccompensation of clerks, \u2022 registers, assistants and office expense\u00ae \u00a1shall always be paid out of the fee\u00ae or receipts- of the offices respectively.\u201d And as regard\u00ae these offices-, -the language of the Cbnstitution itself preclude\u00ae \u2019 any distinction being drawn between \u201csalarie\u00ae\u201d or \u201ccompensation,\u201d arad \u201cexpenses,\u201d because both items are specifically mentioned. Counsel for the appellant insist\u00ae that the history of -legislation in this \u2019State is at variance with thiisi construction of the constitutional provisions just cited, and refers. us\u00a1 to\u00a1 chapter 54 of the Acts, of 1868 (section 14 of article 17 of the Oodei of 1924) to support his contention. That act pools all of 'the excess fees received from the offices of the clerks of courts of Baltimore C&amp;ty, and malees this fund liable for any deficiencias in any of the clerk\u2019s office\u00ae. The constitutionality of this act has, so- far as we are advised), never been challenged, -and we are not to be understood als 'expressing, .any opinion on it in this case, but whether valid or not, it is clearly distinguishable from the act now before us. The former\u201d act pools only the excess fees from the clerks\u2019 office\u00ae ini Baltimore Oity for the benefit of the clerks, wherea,si the act we are considering undertakes to place, in one fund, the excess fee\u00ae from the -offices of the sheriff, clerks, register of will\u00ae and State\u2019\u00ae attorney, .and to render\u201d \u00a1that fund liable for \u2022deficit\u00ae in -any of tine offices mentioned. In view of these 'differences there would seem to be little force in the argument that chapter\" 54 of the Acts of 1868 furnishes any legislative precedent for chapter 576 of the Acts of 1924, and even if it did, such precedent, though entitled to consideration, w\u2019onld not be binding* upon us in determining \u00a1the validity of the later act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Since our attention has not been called to .any specific provisi\u00f3n of the Constitution requiring the \u00a1sheriff of B'altimore Oilty to be paid only from the fees of bis office, 'and1 we know of no such requirement, w*e express no opinion ais to' the validity of chapter 5 7 6 in so far 'as iit makes the 'sheriff\u2019s office a salaried 'One, though of course the attempt to appropriate part of the sheriff\u2019si salary and 'expenses from the S\u00edtate treasury is, as we said above, void1 because it violates the provisions of the Budget Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The remaining point to' be Considered is Whether or not the defective portions of chapter 576 will require us .to hold the entire .act invalid. \u201cA stattute may be good in part, while other parts are invalid. If a portion be unconstitittional, -the Court is not authorized, for that reason, to. dudare the whole void.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Davis, 7 Md. 151. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Hitchings, 5 Gray, 482, where the same rule of construction was adopted, the court said: \u201cThe constitutional and unconstitutional provisions may even be Contained in the same sections, and yet be perfectly distinct and separable, so that the first may staaid, though .the last fall. The point is, not whether they are contained in the same section, for the dis\u00a1tribution into sections is purely artificial; but <em>whether they are essentially and inseparably connected in substance </em>Both of these statements were quoted with approval by this Cfouxt in the case of <em>Painter v. Mattfeldt, </em>119 Md. 466, and the principles .announced are undoubtedly the law of tbis State. See also <em>Hagerstown v. Dechert, </em>32 Md. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Tested by these rules, it seems, obvious that no part of chapter 576 is valid. We have held that the provisions of the law relating, to the payment of .any deficits in the offices\u2019 mentioned from money 'in 'the State treasury, were void, and hence all of these offices, with the possible exception of the sheriff\u2019s office, must depend upon fees for their salaries) and expenses. The other salient part of the act is .the provision relieving Baltimore City from, its liability to pay certain of these fee\u00ae, and to hold this good, andi the portion taking care of any deficit thus occasioned bad, would certainly give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>rise to an anomal'ousi -situation. The two- provisions are intertwined 'and; dependent on each other, and both are so intimately related -to the main purpose of the act as to be, in our opinion, \u201cessentially and inseparably connected in substance.\u201d Nor would it be proper* to 'assume tibiat the Legislature intended to- deprive three of tbeise offices of certain revenue which they have always .enjoyed, although the provision it made in the isante act to -supply other revenue in place of it was- held void. It follows that the. -act must be held unconstitutional in -so far as. it relates to the offices of the State\u2019s .attorney, register of wills, and oler\u00edas of courts of Baltimore City, and, in our opinion, to hold valid -that part of the act which relieves Baltimore City of its liability to 'pay -certain fees to the sheriff, though -all the rest, i-s void, would be -extending beyond reason the principle of law \"which permits, part of an act toi be .declared valid and part of it invalid. We are accordingly -compelled to. hold that chapter 576- of ithe Acts of 1924 -is wholly unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We are riot xmmindfu-1 -of the rule that every \u00a1presumption favors the validity of an act of -the Legislature, and it is 'with the utmost reluctance that we -declare void the action of a co-ordinate branch -of the gpveirnment, but where .a statute plainly contravenes -any -of the provisions of the Constitution we are -charged with the duty of -declaring it void, and this 'obligation is rendered! none the less imperative because the proposed law may -embody wise -and beneficient legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">It \u00a1should be noted thalt by -a -constitutional amendment, adopted in November, 1924, certain changes were made in the provisions regulating the office of the State\u2019s -attorney for Baltimore City, but for the purposes of the present case it was, of course, necessary to -deal with, the Constitution as it existed prior to the adoption of that amendment. The judgment -of the -lower court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\n<em>'Judgment affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
