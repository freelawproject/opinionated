'The case was tided in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, to which it had been removed and, the verdict and judgment being in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appealed. The record contain\u00a9 one exception, and the controlling question which it present\u00ae for our considerlaition is whether upon all the evidence in the case the appellee was as a matter of law guilty of negligence contributing to the accident complained of. In dealing with that question upon the defendant\u2019\u00a9 prayer's w'e must assume the truth of all evidence tending to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim, together with such inferences as may naturally and legitimately be drawn therefrom. Thus dealt with these are the facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Ou the night of thie accident Richard H. Merriken, who was then twenty years of age, with Alvin Brown and Clarence Pense was driven by Leslie Lee from Denton, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>then lived, to Oyster Shell Point to <em>&amp; </em>dance. Lee was a licensed driver and the oar which he drove belonged to his father, although he drove it constantly. At a point on the State Road, neiar Williston, the road curves or bends sharply, and about thirty-seven feet north of the center of the curve in the direction of Denton, on the easterly side of the road, there was a guy pole to which the appellant\u2019\u00ae telephone pole on the opposite side of the road was attached to lessen the strain placed on it by the curve. 'The road at that point was of tarred macadam, and the distance, measured across it between the guy pole on the east side of it and the telephone pole on the opposite side, was said to he twenty-two and onedialf feet. The guy pole Was within the travelled way of the road, with the tracks of passing vehicles within a hand\u2019s breath of it, ,and <em>so </em>placed that one driving an automobile approaching. it from the south would not be able to see it at night by the lights of the machine until he had turned the \u2022corner, and the curve or bend was so sharp that machines passing it in a northerly direction .at a speed of from fifteen to twenty miles an hour might skid .and he forced into contact with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">On the night of the accident Lee, who lived at Hobbs in Merriken\u2019s neighborhood, drove Merrifeen, Brown \u2019and Pense to Oyster Shell Pbint to. the dance referred to. They left <em>the </em>dance <em>to </em>return to Denton <em>between </em>eleven thirty and twelve o\u2019clock. On their return Lee drove and occupied the left front seat, .and Brown <em>the </em>right front seat. Merrikem and Pense occupied the rear seats, and some time before -they reached the curve to which we have referred they both fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Merriken was quite familiar with the road, hut prior to that night Lee, the driver, knew nothing of it at .all, although he had not communicated that fact to Merriken.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Lee testified that he approached the curve referred to at \u25a0about fiften to twenty miles .an hour, that he \u00aea,w no warning post or sign .and that, when he reached it, he found i-t too abrupt to take and was .about to drive into, a field when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>saw the pole in such a position that he could not do that, and he then attempted 1\u00bb drive around the curve, but in that effort hi\u00ae car skidded into oontalct with the pole, smashing the-rear wheels of the automobile 'and injuring Merriken.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Many of these facts were disputed -and were contradicted by other testimony. Eor instance there was evidence that the pole was not in the travelled Way of the road, that when Lee approlaohed the curve 'he was driving at from thirty to' thirty-five miles an hour, and that at the center of the curve there wasi placed as a warning of danger a striped post referred to .as a barber pole. But as it was the exclusive function of the jury to resolve that conflict, it is unnecessary forra to refer further to\u00bb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At the close' of the whole case the plaintiff offered three prayers of which the second and third were granted, and the-defendant five, of which the third, fourth and- fifth were granted. All the other prayers were refused. The plaintiff\u2019s third prayer was.the damage prayer usual iu daises of this character, .and was unobjectionable. Hi\u00ae second prayer, while inartificial in form and really inapplicable toi the facts of the case, could not possibly have injured the defendant. In substance it instructed the jury that if they found that Leie was in control of the car when the accident happiened \u25a0and that the plaintiff had noi control over it, and that no negligence of his contributed to the accident, that Lee\u2019s negligence could not be imputed to' him. The defendant did not contend that the doctrine of imputed negligence applied to' the facts of this ease 'and, as it appeared from the uncontradicted evidence that the plaintiff neither owned nor oontrlolled the 'automobile and was asleep\u00bb at the time of the accident, it must be conceded that it did not. <em>Dorchester County v. Wright, </em>138 Md. 577. And as the prayer did no more than state a principle which could not have been denied, it is difficult to see under the facte of this case how it could have injured the defendant. The defendant objects to' it, 'however, on the ground that it stresses too emphatically the fact that Lee operated 'and controlled the car at .the time of the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>and thereby obscures the fact that Aiettriken was asleep at that time, but we see no force in that objection. Operation, ownership! and control are essential elements in the doctrine of imputed negligence, and if it is to be defined at .all they cannot well be ignored, and if defendant objected to the prayer because it did not sufficiently define negligence, that objection should have been specially made in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The real question presented by the appeal, however, is raised by the refusal of the defendant\u2019s first and second prayers, and it is this: Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law (a) because he fell asleep, or (b) because he did not before he fell .asleep warn the driver of the ear in \u2019Which he was riding of the dangerous curve ?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">To justify a court in chara,ctarizing conduct as negligent in law it must involve some \u201cprominent and decisive act, in regard to&gt; the effect and character of which no room is left for ordinary minds to differ.\u201d <em>Waltring v. </em>James, 136 Md. 414. The ingredients of contributory negligence do not differ in any respect from those of primary negligence, it is&gt; \u00a1after all, \u201clike primary negligence, relative taad not absolute, and being relative it is dependent on the peculiar circumstances of each particular case. There are many acts which would not be negligent, when done under some conditions, though the same acts if done under different conditions might he higjhly negligent. And this is equally true of contributory negligence. iS'o ultimately, in every case of this character it becomes necessary to view the entire surroundings to determine whether either primary or contributory negligence has been 'established.\u201d <em>McNab v. United Railways </em>Co., 94 Md. 724. 'These principles have been so often and so recently stated by this Court that it isi unnecessary to do more than refer to <em>Merrifield v. Hoffberger Co., </em>147 Md. 134, and <em>Pearson v. Lakin, </em>147 Md. 1, in which Judge Dliggeis and Judge Parke respectively speaking for this Oourt collected and reviewed the later decisions involving them.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>defendant\u2019s first and second prayers were properly refused. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the defendant was guilty of negligence directly contributing to the accident merely because he was .asleep at the time it happened, although the jury were entitled toi consider that circumstance in passing upon the question of his negligence together with the other circumstances of the case. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Merriken knew that Lee was unfamiliar' with the road, they both lived in the same neighborhood, he was in the car as Lee\u2019s guest and passenger, and he may well have believed that when Lee started from Oyster Shell Pbint to Denton that he knew the road there, especially as Lee had on that same night driven him from Denton to Oyster Shell Point. In the absence of any evidence to justify such a conviction he was not conclusively bound to presume that Lea would 'operate the car in a negligent, reckiess or imprudent manner, or that he would drive over a strange road at such a speed 'a\u00ae would 'endanger his passengers or that he would disregard such plain and obvious warning\u00ae of danger a\u00ae' the black and white striped poste or \u201cbarber poles,\u201d one of which, according to the testimony of some of the witnesses, was placed at the canter of the curve where the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We 'do not understand that the law requires 'all the passengers in an automobile to exercise the same degree of vigilance and caution in apprehending and detecting danger toi an automobile over which they have noi control a\u00ae is required of the person driving it. Such a requirement would be in many instances .impracticable, and compliance with it would often promote rather tiran prevent accident. Of course, if there is an apparent danger known to the passenger, or which by due care he might discover, and he suffers the driver to incur it without warning or protest, his conduct may well be called negligent, but no .such conditions exist in this case. The danger here was of a character which every 'driver of an automobile commonly and frequently encounter\u00ae, and which may by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>avoided. He was not alone, there was with him on the seat by bis side another passenger who actually did warn him as they -approached the \u2019Curve, although Lee said he did not hear the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Erom some of \"the evidence in the case the jury may have believed that the accident occurred through the concurring negligence of Lee and the appellant, Lee in \u00a1operating the car in a reckless and dangerous manner \u00a1at the time of the accident, and the 'appellant in placing its pole in sudh a, position as to menace the safety of the travelling public. But it dees not appear that when Merriken fell asleep Lee wias driving at an excessive speed, or in a negligent manner. The accident occurred in rounding the curve, hut it is not app&gt;arent that Merriken, even if he had been \u00a1awake and watching, could have from his pioisition on the rear seat have seen the curve when they reached it in time to have warned the driver that he was approaching it, because not only Were Lee 'and Brown in front of him, hut they had the advantage of the lights, of the machine which he had not. The hour was late, it was not apparent that he couldi have prevented the accident had he been awake, .and, under such circumstances, we cannot say that in allowing himsielf to\u00a1 fall asleep! he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Much of what we have said applies \u00a1aliso to the contention that he was negligent as a matter of law because he did not warn Lee before he started from Oyster Shell Point to Den-ton of the dangers on the \u00a1State Road. The record fails to show that Merriken had any reason to believe that Lee was not a reasonably safe and prudent driver, or that he did not know the road, \u00a1and its dangers. Certainly it would be going very far to require that every guest invited to\u00a1 ride in an automobile should, under the circumstances of this case, before accepting the invitation point out to Ms host the dangers of the road, under penalty of being charged with negligenc in law for any failure to. do\u00a1 iso. In \u00a1our opinion that is not the law, and our attention has been called to nio authority which could justify our recoginition \u00a1of it \u00a1as such. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Certainly the cases relied upon by the appellant do- mot do that. <em>Balto. &amp; O. v. McCabe, </em>133 Md. 224; <em>Wash., B. &amp; A. R. Co. v. State, </em>136 Md. 11; <em>Chiswell v. Nichols, </em>137 Md. 305; and <em>Dorchester County v. Wright, </em>138 Md. 580, mot \u2022only did mot decide that, but im those oases the Court w;as dealing with instance\u00ae where the conduct of the driver and its likely consequemces were or should have been apparent to the guest at or about the time of the accident, while in this case, if the accident was due to' the 'driver\u2019s conduct, the passenger was mot aware of it at the time, he was mot bound to anticipate it, and it is mot clear that he could by the exercise of ordinary care have learned of it in time' to have warned the driver to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">It follows from what we have said that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with cods.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
