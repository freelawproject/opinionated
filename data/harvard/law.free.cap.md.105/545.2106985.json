The first section of the Act prescribed the conditions under which the commissioners of any county might, on their own motion, petition the State Geological and Eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>nomic Survey {the commission created by th\u00e9 Act of 1896) for plans and estimates of the cost of constructing or repairing roads in their counties. The second section provided that whenever the owners of two-thirds of the lands binding on any road, a mile or more in length, shall require the County Commissioners to have the same constructed or repaired, stating the willingness of the petitioners to pay ten per cent of the cost of such improvement, it shall be the duty of the commissioners to request the State Geological Survey to furnish plans and estimates of the cost of the construction. By other sections of the Act, that commission is required to furnish such plans and estimates if they deem the proposed road a proper one to he constructed, and elaborate provisions are then made for the doing of the work. The Act appropriated \u00a7200,000 annually by which one-half of the cost of making such roads was to be paid by the State. Held, that the second section of this Act by which the County Commissioners are required, under certain conditions, to apply to the Geological Survey for the construction of a road, relates to the improvement of highways; that the title of the Act is sufficiently exact, definite and comprehensive to cover this method of improving highways and fully apprises the public of the proposed legislation, and that the Act is consequently not in violation of the Constitution, Art. 3, sec. 29, which provides that the subject of every law shall be described in its title.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b610-5\">By the second section of the Act of 1904, ch. 225, the commissioners of a county are required to repair a public road upon the petition of the owners of two-thirds of the land abutting thereon, who pay ten per cent of the cost, in case the State Geological Commissioners approve of the improvement and direct the method of doing it, and by other sections of the law, the State pays one-half of the cost of such construction. By the fifteenth section of the Act, it is declared that nothing therein contained, shall be taken to alter, abridge or affect the present method of road construction or repair by the several counties at their own expense or otherwise as now authorized by law. <em>Held, </em>that there is no conflict between the second and fifteenth sections of the Act, that the object of the Act was to provide for the improvement of certain roads at the joint expense of the State and-the counties, and the purpose of the fifteenth section was to provide that the Act should not affect the power of the County Commissioners to construct or repair roads at their own expense under any existing general or local laws.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>Decided April 2nd, 1907.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-7\">Appeal from the Circuit Court <em>for </em>Frederick County (McSherry, C.

The Court says; \u201cWhile the title must indicate the <em>subject </em>of the Act, it need not give an abstract of its contents, nor need it mention the means and methods by which the general purpose is to be accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b612-12\">13. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>51 Md. 412 (1879).

The Court cites <em>Balto. </em>v. <em>Reits, </em>to the effect that \u201cif the several sections of a law refer to and are germane to the same subject matter which is described ifl the title, it is considei-ed as embracing but a single subject, and as satisfying the constitutional requirement in this respect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b613-10\">18. <em>Steiffel </em>v. <em>Inst. for Blind, </em>61 Md. 144 (1884).

McSherry, J., says: \u201cThe title, whilst it must indicate the <em>subject, </em>need not give an abstract of the contents of the Act, nor need it mention the means and methods by which the general purpose is to be accomplished.

Hellen, </em>72 Md. 603, and <em>Drennen </em>v. <em>Banks, 80 </em>Md. 310, the two most apposite cases of all the forty-six found in the Reports to the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-5\">One of the reasons assigned by the Court below for dismissing the appellants\u2019 petition for the benefit of the Act of 1904, ch. 225, was that sec. 15 of said Act was in conflict with the preceding sections, and practically nullified the involuntary feature, and consequently that the enforcement of the law was a matter wholly at the option of the commissioners, and the same could not be enforced by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-6\">But such a construction the appellants insist is not only at variance with the well- established rules of construction, but at variance with the very words of the Act itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-7\">The preceding sections, especially sec. 2 of the Act, made <em>it \"the duty\" of the County Commissioners </em>to proceed to operate under the law whenever the owners of two-thirds of the lands binding on any section of public road, petitioned for the benefit of State aid under the A.ct and agreed to pay one-tenth the cost of repair.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-8\">The commissioners were left no option in the matter when these conditions were complied with, and were only limited by the provision of twenty-five per cent of the road levy (sec. 6), a question that would arise later and does not concern the giving of notice and asking for plans and specifications asked for in the prayer, for a <em>mandamus </em>in this case (sec. 7).</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-9\">So far as this proceeding is concerned, it is contended that the Act is absolutely mandatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-10\">To say that section 15 nullifies the involuntary or mandatory feature of the Act would ascribe to the Legislature the folly of providing in detail for State aid to road improvement at the request of the citizens of a community, upon their complying with certain conditions, and th\u00e9n deliberately striking down this most important feature by a single sentence in section 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-11\">No such construction was in the minds of those who framed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the law, or in the minds of the members of the Legislature that enacted it. The intention of the Legislature must govern the construction of all statutes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>73 Md. 57. \u201cThe real intent will prevail over the literal sense of the language used.\u201d <em>Roland Park </em>v. <em>State, </em>80 Md. 448. \u201cIt is an established rule in the exposition of statutes that the intention of the law givers is to be deduced from a view of the whole and every part of a statute taken and compared together.\u201d 1 <em>Kent, </em>461-2 (6 ed.); <em>Parkinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Md. 184\u2014194. \u201cThe intention should be followed though contrary to the letter of the statute. \u201d <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>40 Md. 273\u2014290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-5\">. In the case at bar the intention and purpose of the enactment was to provide both for voluntary action on the part of the County Commissioners (sec. 1), and for involuntary action at the request of landowners (sec. 2), and the words of section 15 taken and considered in connection with all the other parts of the Act show that its only object was to reaffirm the right of the County Commissioners to repair roads <em>at their oivn expense, </em>where not in conflict with the manifest purpose and intent of the other provisions of the Act by which the State aid was obtained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-6\"><em>Reno. S. Harp </em>and <em>Hammond Urner </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-7\">The Court below held:</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-8\">1. That the involuntary provisions of the Act are' unconstitutional and void because not described in the title, as required by Article 3, Section 29 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-9\">2. That, independently of the objection just stated, the involuntary provisions in question are inoperative because they are nullified by a later and repugnant provision embodied in the same Act, the former provisions constituting a radical interference with the general and long established powers and methods of County Commissioners in road construction and repair under the pre-existing law, and the latter provision declaring that nothing in the Act contained should affect or impair the present methods of road construction and repair by the Counties as now authorized by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>It is apparent, upon comparison of the two systems of road repair mentioned in the Act, that they are radically different and readily separable, and that neither depends upon the other for its completeness or integrity. One simply supplements, without disturbing, the pre-existing jurisdiction of the county authorities in the maintenance and improvement of public highways by providing an auxiliary fund for which they may voluntarily apply. The other wrests from those authorities all control over the expenditure of the county funds entrusted to their care to the extent of one-fourth of the entire road levy, and places that control in the hands of private individuals to be exercised subject to the discretion of an outside commission. The effect of the former system is to provide means and machinery by the aid- of which the public highways of the State may be gradually improved consistently with their current maintenance in their entirety, while the logical result of the latter system is to force the counties, upon the application of interested individuals, to concentrate a considerable proportion of their road levies upon work designated arbitrarily and without reference to their judgment, and to largely neglect their matured and legitimate plans for general highway maintenance and improvement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-5\">The title contains not the slightest suggestion of the involuntary provisions of the Act, and no one would suppose for a moment from the phraseology of the title that the effect of the Act was to vitally impair the established jurisdiction and control of County Commissioners over the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways and the administration of the public funds in there custody dedicated to those purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-6\">In any case of this character the subject of the proposed legislation must be considered in the concrete and not in the abstract. It is not the improvement of highways generally, but the particular method of improving highways that constitutes the subject of the Act in this case. The title attempts to describe this subject as being for the improvement of the public highways of <em>the State </em>and to <em>provide the means </em>therefor and to require the performance of additional duties by a designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Commission. This unquestionably- conveys the idea that a <em>general </em>system of highway improvement is contemplated by the Act, to be inaugurated by the State, conducted by State officials and paid for with State funds. We should never suspect that under this title were provisions authorizing private citizens to require the improvement of a <em>single mile </em>of road; against the will of the County Commissioners and largely at the expense, of county funds levied fot a different purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-5\">It is true that both the title and the Act deal with the general subject of high way.improvement. But the title does not content itself with any such general description. If the title had simply described the Act as being one \u201cfor the improvement of public highways,\u201d we should be confronted with a different question from that with which we actually have to deal in this case. Such a title would not .have been explicit, but it would not have been misleading. It would at least have suggested the inquiry as to what highways were to be improved, and by whom, and at whose expense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-6\">But here we have an Act, which, after assuring us in its title that it contemplates the improvement generally of the public highways of the State, by the officials, and with the funds, of the State, provides specifically for the construction or repair of comparatively infinitesimal sections of the public highways at the instance of abutting owners, and for the payment of the costs and expenses of such work out of the county treasuries, to the extent of one-fourth of the total road levies, in absolute disregard of the general road interests to which the funds produced by such levies are dedicated.- It seems to us to be perfectly obvious that these two ideas, embodied respectively in the title and in the involuntary provisions of the Act, are hopelessly inconsistent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-7\">It may be contended that when the Act requires the County Commissioners of the several counties to apply one-fourth of their road funds differently from their regular and intended appropriation, upon the demand of private individuals, there is a \u201cproviding of means\u201d for highway improvement within the purview of the title. But we apprehend that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>title had been merely: \u201cAn Act to <em>pxovide means </em>for the improvement of the public highways of the State,\u201d it would be unhesitatingly held to be an insufficient description of the subject of an Act which proposes to provide the desired means by withdrawing from the hands- and control of the County Commissioners certain funds which they had already raised and appropriated by authority of law for totally distinct objects. \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-5\">Upon grounds which seem to us to be less conclusive than those here presented Acts of Assembly have been held invalid, as a whole or in part, for defects of title, in the following cases: <em>Stiefel </em>v. <em>The Maryland Institute, </em>61 Md. 144; <em>State </em>v. <em>Benzinger, </em>83 Md. 481; <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>State, </em>80 Md. 410; <em>Scharf </em>v. <em>Tasker, </em>73 Md. 378; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schultze Co., </em>83 Md. 58; <em>Luman v. Hitchins, 90 </em>Md. 14; <em>Ellicott Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Speed, </em>72 Md. 25; <em>Steenken </em>v. <em>State, </em>88 Md. 710; <em>Kafka </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>99 Md. 238; <em>State </em>v. <em>German Savings Bank, </em>103 Md. 200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-6\">An examination of the numerous cases in which the titles of statutes are considered under Article 3, section 29 of the Constitution will discover a broad distinction between Acts containing provisions which would have the effect of repealing existing laws, and those containing provisions which, while not strictly within the descriptions of the titles, do not interfere with other statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\">There can be no serious dispute but that the involuntary clauses of the Act alter, abridge and affect the method of road construction by the counties as previously authorized by law. They have the effect of repealing by implication <em>pro tanto </em>the provisions of the Code of Public General Laws under which that method has been established and applied. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>School Commissioners, </em>81 Md. 516; <em>Tax Cases, </em>50 Md. 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-8\">By the general law the county authorities of Frederick County are required to apply the whole road levy to the maintenance and improvement of the entire twelve hundred miles of public roads in the county. By the Act of 1904 they may be compelled to concentrate one-fourth of that amount upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the improvement of a mile or two of road and, consequently, to either economize as to all the remainder of the highways of the county or to meet the deficiency by increased taxation. Under the Code the County Commissioners may grade, construct, repair and perfect any part or section of public road in the county according to their own judgment and discretion, exercised with general and intelligent knowledge of the requirements of the public convenience in their respective communities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">Under the Shoemaker Act the owners of two-thirds of the lands binding upon any section of public road not less than one mile long, can, with the approval of the State Geological and Economic Survey Commission, deny to the county authorities the right to determine how, when, by whom and at what cost that particular section of road shall be repaired or improved. Independently of this Act the County Commissioners can alter or close any public road if, in their judgment, such action shall subserve the public convenience. But this right could not be exercised as to any portion of roadway improved under the compulsory provisions of the Act of 1904.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\">The prior involuntary provisions of the Act, embodied mainly in section 2, declare in effect that the present method of road construction shall be altered and abridged as to the sections of roads therein contemplated, while the subsequent provision declares, with equal, or greater, emphasis, that the Act shall have no such effect. The former section repeals by <em>implication </em>the provisions of the general law establishing the \u201cpresent method\u201d of road construction and repair. The latter <em>expressly </em>repeals everything in the Act which might tend to affect the \u201cpresent method.\u201d One asserts and the other denies the right to interfere with the existing road administration of the counties. One enacts a new method of road construction at variance with the \u201cpresent method,\u201d and the other repeals that enactment with promptness and decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\">These two declarations of the legislative intent are radically and fatally repugnant. Both cannot possibly be effective. One must necessarily be inoperative. In this conflict of en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>actments it is the later expression of the legislative will that prevails. Where \u201ctwo Acts are plainly repugnant to each other in any of their provisions, the latter Act, without any repealing clause, will operate to the extent of the repugnancy, as a repeal of the first. This also applies to different sections of the same law.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>School Commissioners, </em>81 Md. 516; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>10 Wend. 553; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shelby County, </em>36 Ohio St. 326; <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Sunbury, &amp;c., R. R. Co., </em>19 Pa. St. 211.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b624-5\">Burke, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4Q\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The appellants, on the 22nd day of December, 1906, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Frederick County praying that the writ of <em>mandamus </em>be issued against William H. Hogarth, Lewis H. Bowlus, Lincoln G. Dinterman, H. Milton Kefauver, and Daniel G. Zentz, the County Commissioners of that County, commanding them, as such commissioners, to give the notice to the Chief Engineer of the Geological and Economic Commission and make the request of said commission, as required by sec. 2 of the Act of 1904, ch. 225, of the General Assembly of Maryland, for plans and estimate of the cost of the proper performance of the work required, according to said plans and specifications, for the construction and repair of a section of public road described in a petition filed with said County Commissioners on the 5th day of November, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">It appears from an examination of the petition, which was filed with the commissioners, and which was also filed as an exhibit in this case, that the appellants were proceeding under sec. 2 of the Act of 1904, ch. 225, to have a section of public road located in Frederick County, constructed and repaired under the provisions of that Act. It was not denied at the argument that the appellants would be entitled to the writ, if, at the hearing, the facts alleged by them in the petition for the writ were satisfactorily established by the proof; provided sec. 2 of the statute to which we have referred is valid and operative. This could not well be denied since the Act declares it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to be the imperative duty of the commissioners to make the request directed by that section of the statute when the requirements thereof have been fully complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">All the neeessary and essential jurisdictional averments, upon which under the terms of the Act the relief prayed for depends, are set out in the petition of December 22nd, 1906, which show a strict compliance with all the requirements necessary to be observed when action is taken under the second section of the Act. An answer was filed by the Commissioners of Frederick County to the petition which contained a traverse of many of the essential facts alleged in the petition, but with these issues of fact we are not concerned. The answer avers (a) that the Act of 1904, ch. 225, is unconstitutional and void; (b) That so much of said Act as provides for involuntary action by the commissioners for the construction and repair of public roads is unconstitutional and void; (c) That the Court was without jurisdiction in the premises. By appropriate pleading the legal questions raised by the answer were presented to the Court for its determination, and on the 10th day of January, 1907, the Court passed an order dismissing the petition for the writ of <em>mandamus, </em>and from that order this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Two grounds are relied upon by the appellees to sustain \u25a0the order of the lower Court, first, the unconstitutionality of the second section of the Act of 1904, ch. 225; and secondly, because, it is contended, the provisions of that section are inoperative, being nullified by later and repugnant provisions of the same Act. This repugnancy, it is asserted, is found to exist between the second and fifteenth-sections of the Act, and js claimed to be of such a character the section 15 must be held to have nullified and rendered inoperative the provisions of section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">There are certain general considerations which must not be overlooked by the Court when it is asked to strike down a legislative Act. They have been stated by the Courts in a multitude of cases, but no where have they been stated with greater clearness and accuracy than by Mr. Cooley in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>work on Constitutional Limitations in which it is said: \u201cIt must be evident to anyone that the power to declare a legislative enactment void is one which the Judge, conscious of the fallibility of human judgment, will .shrink from exercising in any case .where he can conscientiously and with due regard to duty \u00e1nd official oath decline the responsibility. The legislative and judicial are co-ordinate departments of the government, of equal dignity. Each is alike supreme in the exercise of its proper functions, and cannot directly or indirectly, while acting within the limits of its authority, be subjected to the control or supervision of the other, without an unwarrantable assumption by that other of power which, by the Constitution, is not conferred upon it. The Constitution apportions the powers of government, but it does not make anyone of the three departments subordinate to the other, when exercising the trust committed to it. The Court may declare legislative enactments unconstitutional and void in some cases, but not because the judicial power is superior in degree or dignity to the legislative. Being required to declare what the law is in the cases which come before th\u00e9m, they must enforce the.Constitution as the paramount law, whenever a legislative enactment comes in conflict with it. But the Courts sit, not to review or revise the legislative action, but to enforce the legislative will; and it is only where they find that the Legislature has failed to keep within the constitutional limits that they are at liberty to disregard its action; and in doing so, they only do what every private citizen may do in respect to the mandates of the Courts when the Judges assume to act and to render judgments or decrees without jurisdiction. \u201d <em>Cooley's Con. Lim., </em>3 ed. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Court cannot declare an Act of the General Assembly to be unconstitutional, because it is unwise, or inexpedient, or because it displaces or supersedes wiser and better laws regulating the same subject. These matters are committed to the judgment of the law making power, and its action in respect to them is not reviewable by the Court. If therefore it be true, as contended by the appellees, that the second section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the Act of 1904, chapter 225, be an unwise provision, and would operate harshly upon the people of Frederick county, this Court cannot upon that ground set it aside, but resort must be had for redress to the General Assembly for its repeal or modification. Every presumption favors the validity of the statute; it cannot be stricken down as void unless it plainly contravenes some provision of the Constitution; a reasonable doubt as to its constitutionality is sufficient to sustain it; the party assailing the Act must point out the special provision of the Constitution to which it is obnoxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The specific objection to the second section of the Act under consideration is that it violates section 29 of article 3 of the Constitution. That section provides: \u201cThat every law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title.\u201d It may be assumed as settled that the purpose of this provision is; \u201cFirst, to prevent <em>Hodge </em>Podge, or \u201clog rolling\u201d legislation; second, to prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature by means of provisions in bills of which the titles give no intimation, and which might therefore be overlooked and carelessly and unintentionally adopted; and, <em>third </em>to fairly apprise the people, through such publication of legislative proceedings as is usually made, of subjects of legislation that are being considered, in order that they may have opportunity of being heard thereon, by petition or otherwise, if they shall so desire.\u201d <em>Cooley's Constitutional </em>Limitations, <em>3rd Edition 158.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The general disposition of the Courts has been to give a liberal construction to this provision of the Constitution, rather than to embarrass legislation by a construction whose strictness is unnecessary to render effective the purposes for which it was adopted. It is stated by Judge Cooley that the general purpose of this provision of the Constitution is accomplished when the law has but one general object, which is fairly indicated in its title; and that to require every end and means necessary or convenient for the accomplishment of this general object to be provided for, by a separate Act relating to that alone, would be not only unreasonable, but would ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>der legislation impossible. This Court has had occasion -to pass so frequently upon this provision of the Constitution that its purpose and meaning may be assumed to be well understood and thoroughly well settled. The difficulty in this, as in other cases, is found to exist in the application of the settled rule to the particular case. There must be unity in the subject matter of the Act, but \u201cif the several sections of the law refer to and are germane to the same subject matter, which is described in its title, it is considered as embracing but a single subject, and as satisfying the requirements of the Constitution in this respect.\u201d <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Reitz, </em>50 Md. 579. The title is sufficient if it fairly <em>indicates </em>the subject matter of the enactment. These rules of construction have been stated and applied by this Court in every case in which it has been called upon to consider this section of the Constitution, from the case <em>of Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>7 Md. 151, decided in 1854, in which the question was before the Court for the first time, to the case of <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Flack, et al., </em>104 Md. 107, decided October 4, 1906, and in all of the cases it is held that the title need not contain an abstract of the Act; nor mention the means or methods by which it is to be carried into effect; nor will an Act of .a general nature be declared obnoxious to this clause of the Constitution, unless there be engrafted upon it some subject of a private, or a local character, or unless two or more dissimilar and discordant subjects be legislated upon in the same law. If foreign, irrelevant, or discordant subjects are introduced they will be rejected, if other sections of the law can stand without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">' We will now examine the Act of 1904, chapter 225 to see if in its title, or in any of its provisions it violates any of these rules of construction by which its constitutionality is to be tested. .It is a general public law. Its title is: \u201cAn Act for the improvement of the public highways of the State, and to provide the means therefor and to require the commission created by an Act of the General Assembly of 1896, chapter 51 to perform certain additional duties.\u201d The Commission created by the Act of -1896, chapter 51, upon which additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>duties are imposed, is the State Geological and Economic Survey, which is placed by law under the direction of the Governor, the Comptroller, the President of the John Hopkins University, and the President of the Maryland Agricultural College.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The Act we are called upon to consider contains eighteen sections. The first section provides the conditions under which the Board of County Commissioners of any county in the State may of their own volition petition the commission for plans and estimate of costs for the construction and improvement of roads in their respective counties. This is the voluntary feature of the law, and its validity is not questioned; the second section, which is called the involuntary feature, and which is directly assailed as void, is here transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Sec. 2. \u201cAnd be it enacted, That whenever the owners of two-thirds of the lands binding upon any public road or section of road, not less than one mile long, shall present a petition to the County Commissioners of the county where such road, or section of road, may be situated, stating in said petition the desire of said petitioners to have said road, or section thereof, constructed or repaired under the provisions of this Act, and stating further the willingness of said petitioners to pay for such construction or repairs, a sum equal to ten per centum of the cost of such construction or repairs; it shall be the duty of said Board, of County Commissioners to mak\u00e9 such a request to the commission delegated by this Act, as set forth in section one hereof, upon the payment by said petitioners of said ten per centum, or the giving by them of an approved bond to the County Commissioners for the payment thereof at any time it may be demanded by said County Commissioners upon the filing of a similar petition, and the taking of similar proceedings regarding the extension of any road, which in the opinion of said commission, has been properly improved, a similar request shall be made to the aforesaid commission by the Board of County Commissioners in the county where such extension lies, even though such proposed extension be less than a mile in length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Section 3 provides that if the commission after the receipt of the notice from the Board of County Commissioners, as provided in section i, and section 2 of the Act, and after due examination, shall be of opinion that the proposed construction, or repair of roads mentioned in such notice would be generally promotive of the objects therein contemplated, and that such road- or proposed road is a right and proper one to be built, and if there shall be sufficient money from the State appropriation to the credit of the county for the necessary outlay, it shall make the plans and specifications for the proposed work, and shall furnish an estimate in detail of the cost of doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Section 4 relates to the character of material of which the road must be constructed or repaired; section 5 to the payment by the county of the cost of surveys, mapping, printing, &amp;c., proper to be done in the preparation of the plans and specifications and estimate of cost; section 6 to the advertisement for bids for doing the work, but it is expressly provided that the County Commissioners will not be required to advertise for work to be done under the provisions of section 2 of the Act to an amount greater than twenty-five per cent of the road levy of the county; section 7 to the opening of bids and the awarding of the contract; sections 8 and 9 relate to the approval of the contract by the commission and its supervision over the work; section 10 relates to the completion of the work and the payment by the Comptroller to the county of one-half of the total cost of the work; section 11 provides that the State shall not be liable for the cost of acquiring land for any roads, nor for damage caused by the construction or improvement of any road; section 12 provides for the apportionment among the counties of the sum appropriated by the Act; section 13 makes minute provision for the maintenance of the roads constructed under the Act; section 14 makes provision for any county in which the control of the public roads is, or may be vested in any body other than the Board of County Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Section 15, which is said to be repugnant to section 2, is as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>follows: \u201cThat nothing in this Act shall be taken to alter, abridge, or in any way affect the present method of road construction or repair by the several counties, <em>at their own expense or otherwise, </em>as now authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">By section 16 the sum of two hundred thousand dollars annually, or so much thereof as might be necessary is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 17 declares that the provisions of the Act shall be regarded as adding, to such an extent as may be necessary, to enable it to perform the additional duties hereinbefore imposed upon it, to the powers and duties conferred upon said commission by the Act of 1898, chapter 454; section 18 provided that the Act should go into effect January 1st, 1905. -</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">From this examination of the several sections of the Act, which has become to be known as the Shoemaker Road Law, because of the interest taken by Mr. Samuel M. Shoemaker, of Baltimore County, to secure its adoption and retention on the statute books, it is manifest that the sole purpose or object of the Act is the building of good roads in all parts of the State, and as a means to that end to permit the State, under carefully provided safeguards designed to secure the best possible results, to' contribute annually for that purpose the sum of two hundred thousand dollars. Most careful and well considered provisions are made to exclude favoritism, jobbery, and dishonesty, and to insure the application of business principles to the work to be done under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The Act is exactly what its title declares it to be \u2014 an Act for the improvement of the public highways in the State. All its provisions relate to and are inseparably connected with that subject, and with none other. There is no foreign, irrelevant, or dissimilar subject introduced, and it may well be declared to embrace but one subject. Its title, we think is sufficiently exact, definite, and comprehensive to cover the subject of the Act, and to sufficiently apprize the Legislature and the people of the proposed legislation. Sections 1 and 2 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Act merely prescribe the methods or conditions under which request may be made to the commission for plans and specifications and estimate of the cost. These methods and provisions are not required to be set out in the title of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The County Commissioners have no just grounds of complaint because the Legislature imposes upon them the duty, under the provisions specified in the Act, to make the request for plans, specifications, &amp;c., as directed, since they have no powers or duties except such as may be prescribed by law, and if the General Assembly, which invested them with authority over the county roads, sees fit to withdraw or modify that authority, or imposes new and additional duties upon them with respect to the public highways, they cannot be heard to complain. It is their duty to obey the mandate of the law. The Legislature did not intend to make the operation of the Act dependent solely upon the will of the Boards of County Commissioners. If through shortsightedness or antipathy to'the law on the part of said boards they will not avail themselves, when they ought to do so, of the co-operation of the State in the improving of the public roads, the Act makes provision by which the taxpayers may coerce them to action. It has likewise provided checks and restraints for the protection of the county against unwise, unnecessary, wasteful, or improvident expenditure of public money under the involuntary feature of the law. It by no means follows that the road petitioned for under the compulsory provision of the Act must be constructed or repaired. The State Commission is charged with the duty of making due examination into the facts, and it must be satisfied that the proposed construction, or' the repair of the roads would be generally promotive of the purposes contemplated by the Act, and that the proposed road is a right and proper one under the circumstances to be built. The personnel of the tribunal to which the State has committed the decision of these matters would seem to afford a guarantee against apprehended abuses. All proper objections by the County Commissioners, or others interested would be heard by it, as to the propriety of building, or repairing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>roads, and it is safe to assume that it would take no action which would result in injury to the general taxpayers of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We cannot adopt the construction of this Act, insisted upon by the appellees, which finds an irreconcilable conflict between sections 2 and 15. That construction would frustrate the evident intent of the Legislature as gathered not only from the purposes of the enactment, but from the plain words employed. This Act, as we have said, was passed for the improvement of the public roads of the State at the <em>joint expense </em>of the State and county, and it was not intended to affect the construction and repair of roads by the County Commissioners under the general laws upon the subject found in the Code, or under local laws prevailing in the several counties. In order that this might be placed beyond doubt, or question, the Legislature embodied in the fifteenth section <em>an express </em>declaration that the Act must not be taken to alter, abridge or in any way affect the present method of road construction, or repair by the respective counties, <em>at their own expense, or otherwise </em>as now authorized by law. This declared purpose of the General Assembly which would seem to be evident without such declaration, harmonizes all the sections of the Act, and preserves in full force and effect the second section which we have been asked to declare void.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">For the reasons stated, we decide that section 2 of the Act of 1904, chapter 225,is free from constitutional objection, and that there is no conflict or repugnancy between that section and the provisions of the 15th section, and that, assuming the allegations of fact contained in the petition for the writ of <em>mandamus </em>to be true, it was the simple, definite, and imperative duty of the respondents to give the notice and make the request provided for in the second section of that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">It follows that the order of the lower Court appealed against must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded, zvith costs to the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
