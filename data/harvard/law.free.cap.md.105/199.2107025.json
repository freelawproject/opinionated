ordinarily the question of fact whether the person doing the wrong was acting in one capacity or the other is for the jury, yet if the whole evidence shows that the person so acting only held the one capacity, viz., that of special officer, and there is no evidence at. all that he was in the employ of the defendant other than as such officer, then there is no question to be left to the jury, as the evidence is legally insufficient for them to find that the officer was acting as an employee of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">This is certainly so when the act complained of is not violent assault and battery, or even the use of excessive force in making an arrest, but only a case of false.imprisonment, or malicious prosecution; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-9\">In a case like this of false arrest or false imprisonment the defendant is not liable for the act of the wrong doer unless there is shown either express authority or subsequent ratification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-10\">In the case of <em>Deck </em>v. <em>The B. &amp; O., </em>100 Md. 168, the Court, in saying \u201cwhether he was acting in one capacity or other, is a question for the jury,\u201d relies upon the cases of <em>Dickerson v. </em>Waldron, 135 Ind. 507-526; <em>Brill </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>115 Mo. 597-605, and <em>Railway Co. </em>v. Hackett, 58 Ark. 387. An examination of these cases will disclose that in all of them the double and distinct capacities existed in the person of the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-11\">In the case now under discussion, Freeburger was nothing but a special policeman, with absolutely no authority or no power or no duties, other than those derived from the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>mission. He never had been in the employ of the company in any other capacity. The company had no police department. It only asked for a policeman, to perform the duties of such. The testimony unquestionably establishes such to have been the case, and the cross-examination of the witness Freeburger, by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, only emphasizes the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">The case of <em>B. &amp; O. </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>102 Md. 674, seems but to emphasize our contention. In that case the plaintiff, in his first prayer, p. 674, asked fora verdict if the jury should find that the defendant Steiner acted as <em>detective or as special officer </em>\u2014 evidently thinking there was a right of recovery when acting as special officer, provided the act was done when attemping to drive trespassers from the train. This Court said the prayer was bad. In the first- place, because there was no evidence that Steiner was so engaged, distinguishing it from the facts, when the case was first presented to the Court in 100 Md. 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">In a case like this, of false arrest or false imprisonment, the defendant is not liable for the act of Freeburger, unless there is shown either express authority or subsequent ratification. The following cases support this proposition unless the fact that the plaintiff was a passenger at the time of his arrest would affect the question : <em>Turnpike Co. v. Green </em>86 Md. 167; <em>Barabasz </em>v. <em>Kabat, 86 </em>Md. 36; <em>Central Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>78 Md. 394; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>77 Md. 464; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>51 Md. 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">The contention of the plaintiff is that, as the plaintiff was a passenger at the time of his arrest the defendant is liable for the wrongful act of Freeburger, because the defendant was under obligation to protect its passengers, from any wrong or injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">This contention as applicable to the facts of this case is not sound. It will be admitted for the purpose of the argument that \u2014 If the plaintiff, while a passenger, had been arrested by a servant of the defendant, or at the instance or request of one, while about the performance of his prescribed duty,-the defendant would be liable, because the plaintiff would be entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>to be protected by the defendant against assaults and injuries by the defendant\u2019s own employees. And so it is held in the case of <em>B. &amp; O. </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>81 Md. 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">But the person who arrested or restrained the liberty of the plaintiff in the case at bar, was not a servant of the defendant. His only business and authority was that conferred upon him by the State of Maryland. Nor did he act at the instance or request of any servant or employee of the defendant, nor is there any evidence in the record that any of the officers on the defendant\u2019s boat, or agents or servants of the defendant, had the slightest knowledge of the facts complained of in the case. What Freeburger did, he did of his own volition, and his act could only be ascribed to his official capacity, for as far as the defendant is concerned he bore no other relation to it. The law goes a step farther, and at the same time recognizes the obligation of the carrier to protect the passenger. Had an employee of the defendant been present he would have had no right to interfere with Freeburger in the exercise of his police powers. <em>Fetter on Carriers of Passengers, </em>vol. 1, p. 244, sec. 101; <em>Jardine </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>50 N. J. 485; <em>Hershey </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>36 Fed. Rep. 171; <em>Steinmier's case, </em>72 Md. 318.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\">The defendant submits: (1) That Freeburger was a special police. (2) That he had no other capacity. (3) That the company is not bound for the wrongful act of the special police in a case of false imprisonment. (4) That the fact that the plaintiff was a passenger does not affect the question, as the restraint to his liberty was not done at the instance or request of any employee of the defendant, nor was any such present to prevent the same, nor had he the right so to do had he been present.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-7\"><em>Thomas G. Hayes </em>and <em>John H. Grill, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">The capacity in which Freeburger committed the act complained of was that of an agent or servant of the appellant, acting as enforcer of its regulations among the passengers on board the Louise; and hence if such act was wrongful and injurious to the appellee, Joseph Schanagl, and committed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>within the scope of Freeburger\u2019s employment, the appellant, is liable and the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer was properly granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-5\">The evidence of Freeburger, the officer, in addition to the testimony of appellee\u2019s witnesses, conclusively shows that he was employed and paid by the appellant to enforce its rules and regulations among the passengers, while the Louise navigated the public waters between Baltimore and Tolchester. Freeburger admits that the appellee committed no breach of the peace; that he did not arrest him, but that his taking him from his company to the deck below was to advise and admonish him not to engage in a friendly romp or pull with his male companions; this prohibition must have been a rule or regulation of the appellant which he was enforcing. The commission of Freeburger offered in evidence clearly shows that it was only in cases of breach of the peace that he was authorized to act <em>officially </em>as a State officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">The Jaw as given by the Courts of this and other States as \u2022applicable to these officers, commissioned by the State, .employed and paid by the company, shows conclusively that the act complained of, if it were the enforcement of a regulation, as it unquestionably was, was done by Freeburger in his ca.pacity as the agent and servant of the appellant in enforcing its rules and regulations, and for which wrongful act the appellant is liable. \u201cA police officer, by responding to the invitation of the regular agents of the company to aid in enforcing its <em>regulations, </em>becomes for that purpose, a special agent of the company, and for the conduct of such special agent, within the scope of his employment, the company is responsible.

This Court decided that the carrier is liable under such circumstances. <em>Hamel </em>v. <em>Ferry Co., </em>25 N. Y. S. R. 154, affirmed in 125 N. Y. 707; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>N. Y. R.

The declaration alleges that on the 10th of July, 1905, the plaintiff, Joseph Scharnagl, purchased a ticket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>from Baltimore to Tolchester and return, and became a passenger on the defendant\u2019s steamboat Louise ; that at said time .the defendant was a common carrier of passengers and navigated the Patapsco. River and Chesapeake Bay between the city of Baltimore and Tolchester in Kent County; that while a passenger on said steamboat en route to Tolchester the plaintiff was violently seized and arrested by a servant aud agent of the defendant, and taken from the cabin of said steamboat and confined in a lockup on said steamboat; that the said plaintiff when arrested as aforesaid was demeaning himself quietly and orderly with the other ladies and gentlemen who were of his party, and upon inquiry made of said servant, as he was being taken from the cabin to the lockup, why he was arrested, the only answer given him was that it was all right; that the plaintiff, after being placed in said lockup and kept there for sometime was released, and then informed that a mistake had been made and he was not the person intended to be arrested; that his arrest aforesaid was witnessed by a large number of passengers who were on said steamboat, and by said arrest and confinement in said lockup he was greatly mortified and humiliated and suffered great mental pain and anguish, and was otherwise damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and the case was tried upon the joinder of issue upon that plea, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff, from which this appeal was taken. One exception only \u2014 that to the ruling of the Court upon the prayers \u2014 is presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">It is not disputed that at the time of the commission of the wrongs complained of, the defendant was a common carrier, and that the plaintiff was a passenger for hire aboard its steamboat Louise as stated in the declaration. The relation of passenger and carrier being shown to exist between the appellant company and Joseph Scharnagl, the law imposed upon the carrier a primary duty to protect him during the existence of that relation, and if he were unjustifiably assaulted or arrested, or imprisoned whilst that relation continued by the servants or agents of the carrier, while acting within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of their duty, the carrier would be liable.. This proposition is so firmly settled in this State and elsewhere that it seems needless to quote authorities to support it. In <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. Cain, 81 Md. 105, which was an action for false imprisonment wherein it appeared that the plaintiff was arrested and imprisoned whilst a passenger by order of the defendant\u2019s conductor this Court, speaking through Judge McSherry, said: \u201cIf the plaintiff had been guilty of no breach of the peace, his arrest at the instance of the conductor was unlawful, and having been made in the defendant\u2019s depot whilst the plaintiff, a passenger, was still entitled to be protected against assaults and injuries by the defendant\u2019s own employees, if wrongfully made by or at the request of the defendant\u2019s own servants whilst they were in and about the performance of their pre-' scribed duties, the master would be liable.\u201d In <em>Central Railway Company </em>v. Peacock, 69 Md. 262, the Court said: \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>New Jersey Steamboat Company v. Brockett, </em>121 U. S. 645, decided unequivocally that the carrier of passengers must protect his passengers from the violence of the carrier\u2019s employees, as also from that of other passengers; but there is nothing in the decision in conflict with the doctrine that to render the carrier liable the employee must be at the time acting in the employment of the railroad, and within the line of his duty, and the decision assumes that the party is a passenger when injured; for that was the fact in the case.\u201d The statement of the law by this Court is in harmony with direct decisions in other jurisdictions. <em>Indianapolis R. Co. v. Cooper, </em>33 N. E. 219; <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>59 Pa. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Scharnagl being a passenger for hire, and the defendant\u2019s duty towards him being established, we will now inquire whether there is found in the record evidence tending to prove the allegations of assault, arrest and imprisonment found in the declaration. Upon this branch of the case the testimony, as usual, is conflicting, but with the weight and credibility of the evidence this Court has nothing t.o do, those matters being committed by the law to the sole and exclusive judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of the jury. The question which this Cohrt is called upon to decide is this: Assuming the evidence offered by the plaintiff to be true, is it legally sufficient to support the averments of the <em>narr? </em>The appellee, Joseph Scharnagl, testified that he was a resident of Baltimore City, that at the time of the institution of the suit was twenty years of age; that on the afternoon of the ioth of July, 1905, he purchased a ticket at the office of the defendant company on Light street in Baltimore City for a trip by the defendant\u2019s steamboat Louise to Tolchester; that after getting his tickets he went aboard the boat; that after the boat had gotten a little distance past Fort McHenry on its way to Tolchester the wrongs complained of were committed, and are thus described by the appellee in his-testimony: \u201cJust about abreast of Fort McHenry, as I was-standing with this company of mine listening to a party playing on the piano, and a few other company, but not of mine,, singing, and I was standing there thinking of nothing, when here comes this officer up and grabs me by the neck and wrist, and as he takes me to the steps, I says, what\u2019s the trouble, and he says, never mind what\u2019s the trouble, you come with me. He goes down on the deck below, and that is where these witnesses were standing; they don\u2019t see me put in the lock-up; it was a dark place, and he unlocked the door and throws me in as if I was a dog. I was in there fifteen or twenty minutes. I don\u2019t know whether the officer went out or not, but he came back and unlocked the door, and as he-unlocked it he grabbed hold of me. He stood there and! looked at me, and he said: Ain\u2019t you the gentleman I put off' this boat for being drunk this morning? And I said, you must be mistaken; and he said, don\u2019t contradict me that way; let me see your ticket; and I showed him the ticket, and then he released me, and.I went up on deck; andas I was on deck every now and then I could hear a person say, \u2018there goes the young gentleman that was put in the lock-up.\u2019 How would any body else like to be done that way.\" (Record, 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">This testimony as to the assault and arrest is corroborated by four witnesses who were present, and, if true, a most un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>warranted and humiliating outrage was committed upon the the plaintiff. The evidence shows that this maltreatment was inflicted upon the plaintiff by John Freeburger, and in order to hold the appellant liable for his act, the plaintiff was bound to prove, under the principles stated, to the satisfaction of the jury, first, that Freeburger was an employee of the defendant, and secondly, that he was acting within the scope of his duty as such employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The testimony shows that Freeburger occupied a dual capacity on the boat. He was commissioned by the Governor as a policeman, under sec. 403, Art. 23, Code, 1904, for the protection of the appellant\u2019s property, and for the preservation of peace and good order on its premises. He was recommended to the Governor for appointment by the appellant, his compensation was paid by it, and he was dis-chargeable by it in the manner pointed out by sec. 407 of that Article. He undertook the enforcement of all rules, orders and regulations of the appellant among the passengers on the boat, and a\u2019s special officer he enforced all orders, rules and regulations that the company might promulgate and communicate to him, connected with the proper deportment of passengers. This state of facts was amply sufficient to have taken the case to the jury upon the question as to whether he was acting at the time as- an employee of the appellant, and within the scope of his employment. <em>Tolchester Reach Co. </em>v. <em>Steinmier, </em>72 Md. 317; <em>Deck </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>100 Md. 168; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>102 Md. 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The first, second and third prayers of the plaintiff, which will be set out in the report of the case, are based upon correct legal principles, and submitted the case fairly to the jury. The defendant\u2019s first, second and third prayers sought to withdraw the case from the consideration of the jury, and were properly refused. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis of the defendant\u2019s fourth prayer, and for this and other reasons it was rightly rejected. The defendant\u2019s fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth prayers, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>granted, put its defense fully before the jury. The fifth prayer was most favorable to the defendant, and announced a principle which we are not to be understood as approving. Finding no reversible error in the rulings, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
