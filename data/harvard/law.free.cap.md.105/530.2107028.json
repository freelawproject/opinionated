In other words it describes the subject dealt with by naming the section and quoting the title of the Act amended, and beyond this it does nothing whatsoever. It contains no description ot anything, independently of the title of the original Act. It expresses no object or subject or purpose outside of the original title. Under such circumstances the amending Act can contain no provision which is not described by or germane to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the title of the Act amended, and if the amending Act contains any provision not within the scope of the title of the Act amended, such provision is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-5\">In respect to the <em>second </em>of the <em>two </em>characteristics features of this title above referred to, it will be noted that its terms are expressly <em>restrictive </em>as to\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>(a) </em>The <em>section </em>\u2014 2. &lt;?., <em>Section 2 of </em>the Act which it proposes to amend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-7\"><em>(b) </em>The <em>Administrative Agency </em>which is to carry out the things which under the Act are to be <em>done </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., Ihe Board of Public Works of Maryland.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-8\"><em>(c) </em>The <em>things themselves </em>which, under the Act, are to be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-9\">If the context of the statute calls for anything either not within the limits of or in conflict.with the express restrictions of the title touching the matters above mentioned, then the context of the statute is, to the extent of such transgression or conflict, void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-10\">The restrictive terms of the title require that the subject matter of the Act must be kept within it see <em>Cooley's Const Limitations, </em>7 ed. p. 212; 26 <em>Am. and Eng.

This clear and definite restriction is disregarded and exceeded by the Act, in that, besides amending sec. 2, it adds secs. 3, 4 and 5. Nothing is said in the title about the addition of these new sections. On the contrary, the title merely refers to section 2 and restricts the object of the Act \u201cto repeal and re-enact with amendments, sec. 2 of ch. 426 of laws of 1964.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-5\">Code, sec. 2, as re-enacted by ch. 804 of the Acts of 1906, is not described in the title of the Act and is in conflict with the title. There would seem to be no escape at all from this proposition. The title, it will be noted, calls for two things as parts of the subject to which it relates, namely: 1. The things to be done. 2. The administrative agency for the doing of the things.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">Taking up the second matter first, we find that the title pre-scribes that the administrative agency which is to carry out the things to be done under the Act is the Board of Public Works. This is a perfectly definite and well known body. It is established by the Constitution, and, as the Legislature and every citizen is presumed to know, it consists of the Governor, the Treasurer and the Comptroller, the three chief executive officials of the State. It is this definite, well known and constitutional body which, according to the title, is to carry out the duties and functions prescribed by this Act. The title says nothing whatever about any other commission or functionary to execute those duties and functions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">Now then, section 2 prescribes and provides for an entirely different administrative agency to execute the Act from the agency called for by the title. It provides for a commission entirely different from the Board of Public Works, in its constitution, name and organization. This different commission is to be known as the State Tobacco Warehouse Building Commission. It is to consist not of the Board of Public Works, composed of the three chief officials of the State, two of whom are elected by the people and third by the General Assembly, but of these three officials together with five other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>gentlemen who are named. The new commission then, is not the specific ascertained board created by the Constitution and distinctly described in the title, but a commission consisting of eight members, including the members of the Board of Public Works as a minority of said commission. It is then apparent that the new commission created by sec. 2 is a commission, which if valid, may act through five of its members, or even four of its members exclusive of the Board of Public Works and of all the members of the Board of Public Works, and perform the functions which the title distinctly and restrictively says shall be performed by the Board of Public Works, not merely without the acquiescence, but without the presence, or even in the face of objections and protest upon the part of the members of the Board of Public Works or any of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-5\">For example, a majority, that is to say <em>five </em>of the eight members of the commission would be a <em>quorum </em>for the transaction of its business. Of such a <em>quorum, </em>a majority, that is to say, <em>three </em>members would be legally competent to act. So that Code, sec. 2 of the Act of 1906, chap. 804, <em>confers authority upon any three of the private citizens named as members of the Building Commission, </em>to administer an important public work involving the expenditure of large sums of public money, and in this case the demolition of valuable public buildings, instead of vesting such authority in the Board of Public Works which alone is specifically designated and required by the title of the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-6\">It is plain, therefore, that the executive agency designated in the title, namely, the Board of Public Works, and the executive agency sought to be established by section 2 of the Act, namely, the State Tobacco Warehouse Building Commission, are entirely different and distinct bodies, and there is no ingenuity capable of demonstrating that these two functionaries, so palpably and radically different, are or even were intended to be the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-7\">The State Tobacco Warehouse Building Commission is not lawfully created by the Act of 1906, because its creation is not only not described in the title of the Act, but is in conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>with the title. <em>Mayor, etc., of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>104 Md. 107; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>180 N.

Or to sell or lease the said property, <em>i. e., </em>site of former warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and build a tobacco warehouse in same locality, in Baltimore City, to be selected by the Board of Public Works.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-10\">The preamble of the Act of 1906 shows that the insurance money was collected, and the site of warehouses Nos. 1 and 2 sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-11\">As compared with the things which the title says shall be done, what are the things which .section 2 says shall be done</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-12\">They are\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-13\">1.

The title says in its concluding part that the Board of Public Works shall \u201cbuild a Tobacco Warehouse in some locality in Baltimore city selected by the Board of Public Works.\u201d This is something altogether different from the \u201crebuilding, enlarging and fully equipping Warehouses 3, 4, and 5, and if sufficient amount remain in the Tobacco Fund for the purchasing a suitable site, etc., and erecting thereon a Tobacco Warehouse, etc.\u201d prescribed by section 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-6\">Moreover, the. title says that the locality shall be \u201cselected by said Board of Public Works.\u201d By section 2, the site is left to the selection of the Building Commission of eight members, of which the Board of Public Works are not only in a minority but not necessary to make a quorum of the commission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-7\">3. \u201cIn case said commission shall be unable to obtain a suitable site within said bounds, they shall cause to be rebuilt <em>on the site of houses A and B of No. j </em>Warehouse, a modern and fully equipped house for the inspection and storage of tobacco.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-8\">This is in plain conflict with the title, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-9\"><em>(a) </em>It is conditioned upon the contingencies above mentioned, which have been shown not to be described by the title, which calls for something altogether different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-10\"><em>(b) </em>Because, by the title, the Board of Public Works, and <em>not </em>\u201cthe said commission\u201d is required to select the site.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-11\"><em>(c) </em>Because the title does not contemplate or authorize a provision in the Act for the destruction of houses A and B of No. 3 Warehouse to make room for a new warehouse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-12\">This is shown by the provisions of the title requiring first that a new warehouse be put up on the present site of Warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and property owned by the State adjacent thereto, but that if the site of Warehouses Nos. 1 and 2 should be sold or leased then the Board is to \u201cbuild a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tobacco warehouse in some locality in Baltimore city selected by said Board of Public Works.\u201d If this language had contemplated the erection of a warehouse on the site of any existing warehouse of the State its framers surely would not have been so careful to provide that a new site shall be selected only in the event that the sites of Warehouses Nos. i and 2 had been sold or leased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-5\">2. Even if the Act of 1906, Chapter 804, be valid, it does not' confer the slightest authority upon the appellees for the plans and proceedings which the bill specifically charges they are about to carry out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-6\">3. The Legislature can not lawfully mix the Board of Public Works, as organized under the Constitution, with a number of other persons and require it under such circumstances to-act in the manner prescribed by the Act of 1906, Chapter 804.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-7\"><em>William S.

Christmas, as a property owner, taxpayer, and resident of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, on his own behalf and in behalf of all other taxpayers of the State, who might care to come in and avail themselves of the suit. The facts, which are admitted by the demurrer, are that the complainant is a taxpayer as alleged; that prior to the 7th and 8th of February, 1904, the State of Maryland had five tobacco warehouses in Baltimore City, whose capacity for the storage and inspection of tobacco was so much in excess of actual' needs for such purposes that one of said warehouses, to wit, No. 2, was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. That of said five warehouses Nos. 1 and 2 were destroyed by said fire, and that the insurance money accruing as indemnity to the State for the destruction of said two warehouses and also from the sale of the sites on which said two warehouses were located, together with the sum paid the State by the city of Baltimore for a part of a lot belonging to the State, and taken by the said city for the purpose of widening Light street therein amounted to the sum of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand dollars ($267,000.00), which sum was and is now credited to the State Tobacco Warehouse Fund and is a part of the public money of the State of Maryland; that the appellees propose to destroy said warehouses and to build a new warehouse, and in doing so are assuming to act as the State Tobacco Warehouse Building Commission created by the Act of 1906, chapter 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The bill charges that the destruction of said warehouses and the erection of a new one, as the defendants propose to do, and which they are about to begin and carry out, would be not only unlawful, but would result in a total loss of said sum of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand dollars ($267,000.00) belonging to the State, and would involve the loss of valuable State property, and would embark the State in an enterprise, which would be fraught with undesirable burdens and heavy and constant pecuniary losses to the State, and that the pursuance of the proposed plans as indicated would commit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>State to an unwise, discredited, and obsolete policy, which its best interests would require to be abandoned. The bill then sets out in detail facts tending to establish this allegation of waste, extravagance, and unbusiness like policy. The grounds upon which he rests his right to relief are, first, the unconstitutionality of the Act of 1906, chapter 804, under the authority of which the appellees are assuming to act; secondly, that assuming said Act to be valid, it confers upon the appellees no authority to do the things they are about to do, and hence their proposed plans and acts are <em>ultra vires, </em>and their consummation by the defendants, being unauthorized by law, should be restrained by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The Act is said to be unconstitutional and void, because, it is asserted, the subject-matter of the Act is not described in its title as required by Article 3, section 29 of the Constitution. If this objection be well taken the Act must be stricken down, and the undertaking of the appellees arrested. In the case of <em>Fout and Others </em>v. <em>The County Commissioners of Frederiek County, post </em>p. 545, we had an occasion to consider, and state with some particularity the purpose and operation of that Article and section of the Constitution, and we. do not deem it necessary to repeat what was there said with respect to that subject. In the case of <em>Kafka </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>99 Md. 238, the Court, speaking through Judge Jones in reference to the fre quency with which this section of the Constitution had been considered said: \u201cIt has received a liberal construction, and the Courts have been reluctant in any case to give it an operation which would defeat the legislative intent,'yet they have not hesitated to strike down legislative acts that were clear infractions of its purpose and object. These have been declared to be two fold; the first is to prevent the combination in one act of several distinct and incongruous subjects, and that the second is that the Legislature and the people of the State may be fairly advised of the real nature of impending legislation. It would seem that if the object of the constitutional provision in question is to be respected and is to have meaning and effect in controlling legislation, the considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>which have just been mentioned must have a controlling effect in applying it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In the earlier case of <em>Stiefel </em>v. <em>Maryland Institute for the Instruction of the Blind, </em>6l Md. 148, it was said \u201cthat publicity and a knowledge of the true effect and operation of every bill brought before the Legislature are the great safeguards against ill-considered and improper legislation. The provision is one among many others in the Constitution designed to promote those objects. Bills are sometimes read, especially \u25a0 the first time, by their titles only, and the titles only are spread .upon the journal. It is therefore important that the title to the bill should not be misleading, and at least a general idea of the purport of the law may be gathered from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">To the same effect are all the decisions of this Court dealing with the sufficiency of the title, the latest of which are th<em>e State </em>v. <em>The German Savings Bank, </em>103 Md. 196, and <em>Mayor, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Flack et al., </em>104 Md. 107. In the latter case Chief Judge McSherry mentioned some cases in which statutes have been stricken down because of insufficient titles: \u2019\u2019There are several cases,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich illustrate the vice of incorporating in the Act something entirely foreign to the subject-matter described in the title. Thus in <em>Scharf v. Tasker, </em>73 Md. 378, under an Act to provide for the assessment of unclaimed military lots in Allegany and Garrett Counties, a section of the Act which exempted Garrett County from the obligation of paying fees to the Commissioner of the Land Office then due for searches previously made, was stricken down. And in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shultz Company, </em>83 Md. 58, the title had relation to newly incorporated companies, whilst the act included existing companies. In <em>Luman </em>v. <em>Hitchens Bros., </em>90 Md. 15, the title prohibited sales to employees whilst the act prohibited sales to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The Maryland rule upon this subject is in accord with the current of decisions in other States which have incorporated in their organic laws provisions similar to our own. These decisions, with much research and labor and skillful arrangement, have been collected and cited in the carefully prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>brief of the appellant\u2019s counsel, but as most of these cases merely support and illustrate the Maryland doctrine upon the subject we do not deem it necessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The Act, which is assailed in this case (Act 1906, chapter 804), is entitled: \u201cAn Act to repeal and re-enact with amendments section 2 of chapter 426 of the laws of 1904, entitled \u201cAn Act to anthorize and empower the Board of Public .Works of Maryland to collect the insurance upon State Tobacco Warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and place the same to the credit of the Tobacco Warehouses Fund, and to either rebuild a modern warehouse on the present site of Tobacco Warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and the property owned by the State adjacent thereto, or to sell said property or lease the same for such sum as they.may think right and build a tobacco, warehouse in some locality of Baltimore City selected by said Board of Public Works.\u201d The body of the Act embraces six sections. The first section embodies a literal transcript of the title of the Act of 1904, chapter 426, and repeals and re-enacts its second section so as to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cSec. 2. <em>And be it further enacted, </em>That the members of the Board of Public Works, together with Henry Lantz, William B. Claggett and Joshua S. Rawlings, Adrian Posey and John H. Drury, shall be and they are hereby constituted the State Tobacco Warehouse Building.Commission, without compensation, for the purpose of rebuilding,. enlarging, and fully equipping Warehouses Nos. 3, 4 and 5, and if sufficient amount remain in the tobacco fund for the purchasing a suitable site on the water front in the city of Baltimore, and erecting thereon a tobacco warehouse with a capacity of at least eight thousand (8,000) hogsheads, provided the site shall be west of Market space and north of Hughes avenue; and in case the said commissioners shall be unable to obtain a suitable site within the said bounds they shall cause to be rebuilt on the site of houses \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d of No. 3 Warehouse a modern and fully equipped house for the inspection and storage of tobacco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Sec. 3 provides that the Governor shall be President of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Commission, and contains a provision as to how vacancies therein shall be filled; Sec. 4 provides that as soon after the passage of the Act as possible, said Commission shall organize and select a Secretary and proceed to purchase 01-lease a convenient and suitable site or lot of ground having water front in the City of Baltimore, and shall proceed to procure plans and specifications for said warehouse; it further provides for the advertising for bids, the awarding of the contract, the employment of an architect, and for the proper equipment of the warehouse; Sec. 5 authorizes the expenditure of the money credited to the Tobacco Warehouse Fund from the insurance money collected from the former warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and from the sale' of the sites of the same, or which may hereafter be credited to said fund from the sale of warehouse No. 3 \u201cA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The title describes certain duties which it is intended shall be imposed the <em>Board of Public Works. </em>The title is restrictive in character, ' and points out three specific things which the <em>Board of Public Works </em>is authorized to do; first, to collect the insurance upon warehouses Nos. 1 and 2, and place the same to the credit of the Tobacco Warehouse Fund; second, <em>to rebuild a modern warehouse on the present site of warehouses Nos. 1 and 2 </em>and the property owned by the State adjacent thereto; or thirdly to sell said property, or lease the same, and build a tobacco warehouse on some locality in Baltimore city selected by the <em>Board of Public Works. </em>The second section of the Act, which we have transcribed in full, establishes a governmental agency entirely distinct from the Board of Public Works called the State Tobacco Warehouse Building Commission, and which the Act declares is established for the following purposes; first to <em>rebuild, enlarge and equip warehouses Nos. j, \u2021 and p: </em>and second to purchase a suitable site on the water front in Baltimore city in the location mentioned in the Act, and to erect thereon a tobacco warehouse with a capacity of at least eight thousand hogsheads, and in case a suitable site cannot be secured in the locality mentioned in the Act, the <em>Commission </em>is authorized to build <em>on the sites of warehouses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>\u201cA\u201d and\u201cB\" ofNo.j </em>Warehouse a modern and.fully equipped house for the storage and inspection of tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It is thus clearly apparent that the things authorized to be done by section 2 of the Act, and the agency by which they are directed to be done are entirely different from the things indicated in the title. It seems to be perfectly plain that the title of this Act does not indicate in the slightest degree the nature of the proposed legislation. No one looking at the title would suppose for a moment that it was proposed to create such a Commission as that established by the Act, and to confer upon it the powers and duties therein expressed. The title is so insufficient and misleading as to be obnoxious to section 29 of Article 3 of the Constitution, and, therefore, the Act must be declared void. It follows that the work about to be undertaken by the appellees is without warrant or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The appellant, who is a resident and tax payer of the State, has such a special interest in the subject matter as to entitle him to maintain a suit to restrain the unauthorized destruction by the appellees of valuable State property, or the unwarranted expenditure by them of the funds of the State. In accordance with the views herein expressed, the order appealed against will be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\"><em>Order </em>reversed, <em>and cause remanded, with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
