McKenney, assignee of John Critcher, is complainant, and Susan Sutton, widow, and Walter, William, Lucelia, and Annie Sutton, children and heirs of William Sutton, deceased, and others, are defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">The object of the suit was to enforce a judgment lien on land. The defendants (appellants here) pleaded the lapse of ten years between date of judgment and institution of this suit without issuance of execution. The circuit court held that the plea presented no defence to the enforcement of the lien in equity, and the defendants obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">Opinion, states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-10\"><em>R.

More than fourteen years after the rendition of the judgment, to wit, on the 31st day of January, 1883, the present suit was instituted, in which the defendants duly appeared and pleaded the statute of limitations. But the plea was overruled by the decree complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Upon the authority of the decision of this court in <em>Hutcheson </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>80 Va. 251, we are of opinion that the plea ought to have been sustained. The decree will therefore be reversed, and an order entered here dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Decree reversed and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
