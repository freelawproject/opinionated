R. Weaver was defendant. Verdict was for plaintiff for $1,783.86. Defendant moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence. The circuit court overruled the motion. Whereupon, the defendant excepted, and the court certified the evidence and gave judgment according to the verdict.
