Although this court has referred to this issue in prior cases, it has never specifically addressed the merits of the argument. The case arises from a petition filed on August 17, 1983, in the Probate and Family Court to probate a document purporting to be the last will and testament of Rachele Marino (the decedent), who died on March 28, 1983. The decedent was survived by two sons and two daughters. Filomena Marino, the decedent\u2019s daughter, was named executrix under the will and was to receive the bulk of the estate. Frederick Marino, the decedent\u2019s son and the executrix\u2019s brother, was left a specific bequest of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">On September 29, 1983, Frederick filed an objection to the allowance of the petition alleging (1) lack of testamentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>capacity, (2) undue influence exerted by Filomena on the decedent, (3) fraud by Filomena, and (4) lack of compliance with the requisite formalities. Frederick died on December 12, 1984, and a suggestion of death was filed on February 12, 1985. Frederick\u2019s daughter and the administratrix of his estate, Lucille Sheldone, sought recognition of her appearance to continue her father\u2019s action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Filomena then filed a motion to dismiss the action on the grounds that the objections did not survive Frederick\u2019s death. This motion was allowed on June 11, 1985, and an order of dismissal was entered. Lucille appealed, and we took the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Filomena contends, and the Probate judge agreed, that G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, applies in this case. This statute provides that, \u201c[i]n addition to the actions which survive by the common law,\u201d actions of replevin, actions of tort for assault, battery, imprisonment, or \u201cother damage to the person,\u201d actions for consequential damages resulting from personal injury, actions for conversion or for damage to real or personal property, and actions against sheriffs for the misconduct or negligence of themselves or their deputies shall survive. This statute was enacted to abrogate the common law rule established in Massachusetts that-tort actions were personal and, thus, did not survive the death of either the injured party or the wrongdoer. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>244 Mass. 83, 85 (1923). <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>379 Mass. 212, 214 (1979). Because will contest actions were not specifically cited in the terms of G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, the judge decided that the cause of action did not survive. We conclude that the action does survive as one of \u201cthe actions which survive by the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>law.\u201d This is in accord with our decision in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 215, which held that G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, does not operate to restrict the types of actions which survive but was intended to expand on the number of actions which do survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Lucille relies on several opinions of this court which she asserts have implicitly recognized the survival of will contest actions and have allowed the executor or special administrator of an estate to initiate a will contest or to continue a will contest action initiated by the contestant prior to death. <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>295 Mass. 62 (1936). <em>Blinn </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>252 Mass. 197 (1925). <em>Bonnemort </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>167 Mass. 338 (1897). See <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>286 Mass. 329 (1934); <em>Cawley </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>192 Mass. 126 (1906). However, no case has been cited in which we have specifically addressed the question whether a will contest survives the death of the contestant.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We have held that actions seeking the vindication of personal rights, in the absence of a statute, do not survive while those seeking redress for damage to property rights do survive. See, e.g., <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DeNicola, </em>317 Mass. 416, 419-420 (1944). We find the analysis of several other jurisdictions convincing that a will contest is in the nature of a property right and, thus, survives the contestant\u2019s death. <em>In In re Estate of Field, </em>38 Cal. 2d 151, 154 (1951), the Supreme Court of California stated that \u201cthe right of an interested person to contest a will is fundamentally based upon the loss of property or property rights resulting from the recognition of an invalid instrument depriving him of those rights; that the purpose of a will contest is to establish a violation of the contestant\u2019s rights of property; that in its essence the contest is an action for the recovery of property unlawfully taken or about to be taken from the ownership of the contestant.\u201d See <em>Crawfordsville Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>178 Ind. 258, 271-272 (1912); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Blackard, </em>298 Ky. 354, 356-357 (1944); <em>Kinsella </em>v. <em>Landa, </em>600 S.W.2d 104, 107-108 (Mo. App. 1980); <em>In re Morrow\u2019s Will, </em>41 N.M. 723, 735 (1937); <em>In re Estate of Riggs, </em>120 Or. 38, 42-43 (1926); <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Gourley, </em>72 Wash. 462, 471-472 (1913). In a related case, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Court of California recognized that, while the mere expectancy of an heir is usually not regarded as a property right, the expectancy is transformed into a vested property right upon the death of the testator. <em>In re Baker\u2019s Estate, </em>170 Cal. 578, 586 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Our conclusion that the will contest survives the death of the contestant aligns Massachusetts with the great majority of jurisdictions that have considered this question. At least twenty-five States specifically declare that the right of contest survives or is assignable: <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>249 Ala. 545 (1947); <em>In re Estate of Field, </em>38 Cal. 2d 151 (1951); <em>In re Baker\u2019s Estate, </em>170 Cal. 578 (1915); <em>In re Dickerson, </em>55 Conn. 223 (1887); <em>Glos </em>v. <em>Glos, </em>341 Ill. 447 (1930); <em>Crawfordsville Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>178 Ind. 258 (1912); <em>In re Wiltsey\u2019s Estate, </em>122 Iowa 423 (1904); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Blackard, </em>298 Ky. 354 (1944); <em>Succession of Simms, </em>250 La. 177 (1965); <em>Yingling </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>254 Md. 366 (1969); <em>Sheeran </em>v. <em>Sheeran, </em>96 Minn. 484 (1905); <em>Kinsella </em>v. <em>Landa, </em>600 S.W.2d 104 (Mo.

Georgia, <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Felts, </em>148 Ga. 195 (1918), and Michigan, <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Ruthven, </em>292 Mich. 602 (1940) are among those States that do not provide for the survival or assignment of will contest actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\"> Lucille Sheldone does not claim standing in her personal capacity to challenge the decedent\u2019s will. Consequently, we need not reach the question whether she, as an heir of Frederick, is a \u201cperson interested\u201d who may properly contest the will in her own right. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>233 Mass. 136, 139 (1919). Our cases have recognized heirs at law, or, at the discretion of the court, a legatee having interests adverse to those of other legatees as a \u201cperson interested\u201d who could challenge the will. <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Fenelon, </em>266 Mass. 340 (1929). <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>240 Mass. 514 (1922). <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>238 Mass. 313 (1921). <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>233 Mass. 136 (1919) (allowing a will challenge by a person named as a legatee in an earlier will).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
