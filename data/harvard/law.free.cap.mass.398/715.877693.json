L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The authority alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Massachusetts Laborers District Council, I/B/O Local No. 367 (union), and the public employees it represented were engaging or about to engage in a strike in violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A <em>{a). </em>The commission declined to proceed with an investigation and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The commission held that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A, does not apply to public housing authorities. In support of this conclusion it relied on G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission ruled that c. 121B, \u00a7 29, limited the applicability of G. L. c. 150E, in spite of the broad sweep of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The authority appealed to the Appeals Court and we took the case on our own motion. The commission was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The commission first contends that the case is not appealable under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as it is not a \u201cfinal order,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>that the right to appeal in \u00a7 11 has no applicability to a petition for investigation under \u00a7 9A. There is no doubt that the commission\u2019s decision in the present case was in a sense \u201cfinal\u201d as it dismissed the petition. Moreover, the dismissal was based upon the commission\u2019s view that it lacked jurisdiction to proceed rather than its perception that \u00a7 9A had not been violated. Because the commission\u2019s action was predicated on its view that it lacked jurisdiction, it is not necessary to reach the question whether every dismissal of a petition to investigate under \u00a7 9A is directly appealable under \u00a7 11. Furthermore, even if the order appealed from was not a final order it would have been appropriate for the authority to obtain judicial review of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 9A by way of a complaint for declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231 A. The commission conceded at oral argument that the court could treat this case as a request for declaratory relief and answer the substantive question. We therefore consider the question of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">There is no doubt that housing authorities, including the Boston Housing Authority, are \u201cpublic employers\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1, amended in 1981, and the commission does not contend otherwise. See <em>Fall River Hous. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Auth., </em>7 M.L.C. 1722 (1981) (Fall River Housing Authority is public employer within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1); <em>Geriatric Auth. of Holyoke, </em>12 M.L.C. 1571, 1575-1576 (1986) (\u201cThe recent amendment [St. 1981, c. 484, amending \u00a7 1 of G. L. c. 150E] was intended to include authorities\u201d). The commission does contend, however, that G. L. c. 121B, the specific enabling legislation applicable to housing authorities, limits the applicability of G. L. c. 150E to the sections enumerated in G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29. Section 29 was amended in 1977 to make \u00a7\u00a7 4, 10 and 11 of G. L. c. 150E applicable to housing authorities. The commission argues that to apply any other section of G. L. c. 150E to housing authorities would be an implied repeal of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29. Where two statutes deal with the same subject they should be interpreted harmoniously to effectuate a consistent body of law. <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 50-51 (1977). <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>344 Mass. 585, 589 (1962). The doctrine of implied repeal does not mandate repeal of the earlier statute unless it is \u201cso repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment covering the same subject matter that both cannot stand.\u201d <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admin., </em>349 Mass. 687, 690 (1965). See also <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>393 Mass. 303, 306 (1984). We do not believe that the statutes are inconsistent. The broad application of G. L. c. 150E to housing authorities merely expands the coverage of c. 150E from that already provided by G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29. By this interpretation, the prior statute G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, therefore becomes merely redundant, not repugnant or conflicting. Assuming that the statutes are inconsistent, traditional doctrines of statutory interpretation point in different directions. For example, we have said that where the Legislature enacts a new law covering a particular field but leaves conflicting prior prescriptions unrepealed, the earlier statute must give way to the later one. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admin., supra </em>at 690. The court has also observed that, in the case of conflicting statutes, normally the more specific statute will prevail over the more general statute. <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 455, 472 (1976). <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>364 Mass. 109, 118 (1973). See also <em>Mulrain </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Leicester, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 48 (1982). This is not the case, however, where the more general statute was enacted to provide a comprehensive coverage of the subject area. <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>326 Mass. 673, 676 (1951). See also <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, supra </em>at 472. Chapter 150E is such a statute, enacted as a \u201ccomprehensive Statewide statutory revision concerning the collective bargaining rights of public employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472-473.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the comprehensive nature of G. L. c. 150E must prevail over any limitations which might be read into G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29. The commission itself has expanded the applicability of G. L. c. 150E beyond the purported limitations of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29. See <em>Worcester Hous. Auth., 9 </em>M.L.C. 1008 (1982); <em>Worcester Hous. Auth., 5 </em>M.L.C. 1459 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is only by implication that G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, can be said to limit the applicability of G. L. c. 150E. If \u00a7 29 of c. 121B is read as limiting the applicability of c. 150E as the commission suggests, the result is that \u00a7 9A of c. 150E, which prohibits public employee strikes, is read out of the general statute dealing with public employee labor relations. We perceive no legislative intent to single out the provisions of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A, as being inapplicable to housing authorities and we reject reaching such a result by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Strong policy considerations support our interpretation of this statute. Traditionally, public employees have been denied the right to strike. <em>Director of the Div. of Employee Relations of the Dept. of Admin. &amp; Fin. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 162, 167-168 (1976). <em>School Comm. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Burlington Educators Ass\u2019n, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 47 (1979). General Laws c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178F &amp; 178M, as amended (St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1, repealed these sections and inserted G. L. c. 150E). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>See also Annot., 37 A.L.R. 3d 1147, 1150 (1971). The rationale for such a policy is that public employees provide essential services and serve the public purpose. Strikes by public employees are contrary to the public welfare and could under certain conditions paralyze segments of society. See Annot., <em>supra </em>at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">This rationale applies with full force to the employees of the Boston Housing Authority. They provide vital maintenance services for approximately 18,600 apartments housing low income and elderly residents in the city of Boston. In a collateral case in the Superior Court Department in Suffolk County based on the same facts as in the case before this court (see note 6, <em>supra), </em>the judge made a finding that there was a strike on November 20, 1985, which \u201cwhile it lasted only one day . . . caused considerable problems for the Authority in providing proper services for its 55,000 tenants, and said strike threatened the health and safety of these tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The authority also makes the compelling argument that, if \u00a7 9A does not apply, its employees will be the only ones for whom no statute addresses the issue of strike activity. The commission admits that under its interpretation the public housing authorities would be the only public employers within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1, whose employees would not be subject to the no-strike provision of \u00a7 9A or some other statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such an anomalous result should not be reached in the absence of a clear legislative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Because we conclude that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A, applies to employees of housing authorities, we find that the Labor Relations Commission did have jurisdiction, and we remand the case to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-17\"> General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 9A (1984 ed.), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-18\">\"(a) No public employee or employee organization shall engage in a strike, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and no public employee or employee organization shall induce, encourage or condone any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by such public employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>Whenever a strike occurs or is about to occur, the employer shall petition the commission to make an investigation.

This injunction was based upon a \u201cno strike\u201d clause in the collective bargaining agreement rather than G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9A, and is apparently still in effect. The parties do not urge us to dispose of this case on the ground of mootness, and we decline to do so. In addition, we think it appropriate that we decide the question of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction because of public interest involved.
