L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1974, c. 457, and affirmed his conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>377 Mass. 64 (1979). Our opinion noted that the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel had filed a brief that was deficient in many aspects. We proceeded, nevertheless, to consider the defendant\u2019s assignments of error, addressing each arguably meritorious point and concluding that there was no error. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>at 65-66. In April, 1985, the defendant filed a motion under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in violation of both the State and the United States Constitutions and seeking his release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge denied the motion without a hearing, pointing out that the defendant failed to demonstrate that he was harmed in any respect by appellate counsel\u2019s inadequacies. We granted the defendant\u2019s request for direct appellate review and now affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s rule 30 (a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The defendant raises no question concerning the effectiveness of his legal representation at trial. His arguments relate solely to the consequences of his counsel\u2019s failure to file an adequate appellate brief. The defendant concedes, moreover, that he has failed to demonstrate how his appellate counsel\u2019s conduct has prejudiced his rights. He argues in effect that his original appellate representation was so inadequate that it altogether denied him effective assistance of counsel and, therefore, that prejudice should be \u201cpresumed.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 692 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). We grant that the performance of the defendant\u2019s previous appellate counsel failed to meet acceptable standards. A showing of that inadequacy alone, however, is not enough to warrant granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In considering a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, this court has said that \u201cthere ought to be some showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 502 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982). <em>See Pires </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 829, 836 &amp; n.4 (1977). Although art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides broader protection than do the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>386 Mass. 165, 169-170 [1982]), we have relieved defendants of the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>proving actual prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s omissions only in cases involving an actual conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>394 Mass. 654, 656-657 (1985). This case does not involve a conflict of interest, and the defendant has made no showing of actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The defendant was not denied an appeal on the merits because of his counsel\u2019s failures. See <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387 (1985). Nor was the defendant deprived of \u201ccomplete and effective appellate review\u201d on the \u201cbare election of his appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Entsminger </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>386 U.S. 748, 752 (1967). Noting our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we reviewed the full record and reached a decision on the merits. Regrettable as the quality of his appellate brief was, the defendant was not harmed in any respect apparent on the original record or on the record of his appeal. If an appellate court has decided the appeal on its merits, a showing of prejudice is essential to success on a rule 30 motion challenging appellate counsel\u2019s performance as ineffective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for relief under rule 30 (a) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> The defendant does not ask for a new trial or for a new appeal heard with the assistance of \u201ceffective\u201d counsel. He simply seeks release from unconstitutional restraint or imprisonment, arguing that he could never obtain a fair opportunity to challenge his conviction in a State appellate proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> The level of prejudice a defendant must show for purposes of establishing a Sixth Amendment violation in these circumstances may be higher than we would require under art. 12 (see <em>Watson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 A.2d 75 [D.C. App. 1986]), but, because no prejudice at all has been shown, we need not decide the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
