In February, 1985, the intervener filed a petition with the zoning board of appeals of Spencer (board) alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 use of Sherwood Beach as a concert site was an extension of a nonconforming use in violation of Spencer\u2019s zoning by-law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing attended by Michael A. Cappuccio at which the plaintiffs were represented by counsel, the board filed with the town clerk on April 17, 1985, its decision, which stated that the plaintiff\u2019s use was an extension of a nonconforming use. On May 8, 1985, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court, appealing the board\u2019s decision. The judge granted the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that there was no genuine issue of material fact, and that the board was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was not timely filed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (1984 ed.). The judge also denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint by adding two counts. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct review and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (1984 ed.), provides in part that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals . . . may appeal to the superior court department ... by bringing an action <em>within twenty days after the decision has been filed </em>in the office of the city or town clerk\u201d (emphasis added). It is undisputed that the board filed its decision on April 17, 1985,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the plaintiffs did not file their appeal until May 8, twenty-one days after the filing of the board\u2019s decision. It is also undisputed that no notice of the decision was ever mailed to the plaintiffs. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15 (notice of the decision of the board of appeals \u201cshall be mailed forthwith\u201d to designated individuals). The plaintiffs contend that they are among the individuals enumerated in \u00a7 15 to whom the board was required to mail notice of the decision. Section 17 further provides that \u201c[t]he foregoing remedy [appeal within twenty days of the filing of the board\u2019s decision] shall be exclusive, notwithstanding any defect of procedure or of notice other than notice by publication, mailing or posting as required by this chapter, and the validity of any action shall not be qu\u00e9stioned for matters relating to defects in procedure or of notice in any other proceedings except with respect to such publication, mailing or posting and then only by a proceeding commenced within ninety days after the decision has been filed . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs primarily argue that the board\u2019s failure to mail them a copy of the decision, as they allege \u00a7 15 requires, constituted a defect in mailing under \u00a7 17, that the statute therefore provided them with the opportunity to challenge the board\u2019s action within ninety days, so that their appeal was timely. The judge ruled instead that any appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>which only challenges the factual or legal basis for a board\u2019s decision must be filed within twenty days, and that \u00a7 17\u2019s ninety-day appeal period refers to defects in notice for scheduled public hearings required by \u00a7 11, and not to the notice of decisions required by \u00a7 15. The intervener maintains that \u00a7 15 does not require that the plaintiffs be given notice of a decision by the board, and both the intervener and the board agree with the judge\u2019s construction of \u00a7 17\u2019s ninety-day extended appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We conclude that the plaintiffs as owners of the land affected are among the individuals entitled to be mailed notice of a decision under \u00a7 15. Section 15 provides that notice of the decision of the board \u201cshall be mailed forthwith to the petitioner, applicant or appellant, to the parties in interest designated in section eleven, and to every person present at the hearing who requested that notice be sent to him and stated the address to which such notice was to be sent.\u201d Although the plaintiff Michael Cappuccio\u2019s affidavit states that he appeared in person at the hearing before the board, along with his son and counsel, he does not allege that he requested notice be sent to him. The intervener is therefore correct that the plaintiffs are not people \u201cpresent . . . who requested notice\u201d under \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The intervener contends that as <em>she </em>filed the petition before the board, and as \u00a7 11 does not specifically include the property owner of the land affected by the petition before the board in the list of individuals who are \u201cinterested parties,\u201d the plaintiffs were not entitled to notice under \u00a7 15. The term \u201cpetitioner\u201d as used in \u00a7 15 would include a landowner who comes before the board directly with a petition for a variance, see \u00a7 14 (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the intervener had unsuccessfully sought enforcement of the zoning by-law by the building inspector-zoning officer of Spencer, see <em>supra </em>note 3, prior to coming before the board, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>typifies the meaning of \u201cappellant\u201d under \u00a7 15. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8 (\u201cappeal to the permit granting authority . . . may be taken by any person aggrieved by reason of his inability to obtain . . . enforcement action from any administrative officer\u201d). See c. 40A, \u00a7 14 (1) (board has power to hear and decide appeals in accordance with \u00a7 8). See also c. 40A, \u00a7 14 (4) (board empowered to hear and decide appeals from zoning administrator\u2019s decisions \u201cin accord with section 13 and this section\u201d). \u201cInterested parties\u201d under \u00a7 11 means \u201cthe petitioner, abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the petitioner . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs do not clearly fall within the meaning of \u201cpetitioner\u201d as \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 11 use the term, although it is plain that they are parties in interest according to the common understanding of that term. As the intervener herself rightly observes, it would be an \u201codd result [if] the statute requires notice to \u2018abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the petitioners, \u2019 but not to the owners of the land affected, if the owner is not himself the petitioner, applicant or appellant.\u201d The \u201cpractical as well as legal problems [which] may arise\u201d if this result is compelled by statutory language, have been commented on in another context. Cf. <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 234-235 (1981). The \u201cpetitioner\u201d is mentioned twice in relation to those who are to be mailed notice of decision under \u00a7 15. In \u00a7 15 itself, the \u201cpetitioner\u201d is explicitly listed as a person entitled to be mailed notice of the decision, and \u201cpetitioner\u201d appears again in the list of individuals comprising \u201cparties in interest\u201d under \u00a711. We understand the term \u201cpetitioner\u201d under \u00a7 11 to include the property owner of the land affected by the action of the board. The present case illustrates that this is the result logically intended by the Legislature. If the plaintiffs are included under the rubric of \u201cpetitioner\u201d in \u00a7 11, then their abutters and certain other nearby landowners are \u201cinterested parties\u201d under the section and are entitled to be sent notice of decision under \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>This is a proper and reasonable notice requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the \u201cpetitioner\u201d in \u00a7 11 meant only an appellant, such as the intervener, who sought enforcement of the zoning ordinance, \u00a7 ll\u2019s definition of \u201cparties in interest\u201d would be nonsensical. Abutters of the <em>enforcement seeker </em>would be entitled to be mailed notice under \u00a7 15, but not the owner or abutters of the land in question. Construing \u201cpetitioner\u201d in \u00a7 11 as we do, we avoid this absurd result. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982); <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1982), citing <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We next turn to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the board\u2019s failure to mail them notice of the decision constituted a defect of notice under \u00a7 17, and entitled them to a ninety-day appeal period. Compare <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, </em>394 Mass. 663, 668-670 (1985). Section 17 provides that \u201cthe <em>validity </em>of <em>any action </em>shall not be questioned <em>for matters </em>relating to defects <em>... of notice </em>in any other proceedings <em>except </em>with respect to . . . publication, mailing and posting ... by a proceeding commenced within ninety days after the decision has been filed . . . but the parties shall have all rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases\u201d (emphasis added). The plain meaning of this language, see <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973), is that the ninety-day appeal period applies to actions alleging the invalidity of any action by the board due to certain defects in procedure or notice. For cases holding that certain defects in notice had deprived a board of appeals of jurisdiction to act, see, e.g., <em>Planning Bd. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Peabody, </em>358 Mass. 81, 83 (1970); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Great Barrington, </em>352 Mass. 523, 526 (1967); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>351 Mass. 410, 414 (1966); <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>273 Mass. 97, 104 (1930); <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>268 Mass. 416, 418-419 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Prior to the insertion, by St. 1975, c. 808, of the language providing for a ninety-day appeal period to challenge the validity of board decisions on the basis of defective notice, the cognate provision to the current c. 40A, \u00a7 17, was G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as added by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2. Section 21 simply provided for a fifteen-day appeal period and that the \u201cforegoing remedy shall be exclusive, but the parties shall have all rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases.\u201d This court has invalidated actions of a board or similar body as without jurisdiction because the board failed to comply with certain notice requirements under c. 40A. The intervener argues that the ninety-day appeal period based on defects in procedure or notice was intended to limit such a challenge to the board\u2019s actions which previously had been subject to attack indefinitely. See <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Great Barrington, supra; Brady </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westport, </em>348 Mass. 515, 518-521 (1965). The legislativ\u00e9 history of St. 1975, c. 808, demonstrates that the bill which initially proposed to add language similar to the present \u00a7 17 regarding challenges to board actions based on alleged defects in procedure or notice was entitled \u201cAn Act <em>limiting </em>the time to question board of appeals decisions by reason of defective notice or procedure\u201d (emphasis added). 1974 House Doc. No. 773. Much of this bill\u2019s language was ultimately incorporated into the final act. We agree with the intervener that the foregoing suggests that the addition of the ninety-day appeal period language to the statute was not to enlarge the time for filing an appeal on the merits, but was intended to limit the time for filing a challenge to an action of a board on the ground that a defect in procedure or notice had deprived the board of jurisdiction over the matter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The board and intervener argue that, in addition to being restricted to appeals challenging the validity of a board\u2019s action due to defective notice, the ninety-day appeal period in \u00a7 17 applies only to defects of procedure or notice \u201cby publication, mailing or posting\u201d for <em>public hearings </em>required by the first paragraph of c. 40A, \u00a7 11, and not to defects of notice in the mailing of the decision required by c. 40A, \u00a7 15. See <em>Massachusetts Bread Co. </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1053, 1054 (1982). The judge so ruled and we agree. The clause concerning the ninety-day appeal period under \u00a7 17 refers to defects of notice by \u201cpublication, mailing or posting as required by this chapter,\u201d and to \u201csuch publication, mailing or posting.\u201d The words \u201cpublication, mailing or posting\u201d are grouped as a unit in the clause. The first paragraph of \u00a7 11 regarding the notice to be given in \u201call cases where notice of a public hearing is required\u201d is the only place in the chapter which groups together all three methods of notice: by publication, mailing or posting. Consequently, it is to defects in notice for public hearings under \u00a7 11 to which \u00a7 17 refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that the board\u2019s decision \u201cis contrary to law, and unsupported in fact\u201d and is \u201cunreasonable and arbitrary.\u201d As their appeal concerns substantive claims and does not concern any defect in the notice for the public hearing, the plaintiffs were required under \u00a7 17 to bring the instant action within twenty days of the filing of the board\u2019s decision with the town clerk. That the plaintiffs failed to bring their appeal within this period is uncontested and the Superior Court judge was therefore without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. See <em>O\u2019Bienes </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lynn, </em>397 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Mass. 555, 558 (1986), and cases cited. Timely commencement of the appeal in the Superior Court is a condition of maintaining it, \u201ca condition sine qua non,\u201d and is a requirement this court has \u201cpoliced in the strongest way.\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Carver, </em>369 Mass. 804, 808, 811 (1976). See <em>Del Grosso </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Revere, </em>330 Mass. 29, 32-33 (1953).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The plaintiffs contend that they have been deprived of \u201ctheir statutorily created right to appeal from a decision by an administrative body concerning their property, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts [Declaration of Rights],\u201d since the defendant board never mailed the notice of the decision. We see no merit in the argument that the plainiffs have been denied procedural due process of law by our interpretation of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a711, 15, 17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[N]otice reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections,\u201d is an \u201celementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality.\u201d <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>U.S. 306, 314 (1950). <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 795 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, 369 </em>Mass. 62, 68-69 (1975), and authorities collected (adequacy of notice for due process purposes is dependent on whether form of notice provided is reasonably calculated to give actual notice of proceedings and an opportunity to be heard). See also <em>Lotto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 369 </em>Mass. 775, 779 (1976). The plaintiffs allege no lack of notice regarding the hearing before the board concerning their property. In fact, they were represented at the hearing by counsel, plaintiff Michael Cappuccio was present, and the plaintiffs presented a witness (their son). The plaintiffs were clearly aware of the \u201cpending\u201d action, and presented their objections. Moreover, the plaintiffs were bound to take notice of the pertinent statutory requirements, such as the relevant appeal period under \u00a7 17, and the period under \u00a7 15 in which a board must make its decision. See <em>O\u2019Bienes </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lynn, supra </em>at 558-559. Under these circumstances, it is not a denial of due process to impose upon the plaintiffs the responsibility to inquire periodically of the town clerk whether the board\u2019s decision has been filed. Due process is \u201cflexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972). <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976). <em>See Haverhill Manor, Inc: v. Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>368 Mass. 15, 24, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 929 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs challenge the judge\u2019s denial of their motion to file an amended complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), following his allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. There was no error. By their amended complaint, the plaintiffs attempted to add two claims, counts II and III. The proposed count II sought a declaration under G. L. c. 231A of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the board\u2019s decision. The proposed count alleged that eight acres of their land had been used continuously for concerts for many years and that the board \u201cdid not and could not rule that the prior use of [this parcel for concerts] was unlawful or . . . has become unlawful.\u201d It stated that the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>based its decision on a finding that fifteen acres and a new access road had been cleared for future concerts. The plaintiffs argue that they merely seek \u201ca construction of the meaning of the decision\u201d to discover if it applies to the entire property or only the fifteen-acre parcel. Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 protestations to the contrary, count II seeks to challenge the substantive basis of the board\u2019s decision. The form of count II, as a declaratory judgment action, does not save it from being \u201can appeal within the meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17\u201d attacking the decision on nonprocedural grounds. Such a claim must fail for the same reason as the initial complaint. See <em>Iodice </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>397 Mass. 329, 334 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The proposed count HI also seeks a declaratory judgment that the board\u2019s decision \u201cis null and void.\u201d It alleges that, on June 18, 1984, well before the filing of the petition, a member of the board told the Spencer selectmen that she felt the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 land for concerts \u201cwas an extension of a non-conforming use.\u201d This statement allegedly evinces this board member\u2019s \u201cpredisposition\u201d in the zoning matter \u201cso that her decision was not fair and impartial as required by\u201d art. 29 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. It is alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cdid not become [aware] of this bias . . . until <em>sometime after\u201d </em>the board filed its decision. Nothing is said concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of this alleged bias and no allegation is made that this information was not acquired until after the appeal period had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was properly dismissed for untimely filing, and the two proposed counts could not alleviate this defect and save the plaintiffs\u2019 case. Compare <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Arlington, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1007 (1985). Although rule 15 (a) provides that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), broad discretion remains with the judge. Cf. <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 291-292 (1977). We perceive no abuse of discretion in the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> Following oral argument before this court, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum and submissions, and expressed their belief that the board had jurisdiction to render its decision in the instant case. In her appeal to the board, the intervener alleges that she previously filed a similar petition with the building inspector/zoning officer of Spencer, requesting enforcement of the town\u2019s zoning by-law. The building inspector declined to rule on the matter due to a potential conflict of interest. These unchallenged facts provide the basis for the board\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> By their counsel, the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument before this court that the board\u2019s decision was filed on April 17, 1985, although paragraph 19 of their complaint alleges that the decision was in fact filed on April 18 and that the plaintiffs were \u201cimproperly misl[ed]\u201d to believe that April 18 was the filing date. The plaintiffs do not argue this in their brief and appear to have abandoned this contention on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> An individual who seeks a special permit upon which the board is empowered to act, is an \u201capplicant\u201d under \u00a7 15. See c. 40A, \u00a7 14 (2) (board is empowered to hear and decide <em>applications </em>for special permits). So probably is an individual seeking a permit under \u00a7 6 to extend a nonconforming use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-5\"> The individual who petitions for a zoning variance is a \u201cpetitioner\u201d under \u00a7 15, and also under \u00a7 11, so that abutters to the site for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>variance is proposed, and certain other landowners in proximity, are \u201cparties in interest\u201d under \u00a7 11. This is a traditional and common sense definition of \u201cparties in interest,\u201d and it is also logical that the Legislature would presume that they should be mailed notice of the decision under \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\"> Under our reading of \u00a7 11, the petitioner for a variance is, under \u00a7 15, of course also entitled to notice of the public hearing concerning his land as one of the \u201cparties in interest.\u201d This result is eminently sensible if not mandated by constitutional considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> The plaintiffs rely on the clause concluding the provision of a ninety-day appeal period in \u00a7 17, <em>\u201cbut </em>the parties shall have <em>all rights of appeal </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>exception as in other equity cases,\u201d to support their contention that the extended period applies to appeals on the merits as well as those alleging lack of jurisdiction due to defective notice. A consideration of the clause in context reveals that the questioned language preserves the rights of parties in a trial court action. The clause immediately follows an explication of \u00a7 17\u2019s very specific procedures for a \u201cperson aggrieved by a decision of the board\u201d to follow in order to appeal a decision or action of the board, and of the two applicable time limitation periods. <em>\u201c[B]ut\u201d </em>once an appeal to a trial court is taken, the <em>\u201cparties\u201d then </em>have \u201call rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> The plaintiffs do not argue that there is a genuine issue of material fact. In view of our holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was properly dismissed as unseasonably filed, and since the fact that they were not mailed a copy of the decision did not relieve the plaintiffs of the twenty-day appeal period, we agree with the judge that there was no genuine issue of material fact. The facts necessary to our holding are uncontested; the date the decision was filed with the clerk; the date the plaintiffs filed their appeal; and that a copy of the decision was never sent to the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> The board and intervener appear to concede that the plaintiffs possess a property interest in the statutory right to appeal, sufficient to invoke the protection of the due process clauses. Neither the board nor the intervener has put before us argument on the issue. We will assume the plaintiffs have a protectable property interest in the right to appeal. See <em>Cantrone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>404 F. Supp. 765, 770 (D. Mass. 1975), citing <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 572-573 (1975). See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Granby, </em>387 Mass. 117, 119-120 (1982). The plaintiffs certainly have a legally protected property interest in their land, such that an action by the board regarding the use of that land would significantly affect their property. See <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 798 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
