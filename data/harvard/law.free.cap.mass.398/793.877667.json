The town filed a civil action in the nature of certiorari<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk. After hearing, a single justice reserved and reported the case without decision. Essentially, the town complains that the Attorney General exceeded his authority and usurped the municipal legislative power in his disapproval of the by-law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The case is before us on a statement of agreed facts which are summarized as follows. On October 19,1981, town meeting members, at an adjourned session of the town\u2019s special town meeting, voted, under art. 52 of the warrant, to adopt a by-law prohibiting the discharge of certain firearms, with limited exceptions. We set out the by-law in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32 (1984 ed.), the town clerk forwarded an attested copy of the vote under art. 52 to the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>On February 12, 1982, the Attorney General disapproved the by-law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a letter accompanying the disapproval, the Attorney General, acting through an assistant attorney general, explained that the by-law would bar any person issued a hunting license in Massachusetts from exercising that license by means of any gun, fowling piece, or other firearm. The assistant attorney general further explained that \u201c [i]f duplicated in other communities [Article 52] would deprive the Commonwealth of its control over the hunting of wild and stocked animals and game by firearms for the common welfare.\u201d The letter concluded by reasoning that, while \u201c[r]estrictions on the discharge of firearms may be reasonable in densely populated urban areas[, i]n rural areas where hunting is a traditional pursuit serious justification for restrictions would be required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The town claims that the by-law is consistent with both State and local law and that the Attorney General exceeded his authority by mling that it is not. In contrast to the Attorney General\u2019s broad general power to prosecute actions which he believes are in the interest of the Commonwealth, <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 359 (1977), the Attorney General\u2019s power to disapprove town by-laws is limited. The Attorney General may disapprove a by-law only if it violates State substantive or procedural law. See <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>336 Mass. 17, 24 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The Attorney General is guided in the exercise of his limited power of disapproval by the same principles that guide us. See <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 24-25. It is fundamental that every presumption is to be made in favor of the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>of municipal by-laws. See <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 49 (1979). See also <em>Crall v. Leominster, </em>362 Mass. 95, 101-102 (1972); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Carlisle, 336 </em>Mass. 147, 148 (1957). The Massachusetts Constitution reaffirms the \u201ccustomary and traditional liberties of the people with respect to the conduct of their local government. . . .\u201d Art. 2, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Constitution of Massachusetts (Home Rule Amendment), as amended by art. 89. In the exercise of this right to local government, towns have the power to pass by-laws for the purpose of preserving peace and order. G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21 (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The town exceeds its power only when it passes a by-law inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the Commonwealth. See Home Rule Amendment, \u00a7 6. G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13 (1984 ed.) (Home Rule Procedures Act).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Sqq Marshfield Family Skateland, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>389 Mass. 436, 440-441, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 987 (1983). To determine whether a by-law is inconsistent with any general law within the meaning of \u00a7 6 of the Home Rule Amendment and \u00a7 13 of the Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Rule Procedures Act, the Attorney General must apply the same process of ascertaining legislative intent as that applied by this court in Federal preemption cases and in our cases involving inconsistent local ordinances. \u201cThe legislative intent to preclude local action must be clear.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155 (1973). If such intent is not clear, that intent may be inferred if legislation deals with a subject comprehensively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A local enactment must prevent the achievement of a clearly identifiable purpose of State legislation in order to be struck down as inconsistent with that State legislation. <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985). Merely \u201c[t]he existence of legislation on a subject ... is not necessarily a bar to the enactment of local ordinances and by-laws exercising powers or functions with respect to the same subject. If the State legislative purpose can be achieved in the face of a local ordinance or by-law on the same subject, the local ordinance or by-law is not inconsistent with the State legislation.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The Attorney General asserts that the by-law before us is inconsistent with and preempted by State statutes regarding hunting. See G. L. c. 131 (1984 ed.). The Attorney General does not point to any section of G. L. c. 131 which is inconsistent with the by-law. Indeed, the Attorney General has approved similar by-laws in twenty-eight localities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chapter 131 outlines, as the Attorney General notes, carefully guarded conditions by which one may hunt in the Commonwealth safely, provisions by which one is licensed, and provisions designed to preserve and maintain the wildlife and natural resources of the Commonwealth. While hunting is permissible in this Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>monwealth, there is no indication in c. 131 that a municipality cannot prohibit the use of firearms. Some of c. 131\u2019s guidelines do concern the safe use of certain firearms, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 58, 60-64, 66-70, but the Amherst by-law in no way frustrates those sections. \u201cThe mere existence of statutory provision for some matters within the purview of the by-law will not render [the by-law] invalid as repugnant to law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boronas, </em>285 Mass. 321, 323 (1934). See <em>John Donnelly &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd., </em>369 Mass. 206, 212 (1975); <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>367 Mass. 368, 372 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">As we read the letter explaining the Attorney General\u2019s disapproval, he based his decision on his assumption<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that Amherst is a rural town and that, as a rural town, it cannot restrict the discharge of firearms. The General Court, of course, may make a distinction between urban and rural communities, but it has not done so in c. 131. The Attorney General is not free to make a distinction which the Legislature has not made. It is for the Legislature, not the executive branch, to determine legislative policy. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 827, 833 (1978); <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 24. The Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ney General must \u201cbe faithful to the words of the statute . . . as written, and an event or contingency for which no provision has been made does not justify judicial [or Attorney General] legislation.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd., </em>397 Mass. 734, 740 (1986). Neither we nor the Attorney General may comment on the wisdom of the town\u2019s by-law. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 189 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Because the only reasons we may consider in examining the validity of the Attorney General\u2019s disapproval of a by-law are those included in his letter of disaproval, see <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>336 Mass. 17, 21 (1957), the Attorney General\u2019s disapproval of the town\u2019s by-law is quashed and judgment shall enter declaring that the by-law was lawfully adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\"> The Attorney General acted pursuant to G.

If the attorney general disapprove^] a by-law he shall give notice to the town clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the town in which the by-law was adopted of his disapproval, with his reasons therefor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\"> General Laws c. 249, \u00a7 4 (1984 ed.), establishes that \u201c[a] civil action in the nature of certiorari to correct errors in proceedings which are not according to the course of the common law, which proceedings are not otherwise reviewable by motion or by appeal, may be brought in the supreme judicial or superio'r'court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> The by-law adopted by the town provides: \u201cNo person shall fire or discharge any gun, fowling piece or other firearm in the Town of Amherst; but to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, the provisions of this section shall not apply to (A) the discharge of shotguns or air-guns, or (B) the discharge of firearms</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">1. in the lawful defense of the person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">2. for the humane dispatch of injured animals, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">3. by any person lawfully on a target, trap or skeet range established for such purposes, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">4. by any duly authorized peace officer acting in the proper performance of duty, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">5. by any duly authorized military personnel participating in scheduled military exercises, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">6. by any person using blank cartridges in theatrical performances or sporting events, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-15\">7. by an owner or tenant of land (or if authorized by either, any member of the immediate family or person permanently employed by such owner or tenant) but only upon such land and for the limited purposes of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>a) shooting a bird or other animal found to be damaging or posing the imminent threat of damage to the property of such person or persons, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">b) shooting domestic animals raised as livestock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">There shall be a penalty for breach hereof not exceeding $300. for each offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\"> The record is unclear as to the date on which the town clerk submitted the by-law to the Attorney General for approval.

Within the town\u2019s boundaries are the University of Massachusetts, Amherst College, and Hampshire College. Neither this court nor the Attorney General may conclude if those demographic statistics classify the town as urban or rural. The town suggests that the Attorney General classified Amherst as \u201crural\u201d because \u201c[w]ith exceptions for cities such as Springfield and Pittsfield, it is tempting [for those in eastern Massachusetts] to lump the western part of the Commonwealth together under the general classification of \u2018rural.\u2019 \u201d The record does not disclose whether towns such as Ashland, Burlington, Canton, Lynnfield, and Somerset are more or less rural than the town of Amherst.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
