Mulhem, seeks to recover attorney\u2019s fees and expenses allegedly owed him by the defendant, Martin J. Roach, as a consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>cessful representation of the defendant in two land damage actions against the Newton Redevelopment Authority (NRA). Those actions were tried twice in the Superior Court, first before a judge without a jury, and second before a jury. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 983, \u00a7 1. Damages assessed at the nonjury trial were $559,481. The jury trial resulted in damages for Roach in the amount of $1,186,101. The Appeals Court affirmed, <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redevelopment Auth., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 618 (1979), as did this court. <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redevelopment Auth., </em>381 Mass. 135 (1980). The plaintiff wrote both appellate briefs, but did not argue the appeals. In August, 1980, the plaintiff commenced this action in the Superior Court seeking the award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. A judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $350,000 plus interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roach appealed, and the Appeals Court reversed, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 322 (1985), holding that the judge gave inadequate consideration to the fact that the fee was not to be set on a contingent basis and that the plaintiff had not established the time spent by him on the cases. The Appeals Court also held that the judge\u2019s exclusion of the NRA\u2019s counsel\u2019s testimony of their time charges in the eminent domain matters was reversible error. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for further appellate review, and we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact. The plaintiff is an attorney who has been practicing law in Massachusetts since 1956.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He has served as a commissioner of real property for the city of Boston and as general attorney for the Boston Housing Authority (BHA). The plaintiff possesses high standing in the Bar as an eminent domain attorney and is an expert in tax abatement cases in which the fair market value of real property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>is at issue. Although he had represented plaintiffs in only four eminent domain cases, he has \u201crepresented hundreds of defendants in similar cases ....\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The defendant owned land in Newton at the intersection of Route 128 and Washington Street which was zoned for residential use. He had acquired the land in three separate purchases in 1957, 1964, and 1965. In 1969, the NRA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> took one part of the land for commercial use in conjunction with a State assisted funding plan. In 1970, the NRA took the remaining front portion of the defendant\u2019s land as part of a Federally funded program. The NRA awarded the defendant a pro tanto amount of $214,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From the time of the takings, until December, 1975, the defendant\u2019s strategy had been to try to settle the cases favorably himself, with little use of lawyers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitions for assessment of damages were filed in the Superior Court in 1971 and 1972,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but very little else had been done to ready the cases for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The plaintiff and the defendant had been friends for years and had many offhand discussions about the defendant\u2019s cases. On December 31, 1975, as the plaintiff was leaving a country club, the defendant informed him that his eminent domain cases were on for trial the following Monday, January 5, 1976, and asked the plaintiff to represent him at trial. The plaintiff agreed. The defendant stated that he had not yet retained an appraiser and the plaintiff replied that he would try to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>a continuance. It was agreed that they would discuss the fee at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The plaintiff appeared in court on January 5, established that he had just been retained and had not yet secured appraisers, and made what he expected to be a routine motion for a continuance. He was confronted with the fact that the file had been marked \u201cno further continuances\u201d by a prior judge (first judge), and the attorneys for the NRA objected to the continuance. The plaintiff then discovered that when the cases had first been called for trial in November, 1975, the defendant had appeared pro se, having discharged the attorney representing him at that time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first judge had told the defendant to get an attorney and an appraiser, and had written him a letter to that effect. Only after the plaintiff agreed to file a stipulation on behalf of the defendant waiving a certain amount of interest and providing some compensation for the NRA\u2019s counsel, did the first judge reluctantly agree to grant the continuance. It was imperative that the plaintiff secure the continuance, as there was no appraiser to testify, virtually no trial preparation had been completed, and it was likely that if the cases were tried on January 5, judgment would only be for the pro tanto amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">After receiving the necessary continuance, the plaintiff began to prepare for trial. He retained appraisers, worked with them and examined \u201cin minute detail\u201d the NRA\u2019s possible approach to the appraisal questions. Much of the trial preparation occurred at the defendant\u2019s son\u2019s home and entailed going through volumes of records and papers that the son kept in his cellar. Many of the documents with which the defendant provided the plaintiff were of little value. Although the plaintiff was assisted by the defendant, the defendant\u2019s son, and his granddaughter, the plaintiff was always in charge of and in control of the cases. The legal and factual analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims and of the NRA\u2019s defenses were the plaintiff\u2019s work product. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The bench trial lasted five days and, as the defendant was not satisfied with the award, a jury trial was claimed. This trial lasted seven days and the jury verdict doubled the judgment of the bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In April, before the appeal was to be argued before the Appeals Court, the defendant asked the plaintiff for a bill. The plaintiff sent the defendant a bill which was equivalent to one-third of the defendant\u2019s recovery. On April 14, the defendant sent the plaintiff a letter disputing the bill, and discharged him. The defendant then retained Mr. Robert Cohen to represent him in the appeals of the eminent domain cases. As Mr. Cohen was naturally unfamiliar with the cases, he relied on the plaintiff\u2019s brief for the Appeals Court appeal. Although discharged by the defendant, the plaintiff cooperated \u201cin every way possible\u201d with Mr. Cohen in preparing the cases for appeal. After the Appeals Court affirmed and the NRA requested further appellate review of this court, the plaintiff again prepared the brief \u201cwhich took three or four days\u201d and mailed it to Mr. Cohen from Florida. Mr. Cohen had not planned to write a new brief for this appeal and intended to simply rely on the Appeals Court brief, but, on the plaintiff\u2019s advice, did not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mr. Cohen relied on the plaintiff\u2019s second brief at argument before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">There was an understanding between the plaintiff and the defendant as friends that the plaintiff would charge a reasonable and fair fee for his services. The plaintiff\u2019s bill was \u201cmerely an expression of [the plaintiff\u2019s] view after two trials and after preparation of the appeals brief that a fair and reasonable fee would be in the amount that did not exceed the usual common fee of [one third] the net amount plus the interest that had accrued.\u201d At no time did the plaintiff keep a record of the time spent in preparation of trial or the appeals. He did, however, \u201cspend a great deal of time analyzing the facts in the cases [and] all of the documents presented to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Finally, the judge found that, on the evidence, a reasonable fee for the plaintiff\u2019s services, on a quantum meruit basis, is $350,000, plus interest from the date of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The plaintiff maintains that the judge properly considered the appropriate factors in determining his fee and that his findings are supported in the evidence. The defendant argues that many of the judge\u2019s findings relating to the determination of a reasonable fee for the plaintiff\u2019s legal services were clearly erroneous. In particular, he alleges that the judge failed to consider the time actually expended by the plaintiff and erroneously failed to admit evidence of the NRA\u2019s counsel\u2019s time charges. He also challenges the judge\u2019s finding that the eminent domain cases were complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">1. \u201cFindings of fact [by a trial judge sitting without a jury] shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). That the instant case concerns the propriety of a judge\u2019s award of an attorney\u2019s fee has no special bearing on the standard of review. The question of what is fair and reasonable compensation for legal services rendered is one of fact for a trial judge to decide. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 263-264 (1977), and cases cited. <em>Guenard v. Burke, </em>387 Mass. 802, 808 (1982). See <em>Serlin </em>v. <em>Rotman, </em>371 Mass. 449, 451 (1976) (where evidence supported the judge\u2019s conclusions as to fair and reasonable value of attorney\u2019s legal services, the fact \u201c[t]hat this court might have reached a different conclusion, less favorable to [the attorney, was] not relevant argument\u201d). Cf. <em>Meghreblian </em>v. <em>Meghreblian, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1021, 1023-1024 (1982). Accordingly, unless our review of the record leaves this court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 160 (1977), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948), or unless the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the relevant legal standards, we must affirm. See <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>391 Mass. 785, 792-793 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>2. The judge found, and the plaintiff concedes, that no written contingent fee agreement was entered into by the plaintiff and the defendant. See S.J.C. Rule 3:05, as appearing in 382 Mass. 762 (1981); S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106, as appearing in 382 Mass. 772 (1981). See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Southgate Dev. Corp., </em>379 Mass. 523, 524-525 (1980); <em>Serlin </em>v. <em>Rotman, supra </em>at 450 n.2. The absence of a valid contingent fee agreement does not prevent an attorney from recovering the fair value of his or her services. See <em>Guenard </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>at 806-808; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Southgate Dev. Corp., supra </em>at 525-526. See also <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 264 (1977). Moreover, in the instant case, the judge found that the parties, as friends, actually entered into an implied agreement that the plaintiff\u2019s charge would be reasonable and fair,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the details of his fee would be \u201cworked out at a later date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In determining what is a fair and reasonable charge to be made by an attorney for his or her services, \u201cmany considerations are pertinent, including the ability and reputation of the attorney, the demand for his services by others, the amount and importance of the matter involved, the time spent, the prices usually charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same neighborhood, the amount of money or the value of the property affected by controversy, and the results secured.\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>284 Mass. 563, 569 (1933). See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106 (B), as appearing in 382 Mass. 772 (1981). See also <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, supra </em>at 265 (factors listed in rule are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to those contained in <em>Cummings, supra). </em>Not one of the factors is necessarily decisive. \u201cThe weight to be given to each of them will vary according to the nature of the services rendered in the particular instance under examination.\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Old Colony Trust Co., </em>313 Mass. 329, 335 (1943). See <em>Cummings, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">3. We now review the judge\u2019s findings in light of the <em>Cummings </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">a. <em>Ability and reputation. </em>The judge was warranted in finding that the plaintiff \u201cbrought excellent and special skills\u201d to these cases and that he was highly regarded by the Bar as an eminent domain attorney. The evidence included testimony by an attorney who was qualified as an expert in eminent domain cases, that he had tried many cases against the plaintiff, that the plaintiff was \u201can outstanding trial lawyer . . . perhaps the best trial lawyer\u201d the Boston authority had.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">b. <em>Demand for services. </em>Throughout the plaintiff\u2019s representation of the defendant, the plaintiff was a full-time employee of the BHA authorized to accept \u201coutside cases.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact of his full-time employment clearly served to limit the amount of such outside work he could reasonably manage. Since neither the judge nor the parties put particular emphasis on this factor no further analysis on our part is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">c. <em>Importance and difficulty of matter. </em>The judge considered \u201cthe importance of the matter,\u201d or, in the language of DR 2-106 (B)(1), the \u201cnovelty and difficulty of the questions involved.\u201d He found that the issues in the eminent domain cases were \u201cvery complex,\u201d and the takings were \u201chighly unusual,\u201d requiring the exercise of great skill and ability on the plaintiff\u2019s part. This finding was not clearly erroneous. It is supported by supplementary findings concerning the method used to establish a reasonable probability of rezoning to a commercial use. See <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redevelopment Auth., </em>381 Mass. 135, 136-137, 138-139 (1980), for discussion of relevant legal principles confronting the plaintiff in his preparation of the defendant\u2019s cases. The judge also made detailed findings on the method used by the plaintiff to prove the availability of access necessary to show the land\u2019s adaptability for commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>On our review of the record, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s assessment of the difficulty of the cases was plainly wrong. The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s finding that the cases were complex on the ground that the judge did not give due consideration to the assistance he received from the defendant\u2019s son. There is conflicting evidence as to the degree and nature of the son\u2019s contribution. The judge clearly considered the son\u2019s efforts, but found that, although the plaintiff was assisted by the son, as well as the defendant and the defendant\u2019s granddaughter, the \u201cplaintiff was always in charge and control of the case\u201d and that the legal and factual analyses of the defendant\u2019s claims and of the NRA\u2019s defenses were the. plaintiff\u2019s work product. He found that although the son had provided the plaintiff with a great many documents, some were of value to the defendant\u2019s case, \u201cbut much of it was not.\u201d On the evidence, the judge\u2019s findings were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">d. <em>Time spent. </em>The judge found that the plaintiff \u201cdid spend a great deal of time\u201d analyzing the facts, documents (which he found to be voluminous), and law, and in cooperating with his successor counsel. He also found that the plaintiff kept no written time records. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s consideration of this factor was inadequate and claims that the amount of time expended by the attorney is \u201cthe lodestar for determining a fair and reasonable legal fee.\u201d While we agree that the time expended by the plaintiff is a weaker aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge did take into account the time spent by the plaintiff. He found that almost no preparation had been done on the defendant\u2019s eminent domain cases prior to the plaintiff\u2019s first appearance on the defendant\u2019s behalf. In the six years which intervened between the takings and the ultimate trial in 1975, no discovery had been undertaken. From the record,, it is apparent that although the plaintiff was familiar with the defendant\u2019s cases, the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had \u201cnothing more than general information\u201d from the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ant was supported. The judge heard extensive testimony, consisting of a detailed review of what the plaintiff did, or failed to do, by way of pretrial preparation, examination at both Superior Court trials, and the extent of his involvement in the appeals of the defendant\u2019s cases. Such testimony, including that which was elicited during intensive cross-examinations of the plaintiff, proved the lion\u2019s share of the oral evidence introduced at the trial of the instant case. Many of the judge\u2019s findings reflect a review of this testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s consideration of the specifics of an attorney\u2019s actions in the course of his or her representation of a client necessarily entails perception of the probable time involved to perform those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, this court has never deemed time spent by an attorney to be the \u201clodestar\u201d in determining a fair and reasonable fee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Cummings, supra </em>at 569, we cautioned that \u201c[njeither the time spent nor any other single factor is necessarily decisive of what is to be considered as a fair and reasonable charge for [an attorney\u2019s] services.\u201d In that case, the attorney himself admitted that \u201che might have spent altogether twelve or fifteen hours\u201d on the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 567. The court sustained the award of $5,300 for the attorney\u2019s services, which essentially consisted of collecting a debt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>approximately $102,000. In <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, supra </em>at 267, this court approved a fee of $760,000 in a case involving a Federal income tax matter. The law firm had spent about 2,000 hours on the case, and the firm\u2019s total \u201cbillable time charges\u201d were approximately $102,000. <em>Id. </em>at 261-262. The client argued that \u201c[t]ime charges, when they are substantial, should be the starting point and the touchstone for determining a fair and reasonable legal fee.\u201d The court squarely rejected this reasoning, holding that it was \u201cdirectly contrary to <em>Cummings, \u2019\u2019 </em>and added that it did not perceive what considerations would make the substantiality of time charges significant. The court referred to \u201cother cases in which the charges were not important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, and cases cited. Time expended by an attorney, then, is but one of the many factors for a judge to consider in determining a fair and reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The exclusion of testimony concerning the fee charged by counsel for the NRA and the amount of time his firm spent in opposing the defendant\u2019s eminent domain cases was not reversible error. We observe that the plaintiff represented the party with the burden of proof, and came into the litigation after the defendant had permitted the cases to lie dormant for many years. In addition, the plaintiff was forced to prove a substantial portion of his cases using NRA\u2019s witnesses. Although counsel on both sides of the eminent domain litigation confronted similar facts and legal issues, their positions and preparation time were not necessarily comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">An offer of proof showed that the NRA was billed $23,105 for approximately 414 hours of time. Even if the time spent by the NRA counsel could be termed a fair approximation of the plaintiff\u2019s time, concerns of fairness and reasonableness do not mandate that the plaintiff\u2019s fee be predicated on an hourly charge. As stated earlier, an attorney\u2019s fee may well exceed an amount calculated by multiplying the hours of time billed by an hourly rate, and yet remain within the bounds of reasonableness. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Brink, supra. </em>Compare note 13, <em>supra. </em>The amount the NRA was billed for legal services is hardly relevant. Counsel was under contract to the NRA to charge at fixed hourly rates, presumably on a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tial number of cases. While evidence of opposing counsel\u2019s time charges may be admissible in many circumstances to assist a reconstruction of an attorney\u2019s time, see <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 577 n.5 (1980), <em>S.C. </em>384 Mass. 803 (1981), exclusion of such testimony was not error in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">e. <em>Prices charged for similar services in a similar area. </em>The judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s bill was an expression of the plaintiff\u2019s view that, after two trials and preparation of the brief for the Appeals Court, a fair and reasonable fee \u201cwould be in the amount that did not exceed the usual common fee of 1/3 the net amount plus the interest that had accrued through April 11, 1979.\u201d The judge also found the charge \u201cnot illegal or excessive\u201d but \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s expert, Mr. Masterman, testified that, among eminent domain lawyers, the ordinary and usual fee in the Greater Boston area that would be charged in a case such as the one the plaintiff represented the defendant in was \u201can amount. . . equal to no less than twenty-five percent to one-third of all sums recovered above the pro tanto, including interest,\u201d and that where the representation involved two Superior Court trials and two \u201cappellate procedures,\u201d the amount would be \u201c[o]ne-third of all sums recovered above the pro tanto including interest.\u201d Mr. Masterman did testify that he himself had only rarely undertaken representation of a client in an eminent domain proceeding without a written contingent fee agreement. However, when he was asked if his \u201copinion as to the ordinary and usual fee in the Greater Boston Area in a case such as this [would] turn in any way [on] whether there was a contingent fee agreement or not,\u201d Mr. Masterman replied, \u201cNo, it would not.\u201d Mr. Masterman is an established, active, and experienced attorney who had tried \u201cmaybe a thousand\u201d eminent domain cases and who practices in the relevant geographic area. His testimony concerning the usual fees charged was based on his knowledge of the practice of local practitioners, of which, his background suggests, he was quite familiar. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony on this subject was substantially similar to Mr. Masterman\u2019s. There was no conflicting testimony, and we think the judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>f. <em>Amount involved or value of property affected by controversy, and results secured. </em>The judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s efforts on behalf of the defendant \u201ccreated an extraordinary result.\u201d Mr. Masterman testified that the result obtained by the plaintiff was \u201calmost miraculous\u201d and stated that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen. In all the hundreds of cases that I know about, to exceed the judge\u2019s finding by a little bit happens . . . [b]ut to double it [in the jury trial] is unbelievable.\u201d In fact, Mr. Masterman stated that normally a result of more than the pro tanto award is \u201csmashing,\u201d and that even with a $1,300,000 appraisal, to double the $214,000 pro tanto at the bench trial was \u201ca great result.\u201d The judge was justified in his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">4. The determination of a fair and reasonable attorney\u2019s fee requires an exercise of judgment involving the application of many diverse factors. The findings of a trial judge in these matters is entitled to considerable respect on review, and will not lightly be disregarded. See <em>McInerney </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound Ass\u2019n, </em>359 Mass. 339, 352 (1971); <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1982); <em>Meghreblian </em>v. <em>Meghreblian, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1021, 1023-1024 (1982), and cases cited. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and decide that the judge\u2019s consideration of the relevant factors was appropriate. As stated earlier, the weight given each factor will vary with the circumstances in each case. The judge found that the plaintiff was skilled and had great standing as an eminent domain attorney; the matter was complex; a large amount of money was involved; and a significant result was obtained. He also considered the time constraints imposed by the defendant, see S.J.C.

He then became an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County and worked in this capacity for \u201ceight or nine years.\u201d Later, he practiced with the firm of Mulhem &amp; Mulhem in Boston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> The NRA was subsequently dissolved in 1978 and was succeeded by the Newton Community Development Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 8A (1984 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe board of officers who have made a taking under this chapter shall, prior to the expiration of sixty days subsequent to the recording of the order of taking, offer in writing to every person entitled to damages on account of such taking a <em>reasonable amount </em>which such board is willing to pay, either in settlement under section thirty-nine of all damages for such taking with interest thereon, together with taxable costs, if any, or as a payment pro tanto\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> Prior to December, 1975, the defendant had retained a series of attorneys to represent him in aspects of this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\"> The two cases were consolidated. <em>See Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redevelopment Auth., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 619 n.2 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> The defendant had discharged the attorney then representing him just prior to trial because that attorney had presented him with a written contingent fee agreement; the defendant refused to sign it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> The plaintiff maintained that further review would not have been granted unless the court wished to \u201cdeal again\u201d with the issues decided by the Appeals Court so that a rebriefing of the cases for the second appeal was advised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"> The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s findings regarding the actual agreement between the parties as to the plaintiff\u2019s fee. Although the defendant testified that he and his son met with the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s home on December 27, 1975, and that the plaintiff agreed to represent him in the eminent domain cases at the rate of $40.00 per hour, the judge found that this testimony was \u201cnot worthy of belief \u2019 and noted that the defendant\u2019s son was not called as a corroborating witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> The judge found that at the BHA the plaintiff earned a salary of $33,388 per annum in January, 1976, and of $35,888 in 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> We also agree with the admonition of the Appeals Court in <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 577 n.5 (1980), <em>S.C. </em>384 Mass. 803 (1981), commending attorneys to the \u201cutility of time records\u201d even when they do not expect time to be the basis for billing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> For example, the judge found that the plaintiff prepared supporting affidavits and argued all motions personally, and at both Superior Court trials presented witnesses and cross-examined the NRA\u2019s witnesses, and prepared both briefs for appeal. Just before the bench trial, the plaintiff went over plans and documents. The judge found that the plaintiff immediately went to work preparing the defendant\u2019s cases for trial, and that establishing reasonable probability of rezoning using adverse witnesses proved to be a \u201cdelicate operation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\"> For this reason the defendant\u2019s reliance on many cases concerning claims for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982) is misplaced. Hourly rates in such cases have been said to be \u201cthe lodestar calculation.\u201d <em>Wojtkowski </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>725 F.2d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 1984). See <em>id. </em>at 130, citing with approval cases requiring lawyers seeking a fee under \u00a7 1988 to maintain \u201cmeticulous, contemporaneous time records,\u201d and announcing that such records are a \u201cprerequisite for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d in a particular circuit. See also <em>Grendel\u2019s Den, Inc. </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir. 1984) (the \u201clodestar\u201d is determined by multiplying the total number of hours reasonably spent by a reasonable hourly rate). Compare <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 456-457 (1981) (not utilizing a lodestar approach in a \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fee claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> The judge found that, in the course of the eminent domain proceedings, the defendant had retained and discharged no fewer than seven attorneys, including the plaintiff, prior to obtaining present counsel. He further found that one other attorney (in addition to the plaintiff), as well as two appraisers, found it necessary to place liens on the defendant\u2019s recovery before their fees were finally paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> In contrast, we have applied \u201cstrictly conservative principles\u201d to cases of all awards to counsel in the context of a \u201cnonvoluntary relationship.\u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, supra </em>at 265, 266, and cases cited. See <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 596 (1950); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>303 Mass. 187, 191 (1939); <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass.

The appellate function is essentially one of assessing a record to determine whether the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions were warranted on the record. The Appeals Court concluded, with firm conviction, that a mistake had been made, <em>id. </em>at 331, and it ordered a new trial. Any further review in this court simply involves us in second guessing the Appeals Court. Such a case particularly commends itself to the denial of any application for further appellate review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
