See S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981). The judge states that the answer to the question is important in passing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In support of its motion the defendant asserted that the judge erred in not instructing the jury that circumstances under which the plaintiff could have been found to have used the defendant\u2019s product would have barred his right to recover for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">We quote from the order of certification in which the judge has set forth the facts which he states \u201care relevant to the question certified and set out fully the nature of the controversy in which the question arises.\u201d See S.J.C. Rule 1:03, \u00a7 3 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">\u201cOn July 16, 1978, the plaintiff was dismantling an amusement ride known as the \u2018Sky Diver\u2019, in the course of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>employment with Dean &amp; Flynn Fiesta Shows. While his coworkers lifted the ride\u2019s motor, the plaintiff attempted to drive an assembly pin with a hammer through the motor\u2019s mounting holes. While he was doing so, the assembly pin\u2019s head fragmented. Pieces of metal flew into the plaintiff\u2019s eyes, and caused him injury. The assembly pin, hammer and all other components of the \u2018Sky Diver\u2019 were designed, manufactured and marketed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u201cAt trial, the plaintiff introduced into evidence a manual distributed by the defendant to prospective customers. This manual pictured a man hammering the same type of pin that fragmented into the plaintiff\u2019s eyes. The pictured man was not wearing safety goggles. For its part, the defendant introduced evidence that safety goggles were available to the plaintiff through his employer and that the plaintiff had previously been struck in the arms by pin fragments that chipped off during his hammering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The judge certified this question: \u201cIn a personal injury action based on breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, does the misuse defense apply to foreseeable uses of the product as well as to unforeseeable uses?\u201d Citing <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633 (1978), and <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342 (1983), the judge stated in his order that \u201c[t]he applicability of the misuse defense to foreseeable uses appears unsettled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We are uncertain what the judge meant by his reference to the \u201cmisuse defense.\u201d The word \u201cdefense\u201d suggests a matter of affirmative proof by which, if successful, a defendant could prevent liability. We are not aware, however, that we have used the words \u201cmisuse defense\u201d in connection with warranty claims. We hope that a discussion of the circumstances under which a plaintiff\u2019s conduct will bar his right to recover for breach of warranty will assist the judge in deciding the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In the process we shall describe the significance of foreseeability to proof of a warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">A warranty of merchantability that goods \u201care fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used\u201d is implied in a contract for their sale. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (c) (1984 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ed.). The implied warranty of fitness includes uses which are reasonably foreseeable but does not include unforeseeable misuses of a product. <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., supra </em>at 640. \u201c[A] manufacturer must anticipate the environment in which its product will be used, and it must design against the reasonably foreseeable risks attending the product\u2019s use in that setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640-641. Thus, to prove his case a plaintiff asserting a personal injury claim based on a breach of an implied warranty of merchantability must prove that at the time of his injury he was using the product in a manner that the defendant seller, manufacturer, or distributor reasonably could have foreseen. See <em>Correia v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 357 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Quite apart from this element of a plaintiff\u2019s claim is a defendant\u2019s affirmative defense that the plaintiff is barred from recovery because (1) he violated a duty to act reasonably with respect to a product he knew to be defective and dangerous and (2) that conduct was a cause of the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 355-356 &amp; n.12. A defendant making such a claim must prove that the plaintiff knew of the product\u2019s defect and its danger, that he proceeded voluntarily and unreasonably to use the product and that, as a result, he was injured. <em>Id. </em>at 355-357. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment n (1965). This defense differs from the traditional doctrine of assumption of the risk because it combines a subjective element, the plaintiff\u2019s actual knowledge and appreciation of the risk, with an objective standard, the reasonableness of his conduct in the face of the known danger. See <em>Zahrte </em>v. <em>Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., 203 </em>Mont. 90, 93-94 (1983); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Clark Equip. Co., </em>274 Or. 403, 410 n.5 (1976). See also Keeton, Assumption of Products Risks, 19 Sw. L.J. 61, 67-69 (1965). Compare Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment n (plaintiff \u201cproceeds unreasonably to make use of the product\u201d) with <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 496C, 496E (plaintiff need only encounter known risk voluntarily). This defense is significant, of course, only when there has been a foreseeable use of the defendant\u2019s product which, with other elements, established liability for breach of warranty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Magic Chef, Inc., </em>288 N.W.2d 542, 545 (Iowa 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>If by \u201cmisuse defense\u201d the judge meant the defense we have just described, the defendant\u2019s ability to foresee the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary, knowing, and unreasonable misuse of the product is irrelevant under our cases. Foreseeability of use is an element of the plaintiff\u2019s case and has nothing to do with the affirmative defense that the plaintiff\u2019s unreasonable conduct in the face of a known defect was a breach of duty that caused the injury. In so stating, we reject the suggestion that a defendant can be liable for breach of warranty of merchantability if the defendant should reasonably have foreseen that the plaintiff would <em>unreasonably </em>and voluntarily use a product, knowing it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>defective and dangerous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus answer the question, as we have construed it, in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> To say that the defense described in <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 355-356 (1983), applies only when the plaintiff\u2019s use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>was not reasonably foreseeable would be to deny the existence of the defense. Where there is no foreseeable use, there is no liability. See <em>Heil Co. </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>534 S.W.2d 916, 923 (Tex. Civ. App. 1976) (thrust of argument that use must be unforeseeable is that defense of unreasonable use in face of known danger should not be permitted in cases of strict liability for defective design of product). Cf. Twerski, Old Wine In a New Flask \u2014 Restructuring Assumption of Risk in the Products Liability Era, 60 Iowa L. Rev. 1, 24-25 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-5\"> We also reject the statement in <em>Fahey </em>v. <em>Rockwell Graphic Syss., Inc., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 652 n.13 (1985), that the <em>Correia </em>opinion \u201cused \u2018unreasonable use\u2019 of a defective and dangerous product and \u2018unforeseeable misuse\u2019 of such a product interchangeably.\u201d \u201cUnreasonable use\u201d concerns the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged conduct. See <em>Ferragamo </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>395 Mass. 581, 592-593 (1985). See also <em>Young </em>v. <em>Up-Right Scaffolds, Inc., </em>637 F.2d 810, 815 (D.C. Cir. 1980). \u201cUnforeseeable misuse\u201d concerns the question whether the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that the plaintiff would misuse the product in the way he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The distinction is made clear in <em>Perfection Paint &amp; Color Co.v. Konduris, </em>147 Ind. App. 106, 119 (1970), where the court discussed \u201cmisuse\u201d of a product in two aspects: \u201cA legal description of those acts which constitute a \u2018misuse\u2019 of a product has proven to be difficult to achieve. The problem appears to us to be one of failing to differentiate between misuse of a product which does not exhibit any defective condition until misused, or which does not appear to be defective and unreasonably dangerous, and misuse of a product when the defective and unreasonably dangerous condition is either discovered by the consumer or brought to his attention by a legally sufficient warning. While in either situation a product is being misused, the former constitutes the true category of misuse while the latter form of misuse is tantamount to the traditional concepts of incurred or assumed risk.\u201d See <em>Ellsworth </em>v. <em>Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 597 (1985); <em>Suter </em>v. <em>San Angelo Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., </em>81 N.J. 150, 159 (1979); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Clark Equip. Co., </em>274 Or. 403, 410 n.7 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
