L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b) </em>[1984 ed.]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>granted the joint motion to \u201creport an issue\u201d to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34,378 Mass. 905 (1979). We transferred the report here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We summarize the stipulated facts. On March 29, 1983, about 8:28 p.m. , Patrolman Michael Aselton of the Barnstable police department was on radar duty at Old Stage Road in Centerville. He saw the defendant\u2019s motorcycle speed by him and commenced pursuit in a marked police cruiser with activated warning devices. The defendant \u201crealized a cruiser was behind him but did not stop because he was \u2018in fear of his license. \u2019 \u201d The pursuit lasted roughly six miles through residential, commercial and rural areas. At one point, the defendant had gained a 100 yard lead and crossed an intersection, continuing north. The patrolman\u2019s cruiser approached the intersection at about \u201c76 m.p.h. minimal\u201d and passed over a crown in the roadway which caused the patrolman to brake. The wheels locked and the cruiser slid 170 yards, hitting a tree. Patrolman Aselton died as a result of the impact. The defendant had no idea of the accident which had occurred behind him. \u201cNo other vehicles were in any way involved in the causation of the accident.\u201d The stipulation further states that the decision to terminate a high-speed chase \u201cis to be made by the officer\u2019s commanding officer.\u201d No such decision to terminate the pursuit had been made at the time of the accident. The Barnstable police department determined that patrolman Aselton died in the line of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We understand the report to raise the question<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whether the stipulated facts would be sufficient to support a conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">A finding of ordinary negligence suffices to establish a violation of \u00a7 24G. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 389 (1981) , and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 36 (1984). See 20 A.L.R. 3d 473, 476-479 (1968), and cases collected (A showing of ordinary negligence has generally been held or recognized as sufficient to convict an accused under a \u201cvehicular negligent homicide statute\u201d where [as in Massachusetts] the term \u201cnegligence\u201d appears without qualification or modification). The Appeals Court has observed: \u201cIt would seem to follow that if the jury\u2019s task is to find ordinary negligence, then the appropriate principles of causation to apply are those which have been explicated in a large body of decisions and texts treating the subject in the context of the law of torts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 276 (1982) ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 697, 699-700 &amp; n.3 (1978). The defendant argues, however, that the \u201ccausation theory properly applied in criminal cases is not that of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>285 Pa. Super. 34, 42-43 (1981), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Root, </em>403 Pa. 571, 576-580 (1961), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redline, </em>391 Pa. 486, 504-505 (1958). If this theory has any application in this Commonwealth (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 735 [1985]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 824 [1980]), it does not apply to a charge of negligent vehicular homicide. We adopt instead the suggestion of the Appeals Court and conclude that the appropriate standard of causation to be applied in a negligent vehicular homicide case under \u00a7 24G is that employed in tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The defendant essentially contends that since he was one hundred yards ahead of the patrolman\u2019s cruiser and was unaware of the accident, the resulting death of the patrolman cannot be viewed as directly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant, however, was speeding on a motorcycle at night on roads which his attorney at oral argument before this court characterized as \u201cwinding\u201d and \u201cnarrow.\u201d He knew the patrolman was following him, but intentionally did not stop and continued on at high speeds for six miles. From the fact that the defendant was \u201cin fear of his license,\u201d it may reasonably be inferred that he was aware that he had committed at least one motor vehicle violation. Under these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s acts were hardly a remote link in the chain of events leading to the patrolman\u2019s death. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, supra </em>at 824. The officer\u2019s pursuit was certainly foreseeable, as was, tragically, the likelihood of serious injury or death to the defendant himself, to the patrolman, or to some third party. The patrolman\u2019s death resulted from the \u201cnatural and continuous sequence\u201d of events caused by the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 735-736.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We conclude that the proper standard of causation for this offense is the standard of proximate cause enunciated in the law of torts. We further conclude that, should the jury find the facts as stipulated in the instant case, and should the only contested element of the offense of motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation be that of causation, these facts would support a conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G <em>(b).</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-15\"> He was also charged with operating negligently to endanger (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24), and failing to stop for a police officer G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>stipulated facts also state that a complaint issued for failure to stay within marked lanes (G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A). Neither the docket nor the sworn complaint, however, indicates that a complaint issued for this fourth charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> The report states: \u201cA request is hereby made by the Commonwealth and the defendant to have the Court report an issue to the Appeals Court pursuant to Rule 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u201cISSUE: Whether or not the Defendant \u2018caused\u2019 the death, as a matter of law, under M.G.L. Chapter 90, Section 24G, where the [Defendant] was operating a motorcycle at high speeds through residential areas and the Officer, while pursuing the defendant, lost control of his cruiser and died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>as a result of colliding with a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u201cREASON FOR REQUEST: It is the Commonwealth\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s position that the above issue presents a novel issue relative to causation in a criminal case and that this issue should be resolved prior to trial so that properjury instructions may be framed for the trial of the defendant. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\"> For the purposes of the report the defendant apparently concedes all of the elements of negligence except causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\"> The defendant suggests that a consideration of the chase route would \u201clead a reasonable person to conclude that the officer himself or his superior was foolhardy and negligent to allow the \u2018chase\u2019 to go on at such length and at such speeds\u201d and stresses the fact that no decision to terminate the chase had been made by the time of the accident. Any discussion of alleged contributory negligence is inapposite, since contributory negligence would not excuse the defendant\u2019s conduct under \u00a7 24G. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>394 Mass. 77, 87 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> We find the reasoning in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lang, 285 </em>Pa. Super. 34 (1981), compelling. The court reversed the order of a trial court judge which had quashed an information charging the defendant with homicide by motor vehicle for the death of a police officer during a high speed chase. The defendant had been speeding on his motorcycle and attempting to evade arrest. The court held that it was for the jury to decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct directly resulted in the officer\u2019s death when the officer\u2019s car hit a tree during the chase and was not a fortuitous or coincidental event, unrelated to a direct result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. This situation was distinguished from \u201cdrag racing\u201d as one in which \u201ctwo \u2018civilians\u2019 had freely and voluntarily engaged in a race . . . here, we are dealing with one \u2018civilian\u2019 and a police officer. Having observed Lang speeding, Officer Redding was duty-bound to pursue him, which duty arguably became more compelling with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Vehicle Code violation. In a sense, Officer Redding was bound as if by a chain to Lang\u2019s vehicle; and, at the speed Lang was travelling, it was foreseeable the chain would break, hurtling Officer Redding to his death. Lang knew or should have known that his actions, speeding and attempting to elude arrest, were likely to result in injury to someone: either to himself, to some innocent third party, or to the pursuing police officer. ... a jury could reasonably conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Lang\u2019s conduct <em>directly </em>resulted in Officer Redding\u2019s death and was not a fortuitous or coincidental event unrelated to the direct result of his conduct\u201d (footnotes omitted, emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lang, supra </em>at 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
