As grounds for his appeal, the defendant claims that the trial judge erred in (1) denying the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty; (2) prohibiting defense counsel from rehabilitating the defendant on a critical portion of his testimony; (3) allowing testimony of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct; (4) denying the defendant\u2019s motions to sever the indictments; and (5) admitting evidence of fresh complaint. The defendant also argues that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, is unconstitutionally vague. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1a. <em>Required findings of not guilty. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and again at the close of the evidence, the defendant moved unsuccessfully for required findings of not guilty. The standard of review we apply to the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty is stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979): \u2018\u201c[The] question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most f\u00e1vorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 [emphasis in original]. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979) . . . . Thus, to sustain the denial of a directed verdict, it is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>397 Mass. 718, 719-720 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 311-312 (1985). We consider the state of the evidence both at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We summarize the evidence as it may have appeared to the jury. The defendant, a fifty-one year old neurosurgeon, practiced medicine at the Framingham Union Hospital, where the complainant worked as a radiologic technologist. The defendant and the complainant dated from September, 1980, to Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ruary, 1981. On August 15, 1983, the complainant injured her back. On September 6, 1983, she spoke with the defendant by telephone and made an appointment for September 9. On September 7, the defendant telephoned the complainant and suggested that he examine her at her apartment instead. On September 8, he arrived at her apartment at 1 p.m., and examined the complainant on her bed. He told her that she had a muscle spasm and recommended an injection of Valium to relax her muscles. He then administered an injection of five to ten milligrams of Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The complainant testified that immediately after the injection she became virtually unconscious, did not feel the needle being removed, and felt \u201c[v]cry groggy. Very out of it. Very heavy. . . . Like I couldn\u2019t move my arm or my legs.\u201d Sometime later, a ringing telephone awakened her. The defendant told her not to answer the telephone, but, after it had rung several times, she answered. The complainant recalled speaking with her friend, Lisa Block, but could not remember the conversation. She then noticed that the defendant was lying naked beside her, that her clothes had been removed, and that the defendant was \u201chandling\u201d her crotch. The complainant \u201cblacked out again\u201d and later reawoke to find the defendant on top of her, having intercourse with her. She did not remember saying anything to the defendant at this time. Her mind was \u201cin a fog . . . like it wasn\u2019t real .... Like I was in like a Twilight Zone.\u201d She lost consciousness and reawoke to find the defendant having intercourse with her again. She asked him \u201cwhy he was doing it, because wouldn\u2019t it hurt my back?\u201d He replied that \u201cthe medicine would take care of it.\u201d Again she fell asleep and later reawoke; she saw the defendant dressing and heard water mnning in the bathroom. At the defendant\u2019s request, she got out of bed to let him out of the apartment. Her legs were \u201c[l]ike rubber\u201d and she felt like she had \u201cabout ten drinks.\u201d The defendant departed at about 2:45 p.m. and the complainant fell back asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The complainant\u2019s mother and two of her friends testified that they spoke with the. complainant by telephone between 3 and 3:30 p.m. They, along with Lisa Block (who had called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>earlier), each said that the complainant\u2019s speech was slow, slurred, and groggy. She made no mention of rape. The complainant remembered receiving the telephone calls, but had no recollection of what was said. Later in the afternoon, when another friend telephoned, the complainant began to realize what had happened. The complainant reported her allegation of rape to a series of people throughout the rest of the day and the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Two physicians testified on the proper dosage of intravenous Valium and to the probable effects of injecting it into a twenty-six year old woman. Doctor Jonathan Moss told the jurors that intravenous Valium was used almost exclusively to sedate people prior to operations because it is \u201can amnesia drug . . . patients frequently don\u2019t remember even going to the operating room until their procedure is over.\u201d It renders them \u201cmore pliable\u201d and lessens their protestations and resistance to uncomfortable procedures. Intravenous Valium sedates people physically, relieves their anxiety, and stops them from moving or trembling. Most patients receiving a five to ten milligram Valium injection would \u201cbecome very tranquil and fall spontaneously off to sleep\u201d and their decision-making capacity, thought processes, physical coordination and speech would be impaired for several hours. Doctor Robert Boyd stated that the accepted treatment for muscle spasms in the back is bed rest, with oral doses of pain relievers and muscle relaxants when necessary; intravenous injection of Valium would not be recommended because of the potential for \u201cserious and devastating consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant claimed that he came to the complainant\u2019s apartment, examined her, and prescribed bed rest and an oral dose of Valium. In order to give her immediate relief from the spasm she was then experiencing, he injected her with five milligrams of Valium. He denied having intercourse with the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">lb. We consider first the defendant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the drugging charge because the complainant\u2019s testimony was not corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>rated in a material particular. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the elements of the crime of drugging for sexual intercourse are (1) administration of a drug and (2) intent to stupefy or overpower the victim in order to have unlawful sexual intercourse. Besides the complainant\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth introduced testimony from an investigating police officer that he saw an injection mark on the complainant\u2019s arm and from an expert toxicologist that, on the night of the incident, his analysis of the complainant\u2019s blood indicated a level of Valium consistent with an intravenous injection of five to ten milligrams of Valium within the past 16 hours. Further, the defendant admitted to injecting the complainant with Valium that day. This evidence amply corroborates a material particular of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony \u2014 that the defendant administered a drug to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The defendant argues that because he did not contest that he administered a drug to the complainant, that issue cannot be considered a \u201cmaterial particular.\u201d We do not agree. While we have not heretofore attempted to define \u201cmaterial particular\u201d as used in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 11, the cases suggest that the term applies to some specific testimonial fact, which, in the context of the case, is probative on an element of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>353 Mass. 233, 234-235 (1967) (defendant\u2019s admission that he had been at complainant\u2019s apartment not \u201cmaterial particular\u201d on indictment for unlawful sexual intercourse with feeble-minded female); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taschetta, </em>252 Mass. 158, 160 (1925) (testimony by defense witnesses that defendant took woman to house and then left house with her a \u201cmaterial particular\u201d on indictment for fraudulently enticing and taking away woman for purpose of unlawful sexual intercourse); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 59, 64 (1978) (testimony of police officers regarding their observations of man and woman in lounge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cmaterial particular\u201d in prosecution for knowingly having suffered presence of certain females for purpose of unlawful sexual intercourse in premises under defendant\u2019s control). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass. 453, 458 (1984) (undisputed fact of victim\u2019s death sufficient to corroborate defendant\u2019s confession to murder); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeBrosky, </em>363 Mass. 718, 728-730 (1973) (interpreting G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201, providing no defendant shall be convicted solely on the testimony of an immunized witness). Because the defendant could not be convicted on the drugging charge without proof of the injection, facts probative on that point must be considered material particulars. In essence, the defendant would have us read the requirement of corroboration of a material particular as corroboration of a \u201cdisputed issue of material fact\u201d as that phrase is used and understood in the consideration of summary judgment motions in civil practice. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See, e.g., <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Csongor, </em>391 Mass. 737, 740-743 (1984); <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976). However, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 11, does not require that the material particular be disputed, and we decline to read such a requirement into the plain words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">1c. On the rape charge, the defendant claims, based on his reading of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 383, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959), that, where the complainant is possessed of her faculties, the amount of actual force required to sustain proof of rape must exceed that which is necessary to accomplish mere intercourse. Because there was no evidence that the complainant resisted, the defendant claims, the Commonwealth did not sustain its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201cThe essence of the crime of rape, whether aggravated or unaggravated, is sexual intercourse with another compelled by force and against the victim\u2019s will or compelled by threat of bodily injury. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22 (a) &amp; (b).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 687 (1982). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376 (1870), this court held that in Massachusetts, as under the common law, \u201cthe words \u2018against [the victim\u2019s] will,\u2019 in the standard definitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>[of rape], mean exactly the same thing as \u2018without [the victim\u2019s] consent. \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Because the victim there was \u201cso drunk as to be utterly senseless and incapable of consenting,\u201d the court upheld the conviction based on proof only of \u201csuch force as was necessary to effect the purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>318 Mass. 779 (1945); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roosnell, </em>143 Mass. 32, 40 (1886). Nothing in the subsequent amendments to the statutory definition of the crime of rape casts doubt on the continued vitality of <em>Burke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, supra, </em>on which the defendant relies exclusively, this court reversed a conviction of rape where the complainant\u2019s consent had been obtained by fraud. The court reasoned that the \u201cessence of the crime is not the fact of intercourse but the injury and outrage to the feelings of the [victim] by the forceful penetration of her person. . . . Fraud cannot be allowed to supply the place of the force which the statute makes mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Goldenberg, </em>the court specifically stated: \u201cThis is not a case where a woman is incapable of consent by reason of stupefaction, unconsciousness or helplessness, and the amount of force required to commit the crime may be only that sufficient to effect the intercourse. Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burke, <em>105 </em>Mass. 376.\u201d Id. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">There was ample evidence from which a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consent. She was injected with Valium and rendered unconscious. She awoke from her stupor only when jarred by noises such as a ringing telephone and by the motion of the defendant\u2019s body on top of her own. Her speech was barely coherent. There was also evidence that intravenous Valium is used in hospitals to lessen patients\u2019 capacity to resist or protest invasive procedures. The court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Burke </em>is particularly apt here: \u201c[T]he crime, which the evidence in this case tended to prove, of a man\u2019s having carnal intercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>with a woman, without her consent, while she was, as he knew, wholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting and with such force as was necessary to accomplish the purpose, was rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380-381.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">2. <em>Exclusion of rehabilitation testimony. </em>On cross-examinatian, the defendant testified that he had taken back to the hospital the needle, syringe, and other items used to give the Valium injection. He conceded that, although he knew there was a wastebasket in the complainant\u2019s apartment, he had originally told the police that because he could not find a wastebasket there, he returned the items to the hospital. On redirect examination, the defendant explained that he had told the police he could not find a wastebasket \u201c[bjecause I did not want the police to know the reason I would not leave a syringe and needle in that apartment.\u201d When defense counsel asked the defendant to state his reason, the Commonwealth objected. Defense counsel made an offer of proof that the defendant would say \u201cthat he knew that [the complainant] used cocaine and that some of her friends used cocaine; that under those circumstances he wouldn\u2019t leave the needle.\u201d The judge sustained the objection and indicated she might prohibit the prosecutor from arguing the point to the jury. The prosecutor did not mention this point again either during trial or in his closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We agree with the defendant that he should have been permitted to explain the reason for his statement to the police. \u201cIt is well established that a witness may explain, modify, or correct damaging testimony that was elicited on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 400 (1982), and cases cited. The defendant admitted on cross-examination that he had fabricated a reason for removing the needle and syringe from the complainant\u2019s apartment. He had a right to explain why he had lied to the police. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>345 Mass. 508, 513 (1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 1004 (1964). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>345 Mass. 85, 87 (1962).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Nevertheless, we conclude that, in the circumstances of the case, the error was nonprejudicial. In cases in which similar errors have been held to require reversal, the attempted rehabilitation involved the defendant\u2019s credibility on a major, if not the decisive, issue in the case. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130-131 (1977), the trial turned on a battle of credibility between the defendant and the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness, one Silva, each of whom accused the other of shooting a police officer. On redirect examination, the defendant was prevented from explaining why, while in custody and after Silva denounced him, he refused to give a statement to police accusing Silva. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>345 Mass. 85 (1962), the defendant was not permitted to explain a crucial discrepancy in his alibi testimony. If the alibi had been believed, the defendant might have been acquitted. <em>Id. </em>at 88. In <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>329 Mass. 477, 478 (1952), a witness for the defense was prevented from explaining an apparent lie in his testimony; if believed, the testimony would have tended to confirm the defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In this case, even if the jury were to have heard and believed the defendant\u2019s explanation of his reason for not telling the police why he had taken the needle and syringe, we can say with fair assurance that a reasonable jury would not have returned a different verdict. See <em>Commonwealth v. Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440, 443 &amp; n.4 (1986); <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 763-765 (1946). The testimony related to a subject wholly collateral to the issues then being tried. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, supra. </em>The defendant admitted to the police and at trial that he had injected the complainant with Valium. Given this admission, the jury had no reason to infer that the defendant attempted to conceal the syringe from the police because of a guilty frame of mind concerning the injection. No further mention of the testimony was made during the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>mainder of the fifteen-day trial or in the prosecutor\u2019s closing. The defendant\u2019s explanation for removing the needle and syringe from the apartment does not in any way contradict or detract from the substantial evidence of his guilt. We therefore conclude that any prejudice to the defendant arising from this error did not possibly weaken his case in any significant way. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">3. <em>Evidence of prior misconduct. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, two other women, L.J. and K.H., testified that, when they were patients of the defendant, he came to their apartments, injected them with Valium and then sexually molested them while they were under the influence of the drug. The defendant claims the admission of this evidence was erroneous because its questionable probative value on the drugging charge was outweighed by its prejudicial impact and because the evidence was clearly not relevant to the charge of rape, yet no limiting instruction could confine the jury\u2019s consideration of the prior misconduct exclusively to the drugging charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 79 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 206 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 473 (1947). Such evidence can be highly prejudicial to the defendant, and therefore must be excluded unless it comes within one of the permitted uses, such as to show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoening, </em>379 Mass. 234, 242 (1979), and cases cited. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 106, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 840 (1984) (victim\u2019s state of mind); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 73 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984) (motive); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 472 (1982) (common course or pattern of conduct); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672-673 (1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>(same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981) (\u201centire relationship\u201d between defendant and victim); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. 682, 695 (1979) (knowledge); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 42-43 (1976) (distinctive modus operandi); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury-Ehrhart, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 431 (1985) (pattern of conduct). Of course, as with all evidence, it must be relevant to the offense charged; where the relevance is not substantial but borderline, the evidence must be excluded unless its probative value on the issue in contention outweighs the undue prejudice that may flow from it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 201 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The judge in this case, commendably sensitive to the potential for undue prejudice from the introduction of irrelevant evidence, conducted a voir dire and strictly limited the scope of the two witnesses\u2019 testimony to the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct associated with injections of Valium in patients\u2019 homes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> L.J. testified that in November, 1980, when she was twenty-two, she consulted the defendant twice in his office for treatment of migraine headaches. In January, 1981, the defendant proposed that he come to her home to administer a ten milligram injection of Valium. When he arrived, he persuaded L.J., despite her misgivings, to change into a nightgown, and then gave her the injection. While she was under the influence of the Valium and \u201cfading in and out,\u201d the defendant had intercourse with her. K.H. testified that she injured her back in June, 1981, and spent one week in the Framingham Union Hospital under the defendant\u2019s care. After her discharge, K.H. suffered a muscle spasm on July 1, 1981. Her roommate gave her a Valium tablet at about 7 p.m. and telephoned the defendant. K.H. fell asleep in her bed and awakened when the defendant arrived at 11 p.m. Although she told the defendant that she was no longer in pain, he insisted on examining her and giving her a ten milligram Valium injection. Almost immediately she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>began to feel \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201cimmobilized,\u201d was \u201cunable to get up or move\u201d and \u201ccould still speak, but [she] distinctly rememberfed] having a delayed reaction; that is, thinking the thoughts but not having them come out at the normal rate.\u201d The defendant then pulled down her nightgown and started fondling her breasts. When he expressed feelings of guilt about desiring a sexual relationship with her, she replied, \u201cIf you feel guilty, you should stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The judge instructed the jury that both witnesses\u2019 testimony could be considered only on the drugging indictment, not on the rape, and only for the limited purpose of whether it \u201ctends to prove the existence of a plan or scheme or state of mind on the part on the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge also charged the jury that they were not to use the two witnesses\u2019 testimony at all unless they believed it beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The instructions were strong and forceful.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Although the question is close, we conclude there was no error. On the drugging indictment, the Commonwealth was obliged to prove as an element of the crime that the defendant administered the drug \u201cwith intent to stupefy or overpower [the complainant] so as thereby to enable any person to have unlawful sexual intercourse with [the complainant].\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.). The defendant claimed that he gave the injection for therapeutic reasons, not with criminal intent. The Commonwealth offered expert testimony that the defendant\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with good medical practice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In these circumstances the defendant\u2019s conduct with L.J. and K.H. which was remarkably similar to the complainant\u2019s complaint was highly probative. The defendant came to the homes of young women with whom he had a doctor-patient relationship, injected them with Valium, and then sexually molested them while they were physically and mentally unable to express resistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 469-473 (1982).

Later, the defendant again moved to sever, this time on the ground that he would be unreasonably prejudiced on the rape indictment because conviction on the drugging indictment required the jury to find that the complainant\u2019s testimony be corroborated in a material particular.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The decision whether to sever indictments lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 754 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 671 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638, 645 (1975), and cases cited. Joinder is permitted if the offenses constitute a single line of conduct, grow out of essentially one transaction, and would be proved by substantially the same evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200 (1972). Where those criteria are not satisfied and the defendant may be prejudiced by the cumulative evidence of the several offenses, severance is required. <em>Id. </em>at 201. The defendant bears the burden to show that prejudice will result from the failure to sever and that such prejudice is beyond the curative powers of the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The defendant has failed to sustain that burden. The two offenses could be proved by \u201cevidence connected with a single line of conduct, and grow out of what is essentially one transaction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>348 Mass. 610, 614 (1965). The drugging indictment would be incomprehensible without evidence of subsequent sexual intercourse; the complainant\u2019s testimony concerning the rape would have been incredible without evidence that she had been drugged. Most of the evidence was admissible on both indictments and the judge gave limiting instructions on the remainder. At the defendant\u2019s request, the judge limited the use of fresh complaint evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to the rape charge, and the defendant does not now contend that that evidence was so prejudicial as to be beyond the power of curative instructions. Also at the defendant\u2019s request, the judge limited evidence of prior misconduct to the drugging charge and gave clear, forceful, and extensive instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We add that severance would have resulted in a second proceeding, largely duplicative of the first. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 33 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, supra </em>at 673. In such circumstances, the judge properly could conclude that prejudice, if any, to the defendant did not outweigh the interests of the court, the Commonwealth, and the public in a shortened adjudication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, supra </em>at 758, and authorities cited. We conclude that there was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">5. <em>Evidence of fresh complaints. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in admitting testimony that the victim made a \u201cfresh complaint\u201d of the rape to several people. The defendant concedes fresh complaint of a recent rape normally is admissible, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388 (1976), but argues that the evidence in this case was stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The evidence was as follows. The defendant arrived at the complainant\u2019s apartment at about 1 p.m. and, after examining her, administered the Valium injection. The complainant received one telephone call before the defendant left at 2:45 p.m. and three more calls between then and 3:30 p.m. All four callers testified to the effect that the complainant was groggy and her speech slurred and unclear, but that she made no mention of rape. Sometime between 3:30 and 4:45 (the testimony was divergent), as the complainant became more awake, she received another phone call from a friend. She described the injection, falling asleep, and awakening with the realization that she was naked and that the defendant was having intercourse with her. Her friend asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that you have been raped?\u201d The complainant then started crying and became hysterical. Over the next ten to twelve hours, there followed a series of telephone and in-person conversations with other friends, an attorney, and a police officer, in which the complainant repeated her narrative of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Before introduction of the fresh complaint evidence, the defendant moved to exclude all conversations in which the complainant reported that she had been raped. The defendant argued, and renews the argument here, that because the complainant failed to tell earlier callers she had been raped, her later complaints were unreasonably delayed. The judge made the preliminary finding that the statements were sufficiently prompt to constitute fresh complaints, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>172 Mass. 175, 177 (1898). The judge instructed the jury to use fresh complaint testimony only in corroboration of the rape charge. She instructed the jurors to consider the timing and circumstances of the complaints in assessing the weight of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">There was no error. There was ample evidence that, when the complainant received the first four phone calls, she was under the influence of a Valium injection, barely conscious, and severely handicapped in her ability to express herself. The fact that the complainant retained some minimal capacity to speak when a ringing telephone awakened her from a drug-induced stupor does not render her subsequent statements unreasonably remote. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 691 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>364 Mass. 243, 249-250 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Izzo, </em>359 Mass. 39, 42-43 (1971). We conclude that there is no error in the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">6. <em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3. </em>The defendant challenges his indictment on the drugging charge on the ground that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, is unconstitutionally vague. The defendant\u2019s argument is not timely. The defendant did not raise this objection before or even during trial.

Where the prior misconduct is merely one instance in a continuing course of related events, the allowable time period is greater.

Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 44-45 (1966) (evidence of defendant\u2019s arrest for murder sixteen years previously inadmissible). Where the logical relationship between the charged and uncharged offenses is more attenuated, a time span of fifteen minutes may be too much. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yelle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 465, 470 (1985) (evidence that defendant to rape charge had offered a ride to young girl fifteen minutes before picking up complainant not admissible). Where the evidence is otherwise relevant, the jury may consider the time interval between such incidents as bearing on the weight to be given such evidence. The judge so instructed the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> The dissent, <em>infra, </em>suggests that the prior bad acts testimony was so prejudicial that the jury could not be expected to disregard it on the rape charge. The dissent gives no credit to the intelligence of the jurors or to the clarity and forcefulness of the judge\u2019s thrice-repeated instructions. As we read the record, the judge\u2019s careful and conservative approach to the evidence minimized the likelihood that the jurors would be so emotionally swayed by the evidence that they would disregard her instructions. In these circumstances, we may rely on the fair-mindedness of the jurors. See 225-226, <em>supra, </em>&amp; nn. 7 &amp; 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> While we need not decide if the evidence also was admissible on the rape charge, we do note that the evidence suggests a common pattern of conduct according to which the plaintiff would visit young women patients in their homes, inject them with Valium \u2014 a drug that would render them immobile, passive, and unable later to relate clearly and precisely what had happened to them \u2014 and then molest and rape them. The two witnesses\u2019 testimony also may have been admissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that the complainant merely had imagined that intercourse had taken place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Under Mass. R. Crim. P. 9(d)(2), 378 Mass. 860 (1979), a defendant\u2019s motion to sever must be made before trial, \u201cexcept that a motion for severance may be made before or at the close of all the evidence if based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>a ground not previously known.\u201d Before trial, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, but without prejudice to the Commonwealth should the evidence appear to be more probative in light of the issues that developed during the trial. When the judge later made that determination, reversed her ruling, and allowed introduction of the prior misconduct evidence on the drugging charge, the defendant then had new grounds for requesting severance. The motion based on those grounds was therefore timely. Conversely, the defendant\u2019s claims that the indictments required disparate elements of proof and that the material particular requirement on the drugging indictment might cause prejudice on the rape indictment could have been made before trial. To the extent the motions were based on those grounds, they were not timely filed and are not properly before us.

I do not agree that the erroneous exclusion of the defendant\u2019s proffered rehabilitation testimony was nonprejudicial, nor do I agree that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was admissible. I would reverse the judgments and remand the case for a new trial of both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant offered to explain to the jury that the reason he had lied to the police was not self-interest but rather his desire to protect the complainant and her friends from being discovered to be cocaine users. The court recognizes that the defendant \u201chad a right to explain why he lied to the police\u201d <em>(ante </em>at 222), but concludes \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that the exclusion of that evidence was harmless because, even if the jury had believed the defendant\u2019s explanation, they would have found him guilty on the drugging and rape charges anyway <em>(ante </em>at 223). The court\u2019s assurance is unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant\u2019s only realistic hope of acquittal depended on the jury\u2019s not being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had had intercourse with the complainant. Unless he had intercourse, it is unlikely that he administered the drugs to enable him to do so. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>The complainant testified that the defendant had had intercourse with her. The defendant testified that he had not. The defendant\u2019s credibility, therefore, was critical to the outcome of the case. The fact, brought out on cross-examination of the defendant, that he had lied to the police investigators, suggested with considerable force that (1) when he spoke to the police, the defendant was conscious of his guilt; human experience teaches that the guilty tend to lie to investigators about both important and unimportant details of the incident under investigation, and (2) the defendant was not a reliable witness because he was not averse to lying \u201cto save his own skin.\u201d Surely, it cannot rightly be said that the portrayal of the defendant as a deceitful man, conscious of his guilt, did not prejudice him. That portrayal, effectively accomplished on cross-examination, cried out for the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 879-881 (1984). The defendant\u2019s legitimate attempt at rehabilitation was thwarted however. He was not permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to explain to the jury that he had lied, not to protect himself, and not because he had a guilty frame of mind, but to protect others.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In order to find the defendant guilty as charged, the jury had to believe the complainant\u2019s testimony and disbelieve that of the defendant. No one can say with fair assurance that, in choosing whom to believe, the jury was not influenced by the defendant\u2019s cross-examination unmet by any explanation, or that, had they heard the explanation, they would not have arrived at a different verdict. The error cannot properly be considered harmless. Therefore, a new trial on both charges is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">A new trial on both charges is also required because evidence of the defendant\u2019s earlier conduct with L.J. and K.H. was erroneously admitted on the drugging charge over the defendant\u2019s objection. That error prejudiced the defendant with respect to both indictments. As the court observes <em>(ante </em>at 224), \u201c[i]t is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose.\u201d The rationale for this rule is that while such evidence may be marginally probative, \u201cthere is the danger that, because a defendant appears to be a bad man capable of, and likely to commit, such a crime as that charged, a jury might be led to dispense with proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he did-actually commit the crime charged. Moreover, it is not fair that a defendant in the course of a trial should be called upon to defend himself against accusations not set forth in the indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 473 (1947). See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 188 (2d ed. 1972). If this well-settled rule of fairness is to continue to have any vitality whatsoever, the other bad acts evidence in this case must be held inadmissible. The only function of the evidence was to show that the defendant had a general propensity to drug women in order to enable him to have intercourse with them, and that therefore he drugged the complainant for that purpose as charged. That is precisely what the rule prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The court reasons <em>(ante </em>at 227) that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conduct with L.J. and K.H. was \u201chighly probative\u201d in that it showed a distinctive pattern of conduct bearing on the defendant\u2019s state of mind when administering the drug, thus tending to rebut the defense of innocent, therapeutic intent and making more probable the existence of the requisite illegal intent. In support of that contention, the court cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury-Ehrhart, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 431 (1985), and cases from other jurisdictions. In all the cited cases, the admission of other crime evidence was affirmed on appeal, not on the ground that the evidence demonstrated a distinctive pattern of conduct (modus operandi), but on the quite different ground that it demonstrated the defendant\u2019s involvement in a common scheme, design, or plan. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 673 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoening, </em>379 Mass. 234, 242 (1979). Therefore it is difficult to know whether the court approves the admission of the \u201cother crime\u201d evidence in this case because it demonstrates a distinctive modus operandi or a common scheme. In any event, neither theory justifies the admission of the contested evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">When a crime has been committed in a unique way, and the person charged with committing the crime has been shown to have had an opportunity to commit it, evidence that the defendant previously committed the same crime in the same unique way has a strong tendency to show that he, and not someone else, committed the crime with which he is charged. The evidence is admissible, therefore, to establish the identity of the assailant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 366 (1976). Modus operandi evidence is designed to identify the perpetrator of a crime proven by other evidence. In this case, the question is whether a crime was committed, not who committed it, and therefore the distinctive modus operandi theory does not apply. The court cites no case from Massachusetts or elsewhere holding in a criminal case that evidence of the unusual manner in which a defendant has executed a crime or crimes in the past is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion he possessed criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Neither does the \u201ccommon scheme\u201d theory apply. This court said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, supra </em>at 473-474, that \u201c[i]n trials of indictments for larceny by obtaining money or property by false pretenses it has been held, as bearing on the defendant\u2019s intent, that his criminal conduct on another occasion is admissible, provided it is reasonably near in time and so connected with the crime charged in the indictment as to show unity of plot and design and that it was part of a common plan or scheme to defraud.\u201d In that case, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoening, supra </em>at 242-243, which involved indictments for conspiracy to bribe a public official and conspiracy to steal from the Commonwealth, evidence of other bad acts was held admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind when those other acts were part and parcel of one ongoing course of conduct. However, the act in question here, together with the two prior acts involving L.J. and K.H. more than two years earlier, cannot be considered phases of one continuous operation if we are to retain the salutary rule requiring the exclusion of evidence of other bad acts to show a defendant\u2019s criminal propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I recognize that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 469-472 (1982), this court held that at the trial of an indictment for unlawful, unnatural sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen years of age, the judge properly admitted evidence that during the period of the alleged misconduct the defendant also engaged in sexual acts with the victim\u2019s younger brother. For the first time, this court in <em>King </em>applied the common scheme theory in an action charging a sexual offense. Also for the first time, this court in <em>King </em>applied the common scheme theory, not just to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind, but to prove that he committed the act with which he was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 478 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). I continue to believe that <em>King </em>was wrongly decided. It is not necessary, however, that I urge the overruling of <em>King </em>in support of my contention that the evidence of other bad acts in this case should be held inadmissible. The King case and this one are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>In <em>King, </em>the court concluded that the acts alleged in the indictment and the other acts \u201cformed a \u2018temporal and schematic nexus\u2019\u201d because they were committed against a sister and a brother who made their home with the defendant, and the offenses not included in the indictment occurred within the same time period as the offenses with which the defendant was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 472. In the present case, however, the other two acts were with unrelated people, and they occurred six months apart and more than two years earlier than the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In <em>King, </em>the court did not purport to overrule <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68 (1964). In fact, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 757 (1983), the court expressly stated that <em>\u201cCommonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>[383 Mass. 659 (1981)], do not overrule <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra.\u201d </em>No principled distinction can be made between this case and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome. </em>In that case, we held inadmissible in a trial for indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen evidence that the defendant had assaulted other young girls. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71. We \u201cinvokefd] the rule that evidence of a distinct crime unconnected with that for which the defendant is indicted cannot be received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 669, 670 (1947) (holding that it was error to admit in a statutory rape trial evidence that the defendant molested an older sister). The court makes no effort to distinguish the present case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra, </em>or <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra. </em>Rather, the court ignores those cases and turns to foreign jurisdictions for guidance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra, </em>articulates good law, and has recently been characterized by the court as stating the current law. That case, and the sound principle of fairness that it enunciates, should not be overruled without discussion adequate to justify such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s earlier conduct with L.J. and K.H. was probative, though not, as the court says, \u201chighly probative\u201d on the question whether the defendant injected Valium into the complainant to enable him to have intercourse with her or for therapeutic reasons. To infer criminal intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>however, the fact finder must first infer from the defendant\u2019s prior conduct that he had a propensity to commit that crime, and then to say that a man with that propensity probably had the intent required for the crime charged. Thus, the evidence of prior bad acts was introduced for the purpose of showing his propensity to commit the crime. But \u201c[i]t is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purpose of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d The court purports to acknowledge this. See <em>ante </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>and now in this case, displays a sharp retrogression in its sensitivity to the unfairness of admitting in a criminal case evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts that was earlier expressed so well in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra. </em>It is difficult, nay impossible, to reconcile that unenlightened trend with the court\u2019s recent progressive recognition of the danger of unfair prejudice inherent in admitting evidence of a defendant\u2019s conviction under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, to impeach his credibility as a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 832-834 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 (1977). In those cases, we recognized that the greater the similarity between the charged offense and past offenses, the greater the potential for unfairness \u2014 even if, unlike here, the jury is instructed that they are to consider the evidence of past bad acts solely on the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. The court is moving in two diametrically opposite directions simultaneously. The direction taken by the court in this case is the wrong one.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The judge instructed the jury that they should consider the contested evidence only with respect to the drugging charge. Clearly, the evidence, erroneously admitted, was prejudicial to the defendant with respect to that indictment. It was equally prejudicial as to the rape indictment despite the judge\u2019s limiting instruction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 681-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is reasonable for us to be confident that in most cases limiting instructions accomplish their intended purpose. Nevertheless, in cases . . . where the evidence subject to limitations has an extremely high potential for unfair prejudice, we have a duty to be skeptical as to the effectiveness of limiting instructions. . . . The reasoning of the <em>[Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968)] case is highly relevant . . . since that case recognized the futility, even the absurdity, of expecting a jury in some circumstances to conform to limiting instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Both convictions are flawed by prejudicial error, both in the exclusion of rehabilitative evidence to which the defendant was entitled, and the admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct. The judgments should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the Superior Court for retrial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
