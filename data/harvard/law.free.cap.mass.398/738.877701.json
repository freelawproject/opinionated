The plaintiff asserted that the defendants unlawfully distributed a letter containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>confidential information obtained in the course of providing psychological services to the plaintiff and her daughter. The motion judge based his immunity decision on G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, as amended by St. 1979, c. 312. The Appeals Court agreed with that conclusion. <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Landau, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 240 (1985). We do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Section 51A requires certain persons with reasonable cause to believe that a child under eighteen is suffering serious physical or emotional injury resulting from abuse or neglect to report the condition to the Department of Social Services orally and in writing. The defendant Landau, then working on his doctorate in psychology, on April 14, 1980, sent a letter signed by him and the defendant Greenberg which the defendants assert they were required to send pursuant to the mandatory disclosure provisions of \u00a7 51 A. If they were, \u00a7 51A further provides that no person required to report shall be liable because of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">For the purposes of this appeal we assume, without deciding, that the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 51A applied to the defendants in this case, that the letter was a report of child abuse, and that the defendants are immune from liability if they made a report to the Department of Social Services. Our concern is that the material properly to be considered on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment does not demonstrate the absence of a dispute on the material factual question whether the letter was sent to the Department of Social Services. The defendant Landau stated in an affidavit that he sent the letter to \u201ca social worker at the Malden District Court.\u201d The letter has at its top in what appears to be different type from the balance of the letter: \u201cCambridge District Court \u2014 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit states that the letter was sent to the Medford welfare offfice.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The defendants were not entitled to summary judgment at least because they have not shown beyond dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>letter was sent to the Department of Social Services, an indispensable condition to immunity under \u00a7 51 A. The judgment for the defendants is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\"> A child in need of services (CHINS) proceeding concerning the plaintiff\u2019s daughter was pending in that court. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 39E-39J (1984 ed. &amp; Supp. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> There are other potential questions of fact and law. At the time the letter was sent \u00a7 51A did not explicitly provide, as it now does (St. 1982, c. 102), that psychologists are governed by its mandatory report and absolute immunity provisions. If any defendant was not required to report child abuse, \u00a7 51A provides immunity only for good faith action, which, contrary to the Appeals Court, we believe should not be presumed in favor of defendants, who would have the burden of proof on that issue. If the letter was not a \u00a7 51A report, it may matter whether the plaintiff was a patient of the defendants or only her daughter was. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985); G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1984 ed. &amp; Supp. 1985). If the letter was a \u00a7 51A report (a conclusion not yet established in this case), we do not imply that it properly could be used in a CHINS proceeding without parental consent, approval of the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services, or a court order. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51E (1984 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
