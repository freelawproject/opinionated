The defendant attorney appealed from the judgment on several grounds. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We reverse the judgment on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that the evidence did not warrant a finding of damages and order the entry of a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint sets forth two distinct claims. First, the complaint alleges that on May 9, 1975, the plaintiff was discharged from her employment at Itek Corporation (Itek) because she is a woman, and that the defendant negligently failed to file timely complaints of unlawful discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a Federal agency, and with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). As <em>a </em>result, according to the complaint, the plaintiff was barred from obtaining a reinstatement order and an award compensating her for her lost wages and legal expenses, for which she is entitled to damages. The second claim is that on or about June 2, 1975, Itek advised the defendant of its willingness to reinstate the plaintiff to her former position, that the defendant did not communicate that offer to her, and that, if he had done so, the plaintiff would have returned to her former position without loss of pay or benefits. On that claim, the plaintiff seeks damages for her loss of pay and benefits resulting from her failure to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In his answer, the defendant admits that he agreed to file sex discrimination charges with the EEOC and the MCAD, and that he failed to do so. The answer also admits that on or about June 2, 1975, Itek advised the defendant that it was willing to reinstate the plaintiff to her former position. Contradicting the amended complaint, however, the answer asserts that the defendant communicated Itek\u2019s offer to the plaintiff and that she rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The parties \u2019 testimony at trial was consistent with their pleadings and, for the most part, need not be repeated here. It is enough to say that the plaintiff testified that Itek paid her salary until August 1, 1975, that the defendant had not told her about Itek\u2019s June 2, 1975, offer, and that, if he had told her, she would have accepted the offer because she only wanted her job back. The defendant\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that he told the plaintiff about Itek\u2019s offer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that she rejected it on the asserted ground that \u201cshe\u2019d be going back into the same kind of circumstances that existed,\u201d and that there were \u201cseveral people that she would be working for she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Before the presentation of evidence bearing on damages, the judge submitted several special questions to the jury. In response to those questions, the jury determined, in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, that she had had a valid sex discrimination claim against Itek and the defendant had not filed it properly. But they also determined, in the defendant\u2019s favor, that the defendant had communicated Itek\u2019s reinstatement offer to the plaintiff and she had rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Following the announcement and recording of the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions, the judge and counsel briefly conferred about damages. During that discussion, defense counsel stated, \u201cI don\u2019t see how the plaintiff can hope to proceed on a damage theory here when the plaintiff failed to mitigate her damages, and failed to accept the reinstatement offer. I think the damage issue becomes moot.\u201d The trial nevertheless resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We discuss the subsequent procedural events in some detail because they bear on a contested matter\u2014 whether the defendant adequately preserved his right to appellate review of his motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence of damages. The plaintiff introduced the testimony of an expert concerning what the plaintiff\u2019s probable earnings would have been had she remained in Itek\u2019s employ. After the expert\u2019s testimony, the parties rested. The defendant then filed a written motion that the judge direct the jury to award the plaintiff only nominal damages in the sum of $1.00. The motion stated as grounds that the \u201cplaintiff has failed to prove that her rejection of the reinstatement offer was reasonable, that she mitigated damages, and that she sustained any damages at all, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>any damages relative to back pay, in the underlying action.\u201d Referring to <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627 (1978), and <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Lakeville Baseball Camp, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 974, 975 (1976), the judge denied the motion without argument, stating that the case would be submitted to the jury \u201creserving all rights as to legal questions regarding the adequacy of evidence to prove damages, or any other such questions.\u201d In the cases to which the judge referred, we articulated the principle that, except when it is very clear that a directed verdict is required, a trial judge should deny a motion for a directed verdict and postpone the resolution of questions concerning the sufficiency of evidence until the judge rules on a subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Following the jury verdict awarding the plaintiff $30,000, the defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a memorandum in support thereof. This was consistent with the judge\u2019s earlier reservation of the parties\u2019 rights to raise legal questions concerning the adequacy of evidence on damages. The motion set forth numerous grounds including the following: the \u201cplaintiff failed to prove that she reasonably rejected the reinstatement offer (indeed, plaintiff\u2019s own evidence was that she wanted to be reinstated to her former position at Itek and plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that she had no concern about returning to work for those persons at Itek who had previously been her supervisors) . . . [and] plaintiff\u2019s rejection of the reinstatement offer tolled any back pay liability as of the date the offer terminated. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s right to claim damages terminated as of August 1, 1975, as of which date she had no damages, or, at best, nominal damages.\u201d In the memorandum in support of his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the defendant specifically relied on <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>458 U.S. 219 (1982), a case in which the Supreme Court held that a discharged employee claiming to be a victim of discrimination is not entitled to an award for pay lost after he has rejected a reinstatement offer unless there are \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d justifying his rejection of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>We are satisfied that the defendant adequately preserved his right to appellate review. We not only rely on the defendant\u2019s statement to the judge before evidence on damages was introduced, referred to above, but we rely also on the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, on the judge\u2019s reservation of the defendant\u2019s right thereafter to argue the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on damages, and on the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict with its supporting memorandum making the same sufficiency of the evidence argument that the defendant makes here. Essentially, that argument is that by her own uncontradicted testimony the plaintiff suffered no losses prior to August 1, 1975, and that, in view of the jury\u2019s finding that the plaintiff rejected Itek\u2019s June 2, 1975, reinstatement offer, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for wages or benefits lost after August 1, 1975, because as a matter of law she failed to sustain her burden to show that her rejection of Itek\u2019s offer was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We agree with the defendant\u2019s contentions. Clearly, the evidence did not warrant a finding that the plaintiff sustained a loss prior to August 1, 1975. We do not understand the plaintiff to contend otherwise. Also, there was no evidence of compensable loss after August 1. In <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, supra </em>at 238-239, the Supreme Court held that, \u201cabsent special circumstances,\u201d an employer charged with discrimination in hiring can toll the continuing accrual of back pay liability under \u00a7 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g), by unconditionally offering the claimant the job previously denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that such a rule comports with Title VII\u2019s dual policy of motivating employers to bring discrimination to an end, <em>id. </em>at 228-230, and of making the victims of discrimination whole. <em>Id. </em>at 230-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"><em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, supra, </em>demonstrates, at the very least, that, in order to be eligible under Title VII for an award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>of back pay accruing after rejection of a reinstatement offer, an employee must show that the rejection was motivated by circumstances making the rejection objectively reasonable. A simple showing that the employee fears further discrimination, without evidence of circumstances making that fear reasonable, does not satisfy the <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Of course, as the plaintiff points out, the decision in the <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>case does not require that Massachusetts courts or the MCAD interpret G. L. c. 15 IB in a particular way. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 165-167 (1978). But, that decision is very instructive. It declares a sound rule that advances the purposes not only of the Federal statute but of the cognate Massachusetts statute, G. L. c. 151B, as well. Therefore, we adopt the <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>rule as the law of this Commonwealth and we apply it to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In order to recover damages, the plaintiff must show that her rejection of Itek\u2019s reemployment offer was objectively reasonable. The defendant argues that the plaintiff is bound by her own testimony to the effect that her reason for not accepting Itek\u2019s reinstatement offer was not that she anticipated that she would suffer from continued discrimination, but rather that she was unaware of the offer. See <em>Hultberg </em>v. <em>Truex, </em>344 Mass. 414, 418 (1962); <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>334 Mass. 4, 6 (1956). We need not consider that argument, however, because it is enough that we agree with the defendant\u2019s other argument that, in any event, the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence to show the reasonableness of her rejection of Itek\u2019s offer. The only evidence to which the plaintiff directs our attention is as follows: (1) the defendant\u2019s testimony that the plaintiff authorized him to reject the reinstatement offer on her behalf because \u201cshe\u2019d be going back into the same kind of circumstances that existed, and merely postponing the circumstance, and that . . . there were several people that she would be working for she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with\u201d; and (2) the contents of an Itek interoffice memorandum concerning what the defendant had said to Itek\u2019s vice president Famell about the plaintiff\u2019s reasons for rejecting the reinstatement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the memorandum is misplaced. The record shows that the document was admitted in evidence only to show what the defendant said to Parnell, and \u201cnot for the truth of any purported implied statement\u201d by the plaintiff. There is no justification, therefore, for reliance on that memorandum as proof of the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of reemployment. Furthermore, the other piece of evidence on which the plaintiff relies is not sufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of the reinstatement offer was reasonable. The plaintiff\u2019s statement to the defendant of her belief that discrimination against her would resume does not demonstrate the reasonableness of that prediction. Surely, the fact that \u201cthere were several people that she would be working for she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with\u201d is not alone a sufficient reason for a reasonable person to have refused reemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiff has not proved that she is entitled to recover for lost wages or other benefits. Also, there was no evidence that she incurred any legal expenses in connection with the claims for which she retained the defendant. Finally, although the plaintiff argues here that she is entitled to damages because the \u201cdefendant\u2019s negligence deprived [her] of a valuable claim for reinstatement,\u201d the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were limited to the issue of back pay, and the plaintiff did not object to that limitation. In fact, the judge instructed the jury, without objection, that, in view of the jury\u2019s determination that Itek offered to reinstate the plaintiff, \u201cwhat an agency might have done [with respect to a reinstatement offer] is sheer speculation.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict or his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed. The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> That offer, according to the testimony of a vice president of Itek, was open until August 1, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> As an example of \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d the Supreme Court said that if a claimant has been forced to move a great distance to find a replacement job, the trial court could weigh such a factor in deciding whether back pay damages accrued after rejection of the employer\u2019s subsequent reinstatement offer should be awarded to the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 238 n.27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b206-7\">Hennessey, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">(dissenting). I would affirm. After reviewing the record, I conclude that all of the rulings of the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>were free of error. The court in its opinion obviously, and I think incorrectly, interprets the record differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">. The court today holds that \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d is the standard to be applied when a discrimination plaintiff rejects an offer of reinstatement. This issue simply was not before the trial judge, and is not properly before this court on appeal. The law of the case as shown by the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury was that the plaintiff could recover back pay after August 1, 1975, if her rejection of Itek\u2019s reinstatement offer was \u201creasonable.\u201d The defendant did not object to this instruction, or request a charge of \u201cobjective reasonableness.\u201d The defendant first raised the issue of \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d (citing <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>458 U.S. 219 [1982]) in his memorandum on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This came too late. The law of the case had already been established by the trial judge without assistance or objection from the defendant, and the jury had returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Thus, the law as presented to the jury was \u201creasonableness,\u201d and the question properly before this court on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence on this issue to send the question of damages to the jury. In reviewing a denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we must consider whether \u201c \u2018 anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff. \u2019 \u201d <em>Forlano </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>393 Mass. 502, 504 (1984), and cases cited. The defendant testified that his client rejected the reinstatement offer because \u201cshe\u2019d be going back into the same kind of circumstances that existed,\u201d and because \u201cthere were several people that she would be working for she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with.\u201d The majority opinion, without explanation or citation to authority, concludes: \u201cSurely, . . . [this] is not alone a sufficient reason for a reasonable person to have refused reemployment,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 190. I disagree. There was evidence that the plaintiff feared further discrimination, and it was properly a question for the jury whether this fear was \u201creasonable\u201d under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Contrary to the above reasoning, the court today establishes for the first tim\u00e9 that the concept of \u201creinstatement offers\u201d should be treated under State law similarly to <em>Ford Motor Co., supra. </em>Having strained to adopt <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>as the law of this Commonwealth under G. L. c. 15IB (1984 ed.), the majority goes on to conclude that a directed verdict should have been entered for the defendant. Even if by some reasoning, and at this late date, the <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>rule should be applied in this case, at best the defendant is entitled to a new trial. As I read the record, a jury question is presented as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of Itek\u2019s reinstatement offer was \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
