R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979): \u201cCan a person who possesses and carries a firearm on his person or under his control in a vehicle without a license be convicted [of violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(1984 ed.)] where that person is a \u2018new resident\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (j)?\u201d We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We answer the question, \u201cYes. \u201d The relevant facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">In July, 1984, the defendant left his home ip Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and drove to Massachusetts with the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>completing his college education. Along with his other personal belongings, the defendant brought with him a .38 caliber firearm which he had inherited from his grandfather in 1972. The .defendant arrived in the Commonwealth on July 18, 1984. Shortly after his arrival, the defendant secured employment and accepted an invitation to stay as a guest at a friend\u2019s home in Somerville.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On August 20, 1984, at approximately 3 a.m. , the defendant was stopped by the Cambridge police. Under the driver\u2019s seat of the defendant\u2019s car was the loaded .38 caliber firearm. The firearm was seized and the defendant was arrested. In a complaint on November 8, 1984, the defendant was charged with violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Pursuant to G. L: c. 218, \u00a7 26A (1984 ed.), the defendant waived his right to a first instance jury trial. The defendant was tried on January 24, 1985. He was found guilty, and he received the mandatory minimum one-year sentence required by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a). The defendant thereafter claimed a trial de nova pursuant to G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A (1984 ed.). That trial has been postponed pending the answer to the reported question.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">To carry a firearm lawfully within the Commonwealth, a person must either possess a valid license or qualify for one of the exemptions to the licensing requirements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735, 739 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>396 Mass. 840, 843-845 (1986). In this case, we must determine whether the defendant has satisfied the exemption set forth in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(3). This exemption provides a defense to a person charged with unlawfully carrying a firearm, if that person is \u201ccomplying with the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-nine C and one hundred and thirty-one G of chapter one hundred and forty.\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The defendant urges the court to interpret c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (3), so that a defendant who satisfies the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, is immune from prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">To adopt the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute would effectively disregard the distinction between the exemptions for the unlawful \u201cpossession\u201d of a firearm and the exemptions for the unlawful \u201ccarrying\u201d of a firearm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 405-406 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The individual exemptions set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, refer to those instances in which a person may \u201cown or <em>possess </em>[a] firearm, rifle, shotgun or ammunition\u201d without a firearm identification card issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B (1984 ed.) (emphasis supplied). The exemptions pertaining to the <em>carrying </em>of a firearm are set forth in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (l)-(4). The defendant does not meet any of the carrying exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">We acknowledge that the defendant was a \u201cnew resident\u201d of the Commonwealth within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (j), at the time of his arrest. See note 1 <em>supra. </em>This status entitled the defendant to own or to <em>possess </em>a firearm during his first sixty days in the State, notwithstanding his noncompliance with the ordinary licensing requirements. This exemption does not allow the defendant, however, to \u201ccarry\u201d a firearm during this same time period. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (j) (referring to possession).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We next consider the defendant\u2019s argument that requiring a person to comply with the provisions of both G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C and \u00a7 131G, essentially eliminates the exemption provided by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>{a) </em>(3). We note that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131G, by its own terms, permits the carrying of a firearm. Thus, there is no need to satisfy the provisions of both \u00a7\u00a7 129C and 131G of c. 140 in all circumstances. In this case, however, the defendant has only satisfied the exemption for possession. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (;).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The defendant also argues that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, as amended through St. 1984, c. 172 (effective October 7, 1984), represents a \u201cratification\u201d of his position that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, provides a defense to the charge of carrying a firearm unlawfully under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. The remainder of the statute, which was not changed by the amendment, provides, as we indicated, <em>supra, </em>a defense to the charge of the unlawful possession of a firearm, not to the charge of unlawfully carrying a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Our interpretation of this statute is \u201cconsistent with our firm and established view of the prohibitions of \u00a7 10 (a).\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>396 Mass. 840, 843 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The answer to the reported question is, \u201cYes.\u201d The case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> The parties have stipulated that the defendant was a \u201cnew resident\u201d of the Commonwealth within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C <em>(j) </em>(1984 ed.), at the time of his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The defendant cites four cases for the proposition that the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, provide a defense to the charge of unlawfully carrying a firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735, 739 n.2 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 520-525 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 405-406 (1978). Although the defendant\u2019s reading of these cases is plausible, it does not accurately represent the holdings of the courts. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, supra </em>at 405, the Appeals Court explicitly rejected the interpretation of the statute urged by the defendant. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 405-406 (1977) (compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 129C and \u00a7 131G required).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> We recognize that this statute may be thought to apply to a defendant who has been within the Commonwealth for no more than a few hours, en route to his new Massachusetts residence, when he is arrested. Obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the Legislature intended to protect new residents, but it did so in words which exempt the new resident only as to possession, not carrying. Possession of the firearm within the Commonwealth would ordinarily be preceded by at least a brief carrying of the firearm by the new arrival on the way to his new Massachusetts residence. The Legislature did not intend any exemption where, as in the case before us, the new resident was carrying the loaded gun in his automobile more than one month after he arrived in Massachusetts. The Legislature may wish to address the question whether a new resident in the Commonwealth for only a few hours en route to his new residence should face mandatory imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> Prior to St. 1984, c. 172, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, as amended through St. 1978, c. 551, \u00a7 1, read in part: \u201cNeither the provisions of [\u00a7 129C] nor the possession of a firearm identification card issued under [\u00a7 129B] shall entitle any person to carry a firearm in violation of [c. 269, \u00a7 10].\u201d Compare G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (1984 ed.): \u201cThe possession of a firearm identification card issued under [\u00a7 129B] shall not entitle any person to carry a firearm in violation of [c. 269, \u00a7 10].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
