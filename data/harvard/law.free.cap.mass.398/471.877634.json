A review examiner concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge from work was attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board of review of the division (board) denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for review. A judge of the District Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Because the board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for review, the decision of the review examiner is treated as that of the board. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 41 (c) (1984 ed.). The findings of the review examiner are as follows. The plaintiff worked for the West End House, a boys\u2019 club, as a director of physical education from September, 1980, until September, 1984. The plaintiff counseled and instructed youngsters in his capacity as a physical education director.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In July, 1984, the plaintiff was arrested by Boston police and charged with possession of marihuana with intent to distribute. On August 24, 1984, the plaintiff admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, and the case was continued without a finding for six months. On September 24, 1984, the plaintiff was discharged from his job. William Margolin, executive director of the employer, informed the plaintiff he had been terminated because of the charge against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the conclusion that he deliberately acted in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>asserts that his case is governed by our decision in <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>397 Mass. 433 (1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In <em>Wardell, </em>we held that a college employee\u2019s admission to sufficient facts on a charge of indecent assault and battery on a child aged fourteen or over did not provide substantial evidence for denial of unemployment benefits. In this case, as in <em>Wardell, </em>the defendant relies on an admission to sufficient facts and a continuance without a finding as sufficient evidence of deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of an employer\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cAn admission to sufficient facts, absent a subsequent finding of guilt, does not constitute substantial evidence from which a finder of fact in a collateral civil proceeding can determine that the alleged misconduct has indeed occurred\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Wardell, supra </em>at 436-437. Neither an arrest nor a criminal charge provides adequate evidence that an alleged crime was committed. <em>Id. </em>at 437. The plaintiff in this case never admitted any personal criminal involvement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On this record, the evidence is insufficient to warrant disqualification based on the alleged possession of marihuana with the intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">At oral argument, counsel for the division argued that the plaintiff\u2019s admission to sufficient facts itself constituted the deliberate misconduct. Counsel suggested that this court should develop a narrow exception to <em>Wardell </em>if an admission is clearly connected to an employer\u2019s interest. In this case, counsel suggested, the plaintiff\u2019s admission to sufficient facts concerning drug-related activity, given his employment as athletic director at a boys\u2019 club, was so closely allied with the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>er\u2019s interest in the well-being of its young members that the very making of the admission was deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">An admission to sufficient facts is not an act of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d The plaintiff is not to be faulted for following procedures permitted by Mass. R. Crim. P. 12 (a) (3), 378 Mass. 866 (1979). The use of a permissible procedure is not \u201cmisconduct.\u201d The division suggests that an admission to sufficient facts creates an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d However, such an appearance does not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), denies benefits when an employee \u201chas brought about his own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979). The critical issue is the employee\u2019s \u201cstate of mind in performing the acts that cause his discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 209 (1984); <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436 (1978). Even if, as counsel for the division argued, the plea reflected poorly on the employer, there is no evidence that the plea was entered with the intention of harming or tarnishing the image of the employer. The record reflects that the plaintiff claimed he was innocent; for all that is shown in the record, he may have admitted to sufficient facts to avoid the expense, publicity, and notoriety which a full trial might engender. See <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The board also suggests that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to inform his employer of the charge and of the legal proceedings constituted the relevant misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The employer bears the burden both of producing evidence regarding its expectations and of persuading the board of the sufficiency of that evidence. See <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>396 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>226, 231 (1985). There is no evidence in this case of a work rule or regulation, an employee handbook, or any other means of informing employees that they have a duty to report any and all arrests or admissions to sufficient facts. If an employer wants notice of such conduct, it may implement such a requirement by a rule, regulation, handbook, or some other method of notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In reaching this result, we express no opinion as to whether the employer was justified in discharging the plaintiff. That issue is not before us. We merely conclude on the record before us that the employee was not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits by reason of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of a judgment awarding benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2) (1984 ed.), provides that no benefits shall be paid to an individual who has left work \u201cby discharge shown to the satisfaction of the director to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> A letter dated October 3, 1984, indicates that the main reason for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge was the charge against him and \u201cthe subsequent failure of the court to find [him] innocent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\"> Although the plaintiff\u2019s brief mentions G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (3) (1984 ed.), in his argument, it is clear that the plaintiff is not subject to disqualification under that section of the statute. That section provides that no benefits shall be paid to an individual who has left work \u201cbecause of conviction of a felony or misdemeanor.\u201d Merely admitting to sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>facts to warrant a finding of guilty is not equivalent to a judgment or finding of guilt. See <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>397 Mass. 433, 435-436 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\"> Neither the District Court judge nor the board had the benefit of our decision in the <em>Wardell </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\"> The plaintiff claims that he met in his automobile with a person he was counseling and that the drugs were placed on the passenger side by that other person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> The record suggests that the main reason for the discharge was the charge and the admission to sufficient facts rather than the failure to inform the employer of the proceedings.
