The defendant had insured the vehicle against loss by theft but denied coverage on the ground that the plaintiff had intentionally procured the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">A judge of the Superior Court sitting without a jury concluded that the insurer had met its burden of proof on its affirmative defense and entered judgment for the defendant. Concluding that the judge had improperly shifted the burden of proof to the plaintiff, the Appeals Court reversed that judgment and ordered a new trial. <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 621-622 (1985). The Appeals Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>held that the judge had improperly drawn a conclusive inference against the plaintiff from the fact that she failed to deny explicitly in her testimony that she procured the loss of her automobile. We disagree with the Appeals Court. The judge did not shift the burden of proof to the plaintiff, and he was warranted in drawing an adverse inference from the plaintiff\u2019s failure to testify that she did not intentionally procure the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In his findings and rulings, the judge carefully considered the evidence and found \u201cthat the car was more probably than not deliberately destroyed by someone at the plaintiff\u2019s behest. \u201d The judge explicitly and correctly recognized that the burden of proof was on the insurer to prove its affirmative defense. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Travelers Fire Ins. Co., </em>288 Mass. 391, 393 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">After discussing the evidence on which he relied in concluding that the plaintiff had obtained someone to take the car and bum it, the judge added a paragraph to his findings and rulings that caused the Appeals Court to reverse the judgment. In that paragraph, which we set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge as the trier of fact gave weight to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deny on the stand that she hired someone to steal and burn her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The judge responded as any juror or judge, acting on common sense, might have in the circumstances. The plaintiff knew of the insurer\u2019s defense when she testified but she did not deny it. She did not resume the stand in rebuttal after the insurer made a prima facie case in support of its affirmative defense. A reasonable trier of fact might well note that omission. For us to say in a civil action that the trier of fact could not give weight to the plaintiff\u2019s silence, in the face of evidence warranting a finding against her, is to reject practicalities. In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>event, the judge did not shift the burden of proof to the plaintiff. As a fact finder he simply gave weight, but not conclusive weight, to the absence of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The judge\u2019s recognition of the absence of a denial from the plaintiff was not only reasonable and practical but also legally permissible. We have long recognized that, in a civil action, once the party having the burden of proof has presented a prima facie case, it is proper to argue to a jury that the party not having the burden of proof did not testify on a matter apparently within that party\u2019s knowledge. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Silverstein, </em>323 Mass. 239, 240 (1948); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>307 Mass. 163, 164-165 (1940). Cf. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fall River Educators Ass\u2019n, </em>382 Mass. 465, 471-472 (1981) (refusal to testify on matters peculiarly within knowledge of witness warrants adverse inference, even if party with control of witness did not have burden of proof). In effect, the plaintiff faced both an allegation that she had engaged in criminal conduct and evidence establishing a prima facie case in support of that charge. In these circumstances, an inference against the plaintiff, having probative force, was warranted. <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 316 (1922). See also <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616 (1986). Although \u201cthe adverse inference drawn from the failure of a party to testify is not sufficient, by itself, to meet an opponent\u2019s burden of proof,\u201d the trier of fact may rely in part on such an inference if a case adverse to a nontestifying party\u2019s interests has been presented. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge, therefore, was plainly warranted within these legal principles in placing \u201cparticular significance\u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deny her complicity in the disappearance and destruction of her motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s ruling, implicit in the remand of this case for a new trial, that the evidence warranted a finding for the insurer on its affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> \u201cIn addition to the foregoing, I noticed at the trial that although the plaintiff testified at some length, she at no time unequivocally denied having hired some person to steal and torch the automobile. Both she and her sister testified that they had met no one at the Mall [from which the plaintiff asserted her vehicle had been stolen] \u2014 but the plaintiff never stated that she had not prearranged the theft. The absence of such testimony is of particular significance because it was clear from the beginning that the defendant\u2019s defense to the action was that the plaintiff had herself intentionally caused or procured the loss. That defense was set forth in the Answer which was filed on July 20, 1982.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
