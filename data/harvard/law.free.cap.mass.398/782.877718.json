A judge of the Superior Court reported the case to the Appeals Court in accordance with Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), and we allowed Thomas\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">The following facts were stipulated by the parties. The plaintiff was insured by the defendant, The Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford), under a Massachusetts motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>vehicle insurance policy which provided coverage for the plaintiff\u2019s 1973 Plymouth automobile. Thomas was the only operator listed on that policy, and the Plymouth was the only vehicle described on his policy. The policy provided optional medical payments coverage with limits of $5,000 per person, for which Thomas paid an additional premium of $6.00. The vehicle owned by the plaintiff\u2019s wife, Lois E. Thomas, was insured by Hartford under a separate Massachusetts motor vehicle insurance policy that also provided optional medical payments coverage with limits of $5,000 per person for an additional $6.00 premium. The policy listed Lois E. Thomas as the only operator of the 1969 Rambler and the Rambler was the only vehicle described on her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Thomas was injured on December 7, 1981, while operating the 1969 Rambler owned by Lois E. Thomas. As a result, Thomas incurred medical expenses in excess of $22,000. Hartford paid Thomas $5,000 pursuant to the medical payments coverage provided under Lois E. Thomas\u2019s policy of insurance, but has refused to pay Thomas any medical payments benefits under his own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Thomas\u2019s coverage is determined by the terms of his policy. Hartford argues that no medical payments coverage is available to Thomas in this case because of the exclusion contained within Part 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201cWe will <em>not </em>pay for [medical] expenses resulting from injuries to: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201c5. Anyone injured while occupying or struck by an auto owned or regularly used by you or any household member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections page.\" (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">At the time of the accident, Thomas was operating a motor vehicle owned by his spouse, with whom he resides. Therefore, the terms of Thomas\u2019s policy preclude recovery \u2019\u2019unless a premium for [medical payments] is shown for [Lois E. Thomas\u2019s] auto on the Coverage Selections page.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The Thomases\u2019 automobiles were insured under two separate insurance contracts with Hartford. Lois E. Thomas\u2019s Rambler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>was not mentioned on the coverage selections page of Thomas\u2019s policy for the Plymouth, nor was an additional medical payments premium paid for Lois E. Thomas\u2019s Rambler on Thomas\u2019s policy. Under the clear terms of the policy, Thomas is not entitled to receive medical payments benefits under his own policy for injuries received while he was operating his spouse\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Our conclusion is not altered by Thomas\u2019s reference to a further provision of Part 6 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201cIf someone covered under this Part is also entitled to Medical Payments coverage under another auto policy issued to you or any household member, we will pay only our proportionate share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201cIf someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner\u2019s automobile Medical Payments insurance must pay its limit before we pay. Then, we will pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage Selections page for any expenses not covered by that insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Where there is no ambiguity, we will construe the terms of an exclusionary clause according to their ordinary meaning. <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>385 Mass. 1013 (1982). Since Thomas is expressly excluded from medical payments coverage by the quoted paragraph 5 of Part 6, <em>supra, </em>he is not \u201csomeone covered under this Part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The result is consistent with our holding in <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, supra. </em>In <em>Schultz, </em>we applied a \u201cregular use exclusion\u201d barring recovery of optional uninsured motorist benefits for a 1978 accident. The words of the exclusionary clause here are virtually identical to the terms in <em>Schultz. </em>Although <em>Schultz </em>involved optional uninsured motorist coverage, our interpretation of the policy language in the present case is supported by the conclusion reached in <em>Schultz </em>that once the moped was deemed to fall within the term \u201cauto\u201d as a \u201cland motor vehicle,\u201d the regular use exclusion operated to prevent recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Accordingly, we remand this case to the Superior Court with instructions that a judgment be entered declaring that the exclusion contained within the plaintiff\u2019s policy precludes his recovery of medical payment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
