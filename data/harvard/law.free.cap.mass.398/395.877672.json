(1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984). We transferred the case here on our own motion, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We summarize the facts. Prior to 1974, the plaintiff was chairman of the department of languages, and professor of Spanish and Italian, at Newton College of the Sacred Heart. This college closed in 1975. After completing a research fellowship at Boston College, the plaintiff accepted a position as lecturer in the Italian department at the University of Massachusetts at Boston (university). In 1979, the plaintiff applied for an advertised tenure track position in the Spanish department at the university. The advertisement stated that the university was seeking an individual with \u201cspecial training or experience in Applied Linguistics and to serve as Coordinator of first and second year courses in Spanish.\u201d Candidates were directed to contact Professor James Ryan,&lt; chairman of the Spanish department.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The plaintiff initiated an application for this position by telephoning Ryan. Unbeknownst to Ryan, the plaintiff tape recorded their telephone conversation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ryan told the plaintiff that the department was \u201clooking for some younger people.\u201d The plaintiff was fifty-one years old at the time of his application. Nonetheless, Ryan requested the plaintiff to forward his curriculum vitae and list of linguistics courses for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The plaintiff, along with five other final candidates, was interviewed for this position by the Spanish department\u2019s personnel committee. Ryan, as chairman of the department, was an ex officio, nonvoting member of the committee. The committee ultimately voted to recommend that an offer be extended to another candidate, Professor Esther Torrego, who was then thirty-three years old. Members of the committee testified that the ages of the applicants were not considered by the committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>in the selection process. Ryan forwarded the committee\u2019s recommendation, with his approval, to the dean, who extended the formal offer to Torrego. Ryan informed the plaintiff that he had not been selected for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff brought suit against the university and Ryan in 1980, alleging that the defendants had discriminated against him in employment on account of his age, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq. (1982 &amp; Supp. II1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In their answer, the defendants denied that the refusal or failure to hire the plaintiff was based on his age. The defendant Ryan also counterclaimed against the plaintiff under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 Q (1984 ed.), which provides a civil remedy for the unauthorized interception of oral or wire communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The case was tried before a jury in May, 1984. At the close of trial, the judge delivered a charge to the jury which in large measure tracked the language of <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir. 1979), a decision construing the ADEA. The parties did not object to these instructions. We quote at length from the judge\u2019s charge, as it bears directly on the issues raised by the plaintiff on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff \u201cmust persuade you that age was a determining factor in [his] not being hired. It need not be the sole factor for not obtaining the position sought, but rather it must be a determining factor. . . . But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>for his prospective employer\u2019s motive to discriminate against him on account of age, would he have been hired for the position for which he had applied?\u201d This \u201cdetermining factor\u201d standard of causation has been adopted by numerous Federal courts which have interpreted the ADEA. See <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Prudential Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>763 F.2d 1166, 1170 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 946 (1985); <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Sun Elec. Corp., 696 </em>F.2d 1176, 1181 (6th Cir. 1983); <em>Geller </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>635 F.2d 1027, 1035 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., supra </em>at 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The judge further instructed the jury that \u201c[y]ou will be warranted ... in finding that the plaintiff was discriminated against because of his age if the plaintiff proves to you \u2014 that is, if you are persuaded by the greater weight of the evidence that, first of all, he applied ... for a job that the Commonwealth was seeking to fill; second, that he was within the protected age bracket of that statute; that is, that he was between the ages of 40 and 70, and if he was below that it would be of no consequence; third, he must prove to you that he was qualified for the job; fourth, that despite his qualifications he was not hired; fifth, a person with equal or inferior qualifications who was younger or outside the protected age group was hired; and sixth, all of the stated reasons given as to why he was not hired were a pretext or cover-up for not hiring him.\u201d This instruction tracks the order and burden of proof for disparate treatment cases first enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973) (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and generally applied in the age discrimination context by the lower Federal courts. See <em>Tribble </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 669 </em>F.2d 1193, 1196 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1080 (1983); <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>646 F.2d 407, 411 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., supra </em>at 1016. See also TWA v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985) (\u201cinterpretation of Title VII . . . applies with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA \u2018were derived <em>in haec verba </em>from Title VIF \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Finally, the judge instructed the jury that both the university and Ryan could be held liable for any causative discrimination. \u201cNow the word \u2018employer\u2019 under that statute includes a state, such as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or any of its agencies. It includes the University of Massachusetts, and any agent. And there\u2019s no question, I\u2019ve already told you that the University of Massachusetts is an agency of the Commonwealth, and the defendant James Ryan is an agent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. So both Massachusetts and Dr. Ryan could not, or were not permitted by statute to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of his age.\u201d See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630 (b) (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Based on these instructions, the jury were given a special verdict sheet with five questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reporting their answers, the jury were discharged. Both sides moved for entry of judgment in their favor, and the judge heard argument on these motions. The plaintiff argued that Question 3 was unnecessary to the judgment as a matter of law and should be disregarded, and that judgment should be entered against both defendants based on the jury\u2019s answer to Question 2. In the alternative, the plaintiff argued that the jury\u2019s answers to Questions 2 and 3 were inconsistent, and that a new trial should be ordered. Finally, the plaintiff moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Based on the jury\u2019s answers to the questions, the judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claims of age discrimination against both defendants, and entered judgment for the defendant Ryan in the amount of $2,000 on his counterclaim under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>c. 272, \u00a7 99 Q.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed. The sole question presented on appeal is whether the judge acted properly in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claims under the ADEA based on the jury\u2019s answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We conclude that the judge acted properly in dismissing the claims against the defendants. In entering judgment based on the jury\u2019s answers to the questions, the judge was required to make every effort to harmonize the jury\u2019s answers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWhere there is a view of the case that makes the jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.\u201d <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 659, 664 (1976), quoting <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 </em>U.S. 355, 364 (1962) (harmonization rule avoids \u201ccollision with the Seventh Amendment\u201d). <em>See Holder </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 218 (1985). In this case, we do not perceive any inconsistency between the jury\u2019s answers, or between their answers and the judge\u2019s instructions. Question 1 is directed at the liability of the university, and the jury specifically found that the Commonwealth did not refuse to hire the plaintiff on account of his age. Questions 2 and 3 are directed at the liability of Ryan. Although the jury found in their answer to Question 2 that Ryan harbored a discriminatory motive against the plaintiff, their answer to Question 3 indicates that Ryan \u2019 s discrimination was not a causative factor in the plaintiff\u2019s failure to be hired by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The plaintiff argues that Question 3 is irrelevant as a matter of law, and that judgment should have been entered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Ryan on the basis of the jury\u2019s answer to Question 2. In support of this contention, the plaintiff asserts that an agent is considered an \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 630(a) of the ADEA, and that an affirmative finding that Ryan \u201cdiscriminated\u201d against the plaintiff (answer to Question 2) is sufficient to impose liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff confuses the definition of employer with the ultimate issue of causation. Although Ryan is properly considered an \u201cemployer\u201d subject to the proscriptions of the ADEA, see <em>Lettich </em>v. <em>Kenway, </em>590 F. Supp. 1225 (D. Mass. 1984); <em>Seider </em>v. <em>Canada Dry Corp., </em>17 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) par. 8,369 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), he is only liable under the terms of the statute if he \u201crefuse[d] to hire\u201d the plaintiff because of his age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a) (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984). A discriminatory motive, absent a causative impact on the conditions of employment, is not actionable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Kumar </em>v. <em>Trustees, Univ. of Mass., </em>774 F.2d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 1985) (Campbell, J., concurring), rev\u2019g, 566 F. Supp. 1299 (D. Mass. 1984) (no showing that alleged discrimination by dean corrupted adverse tenure decision of chancellor); <em>Padway </em>v. <em>Palches, </em>665 F.2d 965, 967 (9th Cir. 1982) (school superintendent liable for sexual discrimination if trustees relied on him in decision to discharge). The judge adequately explained this principle to the jury: \u201cFirst you\u2019ve got to decide was there discrimination because of age. That itself isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ve got to convince yourself that but for that discrimination he would have been hired.\u201d Since the jury specifically found in their answer to Question 3 that the Commonwealth did not \u201cfail or refuse to hire the plaintiff because of the defendant lames Ryan\u2019s discrimination,\u201d the judge appropriately dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>claims under the ADEA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the judge aptly stated in his ruling, \u201cto hold otherwise would mean that non-causal discrimination in a vacuum is a basis for civil liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the judge erred in excluding certain testimony of Alan Francis, a former professor in the Spanish department of the university. Francis testified that Ryan told him that \u201cthe department was looking for younger people.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked Francis about the degree of deference among department members for Ryan\u2019s views as chairman. Upon objection by defense counsel, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof that, if allowed, Francis would testify that Ryan was a \u201cvery definite force\u201d in the department and not a mere \u201cfigurehead.\u201d The judge ruled that there was insufficient foundation for this question, and excluded the testimony. There was no error. The plaintiff did not establish that Francis had any personal knowledge which would support an opinion regarding Ryan\u2019s influence in the department; Francis was not a member of the personnel committee, and there was no evidence that he had any familiarity with the hiring process or other administrative concerns of the department chairman. On this basis, and assuming that the elicited opinion would be admissible if a proper foundation were laid, the judge acted within his sound discretion in excluding the testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, 367 </em>Mass. 169, 182 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In sum, based upon the judge\u2019s unimpeachable instructions to the jury, the evidence in the case, and the jury\u2019s answers to the questions, there was no error in the judge\u2019s rulings (1) ordering dismissal of the complaint, and (2) denying the plaintiff\u2019s motions for directed verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial. The evidence warranted conclusions that the ultimate authority to hire rested with the dean, and that the personnel committee did not consider age a factor in making its recommendation. The evidence also warranted a conclusion that the Commonwealth did not fail or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>refuse to hire the plaintiff because of his age, and the jury found that as a fact in their answer to Question 1. The evidence further warranted a conclusion that the Commonwealth did not fail or refuse to hire the plaintiff because of Ryan\u2019s discrimination, and the jury so concluded, as shown in their answer to Question 3. While it may have been open to the jury to decide that Ryan\u2019s discriminatory motive somehow tainted the hiring decision, that clearly was not their conclusion. Accordingly, judgment for both defendants was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> According to the plaintiff, he had been alerted to Ryan\u2019s predisposition on the subject of age through prior conversations with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> Section 623(a) of the ADEA provides, in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for an employer\u2014 (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Section 630(b) defines \u201cemployer\u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018employer\u2019 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or proceeding calendar year ....
