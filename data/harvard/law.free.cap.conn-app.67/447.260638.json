Under that statute, if a grantor does not subscribe to a deed \u201cwith his own hand,\u201d his name may be affixed by a person with a power of attorney. The principal issue in this case is whether this statutory directive may be waived by a grantor who has designated a surrogate signer by a specific grant of authority that is not in the form of a power of attorney. This is an issue of first impression. The trial court, concluding that use of a power of attorney was not always mandatory, rendered judgment denying the grantor\u2019s claim that the absence of a power of attorney entitled him to set aside a conveyance under the circumstances of this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On February 3, 1993, the plaintiff, Patrick A. Treglia, brought an action to quiet title and for compensatory and punitive damages against his former attorney, Robert G. Zanesky; his brother, Michael Treglia (brother); and subsequent titleholders to the property at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants filed answers, special defenses and counterclaims. In addition, some of the defendants filed cross claims against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The plaintiffs complaint included a claim that someone other than the plaintiff had signed the plaintiffs name to the contract and warranty deed and that his brother had wrongfully kept proceeds from the sale. The court refused to charge the jury on forgery and refused to propound an interrogatory on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant Norwalk Savings Society filed a motion seeking to preclude the risk of double recovery by requiring the plaintiff to make an election of remedies between his claim for monetary damages and his claimed right to a decree that would quiet title. The court denied this motion before the presentation of the evidence, but subsequently required such an election after all the evidence had been presented. Over protest, the plaintiff elected to pursue his quiet title claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The jury returned its verdict in favor of all the defendants in accordance with its answers to a set of interrogatories. The court accepted the verdict of the jury and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The plaintiff has appealed from the judgment against him. In particular, he maintains that the court improperly denied his motions for directed verdict and to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories and the record as a whole reveal the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From 1979 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to 1986, the plaintiff, his brother and their father, Frank Treglia (father), jointly owned a tract of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>located in Norwalk. During that time period, all three owners had participated in making repairs to the property and in collecting rent from tenants. The plaintiff, however, had left all business transactions to his father and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In February, 1986, the plaintiffs father and brother contracted to sell the Norwalk property to the defendant Pontos Realty, Inc. (Pontos). The contract of sale, duly recorded, contained the signatures of the father and the brother, as well as the purported signature of the plaintiff. Although concededly the plaintiff did not sign his own name on the contract, the jury made no finding as to who had done so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contract set the purchase price at $100,000 to be paid by a promissory note in that amount payable to the plaintiffs brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In accordance with the contract of sale, the property was conveyed to Pontos by a warranty deed that purported to bear the signatures of all three owners. The plaintiff was not present at the closing and, therefore, did not sign his own name. The father signed the plaintiffs name to the deed, in accordance with the grant of authority given to him by the plaintiff to affix the plaintiffs signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Pontos note was secured by two mortgages, duly recorded, to the defendants Norwalk Savings Society and the redevelopment agency of the city of Norwalk. In December, 1990, the defendant Alfred Kery obtained title to a portion of the property from Pontos.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Although the plaintiff knew in 1986 that the property was on the market to be sold, he did not discover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>facts of the sale to Pontos until 1990.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the jury found that he had conducted himself in a way \u201cintended or calculated to induce\u201d the purchasing defendants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to believe that \u201cthey were receiving or had received good title to the property.\u201d The jury further found that the plaintiff had waited too long to raise his claim of ownership and that the purchasing defendants had been prejudiced by the plaintiffs delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On appeal from the judgment of the trial court, the plaintiff does not claim that the factual findings of the jury were clearly erroneous. He does, however, raise three issues of law in which he claims that the court improperly (1) refused to enforce the statutory requirement that a representative signing the name of a grantor must have a valid power of attorney, (2) required the plaintiff to elect remedies prior to submission of the case to the jury, and (3) refused to charge the jury on forgery and on related compensatory damages. The plaintiff also raises three issues in which he claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying (1) the plaintiffs motion for directed verdict on the special defenses of laches and estoppel, (2) the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict on the ground of inconsistent answers to interrogatories, and (3) the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for directed verdict and to set aside the verdict as to his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7 47-5</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The plaintiff challenges the propriety of a judgment that validates a conveyance despite noncompliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>with the statutory formalities for conveyance, specifically those relating to the power of attorney, set out in \u00a7 47-5 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that this statutory provision is a mandatory condition that must be met to effectuate a valid conveyance and, accordingly, that noncompliance with the formal procedure renders a conveyance null and void. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">To determine whether the trial court improperly sanctioned a departure from the statute, we engage in plenary review because this is a question of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Willow Funding Co., L.P. </em>v. <em>Grencom Associates, </em>63 Conn. App. 832, 840, 779 A.2d 174 (2001). The issue is whether a deed of conveyance may be validly signed by a grantor\u2019s representative who is someone other than an attorney \u201cauthorized for that purpose by a power executed, acknowledged and witnessed in the manner provided for conveyances . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-5 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that, without a power of attorney, a conveyance is void and therefore can be set aside at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Connecticut cases have held that a conveyance of property rights is not automatically nullified by lack of adherence to certain formalities. While earlier common law required strict observance of formalities associated with the conveyance of property rights, \u201c[subsequent decisions . . . have sufficiently modified the common law rule so as to put into question whether a different result ... is required .... Under the modified rule, a deed manifesting one cotenant\u2019s attempted transfer of an interest is <em>voidable, not void. </em>Consequently, such a deed is susceptible of ratification. The deed can also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>operate as an estoppel against the grantor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ianotti </em>v. <em>Ciccio, </em>219 Conn. 36, 44, 591 A.2d 797 (1991); see also <em>Pastine </em>v. <em>Altman, </em>93 Conn. 707, 713, 107 A. 803 (1919); <em>Hartford &amp; Salisbury Ore Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>41 Conn. 112 (1874). In <em>Ianotti, </em>our Supreme Court recognized that one cotenant\u2019s attempt to convey an interest in a portion of property did not render the conveyance void. <em>Ianotti </em>v. <em>Ciccio, </em>supra, 44. Rather, under some circumstances, the conveyance may be set aside as voidable if the power to set aside has been effectively exercised. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Similarly, in this case, we conclude that lack of adherence to the statutory formalities set out in \u00a7 47-5 (a) rendered the 1986 deed of conveyance voidable, but not void. We do not intend to give a carte blanche approval to any deviation from the statute. The jury here found, however, that the plaintiff \u201cgave permission to or granted authority to his father to sign his name on the 1986 deed of conveyance.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find it significant that the juiy\u2019s finding focused on authority to sign the plaintiffs name specifically on the 1986 deed of conveyance. This finding is particularly relevant to laying a factual foundation for the purchasing defendants\u2019 special defenses of laches and estoppel. It also establishes, however, the specific authority given to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We cannot create a bright line test to distinguish permissible deviations from the statute from those that are impermissible. We conclude, therefore, that under the special circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs statutory claim is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">ELECTION OF REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly required him to make an election of remedies prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the court\u2019s submission of the case to the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is a question of law and therefore merits plenary review. See <em>Faught </em>v. <em>Edgewood, </em>63 Conn. App. 164, 172, 772 A.2d 1142, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 934, 776 A.2d 1150 (2001). We again disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The plaintiff argues that he may seek both monetary compensation and quiet title in separate causes of action against different defendants. The plaintiff, however, mistakes a party\u2019s right to plead alternate theories of liability with a right to seek inconsistent remedies that could result in double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In support of his position, the plaintiff relies on cases in which an election of remedies was not required <em>prior </em>to the commencement of trial and on cases allowing claims inconsistent with claims raised in previous attempts to recover a nonexistent remedy. See, e.g., <em>Friederichsen </em>v. <em>Renard, </em>247 U.S. 207, 38 S. Ct. 450, 62 L. Ed. 1075 (1918); <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>123 Conn. 468, 196 A. 344 (1937); <em>Abbadessa </em>v. <em>Puglisi, </em>101 Conn. 1, 124 A. 838 (1924). The issue of pretrial election of remedies is not before us in this case. It was only after all evidence had been presented that the plaintiff was required to make his election. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not precluded from attempting to recover on a claim that was inconsistent with a prior attempt to recover a nonexistent remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The plaintiff also invokes cases holding that a litigant is entitled to proceed on inconsistent theories of recovery. See, e.g., <em>DeLucia </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>11 Conn. App. 439, 446-47, 527 A.2d 1234, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 803, 531 A.2d 935 (1987); <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>13 Conn. App. 101, 105-106, 535 A.2d 364 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 807, 540 A.2d 375 (1988). While a trial court has a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to determine which of conflicting sets of facts a party has proved; see <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 107; that duty is relevant only to a party pleading alternate theories of liability. In this case, the plaintiff did not present inconsistent sets of facts in support of alternate theories of liability, among which the fact finder might choose in order to determine which had been proven. Rather, we agree with the defendants that the multiple remedies requested by the plaintiff could have resulted in double recovery. The plaintiff has provided us with no authority, and we know of none, that supports his contention that an election of remedies at the close of a jury trial is improper under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">FORGERY AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly refused to charge the jury on forgery and compensatory damages relating to conversion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The plaintiff asserts that the jury should have been charged on forgery because the jury\u2019s finding on conversion and on damages was inextricably linked with its finding on forgery. The plaintiff further asserts that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-565, the jury should have been charged on double damages related to forgery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, however, that claims of forgery and of related damages were preserved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u201cA fundamental tenet in our law is that the plaintiffs complaint defines the dimensions of the issues to be litigated. [T]he right of a plaintiff to recover is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to the allegations of [her] complaint. . . . The purpose of the complaint is to limit the issues to be decided at the trial of a case and is calculated to prevent surprise. ... A plaintiff may not allege one cause of action and recover upon another.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pergament </em>v. <em>Green, </em>32 Conn. App. 644, 650, 630 A.2d 615, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 903, 634 A.2d 296 (1993); see also <em>Aksomitas </em>v. <em>Aksomitas, </em>205 Conn. 93, 102, 529 A.2d 1314 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In this case, the plaintiffs complaint contained no reference to forgery or to double damages related thereto. The complaint alleged only that \u201ca person other than the plaintiff signed the plaintiffs name to said contract and warranty deed without the knowledge, consent, authority or ratification of the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff has made no showing that this pleading raises questions of forgery or double damages. His claim, therefore, is unsustainable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">SPECIAL DEFENSES OF LACHES AND ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a directed verdict with respect to the purchasing defendants\u2019 special defenses of laches and estoppel. In support of his claim, the plaintiff maintains that the jury verdict was unreasonable in light of the defendants\u2019 failure to prove their interest and to plead facts sufficient to support the special defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">We first articulate the standard by which we review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict. \u201cDirected verdicts are not favored. . . . Our review of a trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict . . . takes place within carefully defined parameters. We must consider the evidence, including reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>able to the parties who were successful at trial . . . giving particular weight to the concurrence of the judgments of the judge and the jury, who saw the witnesses and heard the testimony .... The verdict will be set aside and judgment directed only if we find that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached their conclusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>John T. Brady &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>220 Conn. 432, 440-41, 599 A.2d 370 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The defense of laches, if proven, bars a plaintiff from seeking equitable relief in a case in which there has been an inexcusable delay that has prejudiced the defendant. \u201cFirst, there must have been a delay that was inexcusable, and, second, that delay must have prejudiced the defendant. ... A conclusion that a party has been guilty of laches is one of fact for the trier and not one that can be made by this court, unless the subordinate facts found make such a conclusion inevitable as a matter of law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>216 Conn. 341, 350, 579 A.2d 1054 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defense of estoppel must be supported by proof of two essential elements: \u201c(1) the party against whom estoppel is claimed must be shown to have done or said something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and (2) the other party must be shown to have changed its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. . . . An estoppel is predicated on proof of misleading conduct resulting in prejudice to the other party. . . . The party claiming estoppel has the burden of proof, and whether it has met that burden of proof in a particular case is an issue of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 768, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In this case, the purchasing defendants presented to the jury sufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements of the defenses of laches and estoppel. Both of these special defenses involved fact specific inquiries into the conduct of the plaintiff and the reliance of these defendants on that conduct. The plaintiff has not challenged the facts found by the jury. A fortiori, the jury\u2019s verdict is not unreasonable as a matter of law. The trial court properly denied the plaintiffs motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">INCONSISTENT INTERROGATORIES</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict because certain responses to the jury\u2019s interrogatories were inconsistent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside a verdict by an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Connecticut National Bank v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>46 Conn. App. 199, 214-15, 699 A.2d 237, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 926, 701 A.2d 657 (1997). \u201cThe role of an appellate court where an appellant seeks a judgment contrary to a general verdict on the basis of the jury\u2019s allegedly inconsistent answers to such interrogatories is extremely limited.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>242 Conn. 255, 269, 698 A.2d 838 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The standard for a trial court to review a jury\u2019s responses to interrogatories also is particularly narrow. The role of the court is not \u201cto search the record for conflicting answers in order to take the case away from the jury on a theory that gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences.\u201d <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>203 Conn. 594, 606, 525 A.2d 1332 (1987). Rather, \u201c[w]hen a claim is made that the jury\u2019s answers to interrogatories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>in returning a verdict are inconsistent, the court has the duty to attempt to harmonize the answers.\u201d Id. \u201cTo justify the entry of a judgment contrary to a general verdict upon the basis of answers to interrogatories, those answers must be such in themselves as <em>conclusively </em>to show that as [a] matter of law judgment could only be rendered for the party against whom the general verdict was found; they must negative every reasonable hypothesis as to the situation provable under the issues made by the pleadings; and in determining that, the court may consider only the issues framed by the pleadings, the general verdict and the interrogatories, with the answers made to them, without resort to the evidence offered at the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The plaintiff first asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because the jury\u2019s responses to the interrogatories related to the special defenses of laches and estoppel were inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding relating to the plaintiffs knowledge of the 1986 sale. He asks how he could have been estopped by an event about which he did not know. The answer to his question is that the interrogatory answers were more encompassing than he represents them to be. The jury found in its answer to interrogatory number eleven that \u201cthe plaintiff waited an unreasonable or inexcusable amount of time between the time that <em>he first learned the property was to be sold </em>or had been sold and the time that he first made a claim of ownership to the property\u201d (emphasis added) and, in its answer to interrogatory number twelve that the purchasing defendants had been prejudiced by that delay.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Interrogatory number eleven refers to the time when the plaintiff first learned that the property was <em>to be sold. </em>Even though the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>had no knowledge of the <em>actual sale </em>prior to 1990, the jury finding in interrogatory number three stated that the plaintiff had given his father authority to sign his name on the 1986 warranty deed. Taken together, these answers support a finding that the plaintiff had knowledge in 1986 that the property was to be sold.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> So interpreted, there is no inconsistency between the jury\u2019s responses to the interrogatories related to laches and estoppel, on the one hand, and to lack of actual knowledge until 1990 on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The plaintiff also claims that it was inconsistent for the jury to respond negatively to interrogatories number two and five and affirmatively to interrogatory number nine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The jury found in response to interrogatory number two that the plaintiff had no actual knowledge of the sale prior to February of 1990. Interrogatories number five and nine asked the jury to find whether the plaintiff had conducted himself in a manner intended or calculated to induce certain beliefs in the defendants. In response, the jury found that the plaintiffs conduct intentionally induced the purchasing defendants to believe that they were receiving or had received good title, but did not intentionally induce his brother to believe that he was no longer interested in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">These answers to the interrogatories are not necessarily inconsistent because they can be harmonized so as to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 606. The jury\u2019s findings relating to the plaintiffs conduct did not specify any particular time period. Rather, they referred to a period \u201cbefore, during and/or after the sale of the property in 1986.\u201d The jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>finding that the plaintiff had given authority to his father to sign the plaintiffs name on the 1986 warranty deed implies that the plaintiff knew that the property was to be sold at that time. Therefore, the jury\u2019s findings relating to the plaintiffs conduct do not necessarily conflict with the jury\u2019s finding relating to when the plaintiff discovered the <em>actual sale. </em>Moreover, the jury found in interrogatory number eleven that the plaintiff waited an unreasonable amount of time to claim ownership of the property after learning that the property was to be sold or had been sold. In light of the plaintiffs knowledge in 1986 that the property was to be sold, his grant of authority to his father to convey the property and his failure to claim ownership earlier, the jury reasonably could have considered his delay to be an intentional inducement of certain beliefs in the purchasing defendants. Finally, the jury\u2019s responses to interrogatories number five and nine are not inconsistent with one another because they pertain to the plaintiffs conduct with respect to different defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We conclude that the answers to the interrogatories are not irreconcilable. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to set aside the verdict on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">CONVERSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The plaintiffs final claim challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for directed verdict and to set aside the verdict against his brother, Michael Treglia. The plaintiff maintains that no reasonable jury could have failed to find the brother liable for falsely signing the plaintiffs name on the contract of sale and for converting the sale proceeds. This claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In its response to the interrogatories, the jury found that the plaintiff had not proven that his brother had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cconverted the property of the plaintiff by assuming authority over and dealing with the net proceeds of the sale in a manner adverse to and inconsistent with the rights of the plaintiff. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that this finding cannot be sustained because there was undisputed evidence that the brother signed the plaintiffs name.
