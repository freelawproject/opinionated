J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYYu\">The petitioner, Richard BaiUargeon, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claims that the habeas court improperly (1) held that neither his trial nor sentencing counsel was ineffective, (2) applied the Strickland<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standard to his attempt to withdraw his plea and (3) failed to address his claim that the state lacked a factual basis for charging him with the crime to which he pleaded guilty. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">According to the factual statement made by the state at his sentencing hearing, the petitioner took a female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>to a reservoir in Killingly against her will where he forced her to engage in intercourse. The habeas court found that the attack occurred on July 12, 1994, and that the victim filed a complaint with the police on August 12, 1994. The police questioned the petitioner later that month, and he voluntarily gave a statement claiming that the intercourse was consensual. An arrest warrant was issued on March 15, 1995, and he was arrested on March 20, 1995. He then made a second statement in which he admitted that he had lied in his first statement and that the intercourse was forced.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">On March 26, 1996, the day that his case was scheduled for jury selection, the petitioner pleaded guilty in accordance with <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), to sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court canvassed the petitioner in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 711, now \u00a7 39-19, and found the plea to be \u201centered voluntarily and understandingly, and with the assistance of competent counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the petitioner\u2019s request, the court scheduled sentencing for May 3, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Between the time of his plea and sentencing, the petitioner expressed dissatisfaction with his appointed counsel, Ramon J. Canning of the public defender\u2019s office for the judicial district of Windham, and his desire to fire Canning, to withdraw his plea and to have a trial on the merits. He unsuccessfully attempted to castrate himself to draw attention to his plight, and sent a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>to the court with copies to the news media, the governor and other public officials that detailed his situation and proclaimed his innocence. He also filed a grievance against Canning with the statewide grievance committee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">At Canning\u2019s request, attorney Lawrence Bates, Jr., represented the defendant at the sentencing hearing. The trial court treated the petitioner\u2019s letter as a request to withdraw his plea in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 720,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> now \u00a7 39-26. Because the court already had accepted the defendant\u2019s plea, the court analyzed whether the petitioner had proved one of the exceptions set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 721,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> now \u00a7 39-27, and concluded that the petitioner was seeking to withdraw his plea because of ineffective assistance of counsel. After a colloquy with Bates, the court denied the petitioner\u2019s request to withdraw his plea and imposed the previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>agreed upon sentence of fifteen years incarceration, suspended after ten years, with five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On January 3, 2000, the petitioner filed a second amended habeas corpus petition, claiming that both Canning and Bates were ineffective. The habeas court conducted a trial and dismissed the petition in a memorandum of decision filed January 31, 2000. It concluded that Canning\u2019s performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial and Bates\u2019 performance, while deficient, was not prejudicial. A petition for certification to appeal from that court\u2019s decision was granted and this appeal followed. The petitioner largely restates the claims set forth in his habeas petition and asks that we reverse that court\u2019s decision and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We first note our standard of review. \u201cIn a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 59 Conn. App. 302, 303, 755 A.2d 380, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 943, 761 A.2d 760 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">With that standard in mind, we assess the petitioner\u2019s claims. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The petitioner\u2019s first two claims allege that both appointed counsel were ineffective because of their failure to investigate his case adequately. Arguing the inverse of the habeas court\u2019s findings, he claims that his first attorney\u2019s representation was deficient and prejudicial and that his second attorney\u2019s representation was prejudicial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Because a defendant often relies heavily on counsel\u2019s independent evaluation of the charges and defenses, the \u201cright to effective assistance of counsel includes an adequate investigation of the case to determine facts relevant to the merits or to the punishment in the event of conviction.\u201d <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 154, 662 A.2d 718 (1995); <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 556-57 n.3, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). Regardless, \u201ccounsel need not track down each and every lead or personally investigate every evidentiary possibility before choosing a defense and developing it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ostolaza </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 758, 765, 603 A.2d 768, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 906, 608 A.2d 692 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">A habeas petitioner can \u201cprevail on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel [only if he can] establish both (1) deficient performance, and (2) actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 445, 610 A.2d 598 (1992); see also <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991). For ineffectiveness claims resulting from guilty verdicts, we apply the two-pronged standard set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 639-40, 490 A.2d 82 (1985). For ineffectiveness claims resulting from guilty pleas, we apply the standard set forth in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985), which modified <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">To satisfy the performance prong, the petitioner must \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 688; <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 357, 559 A.2d 206 (1989). A petitioner who accepts counsel\u2019s advice to plead guilty has the burden of demonstrating on habeas appeal \u201cthat the advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>was not -within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>177 Conn. 538, 542, 418 A.2d 913 (1979), citing <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970). The range of competence demanded is \u201creasonably competent, or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 543. Reasonably competent attorneys may advise their clients to plead guilty even if defenses may exist. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 343, 497 A.2d 390 (1985). A reviewing court must view counsel\u2019s conduct with a strong presumption that it falls within the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d and that a tactic that appears ineffective in hindsight may have been sound trial strategy at the time. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">To satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>supra, 474 U.S. 59; <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 156. \u201cReasonable probability\u201d does not require the petitioner to show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case,\u201d but he must establish \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 693-94; <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 446. The <em>Hill </em>court noted that \u201c[i]n many guilty plea cases, the \u2018prejudice\u2019 inquiry will closely resemble the inquiry engaged in by courts reviewing ineffective-assistance challenges to convictions obtained through a trial. For example, where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate . . . the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019 the defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend on the likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>supra, 59; <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 156-57; <em>Minnifield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 68, 72, 767 A.2d 1262, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 907, 772 A.2d 596 (2001). \u201cA reviewing court can find against apetitioner on either ground, whichever is easier.\u201d <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 86, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">After considering the parties\u2019 written and oral arguments to this court, and our own review of the record and transcript, we conclude that the habeas court properly concluded that neither attorney\u2019s performance violated the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The petitioner first claims that Canning had guaranteed that he would be found guilty if he went to trial without first adequately investigating the state\u2019s case or his claim of innocence. As the habeas court found, and the petitioner agrees, the allegations that Canning provided ineffective assistance can be divided into two broad categories: (1) his failure to fully investigate the petitioner\u2019s defense that the intercourse was consensual and (2) his failure to interview individuals who would support the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was intoxicated when he signed the inculpatory statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>petitioner challenges the court\u2019s conclusions that Canning was not deficient in either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The petitioner asserts that the sexual encounter was consensual, and argues that the victim claimed otherwise only after she had reconciled with her husband and they discovered that they were infected with chlamydia. He claims that the victim accused him of rape to mask the fact that she contracted the disease while \u201csleeping around\u201d during her marital separation. At the request of the state police, the petitioner was tested for chlamydia in October, 1994, and tested negative. He argues that Canning should have further investigated chlamydia epidemiology to determine whether the petitioner actually could have infected her. He attacks the court\u2019s factual findings that Canning used the negative test results in bargaining with the state to get a more favorable sentence. He also attacks the court\u2019s legal conclusion that farther investigation into the disease itself would not have been \u201ccrucial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The court\u2019s factual finding that Canning took the chlamydia defense into account in plea negotiations was not clearly erroneous. At the habeas trial, Canning testified that he believed that not only did he think that the chlamydia test and the victim\u2019s thirty day delay in reporting the incident could have been used to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility, but that the state \u201cknew that they had problems with the case.\u201d We do not reevaluate the credibility of witnesses or second-guess the habeas court on such questions of fact. <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 864, 867, 786 A.2d 439 (2001). That, coupled with the petitioner\u2019s failure to put on any evidence to the contrary; cf. <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 158 (upholding habeas court\u2019s finding that defense counsel's investigation inadequate where state\u2019s attorney testified that defense attorney never raised any potential defense during plea negotiations); leads us to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>that the habeas court properly could have found as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We also disagree with the petitioner\u2019s assertion that the results of a further investigation into chlamydia would have been crucial to his case. The petitioner attempts to argue that because he may not have infected the victim, he did not in fact sexually assault her. That argument might have credence if he denied that he and the victim engaged in intercourse; here, however, the petitioner admitted that the intercourse occurred. Whether the petitioner infected the victim does not answer the question of whether she consented to the intercourse. This was recognized by Canning, who testified to that effect at the habeas trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petitioner has not shown why it was unreasonable for Canning to not devote an inordinate amount of time to investigate a disease that would not be dispositive as to the petitioner\u2019s innocence. Canning also did not testify that he would have changed his recommendation to plead under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine even if he had learned more about chlamydia. See <em>Minnifield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 75. Additionally, as the court found, the petitioner did not attempt to introduce medical records of the victim and her husband to demonstrate their relevance or admissibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The petitioner briefly restates allegations that he presented to the habeas court that Canning rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain a videotape of the petitioner\u2019s polygraph test or subsequent statement, failing to obtain police reports of the petitioner\u2019s prior interaction with the criminal justice system and failing to assess adequately the victim\u2019s credibility. For support, the petitioner notes the testimony of his expert witness, attorney Arthur P. Meisler, who cited Canning\u2019s failure to get a copy of the videotape or the police reports, among other alleged investigatory failures that the defendant does not cite on appeal, as evidence that Canning\u2019s preparation was deficient for a case on the active trial list.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Although the court noted that Meisler is \u201ca respected lawyer with considerable experience representing criminal defendants,\u201d it disagreed with his conclusions that Canning\u2019s failure to get the claimed information was either deficient or prejudicial. Our own independent review of the record, briefs and transcripts leads us to the same conclusions. Meisler noted that the videotape, although not independently admissible, would contain any statements against interest made by the petitioner that could be used to impeach the petitioner at trial. Although that information might have been helpful, it cannot be said that the failure to obtain it was below the reasonable competence of criminal defense attorneys. It also was not deficient in these particular circumstances for Canning not to obtain police reports of the petitioner\u2019s prior arrests. Canning had represented the petitioner in the past and was familiar with his prior convictions. Additionally, the defense file contained a copy of the petitioner\u2019s record. As to the allegation that Canning was deficient in failing to assess the victim\u2019s credibility, the court properly rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim. Canning testified that the victim refused to speak with his investigator, that he observed her on the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>of the plea, and that she appeared \u201carticulate, well dressed,\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think she would break down\u201d on the witness stand and admit that the sex was consensual as the petitioner hoped.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In a single sentence of his appellate brief, the petitioner restates his claim that Canning was deficient in failing to interview individuals who could corroborate the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was intoxicated the second time he was interviewed by the police and signed an inculpatory statement. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cDefense counsel will be deemed ineffective [for not contacting a witness] only when it is shown that a defendant has informed his attorney of the existence of the witness and that the attorney, without a reasonable investigation and without adequate explanation, failed to call the witness at trial. The reasonableness of an investigation must be evaluated not through hindsight but from the perspective of the attorney when he was conducting it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 297-98, 497 A.2d 35 (1985); <em>Tatum </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 61, 66, 783 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 937, 785 A.2d 232 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Canning testified that the petitioner told him conflicting stories regarding the circumstances of his second statement. Canning testified that the petitioner had told him, \u201c[o]ne, that he was sober when he made the statement, but that he made it because the police told him he would be released from incarceration if he would sign the statement. The second was, that he was drunk when he originally talked to the police.\u201d Canning also testified that the petitioner did not give him the names of any witnesses who could corroborate his intoxication story, which the petitioner disputed. As the court noted, the public defender\u2019s file contained some information supporting Canning\u2019s view. The first, a handwritten letter from Canning to the petitioner after it was clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that the petitioner was unhappy with the decision to plead, stated, \u201c[y]ou never told me you had been drinking prior to giving the second statement; in fact you told me that you understood everything [the state police trooper] told you and gave him the statement because it was true, and he told you that if you were truthful he would recommend a low bond.\u201d The second, a September 28, 1995 letter from the petitioner to a judge mentioned nothing about intoxication, but stated that the state police had tricked him into giving the second confession by promising that he would be released from custody if he admitted to the offense. In light of those factors and Canning\u2019s explanation, it cannot be said that he conducted an inadequate investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The petitioner next claims that the court improperly found that Bates\u2019 representation was not prejudicial. He argues that if Bates had prepared adequately, he would have realized that Canning did not properly prepare for trial and then presumably would have made his own independent investigation into the merits of the state\u2019s case. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Bates briefly presented the petitioner\u2019s claims that Canning did not allow him to review his file and then forced him to plead guilty, stating at one point, \u201cI\u2019m making these statements because these are what [the petitioner] told me. I have no confirming evidence of this and I have not seen the file \u2014 to know if there\u2019s anything to that effect in the file.\u201d Bates also admitted to the court that he received the file from Canning the previous day, but had not reviewed it. He did not, however, accept the court\u2019s offer for additional time so that he could do so and agreed with the court that the file probably would not contain any information supporting the petitioner\u2019s alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>gations as to Canning\u2019s allegedly ineffective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The court found that Bates\u2019 performance was deficient, concluding that he should have requested a continuance to review the file, should have read the plea transcript and should have interviewed Canning to better prepare for the sentencing hearing. The court found that the petitioner, however, had not suffered any actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Our own review of the record and briefs leads us to conclude that the court properly found that Bates\u2019 performance was deficient. It was below the range of competence for a criminal defense attorney in a similar circumstance not to review his client\u2019s file and to imply before a tribunal that he is not zealously advocating on the defendant\u2019s behalf. That is especially true in light of the court\u2019s offer to give Bates additional time to conduct such a review. Despite those shortcomings, the petitioner has not shown that the outcome would have been different had Bates cured his deficiencies. Bates did present the petitioner\u2019s chief complaint, that Canning essentially guaranteed that the petitioner would be found guilty if the case went to trial and that he entered an <em>Alford </em>plea as a result. The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea, noting that an attorney can be \u201cvery emphatic\u201d with a client regarding his chances before a jury. The court also reminded the petitioner about the plea canvass, in which the court found that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. The petitioner does not challenge the canvass and admitted before this court at oral argument that it was \u201cby the book.\u201d Indeed, the petitioner failed to show a sufficient probability that a continuance and further investigation would have led the court to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea and go to trial. Furthermore, because Canning\u2019s representation was not deficient, the petitioner also has failed to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>a further investigation would have led to a defense that would have succeeded at trial. Taken together, Bates\u2019 representation does not \u201cundermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 694; <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The petitioner also briefly claims that a further investigation would have caused Bates to realize that the plea lacked a factual basis. First, our procedural rules do not require a factual basis for a court to accept an <em>Alford </em>plea.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>State v. Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 363-64, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 Second, the state\u2019s attorney gave a factual basis during the <em>Alford </em>plea, which was based on the petitioner\u2019s second statement and which the court found to be adequate. Indeed, the petitioner has repeatedly recognized that the state had a factual basis for charging him with the crime to which he pleaded. An <em>Alford </em>plea allows the defendant to maintain his innocence while at the same time \u201cacknowledg[ing] that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>60 Conn. App. 313, 315 n.1, 759 A.2d 118 (2000); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985). Additionally, he did not challenge the factual basis during his attempted plea withdrawal. Finally, at oral argument before this court, the petitioner conceded that the state had provided a factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The petitioner combines his final two claims that the habeas court improperly applied Practice Book \u00a7 39-27<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (4) and (5). First, he argues that the court improperly concluded that the <em>Strickland-Hill </em>standard applied when analyzing his claim that the trial court wrongfully rejected his attempt to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel under Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4). Second, he claims that he should be granted a de novo hearing and trial to challenge his guilty plea because he believes that his plea lacked a factual basis, which he believes is required by Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (5). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">When a defendant moves to withdraw a guilty plea after it has been accepted but before sentencing, a court is obligated to allow the motion upon proof of one of the grounds provided in Practice Book \u00a7 39-27. Practice Book \u00a7 39-26; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 49-50, 751 A.2d 298 (2000). The petitioner argues that the habeas court improperly applied <em>Strickland-Hill\u2019s </em>prejudice prong to his claim under Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4) that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea because of Bates\u2019 ineffective representation. He asks that we apply instead \u201can appellate review standard,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>which he apparently assumes does not include a prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The <em>Strickland-Hill </em>standard <em>is </em>the appellate standard of review for ineffective counsel claims raised on a direct appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>67 Conn. App. 708, 712-13, 789 A.2d 1058 (2002). Although our phrasing of the prejudice prong has not been uniform in previous instances where a party has claimed ineffective assistance on direct appeal; compare, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>63 Conn. App. 151, 161-62, 772 A.2d 747, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 934, 776 A.2d 1151 (2001), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Louise-Julie, </em>60 Conn. App. 837, 840, 762 A.2d 913 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 929, 930, 767 A.2d 102, 103 (2001); the prejudice prong has always existed in that the appellant has the burden of showing that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, the result would have been different. Furthermore, our Supreme Court has stated that the standard and analysis for ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the same regardless of whether they are raised in a habeas corpus petition or on direct appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 422 n.30, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim based on Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4) fails because he did not show that Canning\u2019s representation fell below the objective standard of reasonableness or that he would not have pleaded guilty had Bates\u2019 representation been effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The petitioner\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s case lacked a factual basis in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (5) seems actually to be a freestanding claim of innocence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the state correctly points out that the petitioner did not raise a claim of actual innocence separately in his second amended habeas petition, he has continuously attempted to profess his innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>through his physical actions and in several letters to the courts, and his claim of actual innocence is the basis of his ineffective assistance claim against Canning. Cf. <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 170, 182, 774 A.2d 148 (2001) (declining to consider claim of actual innocence where \u201c[n]owhere in [habeas] petitions does the petitioner allege that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advance a defense . . . that he was innocent as a matter of law\u201d). Because the petitioner failed to meet his burden to show that he is actually innocent, however, he cannot prevail on a claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Even without an underlying constitutional violation that affected the result of his criminal trial, \u201ca substantial claim of actual innocence is cognizable by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus . . . .\u201d <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 422, 641 A.2d 1356 (1994). To prevail, a petitioner must satisfy two criteria. \u201cFirst, [he] must establish by clear and convincing evidence that, taking into account all of the evidence\u2014 both the evidence adduced at the original criminal trial and the evidence adduced at the habeas corpus trial\u2014 he is actually innocent of the crime of which he stands convicted. Second, [he] must also establish that, after considering all of that evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom as the habeas court did, no reasonable fact finder would find the petitioner guilty of the crime.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 745, 747, 700 A.2d 1108 (1997). It is an open question whether a habeas claim of actual innocence must be based on new evidence. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>249 Conn. 350, 358, 732 A.2d 754 (1999); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 789-90 n.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Despite his claims of innocence, the petitioner failed to introduce any evidence before the habeas court that we would be able to review. The mere fact that the petitioner may not have infected the victim with a sexu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ally transmitted disease does not address whether the intercourse was consensual and, thus, is not the talisman he believes it to be. In addition to the lack of evidence that the petitioner produced, a reasonable fact finder could find that the petitioner committed the offense for the reasons discussed regarding the existence of a factual basis for the charge to which he pleaded. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner did not satisfy either part of the test required to show actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\"><em> Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.

Part two of that information charged the petitioner with being a persistent dangerous felony offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (a).

At oral argument, however, he conceded that a motion to suppress was unnecessary in light of the judicial district\u2019s practice to hear such motions shortly before the beginning of the trial and the fact that a denial of that motion could negatively affect the petitioner\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable plea agreement. The petitioner then modified his stance, arguing that Canning should have interviewed witnesses recommended by the petitioner to properly assess the success of a suppression motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> The petitioner\u2019s habeas attorney and Canning engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s Attorney]: Was there any way in your opinion, sir, that you could have used [the petitioner\u2019s] test results for chlamydia coming back negative to clearly exonerate him of this purported charge?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">\u201cAttorney Canning: The results of the test?

Concluding that those provisions apply only when the defendant admits guilt, the <em>Godek </em>court used the language and reasoning set forth in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>supra, 400 U.S. 25. <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>supra, 363-64. Our Supreme Court also has noted that the United States Supreme Court has treated <em>Alford </em>pleas and pleas of nolo contendere as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of one another. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985).
