On appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, (2) the suspension of his license for one year was improper and (3) the defendant commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) improperly applied Connecticut law. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The plaintiff was arrested in New Hampshire for, and subsequently pleaded guilty to, operating a motor vehicle in that state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Pursuant to the nationwide driver license compact (compact), which is codified in Connecticut in \u00a7 14-111c, officials in the state of New Hampshire notified the commissioner of the plaintiffs conviction. A hearing was held, and the commissioner suspended the plaintiffs license for one year pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-111c, art. IV (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 14-227a (h) (1) (C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the plaintiffs appeal, the court upheld the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>decision and dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The plaintiff draws two conclusions from language in article IV (a) of the compact that the \u201clicensing authority . . . shall give the same effect to the [driver\u2019s] conduct reported [from the foreign state] as it would if such conduct had occurred in [Connecticut] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-lllc, art. IV (a). First, the plaintiff asserts that the statute confers exclusive jurisdiction on the department of motor vehicles. Second, he argues that the commissioner had the power to suspend his license only for ninety days, not one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The plaintiffs jurisdictional claim is groundless. Appeals from administrative agencies are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides for jurisdiction in the Superior Court. That was recognized by the plaintiff himself, who originally invoked the jurisdiction of the trial court by bringing his appeal to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The plaintiffs argument that his license should be suspended for only ninety days also is without merit. Because General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b sets forth the administrative framework for handling cases involving the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs, the plaintiff next claims that the commissioner had the power to suspend his license only for ninety days pursuant to that section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He alleges that, instead, the commissioner improperly suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>his license for one year pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a, which sets forth the judicial framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">That interpretation would be more convincing if it were not directly contrary to the law. General Statutes \u00a7 14-111d (c) (2) provides that \u00a7 14-227a, not \u00a7 14-227b, is comparable to article IV (a) (2) of the compact,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a point we have noted previously. See <em>Kostrzewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 52 </em>Conn. App. 327, 344, 727 A.2d 233, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 910, 733 A.2d 227 (1999). As a result, we conclude that the commissioner properly applied Connecticut law in suspending the plaintiffs license for one year in accordance with \u00a7 14-227a (h) (1) (C) rather than for the ninety day period provided by \u00a7 14-227b (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-lllc, art.
