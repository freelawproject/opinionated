On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly determined that he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The petitioner had pleaded guilty to the charges in two criminal matters pending against him. In the first case, the petitioner pleaded guilty to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-59 (a) (1), and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). In the second case, the petitioner pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 and assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59. He was sentenced to a total effective term of thirty-five years in the custody of the commissioner of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Subsequently, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been deprived of effective assistance of counsel. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition and later granted certification to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Specifically, the petitioner claims that trial counsel\u2019s failure (1) to investigate adequately the charges against the petitioner, (2) to pursue suppression of the petitioner\u2019s confession, and (3) to assure that the petitioner\u2019s plea was voluntary, intelligent and knowing caused counsel\u2019s representation to be ineffective and prejudiced the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u201cOur standard of review in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging the effective assistance of trial counsel is well settled. Although a habeas court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of review . . . [wjhether the representation a defendant received at trial was constitutionally inadequate is a mixed question of law and fact. ... As such, that question requires plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milner </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 726, 737-38, 779 A.2d 156 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u201c[T]o prevail on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, [the petitioner] must establish both (1) deficient performance, and (2) actual prejudice. ... To prove that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. . . . Furthermore, the petitioner must establish not only that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, but that as a result thereof he suffered actual prejudice, namely, that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The court, in its oral decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that it \u201ccannot find from the evidence in this case that the petitioner has even established the first prong of <em>[Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)] that [counsel\u2019s representation] fell below a standard of care for the advice that he gave. . . . Considering all the facts that have been testified to today . . . this court cannot make a determination that it would have been that the petitioner has been prejudiced by the acts of his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly determined that the petitioner failed to satisfy his burden of establishing that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\"> The transcript of the decision was signed by the court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
