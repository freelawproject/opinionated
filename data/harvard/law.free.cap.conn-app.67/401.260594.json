We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In 1992, the trial court, <em>DeMayo, J., </em>adjudicated the child neglected and committed her to the protective custody of the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120, because the child was being denied proper care and attention, specifically, because the respondent was unable to provide the care that the medically fragile child required. The commissioner\u2019s temporary custody was extended repeatedly. In August, 1999, the commissioner filed a petition to terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>parental rights of the respondent with respect to the child on the ground that the respondent had failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as to encourage a belief that she would be able to assume a responsible position in the child\u2019s life within a reasonable time. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B). The commissioner also alleged that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met, on a continuing basis, the physical, emotional, moral or educational needs of the child and that to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such a relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (D). Additional procedural facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In adjudicating the termination petition, the court, <em>Rogers, J., </em>found the following facts by clear and convincing evidence. The child was bom in 1990 with a chronic, life threatening illness. As a result of her illness, the child has a significant life threatening lung disease. Over the years, physicians frequently changed the medications used to treat this disease because the child\u2019s immune system would respond to the treatment erratically. To this day, the child\u2019s health remains fragile and must be regulated and monitored closely to prevent its further deterioration. At the time of the termination hearing, the child was taking five medications several times a day. She was also taking three additional medications on an as-needed basis. During the summer, she often suffers respiratory distress and must use a nebulizer, sometimes as often as four times a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The respondent began to receive support services administered through the Yale Child Study Center in 1991. The patient care manager who worked with the respondent found that the respondent was unable to recognize the child\u2019s symptoms of illness, to administer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>medications regularly or to contact the hospital when the child was ill. Consequently, the commissioner filed a neglect petition. The child was eighteen months old in 1992 when she was placed in the commissioner\u2019s protective care. At that time, she had severe developmental delays, was grossly underweight and had been hospitalized on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Since that time, the child has resided in a foster home, where her foster mother provides her with exceptional care. The foster mother strictly complies with the child\u2019s medical regime, regularly attends the medical clinic and is able to recognize symptoms of illness and to communicate with medical providers. The child considers her foster mother to be her psychological parent. At the time of the termination hearing, the child was happy and had no significant emotional or behavioral problems. She referred to the respondent as her \u201cother mom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">When the child was in the commissioner\u2019s protective custody, the respondent was aware that she was welcome to participate in the child\u2019s medical treatment at Yale. She, however, missed a majority of the child\u2019s medical appointments between 1992 and 2000. In 1998, she began to receive notice of appointments in Spanish, her native tongue. It was important for the respondent to attend the child\u2019s medical appointments, not only to spend time with the child, but also to learn how to care for her. The child\u2019s nurse practitioner testified unequivocally and credibly that the respondent cannot adequately care for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The child\u2019s medical providers indicated that it was essential for the respondent to visit regularly with the child so that she could utilize her training with respect to the child\u2019s medical needs. The respondent visited the child inconsistently despite the fact that the visits were allowed to take place in the respondent\u2019s home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In May, 1995, the department offered the respondent the opportunity to increase her visits with the child from once to twice a week. Because the respondent failed to attend the additional visits consistently, the department canceled the additional visits in January, 1996. Between June, 1996, and October, 1999, the respondent visited the child only fifty-two out of a possible 110 times. In June, 1998, the respondent was referred to the New Haven Family Alliance for intensive preservation services, but the case was closed one month later when the respondent missed three out of four appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In a memorandum of decision dated July 26, 2000, Judge Rogers granted the petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to her child, concluding that she had failed to achieve personal rehabilitation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The respondent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">As we turn to address the respondent\u2019s claims, we are mindful of the gravity of the proceedings in a termination of parental rights case. Our statutes define \u201cthe termination of parental rights as the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his or her parent. It is, accordingly, a most serious and sensitive judicial action. <em>Anonymous </em>v. Norton, 168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). Although the severance of the parent-child relationship may be required under some circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the interest of parents in their children is a fundamental constitutional right that undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection. <em>Stanley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 295, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983) . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn.

Although we conclude that the claim is not moot, the respondent\u2019s claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u201cMootness presents a circumstance wherein the issue before the court has been resolved or had lost its significance because of a change in the condition of affairs between the parties. . . . Since mootness implicates subject matter jurisdiction ... it can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. ... A case becomes moot when due to intervening circumstances a controversy between the parties no longer exists. ... An issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>moot when the court can no longer grant any practical relief.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giulietti </em>v. <em>Giulietti, </em>65 Conn.

App. 513, 517, 727 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 908, 733 A.2d 225 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u201cThe test for determining mootness of an appeal is whether there is any practical relief this court can grant the appellant. . . . [I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ALCA Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Housing Authority, </em>49 Conn. App. 78, 81, 713 A.2d 886 (1998). The respondent has appealed from the judgment terminating her parental rights, claiming, in part, that in terminating her rights, the court improperly relied on a finding made by a prior court. If this court were to agree with that claim, we could reverse the judgment terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights, thus providing relief. The respondent\u2019s claim therefore is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The following procedural history is relevant to the respondent\u2019s claim that the court improperly concluded that it was not required to find by clear and convincing evidence that it was no longer appropriate for the department to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the respondent because the finding had been made previously. Subsequent to Judge DeMayo\u2019s committing the child to the temporary custody of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>missioner, several of the trial courts granted, in seriatim, petitions for extension of the child\u2019s commitment. In her July 26, 2000 memorandum of decision, Judge Rogers stated in part: \u201c[T]o terminate parental rights, [the petitioner] must initially show by clear and convincing evidence that [the department] has \u2018made reasonable efforts to . . . reunify the child with the parent unless the court finds in the proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts.\u2019 General Statutes [Rev. to 1999] \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (1). The court need not make such a finding, however, \u2018if a court has determined at a hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of \u00a7 17a-110 or \u00a7 17a-lllb that such efforts are not appropriate . . . .\u2019 [General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (1)]. The court made the requisite finding on July 16, 1998, and August 30, 1999, that reunification efforts were no longer appropriate with regard to the [respondent].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The findings to which Judge Rogers referred were made in the context of extension of commitment proceedings held before the court, <em>Cohn, J., </em>on July 16, 1998, and before the court, <em>Dewey, J., </em>on August 30, 1999. Facts concerning the August 30, 1999 hearing before Judge Dewey are sufficient to address the respondent\u2019s claim. The following colloquy took place between counsel and Judge Dewey on August 30, 1999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right, then absent objection, and is there any objection to the motion for extension being granted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\u201cThe Court: Then absent objection, the extension is granted until August 15, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">* * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">\u201cThe Court: State, is there anything further you need?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">\u201c[Assistant Attorney General]: Your Honor, we would ask that . . . further efforts for reunification with the mother and father are no longer necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cThe Court: There\u2019s no objection to that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201c[Child\u2019s Counsel]: Not for the child\u2019s attorney, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cThe Court: Ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">On August 30,1999, Judge Dewey extended the child\u2019s commitment and signed an order for review of the permanency plan that stated in relevant part: \u201cUpon review of the petitioner\u2019s motion for review of permanency plan for extension of commitment and the corresponding study attached thereto, upon hearing the parties and the evidence presented, and upon considering the best interest of the above-named [child], including the [child\u2019s] need for permanency, the court hereby makes the following findings by <em>clear and convincing evidence </em>and orders in accordance with [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-129 [k] (1), (2) and (3): It ... is <em>not appropriate to continue to make reasonable efforts to reunify the [child] </em>with the above-named respondent(s). The commissioner of the department of children and families has no duty to make further efforts to reunify the [child] with the respondent(s).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Thereafter, at the beginning of the hearing on the petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights, the following colloquy took place between Judge Rogers and counsel for the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201cThe Court: The court also found that further efforts to reunify were not appropriate on August 30,1999, and apparently [on] July 16, 1998. So that it\u2019s the court\u2019s understanding that that finding need not be made again. Is that the parties\u2019 understanding at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">\u201c[Assistant Attorney General]: Yes, it is, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Mr. Rosado [respondent\u2019s counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: What date did Your Honor state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThe Court: I got two dates. Judge Dewey made the finding on August 30, 1999, and Judge Cohn made the finding on July 16, 1998, is what the record reflects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201c[Respondent\u2019s Counsel]: I dispute the \u201998 finding. As to the \u201999 finding; yes, with Judge Dewey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right, I think I just need one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The language of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) controls the respondent\u2019s claim. \u201cThe purpose of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. ... If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words actually used because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 435, 668 A.2d 348 (1995). \u201cCommon sense must be used [when construing statutes] and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. . . . We must presume that each sentence, clause and phrase in a public act has a purpose and that the legislature did not intend to enact a meaningless law.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Candlewood Landing Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>44 Conn. App. 107, 110, 686 A.2d 1007 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Section 17a-112 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court . . . may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence (1) that the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to . . . reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts provided <em>such finding is not required if the court has determined at a hearing pur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>suant to subsection (b) of section 17a-110 </em>. . . <em>that such efforts are not appropriate </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Judge Rogers concluded, and the record supports her conclusion, that at the August 30, 1999 extension of commitment hearing, Judge Dewey found by clear and convincing evidence that it was not appropriate for the department to continue to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the respondent. The language of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) is clear: A finding that it is no longer appropriate for the department to make reasonable efforts to reunite the family must be made only once, either at an extension hearing or at a termination hearing. Common sense also tells us that it would be a waste of judicial resources to require courts to make redundant findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The respondent also argues that Judge Rogers\u2019 reliance on the previous determinations that reunification efforts were not appropriate was improper because those decisions were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. As the petitioner points out, the respondent failed to appeal from Judge Dewey\u2019s order of August 30, 1999, extending the child\u2019s commitment and finding that reunification efforts were no longer appropriate. An extension of commitment is an immediately appealable final judgment. <em>In re Todd G., </em>49 Conn. App. 361, 362, 713 A.2d 1286 (1998). The issue may not be raised as a collateral attack on the judgment terminating parental rights. See <em>In re Shamika F., </em>256 Conn. 383, 405-408, 773 A.2d 347 (2001). We conclude that this part of the respondent\u2019s claim is not reviewable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The respondent also argues that the termination was improper because Judge Rogers herself did not make a finding by clear and convincing evidence as to reasonable efforts. The statute tells us that Judge Rogers did not have to make the finding herself because Judge Dewey previously did so at the extension of commitment hearing. Any court adjudicating the termination petition was entitled to rely on Judge Dewey\u2019s finding. The respondent\u2019s claim thus is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The respondent\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly concluded that she had failed to achieve personal rehabilitation within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B). We decline to review this claim because it is inadequately briefed. With respect to this issue, the respondent\u2019s brief consists of a one paragraph factual argument based on reasonableness. The respondent failed to cite the applicable standard of review, and the brief contains no legal authority or analysis to support her theory. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . We will not review claims absent law and analysis.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Dorrell R., </em>64 Conn.

The respondent cannot prevail on this claim because it was not raised at trial and fails to satisfy all four prongs of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). See <em>In re Alexander V., </em>25 Conn.

In the absence of any one of these conditions, the . . . claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although the record is adequate for our review, we need not determine whether the respondent\u2019s claim is of constitutional magnitude. Even if it were, the alleged violation did not clearly exist and deprive the respondent of a fair trial.
