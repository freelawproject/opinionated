App. 284, 288-89, 734 A.2d 1045 (1999), rev\u2019d, 253 Conn. 531, 754 A.2d 153 (2000), we concluded that action by the plaintiff, Interlude, Inc. (Interlude), seeking a refund for taxes it paid on real property was barred by the one year statute of limitations contained in General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court granted certification; <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>250 Conn. 927, 738 A.2d 657 (1999); on the issue of whether we had properly applied \u00a7 12-119 to this case. The Supreme Court held that \u201c\u00a7 12-119 is inapplicable to the present case because there is no issue regarding the assessed value of the property, and because Interlude did not own the property on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>assessment date. Accordingly, the one year statute of limitations provided by \u00a7 12-119 is not applicable here and, therefore, does not bar Interlude\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>253 Conn. 531, 541, 754 A.2d 153 (2000). Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of this court and remanded the case to us for further proceedings. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We repeat here, for convenience, the stipulated facts set forth in our original decision, <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 285-86. \u201cInterlude is a Connecticut nonprofit corporation that provides community based, integrated transitional housing, support and rehabilitation services to individuals who suffer from severe psychiatric disabilities. On September 24, 1992, Interlude took title to four properties located at 25, 27, 29 and 31 Grand Street in the city of Danbury, and recorded its deed on October 5, 1992. Each of the four properties consists of three condominium units; all but four of the units are used by Interlude for its clients for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201cAt the time of Interlude\u2019s purchase of the property, the city exempted the property from taxation. The city notified Interlude of its exemption on July 2, 1993. The city thereafter billed Interlude for the remaining three quarters of the 1991 grand list and for five days of the 1992 grand list, which the city claims became due and payable on October 1, 1992, and January 1, April 1 and July 1, 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initially, Interlude did not pay these tax bills. On November 1, 1994, however, the city noticed a tax lien on the property. On January 15,1995, Interlude paid to the city, under protest, the amount of $21,495.40 in taxes, interest and lien fees as well as an additional $2832.88 in attorney\u2019s fees to avoid a tax sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>property. Interlude then demanded reimbursement of the moneys it had paid to the city under protest, which was denied by the city. Interlude thereafter filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment as to the meaning of a nonprofit organization\u2019s exemption from taxation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-81b and Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20, and demanding reimbursement of all moneys it had paid to the city to avoid a tax sale. The defendants [the city and its collector of taxes] pleaded by way of a special defense that Interlude\u2019s claims were untimely and were not permitted under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-89,12-118 or 12-119. The trial court rendered judgment, granting Interlude a reimbursement \u2018for any taxes it paid that accrued on or after [September 24, 1992, the date of acquisition].\u2019 The trial court did not, however, grant Interlude a reimbursement for any taxes it had paid that had accrued prior to its acquiring the property on September 24, 1992, which represents the bulk of the taxes Interlude had paid under protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Interlude claims on appeal that the trial court improperly construed and applied an exemption from taxation as allowed by General Statutes \u00a7 12-8 lb and as adopted by Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20. We agree with Interlude\u2019s claim and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Prior to the trial of this matter, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts. One of the facts to which the parties stipulated is that \u201c[t]he plaintiff ... is a Connecticut [nonprofit] corporation organized exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d The defendants in fact granted Interlude an exemption from property taxation effective on the date that the deed was recorded, October 5, 1992. There is thus no controversy between the parties as to the general proposition that Interlude\u2019s use of the property at issue qualifies it for an exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>from taxation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-81 (7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only issue is whether that exemption applies only to taxes <em>assessed </em>after the exempt entity acquired the property or to all taxes <em>billed </em>by the defendant city of Danbury after the exempt entity acquired the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-81b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permits municipalities to provide, by ordinance, that the property tax exemption authorized by \u00a7 12-81 becomes effective as of the date of acquisition of the property to which the exemption applies and to provide for reimbursement of the tax-exempt organization for any tax paid by it <em>for a period subsequent to the date of such acquisition. </em>The defendant city did so by enacting Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants agree that pursuant to that ordinance, Interlude is entitled to a refund of property taxes for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the period of September 24 through October 5, 1992, but insist that Interlude must pay the property tax bills for the second, third and part of the fourth quarters of the 1991 grand list, which became due and payable on October 1, 1992, and January 1 and April 1, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The essence of the parties\u2019 disagreement is over the proper interpretation of \u00a7 12-81b; specifically, when the exemption provided for in the statute takes effect and the parameters of that exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Before turning to an analysis of the varying interpretations contended for by the parties, we recite our well settled standard of review. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andresen, </em>256 Conn. 313, 328, 773 A.2d 328 (2001), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 487-88, 757 A.2d 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u201cExemption from taxation is the equivalent of an appropriation of public funds, because the burden of the tax is lifted from the back of the potential taxpayer who is exempted and shifted to the backs of others. . . . This is true whether the relief from taxation be considered an exemption, as the legislature has described it, or results from a policy of considering . . . property not ratable for tax purposes.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Newtown, </em>147 Conn. 374, 386, 161 A.2d 770 (1960), appeal dismissed, 365 U.S. 299, 81 S. Ct. 692, 5 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>By themselves, \u00a7\u00a7 12-81 and 12-89<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> dictate that when a town prepares an assessment list after an entity exempt from taxation under any of the subdivisions of \u00a7 12-81 acquires property in the town, the town should omit that property from the tax rolls for the subsequent assessment. The legislature also enacted \u00a7 12-81b, however, which specifically authorizes municipalities, <em>at their option, </em>to provide by ordinance that the exemption would be effective as of the date of acquisition. The city exercised that option when it enacted Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20 containing the following key sentence: \u201cThe tax-exempt organization <em>shall be reimbursed for any tax paid by it for a period subsequent to the date of such acquisition </em>and shall also be reimbursed for any tax paid by the prior owner for a period subsequent to the date of such acquisition for which such tax-exempt organization reimbursed the prior owner upon the transfer of title to such property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendants\u2019 claim of entitlement to payment is based on their assertion that the tax bills for the second, third and fourth quarters based on the October, 1991 grand list relate to the annual period October, 1991, through September, 1992. Under that assertion, the second quarter bill was for the period of ownership from January through March, 1992; the third quarter bill was for the period of ownership from April through June, 1992; and the fourth quarter bill was for the period of ownership from July through September, 1992. Also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>under that assertion, those bills were, except for the last few days in September, 1992, for the period of ownership prior to Interlude\u2019s September 24, 1992 acquisition of the property and, therefore, prior to the effective date of the exemption. That assertion is, however, false. General Statutes \u00a7 12-142 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe legislative body of each municipality, upon approving any budget calling for the laying of a tax on property, shall determine whether such tax shall be due and payable in a single installment or in two semiannual installments or in four quarterly installments and shall, unless otherwise provided by law, designate the date or dates on which such installment or installments shall be due and payable, <em>subject to the provisions of section 7-383 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 7-383 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe first installment <em>of the general property tax </em>levy of each complying municipality <em>for its fiscal year beginning the first day of July . . </em>. shall become due on the first day of such fiscal year . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clear from those statutes that the first property tax installment for a given fiscal year is payable on the first day of the fiscal year. In this case, the July, 1992 payment, which was paid by Interlude\u2019s seller, was for the period from July 1, 1992, through September, 1992. The quarterly tax bills at issue in this case were for the period October 1, 1992, through June 30, 1993, \u201ca period subsequent to the date of [Interlude\u2019s] acquisition\u201d; Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20; and therefore were not payable by Interlude.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The assessment of the property in question was based on its value on October 1,1991. The mill rate applicable to the assessed property was set in May or June of 1992. The tax was payable in four quarters for the fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>year July 1, 1992, through June 30, 1993. As the defendants state in their brief, \u201cany tax bill paid or collected for a <em>time period subsequent to the date of acquisition </em>shall be reimbursed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Because pursuant to \u00a7 7-383 the property tax <em>for a municipality\u2019s fiscal year, </em>July through June, is payable beginning with the first installment of that fiscal year, all of the taxes at issue in this case were for time periods subsequent to the date of acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">If, as the defendants contend, the \u201cexemptions\u201d provided by \u00a7 12-81b and \u00a7 18-20 of the Danbury Code are exemptions only from future assessment and not exemptions from paying the remaining installments from the previous assessment, \u00a7 12-81b and Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20 would be mere surplusage, adding nothing to the effect of exemption under \u00a7 12-89. Section 12-89 provides for the exemption in subsequent assessment years, while \u00a7 12-8 lb provides for an immediate exemption for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition. That is the clear meaning of the enabling statute and the ordinance enacted by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Low Stamford Corp. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>164 Conn. 178, 319 A.2d 369 (1972), our Supreme Court had occasion to interpret \u00a7 12-81a, which covers the situation reciprocal to that involved here, namely, the purchase of property by a taxable entity from an entity exempt from taxation. In that case, in which the plaintiff purchased the property at issue from an exempt entity, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he assessed value of the property as of September 1, 1968, should be prorated from August 29, 1969, [the date the plaintiff acquired title] to September 1, 1969.\u201d Id., 184. In that case, the court interpreted the language of \u00a7 12-81a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>required the nonexempt purchaser of tax exempt property to pay \u201ca prorated share of taxes for the <em>tax year </em>in which the transfer took place.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the words tax year to mean assessment year rather than the city\u2019s fiscal year. Id., 183-84. The nonexempt purchaser was therefore hable only for three days of tax from the 1968 assessment, and was thereafter hable for the taxes based on the 1969 assessment, which was payable beginning in July, 1970. That decision appears to have given the purchaser a discount for the period between September 1,1969, through June, 1970.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff was required to pay taxes for August 29 to September 1, 1969, pursuant to the court\u2019s decision, and then to pay taxes based on the 1969 assessment, which pursuant to \u00a7 7-383 were for fiscal year July, 1970, to June 1971. In this case, however, \u00a7 12-81b and the Danbury ordinance do not contain the words \u201ctax year.\u201d We instead must determine whether taxes have been collected/or <em>a time period subsequent to the date of acquisition, </em>and we conclude that the bills paid by Interlude under protest were for the time period beginning October 1, 1992, and ending June 30, 1993, and were therefore for a time period subsequent to the date of acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Our legislature has determined, as a matter of public policy, that charitable and other enumerated types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>organizations are exempt from the payment of real property taxes on the property they use for the purposes enumerated in the statute. The construction of \u00a7 12-81b that effectuates the legislature\u2019s stated policy of exemption is that urged by Interlude, namely, that it should be exempt from property taxes based on new assessments under \u00a7 12-89 and that it should be exempt from property taxes based on a prior assessment that are attributable to the period of time after the date it acquires the property under \u00a7 12-8lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment granting the plaintiff a refund of all property taxes levied and collected from it by the defendant city on the properties described in the complaint, and costs and attorney\u2019s fees, with interest as provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this opinion HENNESSY, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen it is claimed that a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the town or city in whose tax list such property was set, or that a tax laid on property was computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property, the owner thereof . . . may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated.

This appeal concerns the interpretation of Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20, adopted pursuant to the enabling statute, General Statutes \u00a7 12-81b. Section 18-20 contains the following key provision: \u201cThe tax-exempt organization shall be reimbursed for any tax paid by it for a period subsequent to the date of such acquisition and shall also be reimbursed for any tax paid by the prior owner for a period subsequent to the date of such acquisition for which such tax-exempt organization reimbursed the prior owner upon transfer of title to such property.\u201d The majority interprets that provision to mean that the plaintiff taxpayer in this case is entitled to be reimbursed by the defendant city for all taxes paid by it to the city, including those that accrued prior to the plaintiffs acquisition of the property and which pertained to a period running from the previous assessment date, October 1, 1991, to the day before the taxpayer acquired the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The trial court correctly determined that under the plain meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-89, a tax exemption would not apply until the first day of October following the date the property was acquired. The court further reasoned that \u00a7 12-81b allows municipalities to modify the effective date of a tax exemption to the date of acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The city of Danbury, through Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20, adopted the modified date of tax exemption in General Statutes \u00a7 12-81b. The court concluded, construing the tax exemption sections strictly against the taxpayer, that Danbury Code \u201c\u00a7 18-20, the language providing for a refund to a tax-exempt organization for taxes paid for a period subsequent to the date of acquisition, refers to taxes accrued and owed past that date, not taxes that happen to have been paid past that date.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The majority\u2019s interpretation is not supported by the plain language of the code provision, and the enabling statute, \u00a7 12-81b, or by the statutory framework that governs assessment of property in Connecticut. The majority holds that an exempt taxpayer is not required to pay any taxes that happen to be owing after acquiring the property, even taxes validly assessed and accrued prior to acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, courts should accord a statutory enactment its plain meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hyllen-Davey </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 57 Conn. App. 589, 595, 749 A.2d 682, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 926, 754 A.2d 796 (2000). Nor may we, \u201cby construction, read a provision into legislation that is not clearly stated therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The trial court adhered to those guiding principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20 has meaning and is not superfluous in that it extends the exemption to the taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>for a period after purchase and before the next assessment date, at which time General Statutes \u00a7 12-89 becomes effective to deal with the exempt taxpayer\u2019s property. Without General Statutes \u00a7 12-81b, as adopted in Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20, the exempt taxpayer would have to wait until the next assessment date after purchase for any exemption to occur. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As the majority points out, there is no question that the plaintiff is entitled to an exemption from taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (7) and no question that the plaintiff is entitled to an exemption under \u00a7 12-89 as of the next assessment date following acquisition. The majority states the issue in the case as \u201cwhether [under Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20] that exemption applies only to taxes <em>assessed </em>after the exempt entity acquired the property or to all taxes <em>billed </em>by the defendant city of Danbury after the exempt entity acquired the property.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The issue, in fact, is whether the exemption applies, as the city contends, only to taxes <em>accrued </em>with respect to the portion of the assessment period after the plaintiff acquired the property or whether, as the plaintiff contends, the exemption applies to all taxes paid by the plaintiff, including those that accrued with respect to the portion of the assessment period <em>before </em>the plaintiff acquired the property, when the taxes happen to be payable after the acquisition with regard to a portion of the city\u2019s fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Danbury Code and \u00a7 12-8 lb allow reimbursement of tax paid by the exempt organization \u201cfor any tax paid by <em>[it] for aperiod </em>subsequent to the date of such acquisition\u201d; (emphasis added) Danbury Code \u00a7 18-20; and \u201cfor any tax paid by the prior owner <em>for aperiod </em>subsequent to the . . . date [of acquisition] for which such tax-exempt organization reimbursed the prior owner upon the transfer of title to such property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The language \u201cfor aperiod\u201d has no meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>unless it refers to a portion of the assessment period during which taxes accrue. As our Supreme Court stated when reviewing this case prior to remand, \u201cthe \u2018assessment date\u2019 is the foundation of municipal taxing power. . . . [I]t is necessary to consider the date of assessment as the appropriate date, both for purposes of valuation of taxable property and for determining whether property is \u2018taxable in the town\u2019 involved.\u201d <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>253 Conn. 531, 539, 754 A.2d 153 (2000) (interpreting General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-89, 12-111, 12-118 and 12-119). By its plain meaning, \u00a7 12-81b expressly provides an alternative exemption date, modifying the effective exemption from the assessment date to the acquisition date.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The statute and the code provision have meaning because they entitle the taxpayer to an exemption without waiting until the next assessment date. Any other interpretation would not give proper effect to the assessment period, on which municipal taxation is based, and would not give effect to the plain statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 12-81a by our Supreme Court in Low <em>Stamford Corp. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>164 Conn. 178, 319 A.2d 369 (1972), undermines the majority\u2019s position. In <em>Low Stamford Corp., </em>the Supreme Court addressed the reverse situation, involving the purchase of property by a nonexempt taxpayer from an exempt taxpayer. That court determined that the taxes <em>for the assessment year </em>should be apportioned on the basis of the acquisition date. The plaintiff was hable pro rata for taxes as assessed on the property for the period covering the date of acquisition to the new assessment. Id., 184\u201485. The Supreme Court interpreted the reference to tax year as meaning the period of time that runs from assessment date to assessment date, rather than the city\u2019s fiscal year. Although the ordinance in the present case does not use the term tax year, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>decision in <em>Low Stamford Corp. </em>supports the interpretation that the time period refers to a portion of the assessment year, the period following the assessment date, which clearly is \u201cthe foundation of municipal taxing power.\u201d <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
