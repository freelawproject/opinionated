We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. On September 15, 1995, Omar Honor\u00e9 was a passenger in a motor vehicle being operated by the defendant in New Britain. While driving toward Berlin, the defendant fatally shot Honor\u00e9 twice in the head with a .22 caliber handgun. The defendant was arrested and charged with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. On June 4, 1999, a substitute information was filed, charging the defendant with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and robbery in the first degree with a deadly weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On July 20, 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to the murder count in exchange for a prison sentence of thirty years. During the trial court\u2019s canvass of the defendant, the defendant informed the court that he wanted to say something. In response, the court stated that the correct time in which to make a statement would be during the sentencing hearing. Upon concluding the canvass, the court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, finding that it was made knowingly and voluntarily, with the assistance of competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On October 14, 1999, the defendant appeared before the court for sentencing under the plea agreement. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ing the sentencing hearing, the defendant reiterated that he would like to speak. The defendant stated that he \u201cwas not happy with [his] lawyer\u201d and was seeking the aid of new counsel. In response, the court informed the defendant that his plea of guilty was accepted at the prior court date and could not now be changed in the absence of some legal justification. Because the defendant failed to state a sufficient reason that would permit the court to allow him to withdraw his plea of guilty other than that he \u201cwas not happy with [his] lawyer,\u201d the trial court denied his request to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him to the agreed on thirty years in prison. Additional facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly accepted his guilty plea because it was not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. The defendant claims that the court\u2019s failure to ascertain the substance of what he wanted to say before entering his plea rendered his plea of guilty defective and violated constitutional principles and Practice Book \u00a7 39-20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial, but seeks to have it reviewed pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. \u201cIn the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In this case, the defendant satisfies the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>because an adequate record exists to review his claim and he alleges a constitutional violation. The defendant, however, cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he cannot demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In determining the validity of a plea, \u201c[t]he standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). \u201cThe question of an effective waiver of a federal constitutional right in a proceeding is of course governed by federal standards.\u201d <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). The United States Supreme Court enunciated in <em>Boykin </em>that several federal constitutional rights are waived when a defendant pleads guilty: the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination; the right to trial by jury; and the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. Id. A waiver of these rights cannot be presumed from a silent record. Id. The trial court is required to address the defendant personally to ascertain whether the plea that the defendant intends to enter has been made voluntarily and knowingly. These requirements also have been codified in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>A review of all the relevant circumstances clearly indicates that the defendant intelligently and voluntarily entered his <em>Alford </em>plea. Although initially stating that he wanted to say something to the trial court, the defendant, after speaking to his attorney, agreed to postpone making any statements until the sentencing hearing. In proceeding with the canvass, the court went to great lengths to ensure that the plea of guilty was made intelligently and voluntarily, and that the defendant knew of the ramifications that would follow if the plea were to be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The court read the statute under which the defendant was pleading guilty, stating the maximum and minimum sentences that he could face. The defendant affirmatively stated that he understood the rights that he was giving up by pleading guilty and that he was satisfied with the advice he had received from his attorney. Additionally, the court informed the defendant that he could not withdraw his plea if it were accepted. Specifically, the court asked the defendant, \u201cDo you understand if I accept your guilty plea here today, you cannot come back to this court after today and move to withdraw the guilty plea, unless there is a legal reason to do so,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cI understand.\u201d The court then stated, \u201cWhat that means, simply put, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Parker, is that once I accept your guilty plea today, you can\u2019t change your mind. Do you understand?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Upon concluding that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made, and that the defendant understood that once accepted, his plea could not later be withdrawn, the court accepted the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">To ensure further that the plea was entered into intelligently and that the canvass was complete as to the issue of self-incrimination, the court recalled the defendant into court. During this second canvass, the defendant once again stated that he understood that he could not withdraw his plea at a later date. At the conclusion of the second canvass, the court once again found that the defendant\u2019s plea was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In complying with the mandates of Practice Book \u00a7 39-19, the court properly determined that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty was made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, consistent with constitutional principles. The defendant, therefore, has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the plea was not made voluntarily. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\u201cA guilty plea, once accepted, maybe withdrawn only with the permission of the court. . . . The court is required to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon proof of any ground set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>27], . . . Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gundel, </em>56 Conn. App. 805, 812, 746 A.2d 204, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 906, 753 A.2d 941 (2000). \u201cThe burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 505-506, 752 A.2d 49 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">After a plea is accepted, Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 provides the circumstances under which a plea can be withdrawn. In the present case, the defendant claims that he should have been able to withdraw his plea because it was \u201caccepted without substantial compliance with [Practice Book] \u00a7 39-19\u201d and because \u201cthe plea was involuntary . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (1) and (2). Having concluded in part I of this opinion that the defendant\u2019s plea was accepted in accordance with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 and that the plea was made voluntarily, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with the intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L.
