The issues regarding the underlying factual dispute were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. See <em>Bergen </em>v. <em>Belfonti, </em>47 Conn. Sup. 291, 791 A.2d 723 (2000). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>In re Karrlo K., </em>40 Conn. App. 73, 75, 668 A.2d 1353 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> The defendant\u2019s statement of the issues presented on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201c1.

Did the Trial Court err in finding, as found in its Ruling on Plaintiffs Motion for Order of Payments dated August 2, 2000, that \u2018it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant\u2019s \u2018financial circumstances\u2019 will substantially exceed [an] annual salary of $52,000.00 in the year 2000\u2019 when no such direct evidence of same was presented to the Trial Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">\u201c4.
