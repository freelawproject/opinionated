On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that funds erroneously credited to a banking customer\u2019s account constituted a debt due the account holder by the bank and were subject to execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) concluded that Eagle Bank\u2019s stop-payment order with respect to these funds was untimely because it occurred after the midnight deadline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>imposed by \u00a7 52-367a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) failed to render judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $9901.88. We agree with the defendant and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. On June 25, 1997, Hartford Fire Insurance Company obtained a judgment for $59,308.60 against Par Painting, Inc., a Connecticut corporation and an account holder at Eagle Bank. On December 5, 1997, the court issued a bank execution against Par Painting, Inc., demanding $68,885.42, an amount that included postjudgment interest and the statutory fees allowed the serving officer. On January 13, 1998, Rotha Contracting Company, Inc., another customer of the bank, requested that the proceeds of a certificate of deposit that it owned be deposited into the Rotha Contracting Company, Inc., checking account. An Eagle Bank employee mistakenly caused the proceeds, amounting to $109,792.99, to be deposited into the Par Painting, Inc., account. Ferrato served the execution on Eagle Bank before noon on January 15,1998. The Par Painting, Inc., account showed a balance of $119,694.87 at the bank\u2019s closing time on that date. On January 21, 1998, Eagle Bank issued and mailed to Ferrato a teller\u2019s check for $68,885.42 in full payment of the execution. That same day, but subsequent to mailing its check, Eagle Bank discovered its accounting error. The bank corrected the error by debiting the Par Painting, Inc., account by $109,792.99 and crediting the same amount to the Rotha Contracting Company, Inc., account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The next day, January 22, 1998, Eagle Bank stopped payment on the check and so informed Ferrato, who nevertheless deposited the check into his trustee account in March, 1998. The check was dishonored as a stopped payment item and was returned to Ferrato. It later became an exhibit at the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">At trial, the plaintiffs claimed that the right of the bank to correct its error expired at midnight on January 16, 1998, pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court agreed and rendered judgment against the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cAmount of check on which payment was stopped: $68,885.42;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201cInterest from 1/19/98 to 12/29/98 under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a (10 percent times 344 days): $6492.21;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\u201c12 percent interest re offer of judgment dated 12/ 30/98 through 3/31/00: $10,372.45;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\u201c12 percent interest re offer of judgment dated 4/1/00 through 5/31/00 (61 days): $1381.48 [Total] $87,131.56.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the $109,792.99 mistakenly deposited into the judgment debtor\u2019s account constituted a debt due the judgment debtor by the defendant and (2) rendered judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $87,131.56. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court failed to recognize that \u00a7 52-367a conditions a bank\u2019s obligation to pay the amount demanded by an execution on the existence of an indebtedness of the bank to the judgment debtor. We agree with the defendant and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The threshold question before us is whether the entire nominal balance of the judgment debtor\u2019s account constituted a debt due from the defendant to the judgment debtor and was subject to execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a. Our analysis of this issue is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... As with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 755-56, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). \u201cIf the words of a statute are unambiguous, we assume that they express the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Hillebrand, </em>240 Conn. 35, 40, 688 A.2d 1317 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Section 52-367a authorizes a judgment creditor to execute against any debts due from any banking institution to a judgment debtor that is not a natural person. This statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f any such banking institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made is indebted to the judgment debtor, it shall pay to such officer, in the manner and at the time hereinafter described, the amount of such indebtedness not exceeding the amount due on such execution, to be received and applied on such execution by such officer. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-367a.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In our view, the plain language of \u00a7 52-367a expresses the legislature\u2019s intent to condition a bank\u2019s obligation to comply with a service of execution on the existence of a debt owed to the judgment debtor by the banking institution on which the execution is served. Thus, the bank\u2019s obligation is not absolute, but rather it is limited by the amount of the bank\u2019s indebtedness to the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ment debtor. This interpretation is in accord with our Supreme Court\u2019s comments on a definitional subsection of the postjudgment procedures statutes. \u201cAlthough [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-350a (16) defines \u2018property\u2019 broadly to encompass \u2018any real or personal property in which the judgment debtor has an interest which he could assign or transfer, including . . . any present or future right or interest . . . [and] any debt, whether due or to become due,\u2019 it does not specify what constitutes [a] . . . \u2018debt.\u2019 While it is reasonable to infer from this language the legislature\u2019s intent to allow a judgment creditor to execute against all forms of a judgment debtor\u2019s assets, it would be unreasonable to infer an intent to encompass property in which a judgment debtor lacks any cognizable interest whatsoever.\u201d <em>Fleet Bank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Carillo, </em>240 Conn. 343, 349, 691 A.2d 1068 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The defendant asserts, and we agree, that the judgment debtor did not have any cognizable interest in the funds erroneously credited to its account. \u201cDeposits . . . create the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the depositor.\u201d <em>Alexiou </em>v. <em>Bridgeport-People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>110 Conn. 397, 399, 148 A. 374 (1930). \u201c[A] bank is indebted to its account holders for the amount of the funds that <em>they </em>have deposited . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Frigon </em>v. <em>Enfield Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>195 Conn. 82, 87, 486 A.2d 630 (1985). A debt is \u201c[t]hat which is due from one person to another, whether money, goods, or services; that which one person is bound to pay to another, or to perform for his benefit; thing owed; an obligation or liability . . . that of which payment is liable to be exacted. . . . Debt contemplates not only an obligation upon the debtor to pay, but a reciprocal right on the part of the creditor to enforce payment . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Lenox Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>122 Conn. 143, 146, 187 A. 895 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The requirements and obligations imposed by \u00a7 52-367a simply do not apply to any portion of a depositor\u2019s account that does not represent a debt due from the bank to the depositor. In the present case, the defendant was indebted to Par Painting, Inc., only for $9901.88, the total amount of the judgment debtor\u2019s deposits on the date of the execution. The $109,792.99 erroneously credited to its account was not a debt due the judgment debtor and was not subject to execution. The defendant, therefore, was not bound to pay this sum to the judgment debtor, and the judgment debtor had no right to enforce payment of that sum. Accordingly, \u00a7 52-367a does not authorize execution against funds erroneously credited to the judgment debtor\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We conclude that the court improperly rendered judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $87,131.56 because this figure included the funds erroneously deposited in the account, which funds were not subject to execution under \u00a7 52-367a.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The defendant next challenges the court\u2019s conclusion that Eagle Bank\u2019s stop-payment order was untimely because it occurred after the midnight deadline imposed by \u00a7 52-367a. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s action was timely with respect to that amount actually owed to a third party account holder and credited to the judgment debtor in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">We determined in part I that \u00a7 52-367a does not authorize execution against funds that do not constitute a debt owed by the bank to the judgment debtor. Therefore, because the defendant lacked authority to issue to the plaintiffs funds that improperly were deposited in the judgment debtor\u2019s account, the midnight deadline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>referenced in \u00a7 52-367a is inapplicable to the funds owed to Rotha Contracting Company, Inc. In the absence of any superseding deadline, a bank\u2019s right to issue a stop-payment order drawn on its account at another bank is governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-4-303 and 42a-4-403. Pursuant to \u00a7 42a-4-303, stop-payment orders are timely if they are received by the payor bank within a reasonable time to allow the bank to act on the instruction before the bank has taken any action on the item as described in \u00a7 42a-4-303.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The defendant issued its check on January 21, 1998. The next day, January 22, 1998, the defendant, having discovered its accounting error, stopped payment on its check. The defendant notified Ferrato of this action that same day. Ferrato did not attempt to deposit the stopped payment item into his trustee account until March, 1998. Clearly, the payor bank had ample opportunity to act on the stop-payment order and in fact did so. The defendant\u2019s action was therefore timely under \u00a7 42a-4-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the court improperly failed to conclude that judgment should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>rendered in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $9901.88, the sum that the plaintiffs should have received on the execution. We agree in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In addition to correcting the amount of the judgment in accordance with our conclusions in part I, the court must also determine whether the plaintiffs should be awarded interest, which the plaintiffs had requested in their prayer for relief, on the sum of $9901.88. General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a authorizes the award of \u201cinterest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more ... as damages for the detention of money after it becomes payable. . . .\u201d The defendant does not dispute that the $9901.88 in the judgment debtor\u2019s account at the time of execution constituted a debt due to the judgment debtor by the defendant. This sum, therefore, was subject to execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367a and the defendant was obligated to turn over this sum to the plaintiffs pursuant to such execution. The defendant concedes that it failed to comply with its statutory obligation under \u00a7 52-367a with respect to these funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defendant, therefore, may be hable for interest at a maximum rate of 10 percent per year on the wrongfully withheld money. \u201cThe real question in each case is whether the detention of the money is or is not wrongful under the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>164 Conn. 463, 466, 323 A.2d 553 (1973). Although bad faith is one factor that the court may look at when deciding whether to award interest under \u00a7 37-3a, we note that, in the context of the statute, \u201cwrongful\u201d is not synonymous with bad faith conduct. Rather, wrongful means simply that the act is performed without the legal right to do so. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he allowance of interest as an element of damages is . . . primarily an equitable determination and a matter lying within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $9901.88 together with applicable costs and for further proceedings to determine whether the plaintiffs should be awarded interest on this sum pursuant to \u00a7 37-3a. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\"> By virtue of a merger, Webster Bank, as the surviving corporation, acquired all the liabilities of Eagle Bank and the separate existence of Eagle Bank ceased.
