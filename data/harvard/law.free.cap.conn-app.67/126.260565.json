On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly (1) denied his petition for certification to appeal, (2) concluded that he had not been deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, when his defense counsel failed, inter alia, to file a motion to suppress certain evidence that police had seized from his person and residence, and (3) declined to review his claim that the seizure of that evidence had violated his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. We disagree and, accordingly, dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>51 Conn. App. 474, 477, 722 A.2d 286 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">For the following reasons, we conclude that the issue of whether the petitioner was deprived of the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>assistance of counsel is not debatable among jurists of reason and that the questions involved in resolving that issue do not warrant significant review. The petitioner raises two claims concerning his counsel\u2019s performance. First, the petitioner claims that his counsel improperly failed to attempt to discredit evidence presented by the state indicating that a canine unit had tracked him from the scene of the crime. Specifically, the petitioner claims that his counsel should have called as a witness Robert Sisson, an investigator with the office of the public defender. The habeas court found, however, that \u201cSisson was a reluctant witness at best\u201d and that counsel had been \u201cafraid that if he put Sisson on the stand, he might not cooperate.\u201d The record reveals that there is little uncertainty that counsel, for strategic and tactical reasons, elected not to call Sisson as a witness. Recognizing that there is a strong presumption that the trial strategy employed by a criminal defendant\u2019s counsel is reasonable and is a result of the exercise of professional judgment; see <em>Goodrum </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 297, 315, 776 A.2d 461, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 902, 782 A.2d 136 (2001); we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the habeas court\u2019s determination that his counsel did not perform deficiently when he elected not to call Sisson as a witness was not debatable among jurists of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Second, the petitioner claims that his defense counsel improperly failed to file a motion to suppress certain evidence that police had seized from his residence and person, namely, a sweatshirt and hair samples, including pubic hair. Other evidence presented by the state, however, which included a fingeiprint lifted from the crime scene that matched the petitioner\u2019s, as well as damaging eyewitness testimony, was compelling. As the habeas court aptly noted, the record reveals that, even if the sweatshirt and hair samples had been suppressed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>there was not a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The petitioner\u2019s last claim is that the habeas court improperly declined to review his claim that the seizure of the sweatshirt and hair samples had violated his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the claims that the habeas court declined to review were subsumed by the petitioner\u2019s claim that his counsel, in failing to file a motion to suppress the hairs and sweatshirt, had provided ineffective assistance. A habeas court is not required to address separately a constitutional claim that has been subsumed by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Cf. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>61 Conn. App. 825, 833-34, 767 A.2d 790 (habeas court need not separately address due process claims subsumed by claims of ineffective assistance of counsel), cert. denied, 256 Conn. 903, 772 A.2d 596 (2001). The habeas court in the present case concluded that there was not a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different if the petitioner\u2019s hair samples and sweatshirt had been suppressed. That conclusion necessarily disposed of the petitioner\u2019s state and federal constitutional claims. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In sum, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> Specifically, the petitioner claims that his constitutional claims are reviewable under the cause and prejudice test set forth in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977). We need not address whether <em>Wainwright </em>permits review in this case because we conclude that those claims were subsumed in the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which was reviewed by the habeas court. See <em>Rivera v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>61 Conn. App. 825, 833 n.4, 767 A.2d 790, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 903, 772 A.2d 596 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
