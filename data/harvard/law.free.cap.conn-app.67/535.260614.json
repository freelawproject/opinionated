Phillips, Jr., appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a conditional plea of nolo contendere, of two counts of attempt to commit assault of a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), and of one count of engaging police in pursuit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-223 (b). On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the state to file a substitute information, after the commencement of jury selection, alleging an attempt to commit the substantive offenses with which the defendant was previously charged. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In a nine count information dated December 7,1998, the state charged the defendant with, inter alia, two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 5, 1999, the state filed a ten count substitute information again charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the defendant with, inter alia, two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">On May 2, 2000, prior to the commencement of jury selection, the defendant orally moved for a bill of particulars or long form information, which the court granted. Thereafter, jury selection commenced. In its preliminary charge to the venire panel, the court summarized the charges as including two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On May 5, 2000, the state filed its first substitute long form information,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> charging nine counts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that included, inter alia, two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (2). Specifically, the state alleged that the defendant, \u201cacting with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer, William Proulx, from performing his duty . . . caused to be hurled an object, to wit, a motor vehicle, capable of causing physical harm, damage or injury, at such peace officer . . . .\u201d The same allegations against the defendant were made with regard to Officer Tracy O\u2019Connell. Later that day, the state filed a second substitute long form information that was the same as the prior substitute information except that it changed the first two counts from assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (2), to attempt to commit assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>167c (a) (1). The information alleged that the defendant, \u201cacting with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable officer, William Proulx, from performing his duty, attempted to cause physical injury to Officer Proulx . . . .\u201d Again, the same allegation against the defendant was made with regard to O\u2019Connell.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On May 9, 2000, defense counsel filed a motion in opposition to the state\u2019s request to file a second substitute information, which the court denied. Thereafter, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of attempt to commit assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-167c (a) (1), and to one count of engaging police in pursuit in violation of \u00a7 14-223 (b). The defendant conditioned his plea on his right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision granting the state\u2019s request to file a second substitute information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of three and one half years incarceration concurrent to the sentence he was then serving. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly permitted the state to file a second long form information in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 36-18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argues that the second substitute information charged an \u201cadditional or different\u201d offense from the one charged in the first substitute information because the intent elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>each charge were different. First, we will determine whether the second substitute information charged an \u201cadditional or different\u201d offense and second, whether the defendant\u2019s substantive rights were prejudiced by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cBefore the commencement of trial, a prosecutor has broad authority to amend an information under Practice Book \u00a7 623 [now \u00a7 36-17], Once the trial has started, however, the prosecutor is constrained by the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>226 Conn. 601, 607, 628 A.2d 973 (1993). This court has held that \u201cfor purposes of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 623 [now \u00a7 36-17] and 624 [now \u00a7 36-18], a criminal trial begins with the voir dire of the prospective jurors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>8 Conn. App. 545, 551-52, 513 A.2d 752 (1986). The second substitute information in the present case was filed after the commencement of jury selection. Thus, Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 governs the state\u2019s ability to amend the information in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Under Practice Book \u00a7 36-18, the court may \u201cfor good cause shown<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> . . . permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 36-18. \u201cThe sole limiting requirement under [Practice Book] \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18], is that no additional or different offense may be charged in an amendment, and no substantive rights of the defendant may be prejudiced by an amendment. . . . It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow an amendment to the information. On appeal, review of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>court\u2019s decision to permit an amendment to the information is one of abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prat, </em>66 Conn. App. 91, 98-99, 784 A.2d 367 (2001). Accordingly, our review of the court\u2019s decision to permit the state to file a second substitute information after the commencement of trial is governed by an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The second substitute information made two changes to the charges against the defendant. It charged a different subdivision of the assault of a peace officer statute and it charged an attempt to commit the offense rather than the completed offense. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>30 Conn. App. 606, 621 A.2d 755 (1993), for the proposition that the charges of assault of a peace officer and attempt to commit assault of a peace officer are different offenses. <em>Raymond, </em>however, is distinguishable from the present case because the offenses in <em>Raymond </em>are not the same as those at issue in the present appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, <em>Raymond </em>dealt with the comparison of offenses for the purpose of a double jeopardy analysis. \u201cAlthough we compare elements to determine if offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy . . . such an analysis is inappropriate here. For purposes of [Practice Book] \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18], the decisive question is whether the defendant was informed of the charges with sufficient precision to be able to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 608. This includes whether the defendant has sufficient notice of the accusations against him to question jurors effectively. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In the present case, the short form information, in effect at the commencement of the voir dire, char ged the defendant with the substantive offense of assault of a peace officer pursuant to \u00a7 53a-167c. General Statutes \u00a7 54-60 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any . . . information or complaint is pending before any court, a conviction may be had for any offense sufficiently alleged therein . . . .\u201d Because that information did not specify a particular subdivision of \u00a7 53a-167c (a), it provided the defendant with notice that he could be convicted, pursuant to \u00a7 54-60, under any of the subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-167c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Additionally, under \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 867 [now \u00a7 42-29]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 54-60<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ... a criminal defendant can be convicted of either the crime charged in the information or of the attempt to commit that crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>39 Conn. App. 267, 271, 664 A.2d 1157, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 930, 667 A.2d 801 (1995). Neither \u00a7 54-60 nor Practice Book \u00a7 42-29 requires that an attempt to commit the crime charged in the information must necessarily be a lesser included offense of that crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 272. Hence, the defendant had statutory notice that he could be convicted of \u201cany offense sufficiently alleged\u201d in the initial information and of an attempt to commit the substantive offense charged therein. Consequently, if the defendant could be convicted of these charges under the initial information then indeed it would not be an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of discretion to allow the state to charge him with them before the end of trial. In support of our decision, we are guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In <em>Tanzella, </em>our Supreme Court held that for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 624, now \u00a7 36-18, because the subdivisions of the statute at issue in that case described different methods by which the party could have committed the crime, the different subdivisions did not constitute \u201cdifferent crimes but simply different means of committing the same crime . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 613. We find the present case analogous to <em>Tanzella </em>because the state did not charge the defendant with an \u201cadditional or different\u201d crime when it amended the charge from a violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (2) to a violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1). It merely changed the method by which it alleged that the defendant had committed the same crime, that is, assault of a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Because the defendant had notice that he could be convicted of attempt to commit the substantive offense of which he was charged and because we conclude that subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) are not different, crimes but rather two ways of committing the same crime, we conclude that the second substitute information in the present case did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 by charging him with an \u201cadditional or different,\u201d offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Having determined that the amendments to the information did not charge an \u201cadditional or different\u201d offense, we now consider whether the amendments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. The defendant claims that his defense was prejudiced because his counsel\u2019s voir dire of the prospective jurors was premised on the previous information. He asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that because the substitute information was allowed, he was not afforded the opportunity to \u201cquestion the venire [panel] effectively to uncover and analyze any bias or prejudice that they may harbor as to the particular crime or crimes charged.\u201d We conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18] is primarily a notice provision. Its puipose is to ensure that the defendant has adequate notice of the charges against which he must defend. ... It is the defendant\u2019s burden to provide a specific showing of prejudice resulting from the state\u2019s delay in providing notice of the charge against which [he] must defend.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prat, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 98-99. In <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 272, we held that \u201c[Practice Book] \u00a7 867 [now \u00a7 42-29] and [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-60 are constitutionally sufficient to put a criminal defendant on notice that he can be convicted of an attempt to commit the crime charged as well as any lesser included offenses of the crime as charged.\u201d Thus, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that he lacked notice during voir dire of the crimes against which he had to defend. Additionally, the defendant has failed to provide us with support for his claim that he was prejudiced by the second substitute information. We, therefore, conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the state to file the second substitute information after the commencement of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-167c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a peace officer . . . when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer . . . from performing his duty, and while such peace officer ... is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such peace officer ... or (2) he throws or hurls, or causes to be thrown or hurled, any rock, bottle, can or other article, object or missile of any kind capable of causing physical harm, damage or injury, at such peace officer . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> The substitute information filed on the morning of May 5, 2000, <em>was </em>in fact the second substitute information filed in this ease. Because, however, it was the first substitute long form information that was filed and because the parties refer to it in their appellate briefs as the \u201cfirst\u201d substitute informa.tion, we will refer to it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> At the time, the state noted that it would file a nine count information, leaving the count charging the defendant with operation of a motor vehicle without minimum insurance to be tried to the court after the jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b561-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental slate required for commission of the crime, he . . . (2) intentionally does or omits 1 o do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> Although the defendant asserts that he is appealing from the decision of the court overruling his motion in opposition to the state\u2019s request to file a second substitute information, for clarity, we refer to the defendant\u2019s appeal as an appeal from the decision of the court granting the state\u2019s request to file a second substitute information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 provides: \u201cAfter commencement of the trial for good cause shown, the judicial authority may permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced. An amendment may charge an additional or different offense with the express consent of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> Although the trial court record does not contain an explicit finding of good cause for the amendment, we note that defense counsel did not object to the amendment on that ground. His argument focused on the two other restrictions under Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 against charging an \u201cadditional or different\u201d offense and prejudicing the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. In this case, we conclude that the existence of good cause is implicit in the court\u2019s decision to allow the second substitute information.
