It arose when the plaintiff Florida Rock Industries Inc. (Florida Rock) sought a permit under \u00a7 404 of the Clean Water Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to mine the limestone which lay beneath a tract of wetlands. The Corps denied the permit on October 5, 1980. On May 25, 1982, Florida Rock filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking monetary compensation from the defendant United States (Government); Florida Rock alleged that the Corps\u2019 permit denial constituted an uncompensated taking of private property for public use in violation of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Federal Claims agreed, <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Cl.Ct. 160 (1985) <em>(Florida Rock I), </em>and awarded Florida Rock $1,029,000 plus attorney fees and simple interest. On appeal, this court vacated the judgment that a taking had occurred and remanded for further consideration. <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>791 F.2d 893 (Fed.Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied </em>479 U.S. 1053, 107 S.Ct. 926, 93 L.Ed.2d 978 (1987) <em>(Florida Rock II). </em>On remand, the Court of Federal Claims found that the permit denial deprived Florida Rock of all value in its land, and so again concluded that there had been a taking and reinstated the $1,029,000 damages award, this time with compound interest. <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 161 (1990) <em>(Florida Rock III). </em>The Government appeals both the damages award and the choice of compound rather than simple interest. We again find it necessary to vacate the judgment that there has been a taking, and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The detailed background of the case is described in the several opinions referred to above as <em>Florida Rock </em>7-/27. We provide here only a brief overview before proceeding to the heart of the matter: whether the Corps\u2019 denial of the \u00a7 404 permit effected a regulatory taking, thus requiring the Government to pay just compensation. The answer to that question depends on the impact the regulatory imposition had on the economic use, and hence value, of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">In 1972, shortly before the enactment of the Clean Water Act, Florida Rock purchased a 1,560 acre wetlands parcel in Dade County, Florida, to the west of suburban Miami. The purchase price was $2,964,000 (an average of $1,900 per acre).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Florida Rock obtained the parcel in order to extract the underlying limestone \u2014 a process which destroys the surface wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">During the 1970s, however, the ecological importance of wetlands was increasingly appreciated. The Corps in 1977 enacted regulations requiring owners of wetlands parcels to obtain permits under \u00a7 404 of the Clean Water Act before engaging in dredging or filling activities. <em>See generally United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>474 U.S. 121, 123-24, 106 S.Ct. 455, 457, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). Not long after, Florida Rock began mining operations on the parcel, without having applied for a \u00a7 404 permit. The Corps issued a cease and desist order on September 7, 1978. Florida Rock stopped mining, restored the area as best it could, and began negotiating with the Corps for the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Initially, Florida Rock sought a permit for the entire 1,560 acres. The Corps responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>that permits would be issued only for. parcels of a size to suffice for three years of mining; in Florida Rock\u2019s case, 98 acres would serve its anticipated needs' for three years. Florida Rock acquiesced in the Corps\u2019 demand and applied for a permit covering only the 98 acre parcel at issue here. After considering the revised application, the Corps concluded that the proposed mining would cause irremediable loss of an ecologically valuable wetland parcel and would create undesirable water turbidity. The permit application was denied on October 2, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Florida Rock, conceding the validity of the Corps\u2019 actions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that the permit denial was an uncompensated regulatory taking of its land. In <em>Florida Rock I, </em>the Court of Federal Claims found that the value of the parcel before the taking was $10,500 per acre and that the value after the taking was negligible because rock mining\u2014 in the view of the court, the <em>only </em>viable economic use \u2014 had been foreclosed. <em>Florida Rock I, </em>8 Cl.Ct. at 164 (citing <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264, 295-96, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 2370, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981)). The Court of Federal Claims concluded that the permit denial was a regulatory taking, for which the landowner must be compensated. <em>Florida Rock I, </em>8 Cl.Ct. at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">On appeal to this court, that judgment was vacated in <em>Florida Rock II. </em>The Federal Circuit held that the Court of Federal Claims in determining the after-taking value of the affected property had erred in focusing on <em>immediate </em>use \u2014 the proper focus should instead have been on a determination of \u201cfair market value.\u201d <em>Id., </em>791 F.2d at 903. The case was remanded to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">On remand, the Court of Federal Claims entertained evidence seeking to establish the fair market value of the property subsequent to the permit denial. The Government presented two assessors, Mr. Slack and Mr. Cantwell, who had investigated contemporaneous land sales in the area. Using the standard comparable sales valuation method, one assessor concluded that the property had a fair market value of $4,000 per acre, while the other found a value of $4,615 per acre. In addition, Florida Rock had received actual purchase offers in the range of $4,000 per acre. The President of Florida Rock Industries, Mr. Edward Baker, testified that he believed the property to be worth $10,000 per acre, even <em>after </em>the Corps\u2019 permit denial (thus presumably explaining why all such purchase offers were declined).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Finally, the Government presented a state court opinion which had affirmed the state\u2019s tax assessment of $4,089,950 for the 1,560 acre parcel, based on comparable sales of nearby parcels during the 1979-1982 time period. (This assessment figure for the larger parcel reflects an average value of $2,621.76 per acre; <em>see supra </em>note 3.) <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc., v. Bystrom, </em>485 So.2d 442, 444-45 (Fla.App.1986), <em>review denied, </em>492 So.2d 1332 (1986) <em>(Bystrom). </em>That assessment was based on comparable sales which presumably reflected the market\u2019s evaluation of present and future land use restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at 444 and 447.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Florida Rock, on the other hand, read <em>Florida Rock II </em>to require a detailed inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>into the motivations and sophistication of buyers of the comparable properties upon which assessment was based. It crafted a survey \u2014 viewed by the Court of Federal Claims to be \u201cadmittedly novel,\u201d <em>Florida Rock III, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 173 \u2014 and concluded that virtually all the buyers of the comparable properties were lacking in sufficient knowledge in order for their purchases to qualify as truly comparable sales. Florida Rock\u2019s assessor, Mr. Failla, used the results of this survey to justify discarding evidence that the average retail price of parcels in the vicinity of Florida Rock\u2019s land was $6,100 per acre, and concluded that the actual fair market value of the tract following the permit denial was negligible. Implicit in this result is the assumption that no one with full knowledge of the regulatory regime would be willing to gamble that concern for the ecological importance of the wetlands would give way in the future to the economics of development pressure from nearby Miami. The Court of Federal Claims in <em>Florida Rock III </em>agreed with Florida Rock\u2019s view of the matter, and decided accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">How to determine whether a regulatory taking under the Fifth Amendment has occurred is a subject of on-going debate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has provided various articulations, influenced, as could be expected, by the particular circumstances of the cases before it. One formula that has emerged and has been repeated in several cases requires that the court balance several pragmatic considerations in making its regulatory takings determination. These considerations include: the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant, the extent to which the regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the Government action. (The leading case is <em>Penn. Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2659, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978) <em>(Penn Central)). </em>In this appeal, it is the economic impact of the regulation that is at issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">The recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992) (Lucas), teaches that the economic impact factor alone may be determinative; in some circumstances, no balancing of factors is required. If a regulation categorically prohibits <em>all </em>economically beneficial use of land \u2014 destroying its economic value for private ownership \u2014 the regulation has an effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>equivalent to a permanent physical occupation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is, without more, a compensable taking.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">If, however, a regulation prohibits less than all economically beneficial use of the land and causes at most a partial destruction of its value, the case does not come within the Supreme Court\u2019s \u2018categorical\u2019 taking rule. As we explain below, we reject the trial court\u2019s analysis that led to its conclusion that all economically beneficial use of the land was taken by the Government. We remand for determination of what economic use as measured by market value, if any, remained after the permit denial, and for consideration of whether, in light of the properly assessed value of the land, Florida Rock has a valid takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In <em>Florida Rock II </em>this court stated that, with regard to the property at issue, although \u201cthere may be a question what knowledgeable buyers would have paid, but that they would have paid some substantial figure seems certain.\u201d <em>Id., </em>791 F.2d 893 at 903. The trial court on remand was instructed: \u201cif there is found to exist a solid and adequate fair market value (for the 98 acres) which Florida Rock could have obtained from others for that property, that would be a sufficient remaining use of the property to forestall a determination that a taking had occurred or that any just compensation had to be paid by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We did not discuss what residual fair market value would be \u201cadequate\u201d to forestall a taking determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">We did explicitly indicate that the Court of Federal Claims should give consideration to \u201ca relevant market made up of investors who are real but are <em>speculating </em>in whole or major part.\u201d <em>Florida Rock II, </em>791 F.2d at 903 (citing <em>Bystrom, </em>485 So.2d at 447; emphasis added). The court noted the testimony of the Government\u2019s assessor, Mr. Cant-well, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-15\">We are of the opinion that Mr. Cantwell\u2019s testimony, if considered and believed, established the existence of a market in which Florida Rock could have disposed of the property and mitigated the severity of the regulatory action here involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-16\"><em>Id. </em>And while the court stated that \u201cwe take it for granted, as Mr. Cantwell did, that the \u201cwilling buyer\u2019 of the market value formula has got to be one who is correctly informed about the physical character of the land, as well as legal restrictions on its use ...\u201d <em>id. </em>at 902, we also indicated that the market as a whole was not dominated by persons engaged in fraudulent or illegal behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-17\">Since the tract was not listed for sale, the $4,000 per acre offer, the frequent inquiries, and the assessed value, must have reflected interest of knowledgeable people, not foreigners or gulls.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-18\"><em>Id </em>In short, we understand <em>Florida Rock II </em>to hold that purchases which are made by market speculators as well as home builders and other developers are comparable sales, with the caveat that particular sales might be discarded by the assessor if those sales appear questionable in light of the market as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-19\">Florida Rock, and the Court of Federal Claims on remand in <em>Florida Rock III, </em>read <em>Florida Rock II </em>differently. Our passing reference to buyers being \u201ccorrectly informed\u201d was read to require a detailed inquiry into the motivation and sophistication of the buyers whose purchases comprised the comparable sales used in the fair market value assessment. The Court of Federal Claims rejected the testimony of Mr. Cant-well \u2014 the same testimony which we had not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>ed with approval in <em>Florida Rock II </em>\u2014 solely because Mr. Cantwell, with little exception, assumed sufficient knowledge on the part of the purchasers. <em>Florida Rock II, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 172. Instead, the court accepted the testimony of Florida Rock\u2019s assessor, who rejected <em>all </em>of the comparable sales values on the principle that none of the purchasers were sufficiently sophisticated and knowledgeable. That was error \u2014 contrary to our instruction in <em>Florida Rock II, </em>contrary to generally accepted understandings of market valuation, and finally, contrary to the working assumptions of a free market.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">There is no disagreement as to the facts regarding the existence and nature of the market. Florida Rock\u2019s study identified in the immediate vicinity of the 98 acre tract 240 land sales during the period 1971 through 1987. A significant number of those sales occurred in the early 1980s, despite the intervening change in the regulatory environment. The average sales price per acre in 1980 was $6,100. The price per acre varied predominantly as a function of the overall lot size; smaller lots commanded higher per acre prices. Florida Rock\u2019s survey indicated that roughly 80% of the buyers had purchased the land for \u2018investment\u2019 purposes and that, overall, the purchasers intended to hold the land for an average of 9 to 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Thus, there was an active though speculative investment market for Florida Rock\u2019s land at the time of and following the permit denial. <em>Accord, Bystrom, </em>485 So.2d at 447-48. The fair market price which Florida Rock could have commanded at that time remains, still, to be determined, but it was certainly much higher than the nominal $500 per acre value accepted by the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Florida Rock\u2019s survey does indicate that most of the buyers in this market did not have extensive knowledge of the provisions of the Clean Water Act and its impact on the development potential of those properties involving wetlands. It is doubtful that any legal conclusions should be drawn from this. Such broad-based disregard for current land use regulations suggests that, while parties contract in the shadow of the law, long term market trends in real estate values are not necessarily correlated to Government controls. The Government\u2019s appraisers testified that detailed knowledge of regulatory constraints was relevant only when the goal of the purchasers was <em>immediate </em>development. And as Mr. Slack testified, \u201cthere was not really a demand for property this far out [from Miami] at this time. People were not buying it to do anything with it right then anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">A speculative market may exist in land that is regulated as well as in land that is not, and the precise content of regulations at any given time may not be particularly important to those active in the market. As this court observed in <em>Florida Rock II, </em>791 F.2d 893 at 902-03, yesterday\u2019s Everglades swamp to be drained as a mosquito haven is today\u2019s wetland to be preserved for wildlife and aquifer recharge;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> who knows what tomorrow\u2019s view of public policy will bring, or how the market will respond to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>We need not decide such speculative questions here. The uncontroverted evidence of an active real estate market compels the conclusion that the typical \u201cwilling buyer-willing seller\u2019 requirement of fair market value had been met; it would be inappropriate for a court to substitute its own judgment of value for that of the market. While an assessor might be justified in adjusting the fair market value figure by discarding aberrational values based upon sales between relate ed entities or fraudulent sales to widows and orphans, an assessor may not discard an <em>entire </em>market as aberrational.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2018Aberrational\u2019 means outside the norm established by general activity. The fact that many players in the market chose to disregard the immediate potential for development in favor of a long-term perspective \u2014 hardly unusual behavior in Florida\u2019s history of real estate investment \u2014 does not make the market as a whole \u2018aberrational.\u2019 When the market provides a well-substantiated value for a property, a court may not substitute its own judgment as to what is a wise investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">It was error to read <em>Florida Rock II </em>as requiring a detailed inquiry into the motivation and sophistication of the buyers of comparable parcels. Dollars are fungible; a speculative market provides a landowner with monetary compensation which is just as satisfactory as that provided by any other market. Should a landowner wish to pick and choose her buyers, that luxury is not chargeable to the federal fisc. To conclude otherwise would be tantamount to concluding that there could never be a market fueled by speculation \u2014 a conclusion at odds both with common sense and with our directions in <em>Florida Rock II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Ultimately, the question that must be answered is whether, as a result of the denial of certain economic uses, there was a taking of Florida Rock\u2019s property by the Government. This question turns on \u201cthe economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,\u201d <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. at 2659, measured by the change, if any, in the fair market value caused by the regulatory imposition. On the state of the record before us we are unable to answer the question. The Court of Federal. Claims answered it with a straightforward \u2018yes\u2019 when the per acre value of the 98 acre parcel after the permit denial was found to be only a nominal $500 per acre, as compared to the $10,500 found by the trial court to be the per acre value prior to the permit denial. This represented a loss in value of roughly 95%. <em>Florida Rock III, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 175. The court in effect treated the permit denial as essentially a \u2018categorical\u2019 taking of all economic use. <em>See Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2893. \u201cThe second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 analysis was correct in theory, but started from an incorrect premise \u2014 that the value of the parcel after denial of the permit was a nominal $500 per acre. When a figure closer to $4,000 per acre is substituted, the correct outcome is no longer clear. On remand, with a fair market value calculated in accordance with this opinion, the Court of Federal Claims must again return to the approach dictated by <em>Florida Rock II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-12\">[T]he court should consider, along with other relevant matters, the relationship of the owner\u2019s basis or investment, and the fair market value before the alleged taking to the fair market value after the alleged taking. In determining the severity of the economic impact, the owner\u2019s opportunity to recoup its investment or better, subject to the regulation, cannot be ignored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-13\"><em>Id., </em>791 F.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">The Court of Federal Claims must reconsider the assessments proffered by the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>ties and other evidence in the record, and determine a fair market value accordingly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Should that determination establish, as the evidence in the record suggests, that there was <em>some </em>(but not a total) reduction in the overall market value of plaintiffs property as a result of the regulatory imposition, the question will then be posed: does that reduction constitute a taking of property compen-sable under the Fifth Amendment?<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">To answer this question requires the court to resolve two preliminary issues. The first is whether a regulation must destroy a certain proportion of a property\u2019s economic use or value in order for a compensable taking of property to occur. The second is how to determine, in any given case, what that proportion is.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922) <em>(.Pennsylvania Coal), </em>the problem for courts has been to determine the extent to which the Fifth Amendment burdens the exercise of the police power through regulation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that is, to determine when a particular regulation somehow \u2014 in the words of Justice Holmes\u2014 goes \u201ctoo far,\u201d <em>id </em>at 415, 43 S.Ct. at 160, and therefore effects a taking.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is now clear that a regulation that constitutes a total deprivation of economically beneficial use goes \u201ctoo far;\u201d such a regulatory imposition re-suits in a \u2018categorical\u2019 taking similar to a physical taking of property.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2886.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">The question remains, does a partial deprivation resulting from a regulatory imposition, that is, a situation in which a regulation deprives the owner of a substantial part but not essentially all of the economic use or value of the property, constitute a partial taking, and is it compensable as such? This question has been much debated in the literature since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision announcing that as a general proposition regulatory takings are compensable; the Court\u2019s decisions to date have not provided an answer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">Nothing in the language of the Fifth Amendment compels a court to find a taking <em>only </em>when the Government divests the total ownership of the property; the Fifth Amendment prohibits the uncompensated taking of private property without reference to the owner\u2019s remaining property interests. In <em>Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court touched upon the question of a partial regulatory taking, <em>see </em>112 S.Ct. 2893-95, but, concluding on the facts before it that the case was one in which the owner was called upon \u201cto sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good,\u201d <em>id </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2895, the Court found a categorical taking and thus did not have to decide the partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>taking question.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at-n. 9, 112 S.Ct. at 2896 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Justice Stevens, writing separately, criticized as arbitrary the notion that \u201c[a] landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an owner whose property is diminished 100% recovers the land\u2019s full value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2919, Stevens, <em>dissenting. </em>In response, Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, noted that Justice Stevens\u2019s analysis \u201cerrs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2894 n. 8.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">No such conceptual problem seems to exist when the taking is by physical occupation. If a property owner owns a 100 acre tract, and the Government takes 95 acres for a public park, no one would argue that the five acres remaining somehow precludes the property owner from claiming entitlement to just compensation for the loss of the 95. Indeed, if the Government took just 5 acres and left the property owner with 95, there would be no question that the owner was entitled to compensation for the parcel taken (plus severance damages attributable to the remaining tract).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Courts have held that even relatively minor physical occupations are compensable. <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982); <em>Hendler v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364 (Fed.Cir.1991). Logically, the amount of just compensation should be proportional to the value of the interest taken as compared to the total value of the property, up to and including total deprivation, whether the taking is by physical occupation for the public to use as a park, or by regulatory imposition to preserve the property as a wetland so that it may be used by the public for ground water recharge and other ecological purposes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-18\">The felt need for some kind of a special rule in regulatory takings cases may stem from the difficult line that has to be drawn between a partial regulatory taking and the mere \u2018diminution in value\u2019 that often accompanies otherwise valid regulatory impositions. As expressed by Justice Holmes in <em>Pennsylvania Coal, </em>\u201cGovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits, or the contract and due process clauses are gone.\u201d <em>Id., </em>260 U.S. at 413, 43 S.Ct. at 159. Gone as well, it is almost superfluous to add, would be the constraints imposed on the Government by the takings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-19\">One way to avoid this linedrawing problem would be to declare that no regulatory taking is compensable under the Fifth Amendment; the only available remedy for a regulation that goes \u2018too far\u2019 is invalidation of the impo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>sition. That was the historie practice in the courts for much of the twentieth century, but the Supreme Court definitively rejected that practice in <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County, </em>482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987). The Fifth Amendment \u201cis designed \u2018not to limit the governmental interference with property rights <em>per se, </em>but rather to secure <em>compensation </em>in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.\u2019\u201d <em>Preseault v. ICC, </em>494 U.S. 1, 11, 110 S.Ct. 914, 921, 108 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (quoting <em>First English, </em>482 U.S. at 315, 107 S.Ct. at 2385; emphasis in both cases).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nothing in the Fifth Amendment limits its protection to only \u2018categorical\u2019 regulatory takings, nor has the Supreme Court or this court so held.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus there remains in cases such as this the difficult task of resolving when a partial loss of economic use of the property has crossed the line from a noncompensable \u2018mere diminution\u2019 to a compensable \u2018partial taking.\u2019 The trial court will find itself with little direct case law guidance. As <em>Pennsylvania Coal </em>and subsequent appellate court decisions have recognized, the question of when a regulatory taking occurs cannot be answered as a matter of absolute doctrine, but irfstead requires case by case adjudication: \u201cthe question depends upon the particular facts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>260 U.S. 393 at 413, 43 S.Ct. at 158 at 159. <em>See also, inter alia, United States v. Caltex, </em>344 U.S. 149, 156, 73 S.Ct. 200, 203, 97 L.Ed. 157 (1952); <em>United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., </em>357 U.S. 155, 168, 78 S.Ct. 1097, 1104, 2 L.Ed.2d 1228 (1958); <em>Penn Central </em>438 U.S. 104 at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646 at 2659, noting the \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries\u201d in takings jurisprudence. But recourse to the facts hardly solves the basic problem at hand \u2014 there simply is no bright line dividing compensable from non-compensable exercises of the Government's power when a regulatory imposition causes a partial loss to the property owner. What is necessary is a classic exercise of judicial balancing of competing values.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">When there is reciprocity of advantage, paradigmatically in a zoning case, <em>see, e.g., Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926), then the claim that the Government has taken private property has little force: the claimant has in a sense been compensated by the public program \u201cadjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.\u201d <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct 2646, 2659. Thus shared economic impacts resulting from certain types of land use controls have been held to be non-compensable. <em>Agins v. Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 262-63, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 2143, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>(1980) (shared \u2018benefits and burdens\u2019 of a zoning ordinance); <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. 104 at 131, 98 S.Ct. 2646 at 2662 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">That the purpose and function of the regulatory imposition is relevant to drawing the line between mere diminution and partial taking should not be read to suggest that when Government acts in pursuit of an important public purpose, its actions are excused from liability. To so hold would eviscerate the plain language of the Takings Clause, and would be inconsistent with Supreme Court guidance.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is necessary that the Government act in a good cause, but it is not sufficient. The takings clause already assumes the Government is acting in the public interest: \u201cnor shall private property be taken <em>for public use </em>without just compensation\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">It is for the trial court as an initial matter to determine whether the Government acted within its proper role in the circumstances presented by the case of <em>Florida Rock. </em>Marketplace decisions should be made under the working assumption that the Government will neither prejudice private citizens, unfairly shifting the burden of a public good onto a few people, nor act arbitrarily or capriciously, that is, will not act to disappoint reasonable investment-backed expectations. The Government, in a word, must act fairly and reasonably, so that private parties can pursue their interests. At the same time, when Government acts as the intermediary between private interests to provide a mutually beneficial environment from which all benefit and in which all can thrive, the shared diminution of free choice that results may not rise to the level of constitutionally required compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">In addition, then, to a demonstration of loss of economic use to the property owner as a result of the regulatory imposition \u2014 a fact yet to be properly determined in this case\u2014 the trial court must consider: are there direct compensating benefits accruing to the property, and others similarly situated, flowing from the regulatory environment? Or are benefits, if any, general and widely shared through the community and the society, while the costs are focused on a few? Are alternative permitted activities economically realistic in light of the setting and circumstances, and are they realistically available? In short, has the Government acted in a responsible way, limiting the constraints on property ownership to those necessary to achieve the public purpose, and not allocating to some number of individuals, less than all, a burden that should be borne by all?</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Admittedly this is not a bright line, simply drawn. Property owners and regulators, attempting to predict whether a governmental regulation has gone too far, will still need to use judgment and exercise care in making decisions. In this sense our decision today continues the tradition of <em>ad hoc </em>judicial decisionmaking in this area. Over time, however, enough cases will be decided with sufficient care and clarity that the line will more clearly emerge.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">The dissent rejects drawing the line between non-compensable \u2018mere diminution\u2019 land use regulatory restraints and compensa-ble takings of property interests that involve less than all of the fee estate. The dissent favors an all or nothing approach \u2014 if some critical threshold of value loss is reached as a result of the regulatory imposition, then the property owner is entitled to compensation for the taking of the entire fee. This is, of course, another way to handle the problem of partial takings, but there are serious problems with the dissent\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">If the dissent\u2019s approach provided a bright line and avoided the <em>ad hocery </em>problem, that might argue in its favor. But it does not. Determining the threshold in any given case which, under the dissent\u2019s view would trigger full compensation, requires the same sort of weighing and balancing of indeterminate factors. Furthermore, the dissent endorses the questionable policy of forcing the Government to pay for something it does not want and has not taken. The dissent\u2019s approach requires the Government to pay for the \u2018fee\u2019 in the land \u2014 i.e., the entire bundle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>rights \u2014 even though the Government may be seeking only to restrict certain kinds of development or certain uses. This has the potential of unfairness to both the Government and the property owner. The latter may wish to be paid for what she has lost but keep the rest; and the Government should not be put to the obligation of paying for more than it wants when it does not set out to take it.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The property owner is entitled to just compensation for what is taken, no less, but no more.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">The dissent is concerned that what is being taken is \u2018value,\u2019 not property.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In fact, in a regulatory context such as this it is both. By taking some portion of Florida Rock\u2019s economic use of the property \u2014 its power to disturb the overlying wetlands, and with it the common law property right to mine its subsurface minerals \u2014 the Government appears to have destroyed part of the value of Florida-Rock\u2019s holdings. If that proves to be the case, and if the application of the <em>ad hoc </em>tests previously described so warrant, the property interest taken belongs to the Government, and the right to just compensation for the interest taken belongs to Florida Rock.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The Supreme Court did not have any difficulty in finding that a property interest was taken when the Government authorized the installation of a small cable box on an apartment building; the Government was not required to buy the building. <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982). Nor was there any difficulty in finding a property interest taken \u2014 if it needs a label, call it a limited co-tenancy with an easement for access \u2014 when the Government sank wells on an owner\u2019s property and periodically entered to service the wells and to make tests of the water. <em>Hendler v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364 (Fed.Cir.1991). The fact that the source of any particular taking is a regulation rather than a physical entry should make no difference \u2014 the nature of legal interests defining the property affected remains unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Finally, the dissent believes that Supreme Court precedent establishes that a Fifth Amendment claim that specific property has been taken is an all or nothing proposition. If taken to mean that a regulatory taking cannot result in less than a taking of the property owner\u2019s entire fee estate, we cannot agree. There has never been any question but that the Government can take any kind of recognized estate or interest in property it chooses in an eminent domain proceeding; it is not limited to fee interests. We see no reason or support for a different rule in inverse condemnation cases, and that is true whether the taking results from a physical or regulatory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">In this case we have concluded that the record does not support a finding that the fee in the land, i.e., all economic use or value, was taken by this regulation, although that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>question is still an open one to be decided by the facts of valuation properly found. Since loss of economic use and value is the issue in this regulatory taking case, it is not possible, absent a valid determination in the record of the \u2018after imposition\u2019 value of the land, to know if a taking occurred, much less what the Government must pay for it. We are compelled, therefore, to remand the matter to the trial court for a determination of that essential piece of information, and for an initial determination as to its significance in order to decide whether there is a compensa-ble taking of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-5\">.

The per acre value of the 98 acre parcel may differ significantly from the per acre value of the 1,560 acre tract; testimony in the record indicates that the market value of the land is highly dependent on the size of the parcel offered (the larger the parcel, the lower the per acre price), and on the location of the parcel relative to the existing roads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\">.

The admissibility and significance of this state court decision was a matter of heated dispute between the parties, both at trial and on appeal. The Government argued that, under the doctrine of nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendoza, </em>464 U.S. 154, 104 S.Ct. 568, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984)), <em>Bystrom </em>was conclusive on the question of the fair market value of the property, and, given the value of the property thus established, there could be no taking. Florida Rock argued that the Court of Federal Claims was not bound by holdings in a state tax assessment case, and that the general rule that property tax assessments are not admissible as evidence of fair market value in a condemnation proceeding (citing <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 Ct.Cl. 352, 620 F.2d 812 (Ct.Cl.1980)) was fully applicable. The trial judge agreed with Florida Rock, and concluded that, since valuation for purposes of state taxation and valuation for purposes of determining a taking under the Fifth Amendment are not identical issues, the court was not bound by the <em>Bystrom </em>court\u2019s findings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AbZQ\">We find no error in the trial judge's conclusion that the value placed on the property in the tax case should not be determinative of the fair mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>ket value for takings purposes. As we explain below, it is not the tax assessor\u2019s valuation which is at issue here, but whether there was a market from which a fair value could be established. At the very least, however, this judicial proceeding provides a thorough review of several real estate assessors' analyses of the fair market value at the relevant time, and provides the Court of Federal Claims with a judicial determination based on a high degree of familiarity with the Florida real estate market. As such, it is admissible and persuasive in support of the Government\u2019s argument that the 98 acre parcel retained more than nominal fair market value after denial of the permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b963-8\">.

It is true that there is a statement in <em>Florida Rock II </em>\u2014 that a willing buyer is one who is 'correctly informed\u2019 about the legal restrictions on the use of the land \u2014 that, taken in isolation and as a blanket requirement, is not a correct statement of law.

It is also true that it was this statement that gave Florida Rock\u2019s lawyers a crack through which they attempted to drive their novel approach to what constitutes a fair market. And it was the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of this approach that requires today\u2019s reversal. When read as a whole, however, the opinion in <em>Florida Rock II </em>does not support such a novel approach to the well-established concept of a willing buyer.

We note in passing that in both <em>First English </em>and <em>Preseault </em>the Supreme Court applied the takings clause to property interests less compendious than a fee simple. <em>First English </em>concerned a temporary prohibition on the use of land in a floodplain. The Supreme Court did not hold, as the dissent would have us today, that the Government's temporary taking required that the Government purchase the fee. Instead, the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment required compensation for what was taken, viz. the use of the petitioner\u2019s land for a limited period of time. <em>Preseault </em>involved a reverter on an easement. The Supreme Court held that the takings challenge was premature because the petitioner had not brought a claim under the Tucker Act in the Court of Federal Claims.

Identification of a specific property interest to be transferred to the Government should pose little problem for property lawyers. Property interests are about as diverse as the human mind can conceive. Property interests may be real and personal, tangible and intangible, possessory and nonpossessory. They can be defined in terms of sequential rights to possession (present interests \u2014 life estates and various types of fees\u2014 and future interests), and in terms of shared interests (such as the various kinds of co-ownership). There are specially structured property interests (such as those of a mortgagee, lessee, bailee, adverse possessor), and there are interests in special kinds of things (such as water, and commercial contracts). And property interests play across the entire range of legal ideas: see, e.g., <em>Tompkins v. Superior Court of San Francisco, </em>59 Cal.2d 65, 27 Cal.Rptr. 889, 378 P.2d 113 (1963) (did joint occupancy of an apartment give one occupant the kind of possessory property interest that carried with it the power to grant to police legal entry to search without a warrant for the other occupant\u2019s marijuana stash).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b972-8\">NIES, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">On procedural and substantive grounds, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s remand for a determination of whether the United States must pay compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the extent that the 98 acres in issue lost a substantial part, but not essentially all, of its economic use or value. The majority\u2019s theory is contrary to Fifth Amendment \u201ctakings\u201d jurisprudence as delineated by the Supreme Court and this court. Labelling its lost use/value theory a \u201cpartial taking\u201d (ipse dixit) does not give it any legitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Inverse condemnation of land, like the affirmative exercise of the power of eminent domain, requires the transfer of the property found to be taken to the United States. Value is not a transferable interest. Thus, a claim for loss of value does not constitute a takings claim within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">In response to the dissent, the majority opines that any loss in value due to a regulatory restriction on land use can be easily transmuted into a taking of a property right in the land (Op. p. 1570, n. 26) and that such right will belong to the government (p. 1570). The majority\u2019s recognition that a successful claim of inverse condemnation of land transfers property rights is salutary. However, the majority\u2019s throw-in line on the transfer of a property right to the United States does not change the thrust of its opinion that damages must be paid to the extent of loss of value in the fee to the 98 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">The majority\u2019s partial taking theory, now vaguely tied to property rights, appears to borrow from the views of then Justice Rehnquist in his dissent in <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 138-153, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2666-2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978), and restated in <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 506-521, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 1252-1261, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1986) that the taking of an identifiable property right should be compen-sable. However, the Supreme Court, in <em>Penn Central </em>(and in Keystone) rejected the division of the fee owner\u2019s bundle of property rights into separate takable rights. <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 130-31, 98 S.Ct. at 2662; <em>Keystone, </em>480 U.S. at 470-501, 107 S.Ct. at 1232-1250. These decisions and all others require one to focus on the effect of a regulatory restriction on the totality of an owner\u2019s rights in the property. See also <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Prod. v. Const. Laborers Pen. Tr., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 113 S.Ct. 2264, 2291,124 L.Ed.2d 539 (1993) (citing <em>Keystone). A </em>diminution in value from denial of an economic use (even if the loss can be expressed in property right terms) is insufficient to effect a taking under <em>all </em>Supreme Court precedent so long as substantial other uses are left to the owner. While the Supreme Court may rethink and change its rulings, this court is not free to adopt positions in conflict with decisions of the Court, anticipating that the Court will be persuaded to adopt a dissenting Justice\u2019s view. In any event, the majority espouses compensation for a partial taking of the fee, which is not the same as the total taking of a severable interest. No support for the partial taking theory can be found even in dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">With respect to procedural error after the first remand, the issue in this case was limited to whether the entire fee had been taken, which turned on whether the property had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>substantial value after the denial of the permit. As this court specifically instructed in <em>Florida Bock II,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-4\">[I]f there is found to exist a solid and adequate fair market value (for the 98 acres) which Florida Rock could have obtained from others for that property, that would be a sufficient remaining use of the property to forestall a determination that a taking had occurred or that any just compensation had to be paid by the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">791 F.2d 893, 903 (Fed.Cir.1986). This court in <em>Florida Bock II </em>remanded for a determination of whether substantial value remained. If it did, no taking occurred. The majority sides with the government on that issue and holds that the entire fee was not taken, which should have ended this litigation under principles of law of the case. Instead, the majority remands to allow Florida Rock to prove a different claim, indeed, a claim once raised and now subsumed in the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the issue of a \u201cpartial taking,\u201d had it been argued on appeal by Florida Rock, would be outside the scope of appellate review because that party filed no cross appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it is not an argument in support of the judgment. <em>United States v. American Ry. Exp. Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 563, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">This court has no license to shape a case more to its liking by not only ignoring the law of the case but also effectively taking an appeal for Florida Rock. The trial court ordered the government to pay $1 + million for the 98 acres and ordered Florida Rock to tender a deed to the property. Florida Rock tied its fate to upholding that judgment. Under the majority\u2019s ruling that the entirety of the fee was not taken, Florida Rock loses.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">While the procedural issue is dispositive, I will also address the merits of the majority theory of a \u201cpartial\u201d taking which conflicts with current Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">No legal subject has received the attention of scholars more than \u201ctakings\u201d jurisprudence in recent years. A flood of literature has been produced advocating various theories of property and social responsibilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>Some espouse the view that property is held subject to complete control as to its use by the state and federal governments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Others, at the opposite extreme, start from a premise that owners have a right to use their property in any manner, virtually without restriction, and, damages must be paid for any governmental interference with their use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The more often the government must pay for exercising control over private property, the less control there will be. That is the reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The majority decision discusses \u201ctakings\u201d law in a conventional manner through sections A and B of its analysis. But then it leads us into the camp of those who advocate damage awards for regulatory restriction (Op. p. 1568). Its economic justification that the government will now pay less for regulatory interference with private property is specious. In the absence of governmental restrictions rising to the very high level of a total \u201ctaking\u201d of the property in issue required by Supreme Court precedent, <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 225-228, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 1026-1027, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1985); <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 130-31, 136-38, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2662, 2665-2666, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978), the government does not now pay. It may pay more in the few cases where a claimant can satisfy those high standards, but it requires little imagination to envision the vast sums required for lost value/use claims if the government must pay for mere impairment of rights. Indeed, the objective of the theory is to preclude government regulation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> precisely because regulation will entail too great a cost. Only in this respect will the theory save the public fisc.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The majority does not analyze loss of value and transfer of a property right separately under its partial taking theory. Essentially it sees no distinction in a property right, an economic use and a loss of value. However, I will address lost value separately from property rights because the concepts, which may be the same under \u201claw-and-economics\u201d theories, are not interchangeable in established takings jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">\n<em>Loss of Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">The majority view that lost value of land in itself is compensable is not the course set by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Caus-by, </em>328 U.S. 256, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 90 L.Ed. 1206 (1945), provides perhaps the clearest statement that an inverse condemnation claim respecting land rights requires an identification of the specific property interest to be transferred to the government. <em>Causby </em>involved a takings claim by reason of low military aircraft flights over the plaintiffs chicken farm which destroyed its use for that purpose. As held therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-14\">[T]he Court of Claims held, as we have noted, that an easement was taken. But the findings of fact contain no precise description as to its nature. It is not described in terms of frequency of flight, permissible altitude, or type of airplane. Nor is there a finding as to whether the easement taken was temporary or permanent. <em>Yet an accurate description of the property taken is essential, since that interest vests in the United States. United States v. Cress, supra </em>[243 U.S. 316], 328-329 [37 S.Ct. 380, 385, 61 L.Ed. 746 (1917)], and cases cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 267, 66 S.Ct. at 1069 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">\u201cValue\u201d is not a property right under Florida law or any state law that I can uncover. While much of takings law is unclear, one principle is not. Rights in land depend on the law of the particular state. <em>Preseault v. ICC, </em>494 U.S. 1,16 n. 9, 20-25,110 S.Ct. 914, 924 n. 9, 108 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (majority and concurring opinions); <em>Ruckelshaus v. Mon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number><em>santo Co., </em>467 U.S. 986,1001, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 2871, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984) (\u201cProperty interests ... are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d). Use of generalities respecting \u201cproperty\u201d law disserves the development of coherent takings jurisprudence. The right taken must be identified not only because, when transferred, it becomes the property of the United States. <em>Id.; Deltona Corp. v. United States, </em>228 Ct.Cl. 476, 657 F.2d 1184, 1190 (1981), but also because compensation is fixed at the fair market value of the transferred property right. <em>Yuba Natural Resources, Inc. v. United States, </em>904 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This bedrock requirement means that, the United States having purchased the fee or a property right, no second claim that the government took that specific property is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">In contrast, a lost value damage claim would impose not even an easement on the land. Successive claims are not only possible but likely. If loss of value alone created a claim, Florida Rock not only would receive the damage award, but also would keep its land. In effect, takings jurisprudence would become a novel type of Fifth Amendment tort claim for regulatory injury to the landowner under which the United States must pay damages while receiving no quid pro quo. This is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Inverse condemnation jurisprudence, like the direct exercise of eminent domain power, is based to a large extent on <em>in rem </em>concepts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the theory of compensation simply for a loss in the land\u2019s value, not for the taking of a property right founded on Florida law, is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The Supreme Court has long <em>rejected </em>the position that a diminution in economic value of private lands caused by government regulation of its use requires compensation. <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 131, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2662, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978); <em>Welch v. Swasey, </em>214 U.S. 91, 29 S.Ct. 567, 53 L.Ed. 923 (1909). As stated in <em>Penn Central, </em>\u201c[Supreme Court precedent] uniformly reject[s] the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a taking.\u201d <em>Penn Central Transp. Co., </em>438 U.S. at 131, 98 S.Ct. at 2663 (citing <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926) (75 percent diminution in value caused by zoning law); <em>Hadachek v. Sebastian, </em>239 U.S. 394, 36 S.Ct. 143, 60 L.Ed. 348 (1915) (87)6 percent diminution in value)). The taking issue \u201cis resolved by focusing on the uses the regulations permit.\u201d <em>Penn Central', </em>438 U.S. at 131, 98 S.Ct. at 2663.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Appellants in <em>Penn Central </em>argued that the NYC landmark law effected a taking because its operation had significantly diminished the value of the Penn Central Terminal site. Appellants further argued that any restriction imposed on individual landmarks pursuant to the Landmark Law constituted a taking requiring just compensation. The Court found \u201cno merit\u201d in the argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">Thus, it is clear that no claim under the Fifth Amendment for a taking is stated by allegations that the property in issue simply lost value.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">\n<em>The Property Rights in Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">In the instant case, while there is no allegation that the government took a property right from the fee owned by Florida Rock, the majority suggests throughout its opinion that mining rights are the property rights in issue whose loss require prorata compensation. Florida Rock\u2019s position in contrast is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>that the denial of the permit for mining effectively took the entire fee by reason of the denial of all economically viable use. This latter position tracks precedent that government actions, which leave some property rights in the owner may, nevertheless, so severely interfere with private land use that they are deemed equivalent to outright condemnation of the land for public use. <em>Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., </em>80 U.S. 166, 177-180, 20 L.Ed. 557 (1871) (\u201ctaking\u201d by flooding land by dam construction).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\"><em>Lucas v. South Carolina, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992), is the latest in a series of \u201ctakings\u201d cases issued since this case was previously on appeal. The plaintiff pleaded the taking of the \u201cfee simple interest\u201d to certain lands. <em>Id. </em>at-n. 7,112 S.Ct. at 2894 n. 7. <em>Lucas </em>is instructive that a taking of the fee may be found even though the owner was left with some property rights after the governmental action. The state regulations at issue in <em>Lucas </em>prohibited any building on Lucas\u2019 two oceanfront privately-owned lots. The regulations did not strip the owner of all property rights, e.g., the right to sell or devise the land. Nevertheless, the court held that the denial of all economically viable use by state regulation effected a categorical and total taking of the land unless, under state law, the action amounted to abatement of a \u201cnuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">The <em>Lucas </em>opinion begins with the recognition that a claim that a governmental regulation took private property for public \u00fase has generally required <em>ad hoc </em>factual inquiries into the circumstances of each case, there being no set formula for deciding that the action effected an inverse condemnation. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2893. In <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 224-25, 106 S.Ct. 1018,1026, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986) (citing <em>Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. at 2659), the Court had provided the following guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-15\">To aid in this determination, however, we have identified three factors which have \u201cparticular significance\u201d: (1) \u201cthe economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe character of the governmental action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">In <em>Lucas, </em>two discrete categories of regulatory action were delineated as compensable without case-specific inquiry namely, (1) regulation allowing physical \u201cinvasion\u201d of private property and (2) regulation denying <em>all </em>economically beneficial or productive use of land. \u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2893. Thus, where <em>less </em>than <em>all </em>economically beneficial or productive use of land is lost by reason of governmental regulation, one reverts to an <em>ad hoc </em>inquiry to determine whether the property in issue, here the fee, was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-19\">In contrast, the majority divides the \u201cad hoc\u201d inquiry into two types of takings, total and partial. After finding there is no categorical taking by physical invasion or prevention of <em>all </em>economic use of land, the two situations recognized in <em>Lucas, </em>the majority concludes that, under the <em>ad hoc </em>inquiry, the claimant may recover proportional compensation for the impairment of economic use if it passes a threshold beyond \u201cdiminution in value.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority, in an <em>ad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number><em>hoc </em>inquiry, the reduction in value resulting from use restriction pertains to whether a \u201ctaking\u201d occurred. In making the \u201ctaking\u201d determination, such loss is a factor. <em>Id., </em>at -n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 2895 n. 8 (95 percent loss may not get \u201cbenefit of categorical formulation\u201d but \u201ckeenly relevant to takings analysis\u201d). The loss in value, however, is not the property taken (as discussed supra) nor the measure of compensation. <em>Yuba, </em>904 F.2d at 1580.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Under Supreme Court precedent, a Fifth Amendment claim that specific property has been taken is an all or nothing proposition. Either the property in issue has been taken and the fair market value at the time of the taking must be paid, or the property is not taken and no compensation is due. <em>Tabb Lakes, Ltd. v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 796, 800-803 (Fed.Cir.1993). The answer is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d not \u201cpartially.\u201d See <em>Lucas, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 2895 n. 8 (\u201cTakings law is full of those \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 situations.\u201d). Thus, under an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis, a 95 percent loss of value in the land, for example, may be sufficient, when considered with other factors, to require the government to purchase 100 percent of the interest in the land, i.e. the fee. Conversely, the landowner asserting the taking of the fee receives nothing, despite the loss in value caused by the regulatory action, if the factors weighed together do not mandate that the government must become an \u201cinvoluntary purchaser\u201d of the fee. <em>Florida Rock II, </em>791 F.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The majority states that in <em>Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court touched upon but did not have to decide \u201cthe partial taking question.\u201d (p. 1568) The Supreme Court did note that precedent did not make it clear, even in a categorical taking, how to determine \u201cthe property interest against which the loss of value is to be measured.\u201d The court noted that \u201cthis uncertainty regarding the denominator in our \u2018deprivation\u2019 fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-n. 7, 112 S.Ct. at 2894 n. 7. The majority seeks to shoehorn its \u201cpartial taking\u201d theory into this open question. It does not fit. The <em>Lucas </em>court left open the question of how to determine the property interest in issue, the denominator. One would still determine whether there is a total taking of that property interest. The \u201cpartial taking\u201d theory does not change the denominator or even the numerator. The majority\u2019s denominator remains the fee and if an ad <em>hoc </em>inquiry negates that the fee is taken, one simply would go on, (under the majority\u2019s view) to consider proportional compensation if a threshold of injury, more than \u201cmere diminution\u201d, is passed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">There can be no question that the \u201cpartial\u201d taking theory of the majority does not change the property in issue (the denominator) from the fee to mining rights. If the taking of mining rights were the issue, one would simply evaluate the mining rights at the time the permit was denied. And there would be no need to remand to determine if a. taking of such rights occurred. One would merely remand for their evaluation. Cf. <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 152, 98 S.Ct. at 2673 (Rehnquist, J. dissenting). Mining is clearly precluded and such right has zero value to Florida Rock after the action on the permit. The majority, instead, engages in a complicated before and after taking evaluation of the fee. But the loss in value <em>of the fee </em>does not reflect the value of mining rights on the date of permit denial. One must also take into account that the land is zoned for five-acre residential development as well. It is pure speculation whether the substantial residual value found by the majority reflects investment value for future mining use or for future residential use.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> What the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>evaluation analysis makes clear is that its discussion of mining rights merely serves to obfuscate its theory that a substantially less than total loss of value in the fee must be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The majority\u2019s partial taking theory finds no home in an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis. As reaffirmed most recently in <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Proc., </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2290:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">[A] claimant\u2019s parcel of property could not first be divided into what was taken and what was left for the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete and hence compensable. To the extent that any portion of property is taken, that portion is always taken in its entirety; the relevant question, however, is whether the property taken is all, or only a portion of the parcel in question. Accord, <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. De-Benedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 497, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 1248, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987) (\u201c[0]ur test for regulatory taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property, [and] one of the critical questions is determining how to define the unit of property \u201cwhose value is to furnish the denominator of the fraction\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The <em>ad hoc </em>analysis answers the question whether the entirety of the property in issue should be deemed confiscated even where the owner retains some rights. It gives no guidance on how to determine what is the property in issue, i.e., the denominator. It is simply the formula to apply after the denominator is properly defined. That \u201ccomplex question\u201d is not facilely answered by giving the restricted interest a name.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">The law has been and continues to mandate that a court may not look only to the part of the entirety of property rights of a fee owner which a regulation restricts, whether called a property right, an economic use, or simply value. As <em>Concrete Pipe </em>informs us, there is always a total taking of that interest and conversely, a partial taking of the fee. This is, indeed, the precise rationale for requiring an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis. One must weigh the rights (and value) of the property in issue before regulatory action against the rights (and value) therein after regulatory restriction and find confiscatory disparity between the two values for a taking to be found. Thus, where only a portion of the acreage of a tract is affected by denial of a wetlands permit, we have held under an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis that no taking of the tract occurred and no compensation was due. <em>Delto-na Corp. v. United States, </em>228 Ct.Cl. 476, 657 F.2d 1184, 1192 (1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">The difficult issue of what is the property in issue (the denominator) was avoidable in <em>Lucas </em>because the plaintiff claimed the fee was taken.' Here as well. Respecting the denominator, as indicated, we do not have a question of the taking of a <em>severable </em>interest, i.e., mineral rights from the bundle of rights in the land.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, Florida Rock abandoned any issue other than the taking of the fee in its entirety prior to the first appeal. <em>Florida Rock III, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 161, 169 n. 5 (1990). At this stage of proceedings, nothing less is at stake than the entire fee interest in the 98 acres. The majority\u2019s ruling that the fee was not taken under an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis mandates reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Inasmuch as the majority remands for determination of the difference in value of the fee, before and after permit denial, it is appropriate to point out the legal error in the $10,500 valuation figure as the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>fee <em>prior </em>to denial of the permit. One must focus on the fair market value on the date of the denial, namely on October 2, 1982, because that is the date of the alleged taking. <em>First Lutheran, </em>482 U.S. at 321 n. 10, 107 S.Ct. at 2389 n. 10 (the valuation of property taken must be calculated at time of taking); <em>Kirby Forest Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>467 U.S. 1, 10, 104 S.Ct. 2187, 2194, 81 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983) (just compensation determined on the date property is taken); <em>Tabb Lakes v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 796, 803 (Fed.Cir.1993) (compensation is measured from the time the taking occurs).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">The pre-denial value ascribed to the fee by the trial court of $10,500 is the value of the wetlands acreage with <em>no </em>regulations. The trial court based the $10,500 figure on the acquisition cost with upward adjustments. <em>Florida Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 161, 169 n. 5 (1990) <em>(Florida Rock III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On the evidence of record, the $10,500 per acre figure does not reflect the fair market value of the fee immediately prior to the denial of the permit on Florida Rock\u2019s property. The value of these lands prior to permit denial had previously been diminished by the state and federal <em>regulations </em>applicable to all wetlands. However, the regulations in themselves constitute no taking. As specifically held in <em>United States v. Riverside Bay-view Homes, Inc.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">A requirement that a person obtain a permit before engaging in a certain use of his or her property does not itself \u201ctake\u201d the property in any sense: after all, the very existence of a permit system implies that permission may be granted, leaving the landowner free to use the property as desired. Moreover, even if the permit is denied, there may be other viable uses available to the owner. Only when a permit is denied and the effect of the denial is to prevent \u201ceconomically viable\u201d use of the land in question can it be said that a taking has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">474 U.S. 121, 127, 106 S.Ct. 455, 459, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Thus, any loss attributable to the regulations is noncompensable. As evidenced by enactment of the FWPCA, the nation has come to recognize that wetlands are necessary resources which require special protection from unbridled development. Contrary to the majority, the limitations of development only under permit may be imposed on this type of property without compensation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Owners of such property have no right from ownership to use lands with this natural resource unfettered. Ownership of property carries responsibilities to the community as a whole as well as privileges. Like height limitations or five-acre zoning laws or other similar restrictions on use, the government\u2019s assertion of control generally over use of wetlands, which devalues all such property to some extent, is not itself compensable. \u201cGovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 413, 43 S.Ct. 158, 159, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922). Thus, the fair market value of the fee must be determined with these general restrictions on land use in place, not as if no regulations of wetlands existed at all. Only with this adjustment is the <em>pre-taking </em>value of the property properly determined. Indeed, the evidence of sales of \u201ccomparable\u201d lands in the 1980\u2019s, discussed by the majority in connection with <em>post-taking </em>valuation, appears in fact to reflect the <em>pre-taking </em>impact of general wetlands regulations on neighboring property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The majority treats sales of wetland property on which no permit was denied as evidence of the value of wetland property on which a permit was denied. Under the majority\u2019s rationale, the denial of the permit has <em>no effect </em>on valuation. Actually, the majority is suggesting a partial taking occurred based on a comparison between the original value of the subject land and the later lower value of other property, lower because depressed by general regulations, but for which no permit was denied. That would mean the existence of general regulations respecting wetlands effected the taking, which is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Riverside Bayview, supra. </em>Moreover, the actual alleged act of taking under the majority\u2019s view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>can be simply ignored. Muddled though land takings law may be, it is not so muddled that these concepts can pass muster.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-6\">. Florida Rock\u2019s complaint in the Court of Federal Claims originally sought, <em>inter alia, </em>damages for the diminution in value of its land but, during the course of litigation, that issue dropped out in the first trial, and no appeal of the viability of that type of claim was taken. Rather, the issue litigated was whether the United States had taken the entirety of the fee to the 98 acres. The majority brings a closed issue back into the entirety of the case by its partial taking theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-7\">.

In a temporary taking, the proper measure of compensation is the value of the use of the property interest during the taking, since the government returns the property interest to the owner when the taking ends. <em>Yuba, </em>904 F.2d at 1580-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\">. \u201cWhile the typical taking occurs when the government acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the entire doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the proposition that a taking may occur without such formal proceeding.\u201d <em>First English Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County, </em>482 U.S. 304, 316, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 2386, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b976-12\">. This exception appears inapt as applied to federal regulation. The source of federal action is constitutional, as is the requirement for compensation. Precedent respecting takings by state action must be carefully parsed to determine whether the principles are equally applicable to federal regulation. The authority of Congress to impose use restrictions in this case rests on the commerce clause which, it is true, may be exercised to achieve purposes akin to a state\u2019s police power. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 432, 436-37, 45 S.Ct. 345, 346, 69 L.Ed. 699 (1925). But it is not at all clear or logical that a state's nuisance law, which the <em>Lucas </em>court recognized as the basis for no compensation respecting a state\u2019s exercise of police powers, is also the limit of the federal power to take property without compensation. The noncompensable seizure of houses, cars, boats, airplanes, or other private property in connection with drug crimes seems to belie the majority\u2019s assumption (Op. p. 1577 n. 10) that state nuisance law alone defines the interrelation of commerce and the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b976-21\">.
