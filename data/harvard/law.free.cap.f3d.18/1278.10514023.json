We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">Clark was fired in December 1988 after being employed as a line technician by Kraft for several years. Shortly thereafter she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the primary thrust of which was an allegation of sexual harassment and retaliation for grievances she filed in response to that harassment. In 1991 Clark filed the instant action, claiming that she was pressured to take a lower paying position and was ultimately fired because of her gender. The sexual harassment claim, the dominant theme in her EEOC complaint, was not advanced, apparently because it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-19\">Kraft moved for summary judgment asserting that Clark had not raised her disparate treatment claim before the EEOC and, therefore, had not exhausted administrative remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge accepted Kraft\u2019s challenge and recommended that summary judgment be granted because the \u201cdisparate treatment claim ... was not presented to the EEOC, nor was it within the scope of the EEOC investigation of plaintiffs charge.\u201d That recommendation was adopted without comment by the district court. Clark timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-20\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-21\">Clark maintains that she properly raised the disparate treatment issue before the EEOC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kraft counters that although Clark\u2019s EEOC complaint included claims of sexual harassment and retaliation for that harassment, it did not include a separate allegation of disparate treatment on the basis of gender. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-22\">As a jurisdictional predicate Clark had to exhaust EEOC remedies for the sex-based discrimination advanced in this action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>sole issue before us is exhaustion and our sole inquiry is whether the disparate treatment claim pursued in the present litigation was advanced before the EEOC. We decide that question in the affirmative because the EEOC investigation of that claim was a reasonable consequence of Clark\u2019s EEOC complaint and supporting documentation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">We look first to Clark\u2019s original \u201cCharge of Discrimination.\u201d This document sets forth several claims, the most important of which are: \u201c1. I was harassed because of my sex, female. 2. I was sexually harassed.\u201d Viewed in isolation the first complaint reasonably could be read as either an allegation of sexual harassment or as a claim that she had been persecuted in her job because of her gender. These points, however, were presented in tandem. Were we to read Clark\u2019s first claim as simply alleging sexual harassment, we would render her second claim redundant. Long established principles of interpretation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Clark\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status at the time of her EEQC complaint<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> militate against such a construction of her filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">We conclude that Clark\u2019s statements to the EEOC presented a sufficient predicate upon which one reasonably would expect the agency to investigate a disparate treatment claim. Her EEOC affidavit explained that females on her line \u201cwere forced to bust off their job and take lower bracket pay jobs.\u201d Her EEOC Discharge Questionnaire expanded on this point, noting that \u201c[d]ue to the cut in Matinence [sic] Dept, they wanted the women off the line operators jobs to place the xtra [sic] men.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These statements at least raise inferences supporting Clark\u2019s claim of gender-based harassment. Her allegation that women on her fine were removed to lower paying jobs to make room for men should have given the EEOC investigators reasonable cause to examine whether she was pressured to do the same or whether her ultimate firing resulted from systematic replacement of any female in her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">Despite its present position on appeal, at the time of Clark\u2019s EEOC complaint Kraft apparently considered Clark to be claiming disparate treatment on the basis of gender. In answer to the EEOC\u2019s request for information Kraft denied the existence of any \u201cevidence that female employees are more frequently terminated or otherwise more harshly treated in the disciplinary process.\u201d Kraft concluded its response by noting that Clark\u2019s termination \u201chad nothing to do with her sex.\u201d If Clark had presented no color-able allegation of disparate treatment that reaction would have been a <em>non sequitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">Albeit mindful that the actual scope of an EEOC investigation does not determine whether a claim is exhausted,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we are also mindful that investigation of a particular claim creates a strong inference that such a claim was presented. In the instant case the EEOC investigated Clark\u2019s gender-based disparate treatment claim. Its determination expressly mentions a gender-based harassment claim which it treats as distinct from claims of sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting such harassment. The first half of the EEOC report deals exclusively with Clark\u2019s \u201csexual harassment allegation.\u201d The determination then separately addresses \u201c[t]he Charging Party\u2019s allegation that she was <em>harassed because of her sex, </em>and in retaliation for complaining about sexual harassment.\u201d EEOC inquiries discussed thereunder include the question whether males and other females in Clark\u2019s position received comparable work assignments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>duties. These questions, like Kraft\u2019s representation that males and females are treated equally, manifestly are. consistent with an EEOC inquiry into a gender-based disparate treatment claim. The EEOC determination concluded that \u201c[t]he investigation discovered no evidence that Charging Party was asked to resign and was subsequently discharged because of her sex, female, <em>or </em>because she complained of sexual harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">It is apparent that sexual harassment and retaliation for reporting sexual harassment were Clark\u2019s principal allegations at the administrative stage. It is also apparent in the statements of Clark, Kraft, and the EEOC that Clark raised a gender-based disparate treatment claim sufficient to prompt an EEOC investigation.. Suggesting no particular resolution on the merits, we conclude that administrative remedies for the instant complaint of gender-based disparate treatment were exhausted and that Clark\u2019s claim is properly before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Kraft is therefore VACATED and the cause is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-15\">. <em>Tolbert v.

Clark asserts that she exhausted administrative remedies on her claim of retaliation for filing a 1988 gender discrimination grievance.
