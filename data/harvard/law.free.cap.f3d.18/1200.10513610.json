We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The authorities seized 24.2 grams of crack cocaine from Gardner. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 that quantity would result in an offense level of 28. Under section 4B1.1, however, because Gardner was over 18 years old and had two prior violent felony convictions his offense level became 34. Gardner\u2019s two prior convictions for voluntary manslaughter would have resulted in a criminal history category of IV. Section 4B1.1 boosted that classification to VI. An offense level of 34 with a criminal history category of VI results in a sentencing range of 262 to 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">Gardner challenges the validity of section 4B1.1, contending that Congress authorized increases in career offender criminal history scores, but did not empower the Sentencing Commission to increase their offense levels. This objection was not raised in the trial court; our review is thus limited to a search for plain error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we may vacate the sentence only if section 4B1.1 goes beyond the Commission\u2019s statutory authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">Gardner\u2019s <em>ultra vires </em>argument rests on his narrow reading of the career offender statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), which requires the Commission to promulgate guidelines that \u201cspecify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants in which the defendant\u201d is over 18 and has been convicted of three violent or drug-related felonies. He urges that the term \u201ccategories of defendants\u201d can only refer to criminal history categories; therefore, in implementing section 994(h), the section 4B1.1 enhancement of both the criminal history scores and the offense level goes beyond the legislative delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">Gardner\u2019s reading of the term is based on the following flawed epagoge: statutes must be construed in an internally consistent fashion, giving terms the same meaning throughout; sections 994(d) and (h) both use the term \u201ccategories of defendants\u201d; the Commission created criminal history categories under section 994(d); therefore, section 994(h) can only refer to criminal history categories when it uses that term. Gardner thus concludes that \u201cthe plain meaning of section 994(h) is that the repeat offenders identified by the statute are to be sentenced at or near the maximum term for the highest criminal history category.\u201d Based on this analysis, according to Gardner, the Commission was authorized to enhance criminal history scores but not offense levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">We are not persuaded that the language of section 994(h) permits, much less compels, that interpretation. We conclude that \u201ccategories of defendants\u201d as used in section 994(h) refers to career offenders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The criminal history category is, at most, only one of the several categories of defendants addressed in various parts of section 994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>We would further note that the Commission and the courts have construed the accompanying phrase \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d as meaning the maximum term authorized by statute for the offense involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With this in mind, Gardner\u2019s interpretation becomes untenable. Increasing his criminal history category to VI but keeping his offense level at 28 would result in a guideline sentencing range of 140 to 175 months, far below the 40-year statutory maximum provided for the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">We conclude that section 4B1.1 is authorized by the statute and, accordingly, is a valid exercise of the power accorded the Sentencing Commission. The sentence appealed is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">. <em>United States v.
