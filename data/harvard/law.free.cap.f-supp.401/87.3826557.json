Election Law \u00a7 465 <em>et seq. </em>(McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 17, Supp. 1974). Pursuant to its authorized powers under \u00a7 472 of the Election Law, the Board promulgated a \u201cFair Campaign Code\u201d (\u201cCode\u201d) for the purpose, <em>inter alia, </em>of \u201cstimulating just debate\u201d in political campaigns.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs in these two cases have challenged the constitutionality of those sections of the Code (and of the statute, Election Law \u00a7 472(a)) which prohibit \u201cduring the course of any campaign for nomination or election to public office or party position,\u201d by means of \u201ccampaign literature, media advertisements or broadcasts, public speeches, press releases, writings or otherwise,\u201d \u201cattacks on a candidate based on race, sex, religion or ethnic background\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(c)); any \u201cmisrepresentation of any candidate\u2019s qualifications\u201d including the use of \u201cpersonal vilification\u201d and \u201cscurrilous attacks\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(d)); any \u201cmisrepresentation of a candidate\u2019s position\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(e)); and any \u201cmisrepresentation of any candidate\u2019s party affiliation or party endorsement\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(f)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State argues that the Code and the statute constitute a narrowly drawn regulatory scheme covering an area of unprotected expression. We disagree and hold that the challenged sections of the Code and of the statute are repugnant to the right of freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment and are unconstitutional on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Roy Vanasco was the unsuccessful Republican party candidate for the New York State Assembly in the 57th Assembly District. His incumbent opponent filed a complaint with the Board in which he claimed that Vanasco had distributed palm cards using the phrase \u201cRepublican-Liberal\u201d when in fact Vanasco was only on the ballot as a candidate of the Republican party. The complaint also alleged that the palm cards implied that Vanasco currently held the position of Assemblyman.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing held on October 16, 1974<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board issued a decision in which it found that the use of the phrase \u201cRepublican-Liberal\u201d \u201cmisrepresented his [Vanasco\u2019s] party endorsement, since he was not the candidate of the Liberal Party\u201d (a violation of \u00a7 6201.1(f) of the Code). Concluding that the printing on the palm card \u201cdoes not clearly indicate that he [Vanasco] is currently an Assemblyman\u201d the Board refused to find that Vanasco had also violated \u00a7 6201.-1(d) of the Code. The Board then ordered Vanasco to surrender all campaign literature which contained the phrase \u201cRepublican-Liberal\u201d or to submit a plan for re-marking the literature. Vanasco complied with the Board\u2019s order by remarking his campaign literature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Joseph Ferris was the Democratic-Liberal candidate for an Assembly seat in the 51st Assembly District. Ferris was elected to office. His incumbent opponent, Vincent Riccio, complained to the Board that Ferris had misrepresented Riccio\u2019s voting record in a leaflet distributed by Ferris and by making certain remarks which had been quoted in a newspaper article. The leaflet claimed that Riccio voted himself a $17,000 salary increase; received his salary for less than 100 days work; opposed increased funds for recreation for the aging and opposed aid to community colleges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>hearing was held and a decision filed on November 4, 1974, one day before the election, wherein the Board found that Ferris had misrepresented Riccio\u2019s voting record (a violation of \u00a7 6201.1(e)) and had done so \u201cwith actual knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of its falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like Vanasco, Ferris was ordered to surrender his campaign literature or submit a plan for re-marking it. Ferris complied with the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">On October 29, 1974 Vanasco and Ferris filed suit against the Board in the Eastern District of New York<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in which they sought the convening of a three-judge court to declare the statute and the Code unconstitutional on their face and as applied to them, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against enforcement of the Code and the statute by the Board. An application for a temporary restraining order was filed and denied and the complaint and application for a three-judge court were dismissed by the district court on October 20, 1974. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied a motion for a stay pending appeal on November 4, 1974, but on the same day filed a decision reversing the order of the district court and ordered the convening of a three-judge court. <em>Vanasco v. Schwartz, </em>506 F.2d 524 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Plaintiff Robert Postel received a notice from the Board on October 25, 1974, informing him that his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Assemblyman in the 68th Assembly District, A. B. \u201cPete\u201d Grannis, had filed a complaint with the Board alleging violations of \u00a7 6201.1(d) and (f). Specifically, Grannis charged that certain Postel campaign literature misrepresented that Grannis had a \u201cpatronage job\u201d in the State Department of Environmental Conservation; received major financial support from Republican \u201cbig whigs\u201d such as Laurence Rockefeller and Henry Diamond ; that the New York Court of Appeals had directed a new election after having adduced proof that a number of Republicans had voted illegally in a Democratic primary; that a complaint against Grannis had been filed with the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights and that Grannis was a registered Republican in 1973.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Postel\u2019s hearing before the Board was started on October 25, 1974 and continued on October 26. By an interim order dated October 28, Postel was ordered to cease and desist the distribution of any and all literature containing any language, complained of in the proceeding before the Board. Before his hearing was continued, Postel filed suit in the Southern District of New York in which he asked for relief similar to that in Vanasco and Ferris\u2019 suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The District Court granted Postel\u2019s application for a temporary restraining order against further Code hearings by the Board. Subsequently, this three-judge court was convened and ordered to consider both the Postel and Vanasco and Ferris cases. At a pre-trial conference held on March 20, 1975 it was agreed that the Court would consider a facial attack on the constitutionality of the Code. All parties have now moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Before considering the specifically challenged sections of the Code and the statute, the fundamental question which must be answered is: To what extent may a state regulate the speech of those persons who are seeking public office? The plaintiffs argue that only those \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited\u201d classes of speech including the \u201clewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words\u2014 those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> fall outside the protection of the First Amendment. The asserted target of several of the Code sections\u2014the deliberate calculated falsehood\u2014would in plaintiffs\u2019 view be constitutionally protected speech. According to plaintiffs, the answer to false campaign speech does not lie in regulation by the state but rather in criticism and rebuttal in the \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d <em>See Whitney v. California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 375-77, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Far from enhancing the political process, regulation of campaign speech will in plaintiffs\u2019 words \u201cundermine its most powerful safeguard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">While recognizing that the First Amendment enjoys a \u201cpreferred position\u201d among those rights guaranteed by the Constitution, the Board contends that the statute and the Code prohibit only that expression which is unprotected by the First Amendment. Unprotected speech, the Board argues, would include those statements made \u201cwith \u2018actual malice\u2019\u2014that is, with knowledge that [they were] false or with reckless disregard of whether [they were] false or not.\u201d <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 726, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Whether the deliberate false statement is the basis of a civil defamation suit by a public official <em>(Times) </em>or a \u201cpublic figure\u201d <em>(Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967)) or of a criminal libel prosecution <em>(Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964)) or, as in these cases, regulation of campaign speech by the state, the Board argues that if the statement is made with \u201cactual malice\u201d then it does not enjoy constitutional protection. We agree with this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\"><em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964), in our view, answers plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the deliberate false statement is constitutionally protected speech when uttered during the course of a political campaign. There the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\u201cThat speech is used as a tool for political ends does not automatically bring it under the protective mantle of the Constitution. For the use of the known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of democratic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected. Calculated falsehood falls into that class of utterances which \u2018are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. . . .\u2019 <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572 [62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031], Hence the knowingly false statement and the false statement made with the reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection.\u201d 379 U. S. at 75, 85 S.Ct. at 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><em>See also, Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 339-40, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); Brennan, The Supreme Court and the Meiklejohn Interpretation of the First Amendment, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 18-19 (1965); Hastie, Free Speech: Contrasting Constitutional Concepts and Their Consequences, 9 Harv.Civ.Rights-Civ.Lib.L.Rev. 428, 447 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The decisions in <em>Times </em>and <em>Garrison </em>and other related cases <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> emphasize the necessity for statements concerning public issues to command a high degree of constitutional protection so that debate may be \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u201d It is that standard of protection and not the narrow area of unprotected speech which they define that constitutes the real significance of the <em>Times </em>line of cases. <em>See </em>Kalven, The New York Times Case: A Note on \u201cThe Central Meaning of the First Amendment,\u201d 1964 Sup.Ct.Rev. 191, 204-10. The <em>Times </em>standard of constitutional protection, in the words of Justice Powell, \u201cadministers an extremely powerful antidote to the inducement to media self-censorship of the common-law rule of strict liability for libel and slander.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 342, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3008, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">It is important to emphasize here a proposition with which the Board agrees, <em>i. e., </em>that any state regulation of campaign speech must be premised on proof and application of a <em>Times </em>\u201cactual malice\u201d standard. We are not dealing with defamation suits brought by \u201cprivate individuals\u201d where a standard somewhat less than that required by <em>Times </em>would be appropriate. <em>See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>at 339-48, 94 S.Ct. 2997.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the contrary, Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>proceedings concern regulation of the speech of \u201cpublic officers\u201d and \u201cpublic figures\u201d during campaigns for political office where the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech \u201chas its fullest and most urgent application.\u201d <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1970). With this proposition in mind, we can agree with the Board\u2019s argument that calculated falsehoods are of such slight social value that no matter what the context in which they are made, they are not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Our discussion of course has so far existed on a theoretical level. We now focus on the contours of New York\u2019s regulations. As we do, we bear in mind the necessity for legislators to use only the most \u201csensitive tools\u201d in separating legitimate from illegitimate speech, <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 525, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1957) so that First Amendment freedoms are given the necessary \u201cbreathing space\u201d they need to survive. <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-23\">By enacting a Fair Campaign Code, New York joined a growing list of states that now regulate campaign speech. See Developments in the Law\u2014 Elections, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 1111, 1272-1298 (1975).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Code is comprehensive and covers not only various forms of \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and \u201cunethical speech,\u201d but also certain practices of \u201cpolitical espionage\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(a)); \u201cacts intended to hinder or prevent any eligible person from registering to vote\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(h)); and use of public opinion polls (\u00a7 6201.2). There are detailed provisions relating to the filing of complaints and answers with the Board (\u00a7 6201.3(a)-(c)), and for the conducting of adversary hearings where a respondent may have counsel present, may cross-examine witnesses and may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the Board subpoena witnesses for him (\u00a7 6201.3(d)-(e)). The Board can impose a fine of up to $1,000 for each violation and/or issue a report setting forth its findings and determinations (\u00a7 6201.3(i)(2)-(3)). In addition, by \u00a7 472(c) of the Election Law, the Board is empowered to institute judicial proceedings to enforce its orders. With this broad legislative scheme in the background, we begin an analysis of those Code sections specifically challenged by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\n<em>Attacks on a candidate based on race, sex, religion, or ethnic background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">/\u00a7 <em>6201.1(c)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The Board admits that this section of the Code (as well as \u00a7 472(a) of the Election Law, which contains the same prohibition) was not intended to be, and is not, limited by a <em>Times </em>\u201cactual malice\u201d standard. It is a blanket prohibition against any attacks on a candidate\u2019s race, sex, religion or ethnic background. Justification for such a sweeping prohibition rests on the assumption that this Code section focuses only on attributes which are completely unrelated to any candidate\u2019s \u201cfitness for office.\u201d Such an assumption is an exercise in self-delusion. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[g]iven the realities of our political life, it is by no means easy to see what statements about a candidate might be altogether without relevance to his fitness for the office he seeks.\u201d <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 275, 91 S.Ct. 621, 627, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1970). Attempts to create a \u201cpublic sector\u201d\u2014\u201cprivate sector\u201d dichotomy were characterized as \u201csyllogistic manipulation [s]\u201d by the Court. 401 U.S. at 273, 91 S.Ct. 621. It would be a retreat from reality to hold that voters do not consider race, religion, sex or ethnic background when choosing political candidates. Speech is often provocative and indeed offensive, <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940); <em>Terminiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949); <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), but unless it falls into one of those \u201cwell defined and narrowly limited classes\u201d of unprotected speech (e. g., \u201cfighting words\u201d) it enjoys constitutional protection. New York\u2019s attempt to eliminate an entire segment of protected speech from the arena of public debate is clearly unconstitutional.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\n<em>Misrepresentations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Three sections of the Code specifically challenged by plaintiffs prohibit \u201cmisrepresentations of any candidate\u2019s qualifications\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(d)); \u201cmisrepresentation of any candidate's position\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(e)); and \u201cmisrepresentation of any candidate\u2019s party affiliation\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(f)). As to these sections the Board contends that the statute and the Code are narrowly drafted so that only the deliberate calculated falsehood\u2014unprotected speech\u2014is the subject of regulation. We disagree and hold that these sections of the Code and that part of \u00a7 472(a) of the Election Law have not been so carefully drawn or authoritatively construed so as to regulate only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>unprotected expression. These sections cast a substantial chill on the expression of protected speech and are unconstitutionally overbroad and vague on their face. <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972); <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>the Supreme Court refused to extend the protection of the <em>Times </em>\u201cactual malice\u201d standard to the publisher of an allegedly defamatory statement against a private citizen. In so doing, the Court did not engage in \u201cad hoc\u201d balancing of the \u201cneeds of the press and the individual\u2019s claim to compensation for wrongful injury.\u201d 418 U.S. at 343-44, 94 S.Ct. at 3009.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, the Court laid down \u201cbroad rules of general application [which] treat alike various cases involving differences as well as similarities.\u201d The Court concluded that the <em>New York Times </em>rule states an \u201caccommodation between this concern [of the press and broadcast media in immunity from liability] and the limited state interest present in the context of libel actions brought by public persons.\u201d <em>Id. See also Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. </em>Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The type of \u201cdefinitional balancing\u201d applied in <em>Gertz </em>and <em>Times </em>recognizes that not all defamatory^spegcti^is. .protected by the first amendment, <em>See </em>Nimmer, the Right to Speak from <em>Times </em>to <em>Time: </em>First Amendment Theory Applied to Libel and Misapplied to Privacy, 56 Calif.L.Rev. 935, 942-43 (1968). In essence, it is this type of \u201cdefinitional balancing\u201d which we have employed in Part II of this opinion when we concluded that the deliberate calculated falsehood does not enjoy constitutional protection even when made during the course of a political campaign and when it involves a proceeding by the Board rather than a civil defamation suit or criminal prosecution. Our conclusion then struck an \u201caccommodation\u201d between the legitimate interest of the state in protecting the electoral process and the \u201cslight social value\u201d associated with calculated falsehoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Facial overbreadth analysis involves a somewhat different approach than \u201cdefinitional balancing.\u201d Over-breadth review is based on a determination of whether the language of the statute in question or the construction it has been given is susceptible of application to protected expression. <em>Gooding, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 522, 92 S.Ct. 1103. <em>See generally, </em>Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 844 (1970). In effect, it is a doctrine which recognizes that despite any legitimate state interest involved, the chilling effect on protected expression is too high a price to pay when the regulatory scheme has not been narrowly drawn. Such a doctrine \u201cis, manifestly, strong medicine.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Okla</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>homa, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">When considering standing to raise an overbreadth challenge, there is \u201cno requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1121, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). Plaintiffs here have shown more than \u201callegations of a subjective chill.\u201d <em>Laird v. Tatum, </em>408 U.S. 1, 13, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972). Vanasco and Ferris have already been subject to adverse decisions by the Board and Postel\u2019s proceeding before the Board has been stayed pending this litigation. All three plaintiffs alleged that they will be candidates for office in future elections. We feel that plaintiffs have demonstrated claims of \u201cspecific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.\u201d <em>Laird v. Tatum, supra </em>at 13-14, 92 S.Ct. at 2326. <em>See also Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 U.S. 809, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Our approach is similar to that followed by the Court in analyzing the \u201cbreach of the peace statutes\u201d involved in <em>Gooding </em>and <em>Lewis. See also Weigand v. Seaver, </em>504 F.2d 303 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 924, 95 S.Ct. 1650, 44 L.Ed.2d 83 (1975). In those decisions the Court found that the very language of the statutes and the construction given them by the state courts produced a broader sweep than the constitutional definition of \u201cfighting words.\u201d The Code\u2019s misrepresentation sections, while not involving \u201cbreach of the peace statutes\u201d or \u201cfighting words,\u201d are similarly deficient. The Board argues that the Code sections are narrowly drawn to regulate only unprotected calculated falsehoods. Although the challenged sections only mention \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d \u00a7 472(a) of the Election Law describes \u201cdeliberate misrepresentations.\u201d Reading these two sections together, the Board contends that deliberate misrepresentation is the equivalent of <em>Times </em>\u201cactual malice\u201d and that any Board proceeding requires such a finding. We disagree with this argument. The sweeping nature of those sections is exemplified by their provisions. For example, \u201cmisrepresentation of any candidate\u2019s qualifications\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(d)) includes among its prohibitions the use of \u201cpersonal vilification\u201d and \u201cscurrilous attacks.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Like \u201cattacks based on race, sex, religion or ethnic background\u201d (\u00a7 6201.1(c)) such expression may be offensive but by that fact alone it does not lose its constitutional protection. <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 22-23, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). <em>See also Tollett v. United States, </em>485 F.2d 1087, 1093 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">That these Code sections are susceptible to application to protected speech could not be more clearly demonstrated than by the construction given to them by the Board in the <em>Vanasco </em>and <em>Ferris </em>cases. While as to Ferris, the Board found that the campaign literature was utilized \u201cwith actual knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of its falsity,\u201d as to Vanasco, the Board merely found that he had \u201cmisrepresented\u201d his party endorsement. There was no finding that the misrepresentation was deliberate or that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> No limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>construction has been applied to these sections and we cannot do so. <em>Gooding, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 520, 92 S.Ct. 1103; <em>United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">It is not hard to see then, given the often difficult task of trying to define, for example, what a political candidate\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d is on issues discussed during a campaign, that the term \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d could be applied to almost all campaign speech. The candidate who wishes to avoid the consequences of a Code proceeding\u2014including the adverse publicity such a proceeding would generate\u2014might very well be \u201cchilled\u201d from the expression of protected First Amendment speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Although our approach to overbreadth analysis of the Code has followed what we believe to be the holding of such decisions as <em>Gooding </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>we also recognize that the overbreadth doctrine has been subject to increasing criticism. <em>See Gooding, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 528-34, 92 S.Ct. 1103, (Burger, C. J., dissenting); <em>Lewis, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 136-42, 94 S.Ct. 970 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These dissenting Justices have expressed concern with the \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d \u201cmechanical,\u201d and \u201cinsensitive\u201d application of the doctrine by a majority of the Court. Despite this criticism, it is still conceded that the overbreadth doctrine performs a legitimate purpose when it \u201cinvalidates statutes because their language demonstrates their potential for <em>sweeping improper </em>applications posing a significant likelihood of deterring important First Amendment speech \u2014not because of some insubstantial or imagined potential for occasional and isolated applications that go beyond constitutional bounds.\u201d <em>Gooding, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 530-531, 92 S.Ct. at 1110 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Proper analysis then would involve consideration of \u201cthe nature of the speech in question, the possible effect the statute or ordinance has upon such speech, the importance of the speech in relation to the exposition of ideas, or the purported or asserted community interest in preventing that speech.\u201d <em>Lewis, supra </em>415 U.S. at 136-37, 94 S.Ct. at 974 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Strict overbreadth analysis does not involve any \u201cinterest balancing.\u201d <em>See, e. g., United States v. Robel, </em>389 U.S. 258, 268 n. 20, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967). <em>Gooding </em>and <em>Lewis </em>did not involve \u201cinterest balancing\u201d as such for once it was determined that the statutes were susceptible to application to protected speech they were classified as over-broad. While we follow (as we must) those decisions, we also conclude that the challenged Code sections are fatally overbroad even when measured against the criteria outlined by the dissenting Justices in <em>Gooding </em>and <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Initially, we note that the inhibitory \u201cchilling effect\u201d resulting from the overbreadth of the Code, applies to important First Amendment speech. Free debate on public issues is essential to the survival of the Republic. It hardly needs repeating that such speech should be \u201cuninhibited, robust and wide-open.\u201d The importance of such expression was outlined in <em>Mills v. Alabama, </em>384 U.S. 214, 218-19, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 1437, 16 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">\u201cWhatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs. This of course includes discussions of candidates, structures and forms of government, the manner in which government is operated or should be operated, and all such matters relating to political processes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aba\">In our view, the Code creates a \u201csubstantial chill\u201d and has a significant likelihood of deterring this important First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Amendment speech.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We cannot agree with the Board\u2019s contentions that any chill on protected expression is \u201cminor or purely speculative,\u201d and that the chill of unlimited liability for damages or imprisonment under the <em>Times </em>and <em>Garrison </em>decisions is \u201cmuch more significant than any chill that might result from the Code\u2019s existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In addition to the overbroad language in the Code and its demonstrated application to protected speech as discussed above, other factors emphasize the substantial chilling effect of the Code. Prior to its effective date (September 30, 1974) the Code was published in newspapers throughout the State of New York and distributed to all candidates for the Legislature and other State and National offices. Based on this distribution, it would be logical to assume that most, if not all, candidates for office in 1974 were aware of at least the existence\u2014and quite possibly the details\u2014of the Code. Also significant is the realistic assumption that any adverse finding by the Board (and indeed, the filing of a charge by an opponent) will be highly publicized by the respondent\u2019s opponent (both Vanasco and Ferris allege in their complaint that they received extensive adverse publicity as a result of the Board\u2019s decisions).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Upon consideration of these factors it is not difficult to see how a political candidate might be deterred from making protected statements when he must consider the consequences of a Board proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The substantial chill resulting from the factors outlined above is manifestly demonstrated by a final and critical factor\u2014the very nature of a Board proceeding. In our view, the result of the <em>Times </em>line of cases is the formulation of a rule\u2014the requirement of \u201cactual malice\u201d\u2014which is highly protective of speech. When applied in the defamation context it means that \u201cmany deserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>plaintiffs, including some intentionally-subjected to injury, will be unable to surmount the barrier of the <em>New York Times </em>test.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra </em>418 U.S. at 342, 94 S.Ct. at 3008. The high degree of protection afforded by the <em>Times </em>rule is underscored by the requirement that \u201cknowing falsity\u201d must be proven with \u201cconvincing clarity.\u201d <em>Times, supra 376 </em>U.S. at 285-86, 84 S.Ct. 710.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">A respondent in a proceeding before the Board receives no such protection. To begin with, the Code provides for an administrative as opposed to a judicial proceeding. Although authorized to file suit in the state courts for an injunction to enforce its decisions (N.Y. Election Law \u00a7\u00a7 472(c), 469) the Board is also empowered to impose a fine up to $1,000 for each violation and may issue a report setting forth its findings and determinations (\u00a7\u00a7 6201.3(i)(2)-(3)). No provision is made for a candidate who is either fined or the subject of a report to obtain judicial review of the Board\u2019s action.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, a finding of the Board need not be premised on what we view as a constitutional requirement of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof. On conclusion of a proceeding, the Code provides that a determination shall be \u201cbased on substantial evidence\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6201.3(i)(l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Judicial participation is particularly necessary when important First Amendment expression is involved. <em>Cf. Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965); <em>Southeastern Promotions Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975). <em>See </em>Monaghan, First Amendment \u201cDue Process,\u201d 83 Harv.L.Rev. 518, 519-24 (1970).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in a Code proceeding faces the possibility of final action\u2014which action could be taken within a few days of an election\u2014based on findings made not in a judicial proceeding, but rather in an administrative proceeding by a Board whose members are recommended by the legislative leaders and state chairmen of the two major political parties (Election Law \u00a7 468(a)) and where proof may be less than clear and convincing. We feel that, taken together, all the factors we have discussed demonstrate that the Code creates a substantial chill on the expression of important First Amendment expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Nothing in our decision downgrades the state\u2019s legitimate interest in insuring fair and honest elections. Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated falsehoods when used by political candidates can lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the electoral process. However, when the State through the guise of protecting the citizen\u2019s right to a fair and honest election tampers with what it will permit the citizen to see and hear even that important state interest must give way to the irresistible force of protected expression under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We conclude that sections 6201.1(c), (d), (e), (f) of the New York Fair Campaign Code and section 472(a) of the New York Election Law are unconstitutional on their face. We do not reach the other arguments raised by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Summary judgment granted for all plantiffs, denied for all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Section 472 of the New York Election Law (McKinney Supp.1974) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">\u00a7 472.

The Court\u2019s reasoning in upholding the Oklahoma statute in <em>Broadriok </em>was as follows: \u201c[T]he plain import of our cases is, at the very-least, that facial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and that its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behaviour that it forbids the State to sanction moves from \u2018pure speech\u2019 towards conduct and that conduct\u2014even if expressive\u2014falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect\u2014at best a prediction\u2014cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe.

Superior Court of Los Angeles County, </em>13 Cal.3d 652, 119 Cal.Rptr. 468, 532 P.2d 116 (1975) (injunction against the publication of allegedly misleading and libelous statements made by a candidate for political office about his opponent found to be an unconstitutional prior restraint). Since we hold the statute and the Code unconstitutional on other grounds we do not consider whether the Board proceedings constitute an unconstitutional system of prior restraints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-15\">.
