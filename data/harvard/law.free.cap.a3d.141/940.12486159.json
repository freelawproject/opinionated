On appeal, the defendant raises two separate claims. First, he claims that \"the unauthorized ex parte excusal of a juror by an unidentified person without notice and a hearing violated [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-82h (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and various state and federal constitutional rights, including the right to be present during jury selection to ensure an impartial jury of one's peers, and the right to a public trial.\" (Footnote added.) In his second claim, he alleges that \"the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to rule on the motion in limine and in denying a mistrial after [a] witness testified, just as defense counsel had anticipated, that the defendant went to jail for robbery.\" We disagree with both claims, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In late October, 2009, the defendant asked the victim, Denny Alcantara, to give him some marijuana without payment up front. The victim refused the defendant's request. As a result of the victim refusing his request for marijuana on credit, the defendant told his friend Shari Johnson that he planned to set up a\n   marijuana transaction with the victim so that he could rob the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the defendant set in motion his plan to rob the victim. Specifically, on November 4,\n   2009, the defendant arranged for the victim to meet him and two of his friends, Darryl Bonds and Joshua McNeil, at 62 Stillwater Avenue in Stamford, the home of Anthony Lacrete. The victim arrived at the designated location, retrieved six bags of marijuana that he had stored at Lacrete's apartment, and waited for the defendant on the front porch. Meanwhile, Ivania Collazo, Bonds' cousin, gave the defendant, Bonds, and McNeil a ride to a parking lot on Stillwater Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While the victim waited on the porch for the defendant, Richard Patterson, a mutual acquaintance of the defendant and the victim, walked by. Patterson stopped and spoke briefly with the victim. After they conversed, Patterson continued walking down the block, and he encountered the defendant and his friends. Patterson told them that the victim was awaiting them. Patterson then telephoned the victim to tell him that the defendant was on his way to meet him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On arriving at the meeting point, the defendant and at least one of his friends took from the victim the marijuana, some cash, his cell phone, and the leather jacket and gold chain he was wearing. In the process, the victim was shot twice in the abdomen. The victim died shortly thereafter. Cell phone call details and cell tower location data placed the defendant at the scene during the foregoing events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant, Bonds, and McNeil returned to Collazo's car, which she drove away from the area. In the car, as they discussed the events that had just unfolded, Bonds said that the victim had marijuana and a cell phone, and the defendant said that the victim had a black leather jacket, a gold chain, and some money. The defendant was wearing the victim's leather jacket. At a nearby store, McNeil left the car and Elvis Battista, Collazo's brother, got in. The defendant told Battista that he had robbed the victim, specifying that he had\n   taken the leather jacket, the gold chain, the marijuana, and some cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   En route to Collazo's apartment in Bridgeport, Bonds received a call on the victim's cell phone, which he answered before throwing the phone out of the window. The defendant and Bonds spent the night at Collazo's apartment, smoking the victim's marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a trial, on January 18, 2013, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all of the charges. Thereafter, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty years imprisonment and ten years special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant claims that \"the unauthorized ex parte excusal of a juror by an unidentified person without notice and a hearing violated ... \u00a7 54-82h (c) and various state and federal constitutional rights, including the right to be present during jury selection to ensure an impartial jury of one's peers, and the right to a public trial.\" Specifically, he contends that a \"reversal [of his conviction] is required since an unidentified person, not the court, excused the juror, and the court did not make a reliable, independent determination that the juror could not perform her duty, as required by statute; the defendant was deprived of his right to be present, his right to individual voir dire, his right to be heard by himself and by counsel, his right to due process of law, and his\n   right to a public trial; and the harm from the statutory and constitutional violations must be presumed.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following procedural history pertains to this claim. Jury selection in the defendant's trial occurred over five days between November 28, 2012, and December 11, 2012. The parties selected a total of twelve\n   regular and four alternate jurors. In the course of selecting jurors, on December 4, 2012, venireperson E.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was selected as the seventh regular juror, and venireperson L.C. was selected as the twelfth regular juror. By the conclusion of jury selection, the defendant had not exhausted all of his allotted peremptory challenges: he had exercised thirteen of his allotment of sixteen peremptory challenges and had three remaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Trial was set to begin on the morning of January 7, 2013, at approximately 10 a.m. As of 10:41 a.m. on that date, however, three regular jurors, including L.C., and one alternate juror had not yet reported to the courthouse. The court noted, in addition, that L.C. had reported previously that he knew someone in the case. The court stated that it therefore was going to bring him in for voir dire when he arrived. The court then asked the clerk to telephone the missing jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Then, at approximately 11:29 a.m., the court stated: \"The clerk has informed me that [E.A.] was released downstairs in the jury assembly room. She claimed that she has the flu and could not remain. And she is not in the building. I don't know who told her she could leave. Nobody informed the court. So, the parties didn't get a chance to voir dire her.... [E.A.] was released, and [L.C.] is the one who claims he knows somebody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defense counsel immediately stated: \"Your honor ... I'm requesting that the court have the clerk call [E.A.] back. We went through careful voir dire of [E.A.].... She indicated that she was fully aware of this process [and] wanted to serve. She's an African-American lady and, while my client, under the guise of a jury of his peers, that doesn't mean people that are African-American like he is or his same age, but I think the panel benefits from a cross [section] of people. [E.A.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   was an African-American lady, sixty-five years old, and seemed to be very well open to serving. And typically, as in the case of\n   <em>\n    State v. Apodaca\n   </em>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174259\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/378/\">\n    303 Conn. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20A.3d%20224\">\n    33 A.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ] ... if a jury member has an issue, it was incumbent upon us to bring that person into the courtroom, as I'm sure Your Honor probably adopts that theory, voir dire the person ... and make a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"I don't know who in the building just let this person go. It doesn't sound like it's above board. And, just to make sure we're beyond reproach and nothing is questionable, I think the court-I'm asking the court to have the clerk call that person back so we can at least have that person brought into the courtroom. Because as we stand here, no one, not even Your Honor, knows who let her go and why.... There was some representation that she might have had a cold. That's all we have so far. So, now we have a panel member that's just let go, and we ask that she be brought back.\" Following defense counsel's argument, the court asked the prosecutor if he had anything to say, and he responded: \"No, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Then, the court brought in L.C. for voir dire, and, following questioning, the prosecutor indicated that he would like the juror released from duty, while defense counsel\n   stated that he would like the juror to remain seated. The court ultimately determined that L.C. should be released, and that it would pick an alternate juror to replace him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court then took up the matter of E.A., stating the following: \"And let me just deal with the issue of [E.A.] while we're at it. Again, I didn't give permission for that juror to be released. I'm not sure who did give permission. I take it, it was our jury clerk, and I'm told that the juror represented that she had the flu and was unable to serve. And I'm not going to delay the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We have jurors waiting. We have witnesses. We're ready to proceed. So, we're going to use the statutory procedure for choosing two of the alternates who will be seated as regular jurors. I'm going to give them my preliminary instructions, and we're going to proceed with the trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   L.C. was brought back into the courtroom and released from service. Two alternate jurors were then chosen by the clerk by lot to be sworn in as regular members of the jury. The court asked defense counsel if he had anything else, to which he responded: \"Nothing, nothing.\" The court then swore in the jury panel, after which trial commenced at approximately 11:45 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We first address the defendant's argument that the court violated \u00a7 54-82h (c). \"Our standard of review for a trial court's decision to excuse a juror is well established. Section 54-82h (c) permits trial courts to excuse a juror [i]f, at any time, any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to further perform [his or her] duty.... The power to excuse a juror under this section is expressly premised on a finding of cause....

That misapprehension centers on precisely when E.A. was excused from her jury service for purposes of \u00a7 54-82h (c). The defendant argues that E.A. was improperly excused from her jury service when the \"unauthorized\" person permitted her to leave the courthouse. In light of the record, it is our view that, for purposes of \u00a7 54-82h (c), E.A. was not excused from her jury service at that point, but rather she was excused from jury service after the court heard from counsel and decided to replace her with an alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We acknowledge that it was not the trial judge who initially permitted E.A. to leave the courthouse. It was, however, the trial judge who ultimately made the decision to excuse her from her jury service. Indeed, after learning from the jury clerk that E.A. had been told she could leave the court, the trial judge sought input from the parties regarding how it should proceed. The defendant argued for the court to bring E.A. back. The court certainly could have opted to do so. Given her reported illness and the time that already\n   had been lost that morning, however, the court opted instead to excuse her and then selected an alternate as required by \u00a7 54-82h (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Therefore, although the court specifically noted, with respect to E.A. initially being permitted to leave the courthouse, that \"I didn't give permission for that juror to be released,\" the court did not simply select an alternate without giving the parties an opportunity to be heard. After giving the parties that opportunity, the court appears to have credited the report from the clerk that E.A. had told someone that she was too ill to remain. The court then effectively excused E.A. when it announced its intent \"to use the statutory procedure for choosing two of the alternates who will be seated\n   as regular jurors.\" Accordingly, E.A. was excused from her service as a juror when the court did so after receiving input from the parties. With the point of E.A.'s excusal clarified, we now turn to the defendant's statutory claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the defendant's statutory claim is not entirely clear and seems to be inextricably intertwined with his constitutional claims, he appears to be claiming that the court violated \u00a7 54-82h (c) in the following ways. First, he argues, the court did not make a reliable, independent determination that E.A. could not perform her duty because an unidentified person, not the court, excused E.A. Second, he appears to argue that the statute requires the court to give the defendant notice and hold a hearing to be able to make an informed decision regarding a juror's ability to serve before it may excuse the juror. In essence, he appears to be claiming that the court failed to exercise its discretion altogether because the unidentified person, rather than the court, actually excused E.A. Third, he argues that the statute was violated because he was not permitted an opportunity to ask questions of E.A. or assess the credibility of the person who excused her. We reject each of these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the defendant's first argument in support of his statutory claim, that the court did not determine independently that there was cause to excuse E.A., it fails because, as we already have explained, it was in fact the court, not an unidentified person, who excused E.A. from jury service. The court accepted the representation that E.A. was ill. As we have noted, illness is good cause to excuse a juror.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20564\">\n    315 Conn. at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20453\">\n    109 A.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, as to the defendant's contention that E.A. was excused without notice and a hearing, this too fails. The record clearly demonstrates that after learning from a\n   member of the courthouse staff that E.A. reportedly was suffering from the flu, the court held a discussion on the record before deciding to replace her. Thus, after announcing what it had learned from the clerk, the court gave the parties an opportunity to be heard on the matter. Defense counsel took that opportunity to place on the record numerous objections to excusing E.A. After hearing these objections, the court decided to excuse E.A. and replace her with an alternate. The court further explained that the trial already had been delayed that morning, that witnesses were waiting, and that it did not want to delay the start of trial any further. Therefore, given the information that E.A. was ill and having received input from both parties, the court properly exercised its discretion in deciding not to delay the trial and to replace E.A. with an alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, to the extent that the defendant argues that he was entitled personally or through counsel to assess the credibility of E.A.'s excuse, neither \u00a7 54-82h (c) nor the cases that have construed it require an opportunity for the parties to question a\n   juror before the court may excuse her. See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20453\">\n    id., at 582-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20453\">\n    109 A.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court's excusal and replacement of juror who reported to court clerk by telephone that she would be unavailable that day because of medical condition was not abuse of discretion). Therefore, on the basis of the plain language of the statute and\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court further reasoned that a delay could result in the loss of other jurors because the trial already had exceeded the estimated time frame that had been given to the jury and protracted testimony still lay ahead.

Neither the trial court nor the parties in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   personally questioned the juror regarding her symptoms. After soliciting additional information through the caseflow coordinator, the trial court based its decision to excuse the juror on the potential delay that would arise from the uncertain time of her return as well as the possibility that, when she did return, she might be contagious. Although the court in this case did not follow up with\n   E.A. to obtain more specific information regarding her reported illness, it, like the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca,\n   </em>\n   based its decision to excuse E.A. on proper considerations of efficiency and the other jurors' and witness' time. Neither the clear language of \u00a7 54-82h (c) nor\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   required more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we do not conclude that the court abused its discretion by crediting the report of E.A.'s illness, deciding that it was not going to delay any further the start of the trial in order to bring her back to the courthouse, and determining accordingly that there was cause to excuse her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even if we were to conclude that the court abused its discretion when it excused E.A. and replaced her with an alternate juror, the defendant has not shown that he was harmed as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant argues that harm should be presumed.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As we previously have discussed, the factual premise of a secret proceeding on which the defendant's argument rests is incorrect. In particular, although an unnamed individual dismissed E.A. from the jury assembly room, E.A. was not excused from jury service until the court subsequently determined that it would follow the applicable statutory procedure for choosing an alternate to replace her. The court did not make this determination in secret; it decided to replace E.A. on the record, after notifying counsel that E.A. reportedly was ill and providing counsel with the opportunity to present argument. The court then followed the proper\n   procedure for choosing an alternate by lot. As a result, the nonbinding cases on which the defendant relies are factually distinguishable.

The defendant filed a motion in limine in which he sought an order prohibiting the state from introducing evidence of his 2007 arrest and robbery charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 7, 2013, the court held a hearing on the motion. At the hearing, it was undisputed that the defendant had been convicted of the 2007 robbery charge. The state represented that it did not intend to introduce any evidence of the defendant's robbery conviction during its case-in-chief. The court then stated that it would \"hold this motion in abeyance until such time as the defense puts on a case and you decide to put [the defendant] on the stand or somebody else. And it will be relevant at that moment since the state just told me\n   it's not going to put on evidence of ... his prior robbery conviction in its case-in-chief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defense counsel expressed concern that certain witnesses who had talked about the defendant's prior bad acts at the defendant's hearing on probable cause would do\n   so again at his trial. The court replied, \"[i]f somebody says something objectionable, object and I'll hear your objection. I don't know what the witnesses are going to say. I'm not even sure who all the witnesses are going to be. I'm not going to anticipate something. I'm going to wait until it happens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nevertheless, defense counsel then asked the court to instruct the state to direct Johnson, one of the aforementioned witnesses at the probable cause hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   not to mention the defendant's robbery conviction in her trial testimony. The court declined this invitation, concluding the matter by stating that \"the state's attorney just told me he wasn't going to ask or raise issues about [the defendant's] robbery conviction in the case-in-chief. If somebody says something objectionable, object.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At the defendant's trial, Johnson testified during the state's case-in-chief. Twice during her testimony, Johnson referred to the defendant's prior robbery conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the first instance, which occurred on direct\n   examination, the defendant objected, and the court excused the jury. Defense counsel then made an oral motion for a mistrial, which the court denied. The court solicited from defense counsel a suggestion for a curative instruction to the jury, indicating that in the absence of a suggestion it would \"tell the jury [to] ignore the last statement that was made,\" and would order the statement stricken from the record. Defense counsel declined to suggest a curative instruction. When the jury returned to the courtroom, the court directed the jurors to ignore Johnson's mention of the defendant's robbery conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thereafter, during a recess, defense counsel obtained the court's permission to reduce the motion for a mistrial to writing and submit it. The court then explained the basis for its prior denial of the oral motion for a mistrial-namely, the lack of detail that Johnson had provided regarding the defendant's prior conviction. The court also noted that, in the absence of a suggested curative instruction from the defendant, the court \"thought it was better not to mention the statement itself because all that would do is highlight it. And I struck it from the record....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although after Johnson first mentioned the defendant's prior conviction the court twice instructed her not to volunteer any information beyond the call of counsel's\n   questions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court's instructions proved\n   ineffective. During the state's redirect examination, Johnson unresponsively referred to the defendant having been released from jail. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Immediately thereafter, the court said \"I'm going to order that last comment stricken. Ignore it. Let's proceed.\" Defense counsel then made a second oral motion for a mistrial, which the court denied. In its final instructions to the jury, the court directed jurors not to consider evidence that had been stricken from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Our review of a trial court's ruling on a motion in limine is limited to determining whether the court properly exercised its discretion. \"It is axiomatic that [t]he trial court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference....

The court characterized its action as holding the motion in abeyance. We conclude that the court reserved decision on the motion with regard to the defendant's request\n   to preclude the state from offering evidence regarding the prior robbery conviction\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   when it accepted the state's representation that it was not going to offer any such evidence in its case-in-chief, ruling that the defendant would have to wait until\n   \"somebody says something objectionable\" and then object. We further conclude that the court's reservation of decision on the motion was a proper exercise of its discretion. See Practice Book \u00a7 42-15 (court may reserve decision on motion in limine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The defendant argues that the foreseeability both of the state calling Johnson as a witness and of Johnson's mentioning the defendant's prior conviction, in light of her divulgence of the same at the probable cause hearing, indicates that the court abused its discretion. Put differently, he argues that the court vitiated the very purpose of a good faith motion in limine, which is to exclude\n   <em>\n    anticipated\n   </em>\n   evidence. For several reasons, we disagree with the defendant that Johnson's disclosures were so foreseeable that the court's failure to order that she be warned against making them\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   was arbitrary or unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the hearing on the defendant's motion in limine, the state represented that it did not intend to offer evidence of the defendant's prior conviction during its case-in-chief. Additionally, the mere fact that Johnson would testify did not require the court to anticipate that she would divulge the defendant's criminal history; as\n   the court noted, in each instance Johnson's disclosure was wholly unresponsive to the prosecutor's line of questioning. Finally, we cannot say, in this case, that an order to the prosecutor to warn Johnson against making these disclosures would have been successful. As the record reveals, the court's two warnings to Johnson following the first disclosure proved ineffective: shortly thereafter, she again mentioned that the defendant previously had been in jail. For these reasons, we cannot say that the court's election to reserve decision on the defendant's motion in limine was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claim that the court abused its discretion by denying his motions for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Again, the defendant argues that the court could have avoided the harm to the defendant flowing from Johnson's reference to the defendant's robbery conviction because it was foreseeable. Specifically, he argues that the court and the state had ample time to warn Johnson in advance not to refer to the conviction in her trial testimony as she had done at the probable cause hearing. The defendant also argues that he suffered prejudice because the jury readily could infer that he had gone to jail for robbery in the recent past: Contrary to the court's characterization of Johnson's testimony as lacking in detail, the prejudice to the defendant was not minimized by the jury not knowing the degree of the charged robbery, when it occurred, when the defendant went to jail for it, and how much jail time he received. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As we already have noted, the giving of a curative instruction, such as the court gave here, carries great weight in our determination of whether the court's denial of a motion for mistrial was an abuse of discretion. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20783\">\n    163 Conn.App. at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20741\">\n    134 A.3d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, after both of Johnson's unresponsive disclosures that the defendant had been convicted of robbery and\n   had previously been in jail, the court promptly gave the jury a curative instruction directing jurors to ignore each statement and informing them that each statement would be stricken from the record. Additionally, in its final instructions, the court instructed the jurors that they were not to consider as evidence any testimony that had been stricken from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"It is well established that, [i]n the absence of an indication to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed [the trial court's] curative instructions....

Indeed, each curative instruction that the court gave was carefully calculated to mitigate any prejudice. As the court told defense\n   counsel, it had opted generally to direct jurors to ignore Johnson's foregoing statement rather than possibly to highlight the statement by specifically mentioning it. Although invited to suggest the language in which the court should have couched the curative instruction, \"[t]he defendant ... neither submitted a request to charge nor took exception to the court's charge on this point. He cannot now be heard to complain that the trial court failed to cure any prejudice caused by [the offending] remark.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state presented ample evidence on the basis of which the jury reasonably could\n   have found that the defendant committed these crimes. The robbery of the victim took place in the same manner in which the defendant had told Johnson he planned to carry it out. The testimony of numerous witnesses, corroborated by cell phone evidence, placed the defendant at the scene during the events in question. Afterward, the defendant was wearing the victim's leather jacket and boasting of having taken the victim's marijuana, cash, gold chain, and cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In sum, on the record before us, it does not appear that an injustice has been done.

The state argues that the court was entitled to disregard the motion because it did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7 42-15, which states that a motion in limine \"shall be in writing....\" Nevertheless, the state neither objected to the defendant's request on this ground nor argues before this court that it was deprived of notice or otherwise prejudiced by the oral motion.
