Spangler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    410 Md. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    976 A.2d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"\n   <em>\n    McQuitty I\n   </em>\n   \"), and\n   <em>\n    McQuitty v.

Code (2006, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 through 3-904 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\"); specifically, \u00a7 3-901(e), precludes beneficiaries from maintaining a wrongful death action when the decedent obtained a personal injury judgment predicated on the same underlying facts during his lifetime. We also focus on whether a decedent's release of one joint tort-feasor in a personal injury action for any and all future claims in connection with the tortious conduct, also precludes the decedent's beneficiaries from pursuing a wrongful death action against all joint tort-feasors based on the same underlying facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons expressed below, we hold that Maryland's wrongful death statute creates a new and independent cause of action for a decedent's beneficiaries, and thus, a judgment on the merits in a decedent's personal injury action during his or her lifetime does not bar a subsequent wrongful death action by the beneficiaries. Additionally, we hold that pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404, a release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides. Thus, where the language of a release unambiguously reveals an intent to release only one joint tort-feasor, the release does not preclude a subsequent wrongful death action against other tort-feasors that were not parties to the release. We explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Prior Proceedings\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents, Peggy and Gary McQuitty (\"the McQuittys\"), on behalf of their minor child, Dylan, successfully sued Ms. McQuitty's obstetrician and primary care physician, Donald Spangler (\"Dr. Spangler\"), along with his practice group, Glowacki, Elberfeld &amp; Spangler, P.A. (collectively \"Petitioners\"), for failing to secure Ms. McQuitty's informed consent\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for treatment. As a result, Ms. McQuitty suffered complete placental abruption, causing severe injuries to Dylan during his birth in May of 1995, and eventually, a severe condition of cerebral palsy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The original complaint also included co-defendants, Franklin Square Hospital, where Dylan was born, and Dr. Spangler's\n   partner, Harrold Elberfeld (\"Dr. Elberfeld\"). Dr. Elberfeld and Franklin Square Hospital moved for summary judgment on liability and damages, which was subsequently granted by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in March of 2004-on the same date Dr. Elberfeld settled with the McQuittys. Franklin Square Hospital also settled with the McQuittys prior to trial, notwithstanding the summary judgment ruling in its favor. The settlements were entered on the record and the case proceeded on the informed consent claim against Petitioners as sole defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to trial, Petitioners moved for summary judgment. Dr. Spangler alleged that he did not have a duty to obtain the informed consent of Ms. McQuitty regarding a placental abruption, \"because he did not conduct or propose an 'affirmative invasion of her physical integrity.' \"\n   <em>\n    McQuitty II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705220\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/527/\">\n    424 Md. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705220\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/527/\">\n    36 A.3d at 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McQuitty I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    410 Md. at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    976 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1027-28 ). The motion was denied, and the trial ensued. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dylan and awarded $13,078,515 in damages, including $8,442,515 in future medical expenses. Petitioners filed a Motion for Remittitur and a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (\"JNOV\"), raising the same argument in support of their motion for summary judgment. The circuit court granted Petitioners' motion for JNOV, which was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unpublished opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McQuitty I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    410 Md. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684875\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/410/1/\">\n    976 A.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court reversed the grant of the JNOV, and remanded with instructions that the circuit court consider Petitioners' unresolved Motion for Remittitur. On September 26, 2009, prior to the resolution of the remittitur, Dylan died and the McQuittys were named as personal representatives of the Estate. Thereafter, Petitioners filed various post-trial motions, seeking a new trial or a reduction in the award for future medical expenses, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that Dylan's death was a \"significant event\" that affected the equities of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court denied Petitioners' motion to revise the judgment, but denied in part and granted in part Petitioners' Motion for Remittitur. As a result, the court reduced the initial jury award, pursuant to the statutory cap on non-economic damages of $500,000 under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11-108(b)(2)(i), and also reduced the judgment by fifty percent to reflect Dr. Elberfeld's\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of liability, as a result of the joint tort-feasor release from the McQuittys, in compliance with the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act, under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court also denied Petitioners' requests to permit the periodic payment of future economic damages under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11-109(c), which would have reduced the jury's award by the Franklin Square Hospital's settlement amount. The court ultimately reduced the judgment to $5,039,257.50, plus post-judgment interest calculated from the date of the entry of judgment, on September 27, 2006, plus costs. Petitioners subsequently filed a renewed motion for a new trial and a motion to alter, amend, or revise the judgment, which were both denied. Thereafter, Petitioners noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari,\n   </em>\n   prior to that proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    McQuitty II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705220\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/527/\">\n    424 Md. at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705220\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/527/\">\n    36 A.3d at 929-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we affirmed the circuit court's judgment. Subsequently, on March 23, 2012, Petitioners satisfied the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Respondents' Wrongful Death Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 17, 2012, Respondents filed a wrongful death action against Petitioners, under the Maryland wrongful death statute, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   to\n   recover damages based upon the same underlying facts in the personal injury action regarding Dr. Spangler's failure to obtain informed consent. On August 1, 2012, Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss Respondents' action. Following a December 6, 2012 hearing, the motion was granted. The circuit court concluded that Respondents' wrongful death action was precluded by the judgment in Dylan's favor \"because Dylan no longer had a right to bring another claim against [ ] [Petitioners] at the time of his death.\" Subsequently, on January 4, 2013, Respondents appealed the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While the matter was pending before the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mummert v.

Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e). In\n   <em>\n    Mummert,\n   </em>\n   the decedent's husband and three children brought a wrongful death action against the decedent's physician, based on a failure to timely diagnose the decedent's colorectal cancer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    at 210-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    77 A.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The physician filed a motion to dismiss the wrongful death action because the statutory three-year period in the wrongful death statute had expired relative to the decedent's personal injury action prior to her death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The motion was subsequently granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    77 A.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly, the narrow question before this Court in\n   <em>\n    Mummert\n   </em>\n   was whether the decedent's failure to file a personal injury claim in her lifetime within the limitations period, precluded her wrongful death beneficiaries from filing a wrongful death action based upon the same negligent act after her death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    77 A.3d at 1051-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reversing the circuit court's dismissal of the action, we held that, in enacting the wrongful death statute, the General Assembly \"did not intend to define 'wrongful act' so as to render a wrongful death claim contingent on the decedent's ability to file timely a tort claim prior to death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    77 A.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We noted that the defenses which generally bar subsequent actions, such as contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, parental immunity, and lack of privity of contract, were distinguishable from the statute of limitations at issue, because where the former defenses applied, \"the decedent did not have a viable claim from the\n   <em>\n    outset.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725863\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/207/\">\n    77 A.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The only defense vis-a-vis the decedent's claim that\n   <em>\n    Mummert\n   </em>\n   expressly removed from the arsenal of the wrongful death defendant is the expiration of the limitations period in the decedent's personal injury claim.

In answering that question, we are unpersuaded by [Petitioners] analogy of a pre-existing judgment in favor of Dylan to the defenses upheld in\n   <em>\n    Mummert,\n   </em>\n   and conclude instead that the rationale expressed by the Court of Appeals in that\n   case supports a holding in favor of [Respondents].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    McQuitty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205822059\">\n    2015 WL 5822059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On that premise, the Court also concluded that a successful judgment in favor of a decedent in a personal injury action was distinguishable from the defenses recognized in\n   <em>\n    Mummert,\n   </em>\n   as barring a subsequent wrongful death action. The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A judgment in Dylan's favor on his personal injury claim is not a bar to that claim-it is the ultimate validation of the claim. The preclusive effect of such judgment flows from the principles of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   Here,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   does not bar [Respondents'] wrongful death action, because\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   only applies to actions between the same plaintiffs and defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8.

The Court opined that the potential for overlapping damages should not \"absolutely bar\" subsequent wrongful death actions, because any overlap could be resolved on a case-by-case, damages-by-damages basis in the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The Court, nonetheless, concluded that the risks associated with a double recovery did not exist in the case at bar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Although Dylan recovered damages for the loss of future earnings, [Respondents] cannot recover damages for those earnings in a wrongful death action, because '[p]arents may recover a pecuniary value for the loss of an employed deceased minor child's future earnings, at least to the date the deceased would have become an adult, had he/she lived.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10 (citations omitted).

Proc. \u00a7 3-902(a). \"Wrongful act\" is defined as \"an act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\" Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e). The primary beneficiaries of a wrongful death action are the spouse, parent, and child of the decedent. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(a)(1). However, relatives by blood or marriage who substantially relied upon the decedent, are also eligible claimants. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(b). Where the decedent is a spouse, minor child, parent of a minor child, or an unmarried child that is not a minor, the wrongful death statute provides damages for \"pecuniary losses,\" if any, in addition to damages for \"mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education where applicable....\" Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c) -(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Maryland's wrongful death statute creates a new and independent cause of action for a decedent's beneficiaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The determinative issue in the case at bar is whether, under the definition of \"wrongful act\" in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), a wrongful death action is derivative, or independent of, a decedent's prior personal injury claim, where the decedent obtained a judgment based on the same underlying facts. Thus, a resolution requires this Court to revisit the interpretation of the language contained in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   'Wrongful act' means an act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Petitioners argue that Respondents' wrongful death action is derivative of Dylan's personal injury action and therefore, barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata,\n   </em>\n   since Dylan would not be entitled to a double recovery if death had not ensued. Conversely, Respondents allege that their wrongful death action is a new and independent cause of action, only subject to the condition that Dylan possessed a viable claim at the outset, and therefore, not subject to a\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We hold that the Maryland wrongful death statute provides a new and independent cause of action, which does not preclude a subsequent action brought by a decedent's beneficiaries, although the decedent obtained a personal injury judgment based essentially on the same underlying facts during his or her lifetime. The parties' arguments focus primarily on the definition of \"wrongful act,\" specifically the phrase, \"if death had not ensued.\" To discern the meaning of this phrase, we apply the long-standing canons of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \" 'The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the [General Assembly].' \"\n   <em>\n    Rosemann v.

The injury for which the equitable plaintiffs are compensated is the pecuniary loss sustained by reason of the death of the person through the wrongful act, neglect, or default of the defendant. The statute, therefore, properly speaking, was not passed, as is sometimes said of it, to remove the operation of the common-law maxim, 'Actio personalis moritur cum persona,' as it has not undertaken to keep alive an action which would otherwise die with the person, but, on the contrary, has created a new cause of action for something for which the deceased person never had, and never could have had, the right to sue; that is to say, the injury resulting from his death.'

Although the wrongful death action at issue hinged upon the decedent's exculpatory release prior to his death, in emphasizing the remedial nature of the statute, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [T]he Wrongful Death Act is remedial legislation and must be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose of creating a right of recovery for the economic loss caused by the death of a family member. The class of litigants in a wrongful death case often includes minor children, dependent upon the decedent for economic support....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   The emphasized language limiting the right to bring a wrongful death claim only in situations in which the decedent, had he or she lived, would have been entitled to bring an action for damages, pertains only to the character of the injury, and is not intended as a procedural or jurisdictional requirement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A wrongful death action can only be brought for the benefit of decedent's heirs.\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2A:31-4. The action is commenced by either an administrator ad prosequendum of the decedent or an executor, if the decedent dies testate.\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2A:31-2. As a matter of law, a wrongful death action does not accrue to the decedent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, although actions brought under the Survivor Act and the Wrongful Death Act arise from the death of the decedent, 'they serve different purposes and are designed to provide a remedy to different parties.' Wrongful death damages are intended to compensate the statutorily recognized class of claimants for the pecuniary losses caused by the death of the decedent as a result of the tortious conduct of others....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (case citations omitted). The Supreme Court of Ohio in Thompson, adhered to a similar line of reasoning. In holding that the decedent's recovery in a personal injury action did not bar a subsequent wrongful death action by his beneficiaries, the court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Because a wrongful death action is an independent cause of action, the right to bring the action cannot depend on the existence of a separate cause of action held by the injured person immediately before his or her death. To conclude otherwise would convert the wrongful death action from an independent cause of action to a derivative action, one dependent on a separate cause of action. Moreover, the wrongful death action does not even arise until the death of the injured person. It follows, therefore, that the injured person cannot defeat the beneficiaries' right to have a wrongful death action brought on their behalf because the action has not yet arisen during the injured person's lifetime. Injured persons may release their own claims; they cannot, however, release claims that are not yet in existence and that accrue in favor of persons other than themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=637%20N.E.2d%20917\">\n    637 N.E.2d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We agree with the\n   <em>\n    Gershon\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning that the phrase \"if death had not ensued\" pertains only to the character of the injury, and was not intended to be a procedural or jurisdictional prerequisite to a subsequent wrongful death action. A contrary interpretation would effectively negate the statute's purpose to compensate eligible beneficiaries for the pecuniary, and related losses, caused by the death of the decedent resulting from the tortious conduct of others. Additionally, as observed in\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   because a wrongful death action is operative only\n   after the injured party's death for the benefit of the surviving beneficiaries, it is unreasonable to read the statutory language as allowing a decedent's personal injury action to essentially \"defeat\" the beneficiaries' right to pursue a wrongful death action on their behalf, when the right to claim has not been triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   It is difficult to reconcile Petitioners' interpretation of \u00a7 3-901(e). In our view, the General Assembly did not intend to bar a wrongful death action simply because a decedent pursued a personal injury action during his or her lifetime, since that interpretation would contravene the independent nature and purpose of a wrongful death claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Alternatively, although beyond the point of consideration in the case at bar, duplicative damages can also be avoided by consolidating the actions and bringing both claims simultaneously.\n   <em>\n    See Prosser &amp; Keaton,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 127 at 958 (noting that some \"statutes may require consolidation of the two actions\" to avoid any potential risk of double recovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Specifically, Petitioners assert that affirming the Court of Special Appeals' judgment would result in an influx of lawsuits, the value of current personal injury cases would increase and make settlement more difficult; there would be a potential for duplicative damages; and finally, the intermediate appellate court's judgment effectually \"usurp[s] the power of the [General Assembly].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Beyond Petitioners' contention that the Court of Special Appeals' judgment would cause an increase in lawsuits and the current value of personal injury cases, these assertions have not been substantiated with any credible evidence. Additionally, as concluded\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   a risk of double recovery is generally not likely, given the distinct purpose of damages in both actions. Nonetheless, to the extent that duplicative damages exist in the case at bar, the circuit court should assess and properly allocate such damages on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQuitty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205822059\">\n    2015 WL 5822059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, Petitioners' contention that the Court of Special Appeals' judgment \"usurps\" legislative powers is also unavailing. Contrary to Petitioners' assertion, the Court did not \"engage[ ] in a rewriting\" of the wrongful death statute, by \"effectively erasing the 'if death had not ensued' provision.\" Rather, the Court simply adhered to the long-standing tradition in Maryland that the wrongful death statute created a new and independent cause of action for a decedent's beneficiaries. We do not characterize the Court's deference in this regard as overstepping its judicial function, but instead, consider its judgment to be in furtherance of its function in interpreting the law and legislative intent that is consistent with the statutory scheme and Maryland wrongful death jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Petitioners allege that the covenant not to sue in paragraph eight of the Elberfeld release was not limited to a future claim against Dr. Elberfeld, but \"rather, ... was an attestation that Respondents 'will not maintain\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   potential action for wrongful death.' \" (emphasis in original). Accordingly, Petitioners aver that because the Elberfeld release \"extinguished\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   future claims of wrongful death beneficiaries, known and unknown,\" the holding in\n   <em>\n    Melitch,\n   </em>\n   where decedent's settlement of his claim during his lifetime barred a subsequent wrongful death action, applies, and similarly bars Respondents' wrongful death action.

A plain reading of the preface of the release, in tandem with paragraphs three, seven, and eight of the release, unambiguously reveals that Dylan did not \"release or in any way discharge\" Petitioners from further claims in connection with the underlying action. The relevant provisions states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   For and in consideration of the sum of ($999,000) the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, for ourselves and our heirs, representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, we, Peggy McQuitty and Gary McQuitty, individually, and as parents and next friends of the minor Plaintiff, Dylan McQuitty (hereinafter Plaintiff) do hereby remise, release and forever discharge Harold Elberfeld, M.D., and his personal agents, servants and/or employees, only, (hereinafter Defendant), his predecessors and/or successors in interest, and his insurance company Zurich American (Zurich) (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Releasees\") and, subject to the terms of paragraph # 3, any other persons or entities for whom Releasees could be legally responsible, as applicable, whether or not named herein, of and from all, and all manner of, actions and causes of actions, suits, debts; accounts, bonds, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, claims and demands of whatsoever kind, in law or in equity, known or unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which we now have or may hereafter have, arising out of an incident and management of a pregnancy and the birth of the Plaintiff more fully described in the pleadings in this case known as\n   <em>\n    Dylan McQuitty, minor, by and through his\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parents and Next Friends Peggy McQuitty and Gary McQuitty v.

The relevant provisions of the release reveals that Dylan executed a covenant with Dr. Elberfeld, and that in consideration of the monies paid by Dr. Elberfeld, that neither Dylan nor his beneficiaries would \"join or attempt to join\" Dr. Elberfeld, his agents and assigns, in any future wrongful death or survival action arising out of the lawsuit. The release does not reflect that Petitioners offered any consideration towards the settlement, and Petitioners' inclusion on the release was for the sole purpose of excluding them from any benefit therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Thus, we are not persuaded that the Elberfeld release was a general release because the \"covenant not to sue\" in paragraph eight did not clearly define the recipient at the time the covenant was made.

At that point, Respondents aver that the judgment in favor of Dylan's Estate became a final and appealable judgment. Petitioners counter that Respondents suddenly take a position regarding the date of final judgment, which the record reveals is inconsistent with the position they maintained throughout the litigation, and with this Court's own recognition of the date of final judgment.
