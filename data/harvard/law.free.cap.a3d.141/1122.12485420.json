Jackson (\"Jackson\") filed for an absolute divorce\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from his spouse, Gayle S. Jackson (\"Sollie\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Concerning the distribution of marital property, the parties were unable to reach a consensus as to how to divide their respective pension plans. As an older federal employee, Jackson is a participant in the CSRS pension program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon retirement, he will be entitled to a pension, but only limited\n   Social Security benefits. Sollie, however, participates in the Maryland State Retirement Service (\"MSRS\") plan, and will be entitled to a pension as well as full Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jackson acknowledges that generally, under Maryland law, in a divorce proceeding, retirement plans are considered marital property subject to division, and Social Security benefits are considered non-marital property, which are not subject to division. He argues, however, that the marital portion of the CSRS pension should be reduced in order to reflect an offset. The offset, he states, is an\n   <em>\n    implicit\n   </em>\n   embedded Social Security element representing the amount of Social Security benefits Jackson would have been entitled to had he not participated in the CSRS. By accounting for the offset, Sollie's share of the marital portion of the CSRS pension would be reduced, and, in Jackson's opinion, this would result in a more equitable distribution of the marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Circuit Court rejected Jackson's offset argument, and ordered the retirement plans be divided so that each party would receive 50% of the marital share of the other party's retirement plan. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the Circuit Court on this point, and hold that, under the doctrine of federal preemption, a trial judge may not offset the value of hypothetical Social Security benefits against the marital share of a CSRS pension when dividing marital assets in a divorce proceeding. We, however, vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand the case for that court to take into consideration the parties' anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 8-205(b) of the Family Law Article (\"FL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties were married on June 21, 1980. By this time, each party was already employed and contributing to their respective pension plans. After thirty-five years of marriage, Petitioner filed a complaint for an absolute divorce. Although the parties agreed to divide other marital assets equally, they were unable to reach a consensus as to how to dispose of their respective pension plans. On June 25, 2015, the parties appeared before the Circuit Court for Howard County for a trial. The trial judge bifurcated the case, and heard the grounds for divorce first, followed by testimony concerning the disposition of Jackson's CSRS pension, and Sollie's MSRS pension. In the latter proceeding, the trial judge heard testimony from Jackson, his expert witness, and Sollie's expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jackson testified about his employment history, including twelve years in the private sector and over thirty-eight years with the Social Security Administration where he remains a full-time employee. As a federal employee, Jackson enrolled in the CSRS, and began making contributions on January 18, 1977.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that, as a CSRS employee, he does not qualify for Social Security benefits, because his employer does not withhold Social Security taxes from his salary. He further explained that he would be eligible to receive limited Social Security benefits, because he previously worked in the private sector, and contributed to the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jackson explained that when an individual, such as himself, is eligible for Social Security benefits as well as a pension from a position that did not contribute to the Social Security program, the individual will be adversely impacted by two statutory provisions enacted by Congress. First, under the Windfall Elimination Provision (\"WEP\"), a special formula is used to reduce the amount of Social Security benefits that the individual is entitled to receive.\n   <em>\n    Windfall Elimination Provision,\n   </em>\n   Social Security Admin. (Jan. 2016), www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf [https://perma.cc/DX2K-WF4X]. If Jackson were to receive Social Security benefits starting at age 66, the WEP would reduce his estimated benefits of $381 per month to $131 per month. Second, under the Government Pension Offset (\"GPO\"), there is a similar reduction in the Social Security spousal or survivor benefits an individual, including a former spouse, may receive.\n   <em>\n    Government Pension Offset,\n   </em>\n   Social Security Admin. (July 2015), www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10007.pdf [https://perma.cc/Y7W3-K5D6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jackson called an expert witness in the areas of the CSRS and pensions to testify on his behalf. The expert explained that a portion of Jackson's salary is withheld to fund the CSRS instead of Social Security. Therefore, in the expert's opinion, the Circuit Court should account for the embedded Social Security element that allegedly exists within the CSRS pension:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [T]he Social Security element means the amount of Social Security that [Jackson] would have had if he had been a private company employee or participated in the FERS program. So if you set that aside and allocate [the value of the embedded element] to Mr. Jackson and then divide the balance of that, the remainder, by the marital fraction, so in essence attributing some of Mr. Jackson's CSRS Pension to Social Security, then this, in my opinion, provides an equitable distribution of the retirement pensions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In essence, because Social Security benefits are non-marital property, and thus, not subject to division by a court in a divorce proceeding, the expert proposed that the embedded Social Security element should be similarly treated as non-marital. Otherwise, according to the expert, an inequitable division would occur, because a portion of that embedded element would be distributed to Sollie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Sollie did not testify, she did call an expert witness in the areas of pension, pension valuations, and Social Security benefits. The expert testified about Sollie's employment history, and explained that Sollie has contributed to the MSRS for over twenty-eight years, beginning on August 1, 1986, as well as to Social Security. As a result, upon retirement, Sollie will be entitled to a pension as well as Social Security benefits. Sollie's expert disagreed with the pension valuation calculations made by Jackson's expert. The expert explained that any attempt to value the hypothetical Social Security element would be speculative, because the element does not exist within the CSRS. The CSRS and Social Security are separate and distinct programs with distinguishing characteristics. Additionally, the expert explained that state courts are federally preempted from interfering with Social Security, and that Jackson was trying to circumvent Congressional intent by suggesting that the trial court could offset the value of Social Security benefits. Congressional intent is expressed by the interplay between the CSRS, the WEP, and the GPO: Jackson, as a CSRS employee, is entitled to reduced Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 30, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its judgment granting Jackson an absolute divorce. On the issue of how to equitably divide the retirement plans, in its memorandum opinion, the Circuit Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It is not the role of the Court to make things equal, only to divide marital property equitably.... Each party's retirement shall be divided in accordance with the Bangs Formula, giving each party 50% of the marital share of the other party's retirement, with the marital share being defined as the number of months of the employee's qualifying participation in the plan from June 21, 1980 and June 25, 2015 and the denominator being the total number of months of the employee's qualifying participation in the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 16, 2015, Jackson filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, and, on August 25, 2015, he filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before the commencement of proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to answer the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Should Maryland adopt the [position of a] majority of states and require a trial judge to consider whether social security benefits should be offset against the marital portion of [a] CSRS pension upon dividing assets as a result of [a] divorce?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

For the reasons stated below, we shall answer twofold: (1) in a divorce proceeding, a trial judge is preempted by federal law from dividing Social Security benefits (including its hypothetical value) directly or by way of an indirect offset when determining the equitable distribution of marital property; (2) on the basis of the evidence presented, a judge must consider a party's actual or anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) when determining whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property. \"A court that grants a divorce has authority to determine which property is marital property, to assess its value, to order the transfer of ownership of certain categories of property, and to grant a monetary award to adjust 'the equities and rights of the parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Robinette v.

The Circuit Court then announced, in its memorandum opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Maryland law is clear with regard to the disposition of marital property. The court is to first determine what is marital property, then value the property, and then make an award that equitably divides the property....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [Jackson]'s argument regarding fairness and equitable distribution is compelling.... However, equitable distribution does not mean equal. The Court can only divide marital property. Social Security retirement benefits are not marital property. Certainly, there will be other inequities, where one party may end up better off than the other. It is not the role of the Court to make things equal, only to divide marital property equally. Social Security retirement benefits, not being marital property, are not part of the division....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Each party's retirement shall be divided in accordance with the Bangs Formula, giving each party 50% of the marital share of the other party's retirement, with the marital share being defined as the number of months of the employee's qualifying participation in the plan from June 21, 1980 and June 25, 2015 and the denominator being the total number of months of the employee's qualifying participation in the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Circuit Court properly recognized that it was without authority to order an offset in this case. In light of this opinion and our interpretation of F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b), however, we remand this case to the Circuit Court for its general consideration of Social Security benefits. It is clear from the record that the trial judge did not consider the anticipated Social Security benefits of the parties as a relevant factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) when determining an equitable distribution of the marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand the case for that court to take into consideration the parties' anticipated Social Security benefits. A trial court is preempted by federal law from dividing Social Security benefits (including its hypothetical value allegedly located within a CSRS pension) directly or indirectly by way of an offset. A trial judge, however, must consider actual or anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) in deciding whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities and rights of the parties in marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY VACATED.

The majority opinion raises several concerns. Specifically, among other things, the Majority exceeds the issue that is before this Court; the Majority's holding will require trial courts to speculate about future Social Security benefits in divorce actions; and, as to the authority for its holding, the Majority relies on a provision of a statute that does not authorize speculation by trial courts about future economic circumstances of litigants. Contrary to the result reached by the Majority, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and hold that Social Security benefits are not to be offset against the marital portion of a Civil Service Retirement System (\"CSRS\") pension in a divorce action or to be considered a factor under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\"FL\") \u00a7 8-205(b) in determining a monetary award in a divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The only issue before this Court-which Milton Everett Jackson, Petitioner, raised in a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   -is as follows: \"Should Maryland [follow] the majority of States and require a trial [court] to consider whether Social Security benefits\n   <strong>\n    should be offset against the marital portion of [a] CSRS pension\n   </strong>\n   upon dividing assets as a result of divorce?\" (Emphasis added) (underlining and some capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   This issue indisputably arises from the facts of this somewhat-atypical divorce action, in which Gayle S. Jackson, Respondent, had Social Security benefits and a pension, while Petitioner, as a federal employee, had almost no Social Security benefits, but had a pension under the CSRS. In other words, Petitioner paid into the CSRS, but did not pay into Social Security. As the Social Security Administration explains, \"[u]ntil 1984, employment by the [f]ederal government was covered under the Civil Service Retirement System [ ] and not by Social Security. If you worked for a [f]ederal agency during those years, you did not pay Social Security tax on your earnings[.]\" Social Security Administration, Retirement Planner: Federal Government\n   Employment, https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/fedgovees.html [https://perma.cc/2F6M-CQGA].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addressing the facts set forth above, the Majority greatly exceeds the issue that is before this Court by issuing the broad holding that, in a divorce action, \"in determining whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities and rights of the parties in marital property, ... a trial court is required to consider the parties' actual or anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b).\" Maj. Op. at 192, 141 A.3d at 1138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The statute to which the Majority refers, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b), lists the considerations that a court must take into account in determining a monetary award as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   The court shall determine the amount and the method of payment of a monetary award, or the terms of the transfer of the interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both, after considering each of the following factors:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (1) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (2) the value of all property interests of each party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (3) the economic circumstances of each party at the time the award is to be made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   (4) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   (5) the duration of the marriage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (6) the age of each party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (7) the physical and mental condition of each party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   (8) how and when specific marital property or interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (9) the contribution by either party of property described in \u00a7 8-201(e)(3) of this subtitle to the acquisition of real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (10) any award of alimony and any award or other provision that the court has made with respect to family use personal property or the family home; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    (11) any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award or transfer of an interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As to the authority for its holding, the Majority relies on F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11), the \"catchall\" provision that enables a trial court to consider \"any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 186, 141 A.3d at 1135 (\"[T]he Court of Special Appeals stated: 'In an appropriate case, of course, it may be that a court could consider the fact that a party is receiving, or will receive, social security benefits, as 'any other factor' in determining whether to make a monetary award.' We agree.\" (Citation omitted)). In my view, contrary to the Majority's reasoning, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11) does not authorize a trial court to speculate as to future Social Security benefits. In other words, that F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11) provides that a court may consider \"any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate\" does not authorize a court to engage in speculation about a party's future receipt of Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With its inclusion of Social Security benefits as a factor to be considered under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11), the Majority's broad holding will cause difficulties in countless divorce actions. The exact amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future depends on several variables, such as the amount of money that a person earns prior to retirement and the age at which the person retires. Indeed, the Social Security Administration provides estimates, not guaranteed amounts, of Social Security benefits. Thus, it is inherently speculative to attempt to estimate an amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future, and to base a monetary award in a divorce action on such an estimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Yet, the Majority expects trial courts to engage in such speculation, and leaves several important questions unanswered. How exactly should a trial court go about calculating future Social Security benefits? What if the trial court values future Social Security benefits at a certain amount, and, years later, it turns out that the trial court's valuation was too high or too low? That outcome is not unlikely, given that, again, it is inherently speculative to attempt to pinpoint the exact amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Notably, in drafting F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b), the General Assembly carefully refrained from forcing trial courts to attempt to predict the future. Instead, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(3) requires a trial court to consider \"the economic circumstances of each party\n   <strong>\n    at the time the award is to be made\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added). It is reasonable to require a trial court to ascertain a spouse's existing economic circumstances; it is not reasonable to require a trial court to come up with an estimate as to a spouse's future economic circumstances, including future entitlement to Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As discussed above, in this case, one spouse had Social Security benefits, while the other spouse had almost no Social Security benefits. The out-of-State cases upon which the Majority relies, in which both parties worked and earned Social Security benefits, reach disparate outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   For example, the Majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Depot v.

Consider for example an individual being divorced at approximately age fifty. Assuming a normal work history, that person will likely have accrued a substantial pension as well as a right to Social Security. When the pension is divided in equitable distribution there will be a diminution of the expected retirement income. However, the presence of Social Security will help offset the diminution. In contrast, an individual who was a civil service participant for many years will, if the trial court's approach is approved, be dealt a double blow of sorts. The pension will become part of the marital estate and, thus, divided, yet there will be no Social Security benefit waiting to cushion this financial pitfall. The situation is exacerbated, thus providing a second \"blow\", in that the money that would, in a conventional setting, be routed into Social Security, and thus into an exempt status, would either have been consumed by the couple, thus providing previous benefits enjoyed by both, or, perhaps, routed into the CSRS or another retirement type vehicle, which, of course, would then be included in the marital estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   In either scenario, a substantial stream of income which would be used to finance a future Social Security benefit, which for most individuals is excluded from equitable distribution, is not similarly shielded for the CSRS participant. Thus, the CSRS participant is at a disadvantage when compared to the majority of the work force. Consequently, should equity prevail, this difference must be negated if we are to equate the CSRS participant with Social Security participants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371-72 (footnote omitted). As to how to calculate the offset, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   To facilitate a process of equating CSRS participants and Social Security participants we believe it will be necessary to compute the present value of a Social Security benefit had the CSRS participant been participating in the Social Security system.

Barring unusual circumstances, an equitable division of the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage would be an equal division of those benefits.... It would not seem to be equitable, and we are aware of no cases finding it to be equitable, to offset against the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage by the only spouse who has accrued retirement benefits of any kind an amount [that is] equal to the hypothetical Social Security benefits that that spouse would have accrued had that spouse been under Social Security. For example, [suppose that a] husband has accrued during the marriage retirement benefits that will pay $5,000 a month, but would have accrued Social Security benefits paying $2,000 a month had he been under Social Security. Because all of the retirement benefits-$5,000 per month-were accrued during the marriage, it is obviously equitable to divide those benefits equally, so that each spouse receives $2,500 per month. But if the husband's hypothesized Social Security benefits in the amount of $2,000 per month are first deducted from his pension, leaving $3,000 to be divided, his wife will receive $1,500 per month, and he will receive $3,500 per month, which is not an equal division, and therefore an inequitable division, barring unusual circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   Using the non-Social Security spouse's hypothetical Social Security benefit instead of the Social Security spouse's actual Social Security benefit approaches this obviously inequitable result[,] as the Social Security spouse's actual Social Security benefit approaches zero.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   Where the non-Social Security spouse's retirement benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage exceed the Social Security spouse's Social Security benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage, using the Social Security spouse's actual [S]ocial [S]ecurity benefits as an offset will always result in the equivalent of an equal division of the retirement benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage[,] and is therefore the more equitable method of division, barring unusual circumstances justifying an unequal division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Harshbarger,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=814%20N.E.2d%20105\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=814%20N.E.2d%20105\">\n    at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , one spouse was entitled to Social Security benefits, while the other spouse was a federal employee who participated in the CSRS; as far as the opinion reveals, the latter spouse was not entitled to any Social Security benefits.

However, whether an offset, or even consideration, of Social Security benefits as a factor can be taken into account by a trial court in dividing marital property is an issue of first impression in Maryland; and, the Supreme Court has not spoken on the subject. As discussed above, courts in other jurisdictions are split on the matter and follow one of three approaches: (1) an offset of Social Security benefits is prohibited by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20407\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Social Security benefits are not to be considered in the division of marital property (this is the approach advocated by Respondent in this case); (2) an indirect offset of Social Security benefits-either by: (a) offsetting the actual amount of one spouse's Social Security benefits accrued during the marriage against the retirement benefits of the CSRS pension spouse accrued during the marriage, or (b) determining the present value of the CSRS pension spouse's Social Security benefits had he or she participated in Social Security during the marriage (this latter approach is the approach advocated by Petitioner in this case)-is permissible; or (3) an offset of Social Security benefits is not allowed but a trial court may consider one spouse's Social Security benefits in the division of marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and hold that Social Security benefits are not to be offset against the marital portion of a CSRS pension in a divorce action or to be considered a factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) in determining a monetary award in a divorce action.

This holding greatly exceeds the question presented, ignores that Social Security benefits are not property, conflicts with F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(3)'s requirement that a monetary award be based on a party's current economic circumstances, and will force trial courts to speculate about the amount of future Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Judge HOTTEN has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    In 1920, Congress enacted the Civil Service Retirement Act, which established the CSRS for federal employees. A defining characteristic of the CSRS program is that the employee does not participate in the Social Security program. Because the employer does not withhold Social Security taxes from the CSRS employee's salary, generally, the employee, upon retirement, will receive a larger pension in lieu of Social Security benefits. The employee may qualify for Social Security benefits, because of previous employment in the private sector. As will be discussed later, those benefits are subject to penalties under federal statutory provisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    At the time Jackson filed for an absolute divorce, he was sixty-one years old, and Sollie was fifty-eight years old.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The Circuit Court granted Mrs. Jackson's request to restore her maiden name: Gayle Ann Sollie.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    The CSRS was replaced by the Federal Employees Retirement System (\"FERS\") \"for Federal employees who first entered covered service on and after January 1, 1987.\"\n    <em>\n     CSRS Information,\n    </em>\n    U.S. Office of Pers.
