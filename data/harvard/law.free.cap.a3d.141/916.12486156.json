The defendant appeals on two grounds: (1) that the trial court improperly denied his request for self-representation, and thus denied him his sixth\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and fourteenth\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   amendment\n   right to represent himself; and (2) that the state improperly used his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   silence to imply his guilt, thus violating his fifth\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and fourteenth\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 2012, the police were investigating the victim, Javon Zimmerman, and the victim's brothers, Keyshon and Roo, for drug sale activity. The defendant had an ongoing feud with the Zimmermans. The feud stemmed from the Zimmermans' failure to make promised payments to the prison commissary account of the defendant's half-brother, Stephen Cook. In 2009, Cook had shot and killed a drug dealer, Kieran Stanley, at the request of the Zimmermans. The feud came to a head on May 12, 2012, when the defendant approached the victim while he was in a vehicle in the parking lot of RJ's Caf\u00e9, a bar in Derby. After the victim jumped out of the vehicle, the defendant walked toward him, said, \"Fuck you, Javon,\" and shot him two times. The victim died in the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury returned a verdict of guilty on April 8, 2014, and on the basis of that verdict, the court found that the defendant had violated his probation. On June 24, 2014, the court sentenced him to fifty years incarceration plus ten years of special parole on his conviction for murder and three years for the violation of probation, to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of fifty years incarceration plus ten years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for self-representation in violation of his right to self-representation under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant argues that he made a clear and unequivocal request to represent himself that the court denied for improper reasons. More specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his request for self-representation because it based its denial on what it thought were his frivolous reasons for wanting to represent himself, not on any delay or disruption of the trial that was likely to result from his self-representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant's special public defender, Lawrence Hopkins, filed a motion to withdraw his appearance because the defendant and his mother had filed grievances against him. On April 9, 2013, at a hearing on the motion to withdraw, Hopkins told the court, \"I really think it's in [the defendant's] best interests to have another attorney. Communications between [him and me] have been bad, at best. The\n   situation between the family and [me], I would best describe as antagonistic.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.,\n   </em>\n   did not act on Hopkins' motion. Instead, it continued the case until July 9 to give the defendant or his parents time to hire new counsel. The defendant never retained new counsel, however, and so three days of jury selection began on February 25, 2014, with Hopkins representing the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the morning of April 1, 2014, just as the court,\n   <em>\n    Markle, J.,\n   </em>\n   was announcing that it was ready to bring in the jurors to start hearing the evidence at trial, the defendant interrupted the judge and asked permission to address the court. The court allowed the defendant to make a statement in which he described his longstanding difficulties with Hopkins. He said that he believed that Hopkins was not working on his behalf. The defendant went on to describe Hopkins' failure to follow up with two witnesses who would have purportedly testified that he had not shot Javon Zimmerman,\n   but who would not be willing to identify the actual shooter. In addition, the defendant recounted several instances in which he felt that Hopkins had lied to him. The defendant also described his disagreement with Hopkins' trial strategy, including as to the witnesses to be called and the jurors to be selected. Hopkins disputed several of the defendant's accusations and provided an explanation as to why certain witnesses had not been called: \"I don't know who they are. And if in fact they exist and they were a witness to this thing or are going to suggest that they saw someone else shoot this person but they won't say who it is, that gives me grave doubts as to, number one, their veracity, and number two, their very existence.\" The court explained to the defendant that his concerns about his attorney had already been resolved on pretrial motions, and thus announced that it was prepared to move on with the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that day, after the court gave the jury preliminary instructions, Hopkins made the following statement to the court, outside the presence of the jury: \"Your Honor, against my advice [the defendant] has decided that he wants to-that he would like to represent himself throughout the course of these proceedings. I indicated to him that while that is not advisable, number one, it will not delay the process, that we're here, ready to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"I indicated that it is customary that a lawyer would be appointed as standby counsel, which is a role I am happy to assume. I also indicated to him that the rules require that I not sit at defense table with him, but be available in the courtroom in case he has any legal questions for me, and I am certainly willing to do that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court asked the defendant if Hopkins was correct as to the reasons why he wanted to represent himself,\n   and the defendant responded, \"No, I didn't want self-representation. I wanted new representation. I was just ... asking him about my defense, and I asked him, could I subpoena a couple of people, and he said no.\" The court then advised the defendant not to discuss his defense on the record, but the defendant continued, \"I just asked him a question about whether I can subpoena some people. He is telling me no, and he said, well, the only way you are going to subpoena people ... or ask questions that you have is if you represent yourself. So, he basically gave me no option but to just sit here and go with something I don't even know about because he won't even tell me his plan; he won't tell me nothing. He said, just represent yourself. So, he is putting me in a rock and a hard place. I don't know what to do.\" The court then said, \"Well, based on that, I am not going to grant you your motion for self-representation. Legally,\n   that's-besides being at the absolute eve of the trial and the witnesses being called [are] here to start, besides the procedural aspects, the question of when and how subpoenas are rendered can be best addressed by an attorney ... not by somebody without the experience.\" The defendant, however, persisted, \"Can I ask you a question? Is there no way that you can order him to work with me? Is there no way that the court can order him to work with me and that we can both work together on this case, instead of him just saying he do it his way or it's no way at all? Is there any way that you can ... get him to work with me or at least meet me halfway?\" Hopkins then said, \"The question [is], do you want to represent yourself or not; that's the question, yes or no.\" The defendant did not answer that question, instead asking, \"The question is, can you work with me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court then canvassed the defendant, eliciting from him that he was twenty-six years old, had a general equivalency diploma, and had worked in construction\n   with his father and as a dishwasher. The court, again, stated, \"I am going to deny your request for self-representation. I am sure that Attorney Hopkins knows what the law is in regard to issuing subpoenas, and I have confidence that if there is a witness to be subpoenaed that counsel is aware of the statutory provisions where it is allowed, and how it is allowed, and when it is allowed, and I am not sure that you do. So I don't think self-representation on that basis is appropriate.\" Following that colloquy, the jurors were invited to reenter the courtroom, and the state began to present its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After several state's witnesses had testified on the morning and in the early afternoon of the first day of trial, Hopkins again informed the court that the defendant wished to address it. The following discussion then ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Defendant: Excuse me, Your Honor. I notice during the cross-examination they are not bringing none of the details. This guy said that, in his statement, that Javon walked up on me and I shot him. Therefore, he clearly said I walked up on Javon; that was a contradiction in his first statement. He said I had a ... .38 revolver. Later on another witness said I had a nine millimeter. Them is clear, big contradictions that could cause reasonable doubt, but he is not bringing those up. He is not asking about my clothes. There's a big argument about my clothes, and he is not asking any of the witnesses about my clothes or nothing ... I feel like ... he is missing a big part of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The Court: ... [Q]uite frankly, I will tell you that ... you have an attorney to make some strategic decisions about what to cross-examine and what not to cross-examine on, what is relevant, what is not relevant. And sir, on every objection that you make at this point, your counsel, I see him doing a more than adequate job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   He has cross-examined this witness as to any underlying motivation he may have toward the testimony. I can't-from what you just told me, I can't make a determination as to whether those things, at this point, are relevant or not or the circumstances. So, I don't-I am not going to-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The Defendant: He never even asked-Officer Roger arrested me a few times. He said he don't remember me. Here it is on record that he arrested me. I had several run-ins with Derby police in 2008. He clearly lied up there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Court: I don't know that as a fact, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Defendant: Why would I lie in\n   acing\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   my police records?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Court: All right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The Defendant: We can take a break and you can look it up online if you think I am lying. They clearly-I feel like I am getting railroaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Court: All right, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The Defendant: All right. I don't have nothing else to say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The Court: I am not going to-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: You don't want to do it yourself?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The Defendant: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Well, tell her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The Defendant: Can I please represent myself from forward because I feel I can do a better job than cross-examining than he is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Court: All right. We're going to take a brief recess.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the recess, the court ruled as follows: \"[D]uring the recess I considered your comments and listened to your objections that you made on the record before we took the recess. During the recess, to let you know, I spoke with your attorney and the state, and I advised them in advance of the ruling I am about to make. But first, before I make that ruling, I am going to give you some advice, advice from the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"I listened to your objection concerning what you considered to be a lack of cross-examination of the officer concerning what you say that he knew you, and there were prior arrests and he knew you by prior arrests. What you don't understand is that, sir, that decision to cross-examine concerning the prior arrests, you may not understand this, but that would have been very prejudicial to you to have the jury, who has been advised constantly that there is a presumption of innocence, to be then told that you have had prior arrests. That information will be prejudicial to you. As a matter of fact, if the state was to try to offer that evidence in, the court would have ruled that it is inadmissible because it is prejudicial to you. Understood?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"So, and I say this to you because these are strategic decisions that an experienced [attorney], like Mr. Hopkins, makes after spending years in a trial court and knowing what is relevant, what is a strategic plan to defend you, and what would not be a smart choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"So, if you didn't understand why your attorney did not cross-examine that officer in the manner that you wanted, I was going to explain it to you because I think your attorney has explained it to you and you just choose not to listen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"So, again, emphasizing that this was the type-the nature of the evidence that the court would have ruled\n   inadmissible. In plain words, it would have hurt you in your case. And again, your inability to comprehend that fact, along with other strategic decisions that Mr. Hopkins is making on your behalf, is another reason why the court will not allow you to represent yourself because you have the inability to understand when strategic decisions are being made in your best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"So, I am going to remind you once again that you may know it, but Mr. Hopkins is an experienced criminal defense litigator who has been doing this for many years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"So, from this point forward, Mr. Silva, I am going to decline any further objections made by you concerning trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The Defendant: Can I say one thing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The Court: No. No. You're not going to say anything right now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following that exchange, the state proceeded with its case, and the issue of self-representation was not raised at trial again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant now claims that the court erroneously denied his clear and unequivocal request for self-representation. The state disputes this claim, arguing first that the defendant did not make a clear and unequivocal request to represent himself and, second, that even if his request was clear and unequivocal, the court properly denied it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The sixth amendment right to counsel is made applicable to state prosecutions through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.... In\n   <em>\n    Faretta v. California,\n   </em>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p807\">\n    422 U.S. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p807\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p807\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) ] the United States Supreme Court concluded that the sixth amendment [also] embodies a right to self-representation and that a defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.... In short, forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"It is well established that [t]he right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins.... Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"State and federal courts consistently have discussed the right to self-representation in terms of invoking or asserting it ... and have concluded that there can be no infringement of the right to self-representation in the absence of a defendant's proper assertion of that right.... The threshold requirement that the defendant clearly and unequivocally invoke his right to proceed pro se is one of many safeguards of the fundamental right to counsel.... Accordingly, [t]he constitutional right of self-representation depends ... upon its invocation by the defendant in a clear and unequivocal manner.... In the absence of a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation, a trial court has no independent obligation to inquire into the defendant's interest in representing himself .... [Instead] recognition of the right becomes a matter entrusted to the exercise of discretion by the trial\n   court.... Conversely, once there has been an unequivocal request for self-representation, a court must undertake an inquiry [pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 ], on the record, to inform the defendant of the risks of self-representation and to permit him to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Although a clear and unequivocal request is required, there is no standard form it must take. [A] defendant does not need to recite some talismanic formula hoping to open the eyes and ears of the court to [that] request. Insofar as the desire to proceed pro se is concerned, [a defendant] must do no more than state\n   his request, either orally or in writing, unambiguously to the court so that no reasonable person can say that the request was not made.... Moreover, it is generally incumbent upon the courts to elicit that elevated degree of clarity through a detailed inquiry. That is, the triggering statement in a defendant's attempt to waive his right to counsel need not be punctilious; rather, the dialogue between the court and the defendant must result in a clear and unequivocal statement....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Finally, in conducting our review, we are cognizant that the context of [a] reference to self-representation is important in determining whether the reference itself was a clear invocation of the right to self-representation.... The inquiry is fact intensive and should be based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the request ... which may include, inter alia, whether the request was for hybrid representation ... or merely for the appointment of standby or advisory counsel ... the trial court's response to a request ... whether a defendant has consistently vacillated in his request ... and whether a request is the result of an emotional outburst....\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior to trial, a court is not free to investigate the adequacy of defense counsel and, upon discovering that counsel is providing adequate assistance, require the defendant to continue to be represented by counsel....

Ultimately, the court determined that the reason for self-representation advanced by the defendant did not weigh in his favor because it would not have been beneficial to the defense. The defendant appears to equate a 'legitimate' reason for self-representation with one that is not grounded in a desire to cause disruption or delay, but is genuinely advanced and is related to a legitimate right of a defendant in furtherance of his defense. We recognize that the court did not find that the defendant's request was not genuinely made or that it was made for the purpose of disrupting the proceeding. In fact, the court deemed the reason to be facially legitimate as it related to a fundamental right of a defendant to present a defense.

Instead, the trial court must weigh the three factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   and determine, on the basis of those factors, whether they provide a strong enough reason to justify the potential disruption in trial that might result in the course of a midtrial change in representation. If the trial court determines that the three\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   factors do not provide a strong enough reason to justify a potential disruption, it is not necessary for it to make a finding that a disruption in the proceedings will occur because the court has already determined that there is no benefit to be gained by granting the defendant's request for self-representation.

Nevertheless, the trial court clearly considered the relevant\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   factors in evaluating the defendant's request for self-representation and determined that the first factor, in particular, did not weigh in favor of granting his request. The trial court determined that the defendant's reasons for wanting to represent himself would ultimately waste the court's time and be prejudicial to the defendant. Accordingly, because the court determined that two of the\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   factors did not provide a strong enough reason to justify a potential disruption in the proceedings, the court was not required to make any finding as to whether a disruption would actually occur.

The defendant argues that the state violated\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   in his case by using his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence and demeanor to imply that he had killed Javon Zimmerman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. At trial, Patrick Meehan, a detective with the\n   state police, testified that he had interviewed the defendant after his arrest on May 17, 2012, but that the defendant refused to allow the interview to be recorded. After advising the defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, Meehan told him that he wanted to discuss the shooting of Javon Zimmerman at R.J.'s Caf\u00e9 and the defendant's possible involvement in that shooting. The defendant told Meehan that he had been at R.J.'s Caf\u00e9 at the time of the murder, that he had an altercation with Javon Zimmerman in the parking lot, and that he ran away after the altercation. When Meehan asked the defendant if he had murdered Javon Zimmerman, the defendant did not reply, and just gave \"a blank stare\" and shrugged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following his refusal to answer that question, the defendant continued to answer questions\n   about whether he had touched the car that Javon Zimmerman had been in when he arrived at R.J.'s Caf\u00e9, and about his history with the Zimmermans. He also agreed to provide a DNA sample to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant testified on his own behalf. He told the jury about the ongoing feud he had with Javon Zimmerman, but explained that he had been trying to get out of the drug \"game.\" The defendant described the events on the morning of Javon Zimmerman's murder as follows. The defendant admitted that he was at R.J.'s Caf\u00e9 on the evening of May 11, 2012, and into the morning hours of May 12. The defendant was watching from inside\n   the entryway of the bar as Javon Zimmerman's car pulled into the parking lot, and he saw Tyquan Bailey get out of the car. The defendant walked outside and spoke briefly with Bailey, and they were then joined by the defendant's friend. As they were talking, Javon Zimmerman jumped out of the vehicle and started yelling at Bailey for speaking to the defendant and his friend. The defendant then heard gunshots, saw a flash, and took off running. Although the defendant denied being the shooter, he declined to name the person who had fired the gun, simply stating that it was his \"boy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   During cross-examination, the prosecutor pressed the defendant about his refusal to provide the name of the person he allegedly saw shoot Javon Zimmerman. In particular, the prosecutor asked the defendant if, during the course of his four hours of questioning by police, he ever told them that he knew the identity of\n   the real murderer. The prosecutor said, \"When he asks you if you shot him, you don't say-\" and the defendant interrupts to say, \"Nothing.\" The prosecutor continued, \"why does everybody keep pointing the finger at me? You don't say, I didn't do this. You don't say, this my life we're talking about. I got kids. I would never shoot somebody in the middle of a parking lot with witnesses around. You say none of that.\" The defendant agreed, stating, \"I say nothing,\" explaining, \"I didn't answer all of [Meehan's] questions because when he asked me what happened that night I told him I don't want to even get into that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   During its closing argument, the state mentioned the defendant's refusal to answer Meehan's question about whether he had killed Javon Zimmerman: \"Interview with Detective Meehan. We don't have any audio or video of that; [the defendant] wouldn't allow it. But the important part about that, well, Detective Meehan stressed-you decide what is the important part. But Detective Meehan stressed, he is all over the place in the first part. The Zimmermans; the killers; they bring people up to pull the trigger. Javon you know was there, and on and on about that. Did you do it? The shrug basically told you what I did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The defendant claims that the state improperly used his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence and demeanor to imply his guilt and that this constitutional violation was harmful. More specifically, the defendant alleges that the state's use of his failure to answer Meehan's questions about whether he had killed Javon Zimmerman violated the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Doyle,\n   </em>\n   which held that it is a violation of due process to use a defendant's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence to impeach him at trial. The state contends, however, that the defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent, and thus that no\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   violation occurred. Moreover, the state argues, even if such a violation did occur, it was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial and now seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review.

Once an arrestee has\n   waived his right to remain silent, the\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   rationale is not operative because the arrestee has not remained silent and an explanatory statement assuredly is no longer 'insolubly ambiguous.'

While a defendant may invoke his right to remain silent at any time, even after he has initially waived his right to remain silent, it does not necessarily follow that he may remain 'selectively' silent. We need not, however, in this case, decide the boundaries of intermittent assertion of the right to remain silent because, as the trial court found, the defendant's expression of a disinclination to answer one question was not tantamount to any assertion of his fifth amendment right. The defendant talked freely with the two officers who arrested him. In response to their questions, he voluntarily discussed with them his version of the events of the evening in question.

The defendant remained selectively silent when asked if he had committed the crime, yet answered questions before and after about his relationship with the victim and his whereabouts on the morning of the victim's murder. Thus, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Morrill,\n   </em>\n   the defendant did not refuse to answer any questions about the crime, and in fact, was quite forthcoming about\n   details relating to his relationship with the victim and his presence at the scene of the murder.

The question asked of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Taft\n   </em>\n   was also the ultimate inculpatory question of whether the defendant knew the car he had received was stolen.\n   <em>\n    State v.
