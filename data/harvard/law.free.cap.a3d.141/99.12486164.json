On January 6, 2011, Sanmartin Prado pleaded not guilty by way of an agreed statement of facts to Count 2, second-degree child abuse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to an agreement with the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Sanmartin Prado's trial counsel (\"trial counsel\") engaged\n   in a waiver colloquy with Sanmartin Prado; and the following exchange occurred as to Sanmartin Prado's immigration status:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: And understand what-we have had discussions with respect to your immigration status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: You have a green card and you have been a permanent resident of the United States for over twelve years, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: You are not under an active deportation order?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: And there's no immigration detainer that we are aware of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: And you understand that I'm not making any promises and the [circuit court] is not making any promises about what the federal government could possibly do in the future with respect to reviewing this conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: And you still wish to proceed this morning?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thereafter, the circuit court announced that \"Sanmartin Prado ha[d] waived his rights to a jury trial and to a Court trial in this matter, and that he ha [d] done so voluntarily and understanding the rights that he has.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State then read into the record the following agreed statement of facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [O]n April 28th, 2010, the Crimes Against Children's Unit of the Baltimore County Police Department received information regarding a possible child abuse that occurred to a three-year-old named B[.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The matter was assigned to Detective Lane to investigate. Detective Lane's investigation revealed that on 4-18-2010, ten days earlier, the child was in her father, ... Sanmartin Prado's care and during that time she sustained a serious burn to the left side of her face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   During that time the mother of the child, Gina Salinas became aware of the burn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Together [ ] Salinas and [ ] Sanmartin Prado made the decision not to take the child to the hospital, however, the next day, April 19th 2010, the child was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital. There the mother and [Sanmartin Prado] told the hospital staff a story that consisted of this being an accident. The child was in the bath tub, she turned the water on and she burnt her face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The police were not called at that time. Days later the police were informed of this injury. The police did interview [ ] Salinas and she told the police that she had left her child B[.] with [Sanmartin Prado] while she worked and when she came home from work she found B[.] to have a serious burn to the left side of her face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Sanmartin Prado] was subsequently interviewed by Detective Lane on May 3rd of 2010. All of this happening well after the child had received care and treatment for what was determined to be second and third degree burns on the left side of her face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   By this point those burns had scabbed over. The injury was just a discoloration to the child's face, however, on May 3rd, 2010, while speaking with Detective Lane, [Sanmartin Prado] after being Mirandized did agree that on April 18th, 2010, while his wife worked, he cared for his children. At\n   some point B[.] woke up from her nap and she was inconsolable. She was crying for her mother and, as he had done in the past, he took the spray from the shower head and as she sat in the bathroom on the toilet he sprayed the water at her. [Sanmartin\n   Prado] would say that most of the water went on the floor, however, the child continued to cry, he believed crying still for her mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   He would say that he had no idea that the water was as hot as it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The bath tub was examined and it was that the faucet was just one faucet for both cold and hot water. The water temp-well, [Sanmartin Prado] said that he sprayed his daughter in the facial area and the body for approximately two minutes. The water temp was tested and it was found that after one minute that the water would reach a temperature of 128 degrees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Studies have shown that at 122 degrees the skin will burn after one minute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Again, if called to testify, [ ] Salinas, the mother, would attest she was not home when the burns occurred. Again Detective Lane would attest that [Sanmartin Prado] admitted that as a course of punishment he turned the water on his child not meaning to burn her, is-would be his words, but that he did, in fact, spray her with the water and that did in fact cause burns that were subsequently seen approximately ten days after being treated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   All events occurred in Baltimore County, and that would be the State's case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The circuit court found Sanmartin Prado guilty of second-degree child abuse, and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment with all but two years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation with the condition that Sanmartin Prado complete a physical offender treatment program and a parenting course offered by the Department of Social Services. The charges for first-degree child abuse causing severe physical injury and second-degree assault were nol prossed. Sanmartin Prado did not appeal the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Over two years later, on October 21, 2013, Sanmartin Prado filed in the circuit court a \"Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis\" (\"the petition\"), contending that, as a result of the conviction, he was facing a significant collateral consequence, namely, \"that he is automatically deportable from the United States[.]\" Sanmartin Prado stated that, as of the time of the filing of the petition, he was \"in proceedings before the Immigration Court with one of the allegations being the conviction in the [ ] case to substantiate or to support the government's claim for deportation.\" Sanmartin Prado alleged that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel at the January 6, 2011 plea hearing by failing to advise him that he was subject to automatic deportation as a result of the conviction, and by failing to specify what immigration consequences he could face as a result of conviction, including being subject to automatic deportation. According to Sanmartin Prado, had he known that he would be subject to automatic deportation as a result of the conviction, he would not have pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts, and instead would have gone to trial. On November 18, 2013, the State filed an answer and motion to dismiss the petition without a hearing, contending, in pertinent part, that trial counsel properly advised Sanmartin Prado of the potential immigration consequences of a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 28, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the petition. At the hearing, Sanmartin Prado called trial counsel as a witness. Trial counsel testified that he visited Sanmartin Prado in jail before the January 6, 2011 proceeding, and the following exchange occurred concerning trial counsel's discussions with Sanmartin\n   Prado about the immigration consequences of a conviction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Now, when you discussed these matters with [ ] Sanmartin [Prado], did you ask him if he was a citizen of the United States?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I don't know if I exactly asked him if he was a citizen, I asked him where he was born, he told me he was from Ecuador, he came to the United States with his mother when he was eighteen and he told me that he was a\n   permanent resident and had a green card and had, had so had that green card since 1998. That's what my notes reflect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: But did you, you did not determine whether or not, since 1998, he had become a citizen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: No, I knew he was not a naturalized U.S. citizen, if that's your question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Now, after having gotten that information, what, if anything, did you explore to determine if any problems he might have with immigration?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: On December ... 30th of 2010, I met with [Sanmartin Prado] for the final time at the Detention Center. I explained to him that the, there could and probably would be immigration consequences as a result of the plea but that the, the term of art that I usually use is that immigration is a moving target and that it was, I recall telling him that it was a deportable or a possibly deportable offense, but the plea agreement that the State had offered, he indicated to me that he was interested in taking that and my notes, written on the inside of my file jacket, I can read them verbatim if you'd like.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: That's fine. If that refreshes your recollection, that's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: It says, [Sanmartin Prado] wants deal, prefer Alford plea, quote, cannot admit guilty, unquote, spoke extensively re imm, I-M-M-period, consequences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [CIRCUIT COURT]: I'm sorry, slow down,-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Which I would take to be immigration consequences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. What did you explain to him about immigration consequences?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: That it's a deportable offense and he could be deported if the Federal government chooses to deport him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Why is it a deportable offense?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Because it is an aggravated felony which carries more than a year in jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: And where did you get that information from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: My, I've always wanted to say this, my training, knowledge and experience as a lawyer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: That's good. Nothing wrong with that. And at the time that you advised my client-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [CIRCUIT COURT]: Can, can you go, hold on, [coram nobis counsel]. [Trial counsel], you told, you testified that you told [Sanmartin Prado], the question to you was, what consequences did you advise him of and what you said to [Sanmartin] Prado was that it was a deportable offense, he could be deported and then what did you say, if the immigration officials?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: If the Federal government chooses to exercise their right to deport him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [CIRCUIT COURT]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Or to, to initiate deportation proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Nowhere in that colloquy [during the January 6, 2011 proceeding] do you ever tell [ ] Sanmartin Prado that he's automatically deportable as a result of the conviction in this case, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: [D]id you ever tell [ ] Sanmartin Prado that the conviction would make him automatically deportable under all circumstances?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I don't know if I used the term automatic but I certainly said it was a deportable offense, so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Trial counsel also testified that he met with Sanmartin Prado's wife and that his \"notes d[id] not reflect that we discussed the possible immigration consequences[,] but I can't believe I would not have discussed those with her[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked trial counsel what he meant \"by deportation is a moving target[,]\" to which trial counsel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Especially back in 2009, 2010 even, early into 2011, I found that there was sort of some arbitrary enforcement of the Federal immigration laws. Some people were getting deported, other people were not. Some people were getting deportation orders. So, you know, I guess, in hindsight, you know, I shouldn't have used the term moving target but I think it was clear to [Sanmartin Prado] and I think I made it pretty clear on the record that this was deportable and he and I discussed that and that that was a very real collateral consequence to the plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   When asked by the prosecutor \"at no time did you tell [Sanmartin] Prado you will not be deported as a result of this case[,]\" trial counsel emphatically testified: \"I absolutely, positively did not tell him you, because if I, if that, if I were that certain, I would have not had the discussion at all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Sanmartin Prado testified on his own behalf through the assistance of a Spanish-language interpreter. According to Sanmartin Prado, he saw trial counsel at the jail twice without the assistance of an interpreter. Coram nobis counsel asked about Sanmartin Prado's discussions with trial counsel about immigration consequences and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Did you know when you went to Court that if you were found guilty, you would be deported to your home country?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. Did anybody tell you that could happen, either [trial counsel] or anybody else, before you went to Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. When did you first find out that you were subject to, or you were going to be deported as a result of your case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: About maybe six months after I got out from jail, they came to the house, nobody told me anything, [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] came to the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, if you would have known that you would be deported by being convicted, would you have not asked for a trial or\n   would you have asked for a trial, in your case, an actual trial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On cross-examination, Sanmartin Prado testified that trial counsel never advised him that he could be deported, but acknowledged that he and trial counsel had discussed his immigration status:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Sir, it's your testimony that [trial counsel] never told you that you could be deported because of this crime?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: He never told me, maybe he told me in other words that I did not understand, but he never told me about deportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Did [trial counsel] ask you regarding your immigration status? ... Sir, isn't it true that [trial counsel] asked you if you were a citizen of this country?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: He asked me but I said no I was a resident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. So did you talk about your green card and your status in this country?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: So you admit that [trial counsel] did have conversations regarding your immigration status?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes. Because the first time he saw me, he asked me if I was a resident and I told him yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   And, in response to the prosecutor's question \"Did [trial counsel] ever tell you you would not be deported as a result of this crime or he never talked to you about deportation?[,]\" Sanmartin Prado stated: \"He never talked about that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On June 12, 2014, the coram nobis court issued a Memorandum and Order denying the petition. In relevant part, the circuit court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [A]t the coram nobis hearing, [ ] trial counsel testified, and the Court finds as a fact, that he met with [Sanmartin Prado] at the Baltimore County Detention Center before trial and explained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that this was a \"deportable offense\" and [Sanmartin Prado] \"could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\" and it was \"possible\" that [Sanmartin Prado] would be deported. [Sanmartin Prado] testified that trial counsel never told him he \"would be deported[,]\" but acknowledged that he did have conversations with trial counsel regarding his immigration status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The circuit court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Upon consideration of the evidence presented to this Court as well as the record of the plea hearing, the Court finds that [Sanmartin Prado] has not rebutted the presumption that he \"intelligently and knowingly\" failed to raise the allegation on appeal and [Sanmartin Prado] has made no showing that special circumstances exist for his failure to make the allegation of error on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On July 9, 2014, Sanmartin Prado filed a notice of appeal.

According to the State, under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Denisyuk,\n   </em>\n   a lawyer must advise his or her client of whether there is a \"risk of deportation\" and \"that deportation is a likely consequence of [a] guilty plea.\" (Citations omitted). The State argues that trial counsel's advice and representation to Sanmartin Prado \"fully comported\" with\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Denisyuk\n   </em>\n   because trial counsel advised Sanmartin Prado that second-degree child abuse was a deportable offense and that there could and probably would be immigration consequences if he were convicted of the offense. The State asserts that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Denisyuk,\n   </em>\n   trial counsel in this case neither failed altogether\n   to advise Sanmartin Prado concerning immigration consequences, nor misadvised Sanmartin Prado about the immigration consequences. The State maintains that the holding of the Court of Special Appeals sets a new standard, and is inconsistent with other jurisdictions' holdings in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Padilla,\n   </em>\n   and with the standard set forth in Maryland Rule 4-242(f) (Collateral Consequences of a Plea of Guilty, Conditional Plea of Guilty, or Plea of Nolo Contendere).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Sanmartin Prado responds that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that trial counsel failed to properly advise him in open court of the immigration consequences of a conviction in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Denisyuk.\n   </em>\n   According to Sanmartin Prado, the Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that proper advisement of immigration consequences consists of defense counsel advising a defendant that he or she is \"deportable,\" without any qualification, such as \"if the federal government cho[o]se[s] to initiate deportation proceedings,\" \"possibly deportable,\" or similar qualifiers. Sanmartin Prado argues that trial counsel's advisement was deficient because trial counsel neither advised that deportation was mandatory and automatic nor advised \"without equivocation\" that Sanmartin Prado was deportable. Sanmartin Prado asserts that trial counsel misadvised him of the immigration consequences of a conviction by equivocating and stating that he \"could be deportable or probably would be deportable and that immigration is a moving target[.]\" Sanmartin Prado maintains that trial counsel's advisements led him to believe that there was a possibility that there would be no immigration consequences for a conviction. Sanmartin Prado also contends that the advisements in this case violated Maryland Rule 4-242, which Sanmartin Prado argues requires that an advisement of immigration consequences of a guilty plea be made on the record in open court. In so contending, Sanmartin Prado\n   points out that, in this case, proceeding by way of a not guilty plea upon an agreed statement of facts was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In a reply brief, the State contends that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   did not require trial counsel to advise Sanmartin Prado in an unequivocal\n   statement that he would be deported if convicted. The State also takes the position that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Denisyuk,\n   </em>\n   Sanmartin Prado did not enter and was not convicted based upon a guilty plea. Stated otherwise, the State theorizes that the not guilty agreed statement of facts arrangement was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   We review without deference a trial court's resolution of questions of law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Padilla's counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute, which addresses not some broad classification of crimes but specifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses.

According to our Supreme Court, advice that a defendant \"could\" or \"might\" be deported is also inadequate, as such advice is incomplete\n   and therefore inaccurate because stating that a person 'may' be subject to deportation implies there is some chance, potentially a good chance, that the person will not be deported.

In the immigration context, prosecutorial discretion should apply not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary enforcement decisions, including deciding whether to settle or dismiss a case and whether to grant deferred action or a stay of removal[.] Deportation is not mandatory for a felony conviction. Rather, certain aliens, including those convicted of a felony, are generally prioritized\n   for removal unless, based on the totality of the circumstances, the alien should not be an enforcement priority. Relevant factors include an alien's length of time in the United States and family or community ties in the United States.\n   <strong>\n    Because deportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense,\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    does not require an attorney to advise an alien client that deportation is an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, including a controlled substance offense.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   (Bolding added) (citations, brackets, ellipses, footnotes, italics, and most internal quotation marks omitted).

To be sure, Sanmartin Prado did not enter, and was not convicted based on, a guilty plea, a conditional plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, as was the circumstance in\n   <em>\n    Padilla, Denisyuk,\n   </em>\n   and the other cases discussed above. Rather, Sanmartin Prado entered into a plea agreement under which he would proceed by way of a not guilty agreed statement of facts on the charge of second-degree child abuse, and, \"[u]pon a finding of guilt,\" the State would recommend a sentence of ten years' imprisonment with all but one year suspended, and the State would nol pros the remaining\n   charges for first-degree child abuse causing severe physical injury and second-degree assault. The State's recitation of the plea agreement made it clear that both parties expected that Sanmartin Prado would be convicted of second-degree child abuse based on the agreed statement of facts. During the waiver colloquy conducted by trial counsel, trial counsel explained that, by proceeding with a not guilty agreed statement of facts, Sanmartin Prado would be waiving his right to a jury trial as well as his right to \"a Court trial or a bench trial [,]\" \"a formal contested\n   trial in front of a judge.\" Sanmartin Prado affirmatively responded that he understood. Sanmartin Prado also affirmatively responded that he understood that he was waiving his right for trial counsel \"to present a formal defense[.]\" Sanmartin Prado did not reserve the right to appeal any matter associated with the not guilty agreed statement of facts plea.

As the Court of Appeals of Missouri remarked: \"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   does not require that counsel use specific words to communicate to a defendant the consequences of entering a guilty plea.

Trial counsel fully complied with the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   by advising Sanmartin\n   Prado, prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding, that \"this was a 'deportable offense' and [Sanmartin Prado] 'could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,' and it was 'possible' that [Sanmartin Prado] would be deported.\" Trial counsel did not fail to advise Sanmartin Prado altogether about the risk of deportation nor did trial counsel provide misadvice or false assurances along the lines of \"you will not be deported\";\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   trial counsel in this case avoided providing no or incorrect advice. To be certain, advising Sanmartin Prado that the offense was \"deportable\" is not the equivalent of advising him that he will be automatically deported. But, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   does not require the use of specific magic words when advising a client of the risk of deportation, provided such advice is correct advice, nor does\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   require that defense counsel advise a noncitizen client that a conviction for a deportable offense will absolutely, with certainty,\n   or automatically, result in deportation. Importantly, the applicable immigration statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not state that the offenses are \"automatically deportable\" or that a noncitizen shall be \"automatically deported\"; rather, the statute provides that convictions for the offenses render noncitizens \"deportable.\" Thus, contrary to Sanmartin Prado's contention, neither\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   nor the statute requires that trial counsel advise that deportation was automatic or mandatory. And, in any event, that an offense is \"deportable\" does not mean that deportation is an absolute certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   As discussed above, in\n   <em>\n    Shata,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342201\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/364/63/\">\n    868 N.W.2d at 108-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court of Wisconsin explained why \"deportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense,\" stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   [W]hether immigration personnel would necessarily take all the steps needed to institute and carry out an alien's actual deportation is not an absolute certainty[.] For example, prosecutorial discretion and the current administration's immigration policies provide possible avenues for deportable aliens to avoid deportation. In fact, the executive branch has essentially unreviewable prosecutorial discretion with respect to commencing deportation proceedings, adjudicating cases, and executing removal orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   Indeed, the secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") recently explained that the DHS, which is responsible for enforcing the nation's immigration laws, must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law. Due to limited resources, DHS cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States. DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of an enforcement proceeding. In the immigration context, prosecutorial discretion should apply not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary enforcement decisions, including deciding whether to settle or dismiss a case and whether to grant deferred action or a stay of removal[.] Deportation is not mandatory for a felony conviction. Rather, certain\n   aliens, including those convicted of a felony, are generally prioritized for removal unless, based on the totality of the circumstances, the alien should not be an enforcement priority. Relevant factors include an alien's length of time in the United States and family or community ties in the United States.\n   <strong>\n    Because deportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense,\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    does not require an attorney to advise an alien client that deportation\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    is an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, including a controlled substance offense.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   (Emphasis added) (citations, brackets, ellipses, footnotes, and most internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the process that must occur between a defendant's conviction for a deportable offense and actual deportation makes it less than certain or absolute that deportation will actually result even if the defendant is convicted of a deportable offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Aside from the circumstance that deportation is not an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, from a practical standpoint, it would be unreasonable to require defense counsel, without qualification, to advise noncitizen clients about the risk of deportation such that defense counsel is placed in the position of having to provide detailed and specific information about the risk of deportation and to essentially become an immigration law specialist. Even in\n   <em>\n    Padilla,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the Supreme Court recognized that immigration law is a \"complex\" area of law and that there will \"undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain.\" Requiring defense counsel, who \"may not be well versed in\" immigration law,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   to become legal experts concerning immigration law places too high a burden on defense counsel, one that surely exceeds the \"prevailing professional norms[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, it may not always be easy to tell whether a particular immigration statute is succinct, clear, and explicit. Indeed, even for those who are trained in immigration law, it may be difficult to ascertain whether a particular crime would be considered as a\n   crime involving moral turpitude or as an aggravated felony. In short, it is unreasonable to require that defense counsel investigate and determine that the Federal government will, with certainty, actually deport a particular noncitizen defendant upon conviction of a deportable offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   As to Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1), we conclude that trial counsel's advice fully complied with the Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   Before the court accepts a plea of guilty, a conditional plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, the court, the State's Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof shall advise the defendant [ ]\n   <strong>\n    that by entering the plea, if the defendant is not a United States citizen, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship\n   </strong>\n   [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   (Emphasis added). Here, trial counsel's advice fully comported with Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1), and indeed, by including the advisement that the offense of conviction was a deportable offense and that Sanmartin Prado could be deported if the Federal government chose to proceed, exceeded the requirements of the Rule. Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) requires only that a defendant be advised that as a result of a guilty plea, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship. Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) does not require that any specific advice be given regarding the probability or certainty of deportation or\n   that any specific information be given regarding any immigration law that may be applicable to a particular defendant's case. In sum, Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) requires only that a noncitizen defendant be alerted that he or she may face immigration consequences. The coram nobis court's findings support the conclusion that trial counsel complied with\n   Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1). The coram nobis court specifically found that trial counsel advised Sanmartin Prado that the offense of conviction was a deportable offense and that he could be deported. Additionally, the record reflects that at the January 6, 2011 proceeding, following a colloquy with Sanmartin Prado concerning his immigration status, trial counsel stated: \"And you understand that I'm not making any promises and the Judge is not making any promises about what the federal government could possibly do in the future with respect to reviewing this conviction.\" Sanmartin Prado stated that he understood. Together, the advisements prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding and during the proceeding, indicate that Sanmartin Prado was made aware that he \"may face additional [immigration] consequences[.]\" In other words, trial counsel satisfied Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) in all its dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   As a related matter, we note that, by its plain language, contrary to Sanmartin Prado's assertion, Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) does not explicitly require that an advisement about additional immigration consequences must be made on the record at a plea proceeding. In distinct contrast, both Maryland Rule 4-242(c) (Plea of guilty) and Maryland Rule 4-242(e) (Plea of nolo contendere) expressly require that an \"examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State's Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination therefor\" occur so that the trial court can determine and announce on the record that the defendant is pleading voluntarily with the understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. Each of those subsections further states that, \"before accepting the plea, the court shall comply with section (f) of this Rule.\" Neither Maryland Rule 4-242(c) or (e) provide, however, that compliance with Maryland Rule 4-242(f) can only be achieved by an on-the-record examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   In any event, in this case, trial counsel advised Sanmartin Prado of the immigration consequences for a conviction for second-degree child abuse both on and off the record in a manner that satisfied Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1). The record of the January 6, 2011 proceeding demonstrates that trial\n   counsel confirmed with Sanmartin Prado, on the record, that Sanmartin Prado was a legal permanent resident,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   a noncitizen, and that the two had engaged in discussions about Sanmartin Prado's immigration status. Sanmartin Prado also confirmed that he understood that neither trial counsel nor the circuit court were making any promises concerning what the Federal government would do in the future, as to immigration consequences, if Sanmartin Prado were convicted. Again, following the coram nobis hearing, the circuit court found \"as a fact\" that trial counsel met with Sanmartin Prado at the detention center prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding, and that, at that time, trial counsel \"explained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that this was a 'deportable offense' and [Sanmartin Prado] 'could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings[.]' \" Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that trial counsel's advisements satisfied Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In sum, we hold that trial counsel did not perform in a constitutionally deficient manner in advising Sanmartin Prado as to\n   the immigration consequences attendant to a conviction for second-degree child abuse in the manner in which he did. Sanmartin Prado has failed to satisfy the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   which requires that a \"defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713263\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/428/386/#p399\">\n    428 Md. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713263\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/428/386/#p399\">\n    51 A.3d at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
