The Appellant seeks to collect benefits under the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act, Md. Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 -9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article (\"LE\") that would have been due to her father, Carville Hollingsworth (\"Hollingsworth\"), had he not died of causes unrelated to the accidental injury he sustained in the course of his employment. Under LE \u00a7 9-632, an award of benefits by the Workers' Compensation Commission survives upon the death of an injured employee. On the other hand, under LE \u00a7 9-640, an award of benefits survives upon the death of an injured employee only up to $45,000.00. Appellant argues that LE \u00a7 9-632 applies and Appellees contend that LE \u00a7 9-640 governs. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with Appellees that LE \u00a7 9-640 controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are undisputed. In 2010, Hollingsworth sustained an accidental injury in the course of his employment with Appellee. The body parts involved in the 2010 injury included Hollingsworth's neck, right shoulder, back, and right hand. In November 2013, the Commission issued an award of compensation after determining that, as\n   the result of the combined effects of the accidental injury and his preexisting conditions, Hollingsworth was permanently\n   totally disabled. The Commission found that Hollingsworth had a 65% permanent disability due to the 2010 accidental injury. The Commission then found that the balance of his permanent disability, 35%, was due to his preexisting conditions, for which the Subsequent Injury Fund was responsible for paying compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with these findings, the Commission directed the Appellees to pay Hollingsworth compensation at the rate of $798.00 weekly beginning February 7, 2013, not to exceed the sum of $345,534.00 allowable under the \"Other cases\" provision of the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act, LE \u00a7 9-627(k). The Commission also ordered the Subsequent Injury Fund to begin making payments to Hollingsworth at the end of the compensation to be paid by Appellees. The Commission ruled that these payments by the Fund would be made for as long as Hollingsworth continued to be permanently totally disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hollingsworth died in July 2014 from causes unrelated to the accidental injury. Up to the time of his death, Appellees made compensation payments pursuant to the Commission's award amounting to $52,166.54. Subsequently, the Appellant filed issues with the Commission seeking continued payment of the benefits provided in the November 2013 award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following an October 2014 hearing, the Commission issued an order in which it determined that Appellees were not obligated to make further payments under the award of compensation to Appellant because LE \u00a7 9-640 caps the survival of benefits at $45,000.00 and Appellees had already paid more than this amount to Hollingsworth at the time of his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant petitioned for judicial review of the Commission's order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court denied Appellant's motion and granted Appellees' motion, thereby affirming the Commission's ruling. Appellant\n   then appealed the Circuit Court's decision to the Court of Special Appeals and filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before the intermediate appellate court's consideration of this case, we exercised our bypass jurisdiction and granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   under Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to consider the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Does a workers' compensation award payable by an employer and insurer for the degree of permanent disability which resulted from an accidental injury survive the death of the injured worker under \u00a7 9-632 of the Labor and Employment Article, so that it is payable to his dependents, in a case where he was found to have additional disability due to preexisting conditions which caused him to be permanently totally disabled?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We hold that LE \u00a7 9-640 governs survival of benefits where a claimant is found to be permanently totally disabled irrespective of whether the claimant's permanent total disability is due solely to accidental injury or a combination of accidental injury and preexisting conditions. Because LE \u00a7 9-632 does not apply, we answer no to the question presented and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In an appeal from judicial review of an agency action, we review the agency's decision directly, not the decision of the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Hranicka v.

Part IV of subtitle 6 encompasses \u00a7 9-625 through \u00a7 9-634. Section 9-625 establishes the scope of Part IV and provides that \"[a] covered employee who is\n   <strong>\n    permanently partially disabled\n   </strong>\n   due to an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease shall be paid compensation in accordance with this Part IV of this subtitle.\" LE \u00a7 9-625 (emphasis added). Accordingly, under the plain language of LE \u00a7 9-625, when an employee is determined to be permanently partially disabled, Part IV governs the payment of workers' compensation benefits. The provision governing survival benefits within Part IV-and the provision Appellant argues applies to this case-is \u00a7 9-632. Under this section, \"[i]f\n   a covered employee dies from a cause that is not compensable under this title, the right to compensation that is payable under this Part IV of this subtitle and unpaid on the date of death survives in accordance with this section.\" LE \u00a7 9-632(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In contrast, Part V of subtitle 6 encompasses \u00a7 9-635 through \u00a7 9-642. Section 9-635 delineates the scope of Part V stating, \"[a] covered employee who is\n   <strong>\n    permanently totally disabled\n   </strong>\n   due to an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease shall be paid compensation in accordance with this Part V of this subtitle.\" LE \u00a7 9-635 (emphasis added). Thus, the plain language of LE \u00a7 9-635 dictates that when an employee is found to be permanently totally disabled, Part V governs the payment of benefits. The provision governing survival of benefits within Part V-and the provision Appellees contend applies to this case-is \u00a7 9-640. This provision states in pertinent part: \"If a covered employee dies from a cause that is not compensable under this title, the right to compensation that is payable under this Part V of this subtitle\n   and unpaid on the date of death survives in accordance with this section to the extent of $45,000....\" LE \u00a7 9-640(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Commission explicitly found that Hollingsworth was permanently totally disabled in its November 2013 award of compensation. In answering \"[w]hat proportion of the employee's alleged disability is due to the alleged injury, and what proportion thereof, is due to the previous permanent impairment,\" the Commission stated: \"Permanently totally disabled. 65% is due to the April 21, 2010 accidental injury (neck, right shoulder, back, and right hand), balance thereof is due to pre-existing conditions.\" As part of this finding, it ordered Appellees to \"pay unto the above-named claimant [Hollingsworth], compensation for permanent total disability.\" Because Part V governs the payment of benefits when an employee is found to be permanently totally disabled, \u00a7 9-640 -the provision governing survival of benefits in Part V-applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant endeavors to avoid the clear language of the statute by claiming that the Commission's determination that Hollingsworth had a 65% permanent disability due to the accidental injury is a finding of permanent partial disability. Appellant maintains that the Commission's permanent total disability finding is the result of adding Hollingsworth's 65% disability due to accidental injury to the proportion of disability attributable to Hollingsworth's preexisting conditions. In essence, Appellant considers a permanent total disability to be a disability that is attributable solely to an accidental injury. By characterizing the Commission's finding as a permanent partial disability determination, Appellant seeks to shift Hollingsworth from Part V of Subtitle 6 of the Worker's Compensation Act (permanent total disability) to Part IV (permanent partial disability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellant's argument fails, though, because permanent total disability is a separate and unique determination, not dependent upon the numerical percentage of a claimant's partial impairment. That the Commission apportioned Hollingsworth's permanent total disability between the accidental injury\n   and his preexisting condition does not convert the Commission's permanent total disability finding into a permanent partial disability determination. A finding of permanent total disability is distinct from a finding of permanent partial disability because permanent total disability means the claimant is incapable of working.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mureddu v.

The intermediate appellate court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   supports Appellees' argument that Part V governs all permanent total disability claims, including those where a permanent total disability exists due to the combined\n   effect of an accidental injury and an employee's preexisting conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, the statutory language of LE \u00a7 9-640 reflects that the General Assembly did not consider there to be a distinction between permanent total disability from a single accidental injury and permanent total disability from an accidental injury combined with preexisting conditions.

LE \u00a7 9-640(a) (\"This section does not apply to compensation paid under Title 10, Subtitle 2 [Subsequent Injury Fund] of this [Labor &amp; Employment] article.\"). The Subsequent Injury Fund is only liable for payment of benefits under a permanent total disability finding if the permanent total disability is apportioned between an employer and the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7 9-802(b) (detailing when covered employee is entitled to compensation from the Subsequent Injury Fund);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Code of Md.

If we were to accept Appellant's argument that \u00a7 9-632 applies when a claimant's permanent total disability is from an accidental injury combined with preexisting conditions, subsection (a) of \u00a7 9-640 would be rendered nugatory.

Yet the Workers' Compensation Commission has long recognized that the General Assembly designed a separate statutory scheme for permanent total disability claims. Pursuant to the hearing procedures that the Workers' Compensation Commission has adopted in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\"COMAR\"), a claimant must \"[s]pecifically plead permanent total disability.\" COMAR \u00a7 14.09.03.02D(3). The regulations further stipulate that \"[a] claimant alleging permanent disability shall file with the Commission an Issues Form that: (1) [e]xplicitly claims permanent partial\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   permanent total disability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024904\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/673/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14.09.09.02A (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellant's Other Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellant asserts that the November 2013 award of compensation ordered Appellees to pay benefits pursuant to the \"Other Cases\" provision in LE \u00a7 9-627 and that because this provision is part of the permanent partial disability provisions in Part IV, LE \u00a7 9-632 applies. This argument mischaracterizes the Workers' Compensation Commission's award-the award states that benefits shall not \"exceed the sum of $345,534.00 allowable under 'Other Cases.' \" Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Subsequent Injury Fund v. Kraus\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the method of calculating an employer's liability when there is a permanent total disability finding apportioning liability between the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund is simply \"by reference\" to the \"Other Cases\" provision in the permanent partial disability section of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    301 Md. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    482 A.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (\"The assumption does not lead to the conclusion that the employer's contribution cannot be calculated\n   <strong>\n    by reference\n   </strong>\n   to the permanent partial disability sections or that employer and Fund payments must be concurrent.\") (emphasis added). As Appellees correctly point out, the Commission's reference to the \"Other Cases\" provision in LE \u00a7 9-627 is not a directive that they pay permanent partial disability benefits. Rather, the Commission's longstanding \"practice\" of \"refer[ring] to the statutory provisions governing the\n   amount of award in permanent partial disability cases\" is merely a means by which the Commission calculates benefits owed by an employer when there is a finding of permanent total disability where the Subsequent Injury Fund is also liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    482 A.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kraus,\n   </em>\n   the Court considered a dispute between an employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund regarding the allocation of payments under a permanent total disability award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    482 A.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission in that case found that a Baltimore City firefighter was permanently totally disabled and that 70% of the firefighter's disability was attributable to occupational disease and 30% to a preexisting condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We concluded that the Commission was correct in referring to the permanent partial disability provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act to calculate the City's liability even though the firefighter was permanently totally disabled because \"the percentage of disability must be converted into a dollar amount in order to determine how much of the total award is payable by the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1977770\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/301/111/#p122\">\n    482 A.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Kraus\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the notion, as Appellant suggests, that an employer's liability in cases where the Subsequent Injury Fund\n   is also liable is to be governed by the permanent partial disability provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Instead, a fair reading of\n   <em>\n    Kraus\n   </em>\n   indicates that the opinion stands for the limited principle that an employer's liability in such a case is to be calculated by referring to the applicable permanent partial disability provision to determine how much of the total award is payable by an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant also relies on the following language from\n   <em>\n    Anchor Motor Freight v. Subsequent Injury Fund\n   </em>\n   to support her claim that \u00a7 9-632 applies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [I]t is reasonable for the statute to hold the employer liable for the full effects of the compensable injury notwithstanding the fact that a previous impairment existed at the time of the subsequent accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1884506\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/278/320/#p328\">\n    278 Md. 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%20505\">\n    363 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). Appellant asserts that if \u00a7 9-640 applies, the employer and insurer would be relieved\n   of their responsibility to pay for the full effects of the compensable injury. Appellant, however, takes this language from\n   <em>\n    Anchor Motor Freight\n   </em>\n   out of context without analyzing the circumstances under which the award in that case was made. In that case, the employer proffered that a claimant who was previously found to be permanently partially disabled as a result of the combination of an accidental injury and a preexisting condition could not later be found permanently totally disabled as a result of the worsening of the condition from the accidental injury alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 327,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%20505\">\n    363 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected this argument and held that an employer is liable for permanent total payments, even if the employee had a preexisting impairment, if the compensable injury is sufficient to cause the employee to be permanently totally disabled initially, or as a result of a subsequent worsening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 328-29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%20505\">\n    363 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike this case, which concerns an employee who was permanently totally disabled due to accidental injury and preexisting conditions,\n   <em>\n    Anchor Motor Freight\n   </em>\n   addressed an employer's liability when the claimant was permanently totally disabled as a result of the accidental injury alone. Appellant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Anchor Motor Freight\n   </em>\n   is therefore misplaced because she attempts to divorce the opinion's language from the context in which that language was used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Appellant points to\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v.

In\n   <em>\n    McKenzie,\n   </em>\n   a claimant was permanently totally disabled with 65% of the employee's disability attributable to accidental injury and 35% due to preexisting conditions-the exact apportionment in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    532 A.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission ordered the employer and insurer in\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   to pay benefits at the permanent partial disability rate, but ordered the Subsequent Injury Fund to pay compensation at the permanent total disability rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We rejected that disparity because \"[t]he instant case is one of compensation for permanent total disability and logically the rate of payment should be that applicable to permanent total\n   disability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    532 A.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In conclusively stating that the award was one for permanent total disability, we opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The issue in this permanent, total disability, subsequent injury, workers' compensation case is the rate at which the compensation apportioned to the employer is paid.\n   <strong>\n    Although the total amount of compensation payable by the employer is apportioned as if the injury were a permanent partial one, we shall hold ... that periodic payments of the amount so apportioned\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    are to be paid at the rate at which permanent total disability compensation is paid.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    at 55-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071814\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/54/\">\n    532 A.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We thus agree with Appellees' contention that, \"[f]or the Appellants to suggest that the\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   case somehow supports their position turns the holding in\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   on its head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our reasoning in this case can be aptly summarized by the Workers' Compensation Commissioner's statement at the October 2014 hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]here is absolutely no support in the law, in the case law or in the statute, that says when there is a death of the claimant before the [Subsequent Injury Fund] starts paying that the permanent total [disability] finding simply evaporates....
