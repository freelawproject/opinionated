We also consider whether, in affirming the judgment of the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals applied the appropriate standard of review to the circuit court's factual findings and legal conclusions. For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 6:03 p.m. on May 23, 2013, Deputy First Class Chad Atkins (\"Deputy Atkins\") of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office, was patrolling Worthington Boulevard in an unmarked police vehicle when he observed a speeding vehicle being driven by Petitioner. As a result, Deputy Atkins, a certified radar and laser operator, activated his radar equipment and determined that the vehicle was traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour zone. Deputy Atkins subsequently stopped Petitioner for the traffic violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Deputy Atkins approached the passenger side of Petitioner's vehicle, subsequent to Petitioner rolling down the window. Petitioner was the sole occupant. During the suppression hearing, Deputy\n   Atkins testified that upon initial contact with Petitioner, he detected the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. He further testified that he could not recall whether his head crossed the window's threshold while speaking with Petitioner. Deputy Atkins was familiar with the smell of marijuana, having received over one hundred hours of police training in controlled dangerous substances-including the identification of marijuana-and completing approximately one hundred drug-related arrests. Deputy Atkins also testified that the weather was windy and the odor of marijuana \"quickly dissipated.\" Approximately two to three minutes after Deputy Atkins initiated the stop, he returned to his vehicle and requested a nearby K-9 dog unit. Corporal Eyler\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arrived approximately fifteen minutes later. Thereafter, Deputy Atkins returned to Petitioner's vehicle, and requested that he step out. While Deputy Atkins and Petitioner stood behind Petitioner's vehicle, Corporal Eyler began the K-9 dog scan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While Corporal Eyler conducted the scan, Deputy Atkins informed Petitioner that he detected the odor of marijuana emanating from his vehicle. Petitioner admitted that there was pipe and a small amount of marijuana in the center console. Shortly thereafter, Corporal Eyler informed Deputy Atkins of a positive alert from Petitioner's vehicle. A search of the vehicle by Deputy Atkins revealed a film canister containing 1.6 grams of marijuana, as well as a smoking device containing burnt marijuana residue in the center console. Petitioner was placed under arrest and later released with a criminal citation. Petitioner subsequently moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle, asserting that Deputy Atkins conducted an unconstitutional search when he inserted his head into the passenger window and detected the odor of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Suppression Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner's suppression hearing was held before the circuit court on January 6, 2014. Deputy Atkins testified on behalf of the State regarding his initial contact with Petitioner. On cross-examination, defense counsel sought clarification regarding the moment Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana. The cross-examination proceeded, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So when you stopped him, you got out of your car, did you smell marijuana?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: Yes, on the initial contact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I said when you got out of your car did you smell marijuana?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: You mean before I went up to his car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah.

Did you perform a sniff of his car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: Did, what do you mean by sniff?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Like a dog. I'm saying did you specifically examine his car for, for the smell of marijuana?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: You mean did I walk around the car and just sniff at, at his car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand the answer may be no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Ah, so the point at which you, you allege you smelled marijuana was when you kind of\n   leaned in to get his, get his license and registration?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: If you call it leaning, it's when he rolled down his window and I made con-when I was speaking with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you recall how you, how you positioned yourself when you were speaking with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: Like I, I, I don't know how to explain it 'cause I do it on every single stop that I have.

No-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Where the, where the pane-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: -because sometimes-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: -would have been-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [STATE'S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Let, let him answer.

Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [DEPUTY ATKINS]: No, I, the, wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Following the parties' agreement regarding the admissibility and authenticity of the DVD traffic stop video, it was played in court. Although the point at which Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was not clear from the video, the court acknowledged that Deputy Atkins' head appeared to cross the window pane into the interior of Petitioner's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defense counsel subsequently moved to suppress the 1.6 grams of marijuana contained in a film canister in the center console of Petitioner's vehicle, arguing that an illegal search occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment when Deputy Atkins inserted his head into the passenger window. Defense counsel further argued that the prolonged detention while awaiting arrival of the K-9 unit also violated the Fourth Amendment. The State countered that the traffic stop escalated to a narcotics investigation the moment Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana, providing, \"at a minimum,\" reasonable articulable suspicion to justify Petitioner's detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After considering the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court rendered the following ruling:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   As this was a warrantless search the burden of course is on the State to show that the stop was reasonable and justified under the [F]ourth [A]mendment because of course as a general rule the [F]ourth [A]mendment prohibits searches and seizures without a warrant except in a certain specific number of [ ] exceptions....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case the [c]ourt finds the following facts. On the date in question Deputy Atkins was on routine patrol in Frederick County, Maryland. While on routine patrol he observed a vehicle being driven by a person who we later discovered to be [Petitioner] that was, appeared to be, to him to be exceeding the posted speed. Deputy Atkins was going in the opposite direction on Worthington Boulevard in Urbana and he did a U-turn and pulled the vehicle over. He approached the vehicle on the passenger side of the vehicle. The window was rolled down. [Petitioner] was in the driver's side, he was the only person in the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Deputy Atkins asked for his of course license and registration and during that process his, from the video his head appeared to have intruded somewhat into the window space, into the interior of [Petitioner's] car. The testimony of Deputy Atkins was that he didn't recall whether his head went in the vehicle or not.\n   <em>\n    It was very possible [Deputy Atkins'] head would have broken the [pane] and it was at some point, it was not clear whether it was when his head was inside or when the window was rolled down, he-smelled what he believed based on his training and experience smelled like marijuana.\n   </em>\n   But he also testified that it dissipated rather quickly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on those factors what Deputy Atkins chose to do at that time was to not conclude that there was probable cause to conduct [ ] a search of [Petitioner's] vehicle. Although case law clearly indicates that the test, that the police officer's, trained police officer's smelling of an odor of marijuana can perform the basis of probable cause to do a warrantless search and of course one of the exceptions permitted in the [F]ourth [A]mendment is if the officer has probable cause to search or arrest for an offense committed in his presence, which of course probable cause of a strong odor of marijuana would be evidence, probable cause that [Petitioner] was in possession of marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   But [Deputy Atkins] was not, it wasn't a strong odor so he was not convinced. But it did create an articulable suspicion which was reasonable under the circumstances to detain [Petitioner] for further investigation until a K-9 unit could arrive. That further detention was approximately 15 minutes. I think that was [Deputy Atkins'] testimony on the stand and in reviewing the time frames on the, um, on the video that was very close. I think the, actually got back to the car at like four minutes after the, the stop was initiated and I think the dog came at about, and started the search about 20 minutes after the stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   So that was close. So the question is was that a sufficient basis, a sufficient articulable reason to detain [Petitioner] for that period of time and the [c]ourt does find that is a sufficient articulable justification for the further detention of [Petitioner]. This was not one of the cases where it was just because it was some other reason and that they were trying to justify the stop based on it took a long time to get the tickets written or the information back from the Motor Vehicle Administration. That was not the reason offered by the State. But it was because of the odor of marijuana that [Deputy Atkins] smelled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   And quite frankly the [c]ourt, ah, commends [Deputy Atkins] for not arresting [Petitioner], but to make sure that what he, that there was probable cause before he arrested [him]. Or eventually charged him. I believe the testimony was he charged him on a, um, on a citation and, and never did officially put [Petitioner] into handcuffs. Which\n   again, the [c]ourt finds based on all the circumstances is, was certainly appropriate under this circumstance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Following the denial of his suppression motion, Petitioner pled not guilty to an agreed statement of facts. The court found Petitioner guilty of possession of marijuana, and subsequently sentenced him to thirty days, all suspended, in addition to one year of probation, a $200 fine, and $145 in court costs. Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See Terrance Jamal Grant v. State of Maryland,\n   </em>\n   No. 2742 Sept. Term, 2013,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205822270\">\n    2015 WL 5822270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Md.Ct.Spec.App. July 24, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Court of Special Appeals' Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On appeal, Petitioner averred that the court's indication that when Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was \"not clear,\" reflected an unambiguous explicit factual finding. Therefore, the State failed to satisfy its \"burden to justify the warrantless search and arrest[,]\" and the circuit court erred in denying Petitioner's suppression motion. In contrast, the State argued that the court's statement was ambiguous and not an explicit finding, and therefore, based on the supplemental rules of appellate review, the court may resolve ambiguities and draw inferences from the evidence in favor of the prevailing party, here, the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals adopted the State's argument, concluding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [T]he [circuit] court's statement reflected the ambiguous nature of the evidence. As we have previously explained, we resolve any ambiguity by looking to the officer's testimony that he smelled the marijuana upon 'initial contact.' This can be interpreted to mean that Deputy Atkins detected the tell-tale odor of marijuana before he placed his head in the vehicle's window. If this was the case, and we must interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, then there was no warrantless search of [Petitioner's] vehicle. Although there existed, at that moment, probable cause for Deputy Atkins to arrest [Petitioner] and search the vehicle he did not do so. Instead, he took the extra precaution of calling for a K-9 [dog unit] to respond to the scene to confirm his reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Then he placed [Petitioner] [ ] under arrest and searched the vehicle. Under the totality of the circumstances, the stop and search were reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Grant,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205822270\">\n    2015 WL 5822270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. We thereafter, granted certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The well-established standard of review for motions to suppress is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Our review of a circuit court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment, ordinarily, is limited to the information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the record of the trial. When there is a denial of a motion to suppress, we are further limited to considering facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. Even so, we review legal questions\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   and where, as here, a party has raised a constitutional challenge to a search or seizure, we must make an independent constitutional evaluation by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the unique facts and circumstances of the case. We will not disturb the [circuit] court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

We hold that the circuit court erred in denying Petitioner's suppression motion where the evidence was unclear regarding the timing of Deputy Atkins' detection of the odor of marijuana. In the absence of a finding that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he inserted his head into the passenger window, the State did not satisfy its burden regarding the lawfulness of the search. We explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    A. When Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was dispositive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Resolution of the suppression motion hinged upon a factual determination of when Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana-before or after he inserted his head into the passenger window. This determination was critical to ascertaining whether an unlawful search occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addressing the constitutionality of Deputy Atkins' conduct, we first acknowledge that only the events occurring after the traffic stop are relevant to our Fourth Amendment analysis. Because Deputy Atkins had probable cause to stop and temporarily detain Petitioner's vehicle as a result of a speeding violation, the initial traffic stop was constitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whren v.
