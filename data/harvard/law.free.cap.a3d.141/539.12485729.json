(Appellant) appeals from the dispositional order entered March 17, 2015, after she was adjudicated delinquent of retail theft. Upon review, we vacate the order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The juvenile court summarized the testimony offered at the adjudicatory hearing in this matter as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Stephen McCartney was the first witness to testify. Mr. McCartney testified that on December 21, 2014, he was working as a plain clothes loss prevention agent at Nordstrom Rack store located at 17th and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pa. On that date, Mr. McCartney said that he observed [Appellant], along with another young woman, J.B., enter the store at approximately 3:45 PM. Mr. McCartney identified [Appellant] at the bar of the court. Mr. McCartney explained that he began surveillance of the two young women because\n   they were carrying seemingly empty bags and looking around suspiciously. Mr. McCartney testified that he maintained continuous observation of [Appellant] and [J.B.] once they were in the women's shoe department on the third floor of the store. He explained that [J.B.] selected a pair of blue Ugg boots valued at $159.97[ ] and, approximately five (5) minutes later, they headed for the men's shoe department where [J.B.] sat down and placed one boot into each of the two bags that were carried into the store. Mr. McCartney said he observed [Appellant] hand a black handbag to [J.B.] so a boot could be concealed in it. Mr. McCartney testified that while [Appellant] was carrying a black handbag and [J.B.] carried an empty H &amp; M shopping bag, the women switched bags once the boots were placed in them. Mr. McCartney testified that he was approximately 20 to 25 feet away when he made these observations and he had a complete view of the transaction. Mr. McCartney watched the two women proceed down the elevator to the first floor where [Appellant] left the store through the Chestnut Street exit while [J.B.] left the store through the 17th Street exit passing all of the points of sale without stopping to pay for the merchandise. Mr. McCartney testified that the police were called and both [Appellant and J.B.] were stopped and arrested. The merchandise was returned to the store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The only witness to testify for the defense was [Appellant]. She testified that she was at the Nordstrom Rack store on December 21, 2014 with her friend, [J.B.]. [Appellant] testified that her friend was shopping for boots and she sat down in the men's section to try them on. [Appellant] indicated that [J.B.]'s books were in her black handbag, and it was heavy, so they exchanged bags. [Appellant] said that it was crowded on the first floor and she walked out the Chestnut Street exit when she looked back and realized that [J.B.] was [not] behind her. She testified that she started to call [J.B.'s] cell phone while walking back to the store when security guards came towards her asking for the boot and grabbing the H &amp; M bag. She was then taken back to the detention room and the bag was emptied out. [Appellant] testified that she did not know until that time that [J.B.] put the boot in the bag. [Appellant] further testified that she did [not] see [J.B.] put the boots in the separate bags and she did [not] realize that she carried a boot out of the store in the H &amp; M bag.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Juvenile Court Opinion, 7/7/2015, at 3-5 (citations omitted). Of particular import for purposes of this appeal, Appellant sought to call J.B. as a defense witness at the adjudicatory hearing, but the juvenile court prevented her from doing so out of concern for protecting J.B.'s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. N.T., 3/17/2015, at 17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile court adjudicated Appellant delinquent for retail theft and placed Appellant on probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Appellant presents the following issues for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.

Appellant's Brief at 11. Appellant argues that the juvenile court erred in so doing because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   J.B. was represented by counsel, fully advised of her right against self-incrimination, and wished to testify on Appellant's behalf.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309430\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/134/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Appellant claims that the juvenile court's decision violated her constitutional rights to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in her favor, to a fair and just trial, and to present a defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provide that, in all criminal prosecutions, an accused has a right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" U.S. Const. amend.

And that's what [J.B.'s counsel] is here for, to be 5th Amendment counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: I was not involved in the conversation about the 5th Amendment rights, but I understand from [J.B.'s counsel] that he explained what her rights are, the consequences of testifying here today. She said she still wants to testify, which is why we put the colloquy on the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Sure, she might want to buy a car too but can she? No. You know why? Because she's not 18 yet. She's a juvenile. So just because she wants to testify doesn't mean she gets to testify. And it's pretty clear to the [c]ourt that she has some serious 5th Amendment issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Understood, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Was she ever arrested?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: She was arrested, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: And is that still coming up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [J.B.'s Counsel]: I can tell the [c]ourt that she was-her case was diverted.

What difference does it make what she wants to do? The idea is that I appointed you as her counsel to advise her legally what she should do.

Finally, the juvenile court shall conduct an on-the-record colloquy to ensure that the juvenile is fully aware of both \"the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307698\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/66/341/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the circumstances of this case, the juvenile court offered the following reasoning for its decision to preclude J.B. from waiving her privilege against self-incrimination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In order to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of the witness[ ], counsel was appointed to represent her. Further, the purpose of the in[-]court colloquy was to determine whether the witness understood that she could remain silent pursuant to her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The witness's waiver of her right to remain silent was significant to the [c]ourt because the witness was also facing charges arising from the facts of the instant case. It was clear to the [c]ourt that counsel advised [J.B.] not to testify. Furthermore, [J.B.'s] parents were not present in court and did not participate in the discussion with counsel about their child's waiver of her Fifth Amendment rights. Under [s]ection 6338 of the Juvenile Act, this [c]ourt refused to permit her testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Juvenile Court Opinion, 7/7/2015, at 6-7. Thus, the juvenile court considered many, but not all, of the factors outlined above in precluding J.B. from waiving her Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that a remand is proper in this case because, notwithstanding the juvenile court's representation that an on-the-record colloquy of J.B. occurred, the court did not cite-and the record does not reveal-that such a colloquy was in fact conducted. In the absence of this colloquy, we have little basis upon which to confirm that J.B. was fully aware of both the nature of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the consequences of waiving that right. Moreover, we have no indication of the manner in which her youth, experience, and comprehension impacted her decision, or whether there was any indication that J.B. was coerced or otherwise influenced improperly when making her decision. Given these circumstances (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   no on-the-record-colloquy), we hold that the juvenile court's refusal to permit J.B. to waive her Fifth Amendment right was in error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Appellant is entitled to a\n   new disposition wherein the juvenile court shall perform a proper colloquy with respect to J.B.'s waiver of her Fifth Amendment rights and give full consideration to all of the factors outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Given our disposition above, we need not render a decision on Appellant's second issue. However, in the event that the juvenile court finds on remand that Appellant committed retail theft, we remind the court of its responsibilities pursuant to Section 6341(b) of the Juvenile Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Finding of delinquency.\n   </strong>\n   -If the court finds on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed the acts by reason of which he is alleged to be delinquent it shall enter such finding on the record and shall specify the particular offenses, including the grading and counts thereof which the child is found to have committed.\n   <strong>\n    The court shall then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing, which shall occur not later than 20 days after such finding if the child is in detention or not more than 60 days after such finding if the child is not in detention, to hear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation and to make and file its findings thereon\n   </strong>\n   .... In the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts which constitute a felony shall be sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation. If the court finds that the child is not in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation it shall dismiss the proceeding and discharge the child from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(b) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.
