Troy Robert Allen (\"Petitioner\") was convicted after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County (\"circuit court\") of sexual abuse of a minor household member, \u00a7 3-602(b)(2) of the Md.Code (2002, Repl. Vol. 2012), Criminal Law Article (\"Crim. Law\"), two counts of third degree sex offense, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-307, three counts of second degree assault, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-203, and one count of fourth degree sex offense, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-308(b)(1). Pursuant to Petitioner's Motion for a New Trial, one of the convictions for third degree sex offense was stricken in favor of a finding of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner was sentenced to twenty-five years' imprisonment (all but five years suspended) for sexual abuse of a minor, and twenty-one years' imprisonment (all suspended) for the remaining offenses, to run consecutively. Petitioner was also required to serve five years of supervised probation upon his release, with the condition that he have no unsupervised contact with minors. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the circuit court erroneously prohibited unsupervised contact with his minor son during the probationary period. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion,\n   <em>\n    Troy Robert Allen v. State of Maryland,\n   </em>\n   No. 0617, September Term, 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205885165\">\n    2015 WL 5885165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Md.App. October 7, 2015), held that the condition of probation was \"sufficiently related\" to the \"sexual assault of a child residing in [Petitioner's] household[,]\" and affirmed the judgments of the circuit court. This Court granted a Writ of Certiorari to determine whether the circuit court erred by imposing the no-unsupervised-contact with minors condition. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After dating for several months in 2012, Petitioner and his then-girlfriend (\"Marisa\") began sharing a home in Salisbury, Maryland. At the time Petitioner and Marisa moved in together, Marisa had shared custody of her ten-year-old daughter from a prior relationship (\"B.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2013, Petitioner and Marisa had a son (\"F.\"), who resided in the home along with B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The evidence at trial revealed several instances of B.'s sexual abuse at the hands of Petitioner while B. was a member of his household during 2012-2013:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On one such occasion, B. and Petitioner were sitting on the couches in the living room of their home when B. noticed that Petitioner's penis was protruding from the waistband of his shorts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Petitioner\n   noticed that B. had seen his penis, Petitioner wrote \"[d]id you see it?\" on a piece of paper, which he later crumpled up. On a later occasion, B. was again sitting on a couch in the living room with Petitioner seated next to her, when Petitioner exposed his penis and asked her \"to touch it[.]\" When. B. refused, Petitioner placed the tip of his penis on her left forearm. During both of these incidents, Marisa was not present in the living room, but was elsewhere in the home. B. did not inform Marisa at the time, because she was fearful that Petitioner would become angry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The evidence at trial also revealed that, on two occasions, Petitioner squeezed the nipple area of B.'s chest. During the first incident, Marisa, Petitioner and B. were grocery shopping, and Petitioner and B. were \"horse playing[ ]\" when Petitioner twisted B.'s nipple. B. informed Marisa that \"[Petitioner] just pinched my boob[,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Marisa confronted Petitioner by telling him: \"don't ever touch her there again.\" Petitioner responded that he was sorry, but shortly thereafter told B. that \"he was going to put his thing in [her] thing.\" On the second occasion, B. and Petitioner were alone in the kitchen of the residence and Petitioner \"turned [B.] and then twisted [her] boob.\" Marisa was located elsewhere in the home during this later incident, and B. did not inform her of the abuse at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 1, 2013, Marisa asked Petitioner to leave their shared home in Salisbury, and on August 4, 2013, B. spoke with police regarding the aforementioned abuse. On that same date, Marisa text messaged Petitioner concerning B.'s allegations, and Petitioner responded that \"I will not go down like this, I won't have that label on me when I know it will go away.\" Petitioner further stated that \"he would take his life and that he was leaving town and going to get a bus ticket.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In preparation for Petitioner's sentencing hearing, a psychologist employed with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\"DHMH\") prepared a mental health assessment, and the Department of Parole and Probation prepared a pre-sentence investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The mental health assessment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on a two-and-a-half hour interview with Petitioner, along with the consideration of several documents, a licensed psychologist working with DHMH made several findings regarding Petitioner's account of the instant offense, Petitioner's background, and Petitioner's mental status. The psychologist also performed a structured risk assessment, and rendered conclusions and recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Concerning Petitioner's account of the instant offense, the psychologist noted that Petitioner \"was very guarded and superficial in his discussion and had to be redirected to describe the events.\" According to the assessment, Petitioner stated that the occasions B. had seen his penis were \"inadvertent\" and \"not purposeful.\" Petitioner remarked that \"when he sat on the couch he slouched so that his shorts or pants went low on his hips and that he put his hands in the waistband of his pants.\" Petitioner stated his belief that \"everyone sits like that[,]\" and as a result, B. was able to view the tip of his penis. Petitioner reported that the incident at the grocery\n   store was simply horseplay where he \"was pinching\" and \"accidently got her chest.\" Petitioner reported that he was upset about the charges against him, and opined that \"he does not believe that his crime is a sex offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding Petitioner's background, he reported to the psychologist that \"his sexual fantasies and behavior have always been heterosexual[ ]\" and \"[h]e denied any sexual behavior or fantasies involving men.\" Petitioner reported that, after he graduated high school and moved to North Carolina, he began \" 'talking with girls' via text over the phone.\" According to Petitioner, these girls would send him pictures and he \"got into a porn addiction[,]\" where he would use online dating sites to trade sexually explicit photos with \"freakier girls.\" Petitioner informed the psychologist that he moved to Maryland in an attempt to stop this behavior, but began \"engaging in the ... phone exchanges[ ]\" when \"his relationship with his girlfriend [(Marisa)] worsened.\" The psychologist noted that, in an interview with police, Petitioner acknowledged using an internet chat room to exchange pictures with girls who were 15 and 16 years old. Petitioner stated \"that his exhibitionist behavior and fantasies all involved texts and phone messages, and denied exhibitionism in person.\" According to the psychologist, Petitioner \"normalized his behavior\" and his \"level of insight was poor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Concerning Petitioner's mental status, Petitioner was diagnosed with \"[e]xhibitionist [d]isorder-pre-pubertal child victim\" and \"sexual abuse of a child-perpetrator\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Exhibitionist disorder is diagnosed when an individual obtains recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of genitals to an unsuspecting person and has acted on these urges with a non-consenting person. Through his behavior on the internet and by texting, [Petitioner] gained arousal and sexual satisfaction including ejaculation through sending pictures of himself to others. In the instant case he furthered this behavior by exposing himself to an unsuspecting and non-consenting person, the pre-pubertal victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The risk assessment revealed that Petitioner exhibited a moderate risk of engaging in further acts of sexual violence. Using an actuarial assessment tool for quantifying the risk of sexual violence, the psychologist concluded that Petitioner was in the 78th percentile among adult male sexual offenders, with the 100th percentile being the most likely to reoffend. As a result, Petitioner's \"risk of sexual re-offending, relative to other sex offenders, [was] estimated at being almost twice that of other sex offenders.\" The assessment noted that \"[r]isk factors for re-offending in [Petitioner's] case include his young age, history of repetitive problematic sexual behavior, and his lack of awareness of the potential impact of his behavior on a very young victim.\" The assessment's conclusion remarked that \"[Petitioner] has a history of engaging in sexual behavior with young adolescents[,]\" and \"his lack of caution and inhibition in engaging in sexualized behavior in front of girls under 18 is problematic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The pre-sentence investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The pre-sentence investigation revealed that, as of March 31, 2014, Petitioner also had pending charges in Worcester County, Maryland for sexual abuse of a minor household member, sexual abuse of minor, and two counts of indecent exposure. The Worcester County case involved B. and another ten-year-old female. The pre-sentence investigation recommended that Petitioner be sentenced according to the Maryland sentencing guidelines, and,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia,\n   </em>\n   \"have no contact with the victim or her family,\" and \"have no unsupervised contact with minor females[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The sentencing hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At Petitioner's sentencing hearing, the State of Maryland (\"State\") sought twenty-five years' incarceration (all but eight suspended) for the sexual abuse of a minor, consecutive suspended sentences on all remaining counts, and five years of supervised probation upon Petitioner's release. Among the conditions of probation requested by the State was that Petitioner have no contact with B., and \"[n]o unsupervised contact with minors.\" Petitioner's counsel objected to the no-unsupervised-contact condition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: ... Now, one of the problems is the unsupervised contact with minors....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [H]e has his own son, [F.] Obviously, he needs to see him, should have contact with his son. And I think that the Court, any Court Order would need to be a little more fine line than just no contact with minors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I think it just has to be another adult there is what I'm reading that to mean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: Well, I understand that, but with regard to [F.], there shouldn't be another adult, if it's his son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   There's no reason for it. There's no basis in the law to be around his own son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Well, except for that he has a conviction for child sex abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: I understand that, but-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: And his son's a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: -a parent's right to be with their child is one of the preeminent rights in the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: I agree with you, but it's not an absolute right, and where there has been a child-at this point, he is convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: And he is convicted of sex abuse of a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   So, I don't think the [c]ourt is precluded from imposing a no unsupervised contact with minor-with his own son. I mean, I don't know of any law or constitutional provision that disallows it. I grant you, it's a rarity that Courts shouldn't just go there without any basis. I agree with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [PETITIONER'S COUNSEL]: I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court imposed a sentence of 25 years' incarceration (all but five suspended) for the charge of sexual abuse of a minor. The court imposed five years of supervised probation upon release, with the condition that Petitioner have no unsupervised contact with minors. The court also imposed consecutive suspended sentences of ten years' incarceration for third-degree sex offense, ten years' incarceration for second-degree assault, and one year of incarceration for fourth-degree sex offense. The remaining two convictions for second-degree assault merged for sentencing purposes with the third-degree sex offense, and fourth degree sex offense. Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On appeal, Petitioner argued that, \"to the extent the no unsupervised contact condition relates to [his] interaction with his own infant son, the condition constitutes an illegal sentence that must be vacated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Petitioner, \"there was no evidence presented which would have indicated that [he] presented any danger to either his son or to other children related to him by blood.\" Thus, \"there was no rational basis for the imposition of the no unsupervised contact condition, which ... unreasonably infring[ed] on his fundamental [due process] right to parent his child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, and observed that trial courts have broad discretion in imposing a sentence. (quoting Md. Code (2001, Repl. Vol. 2008), \u00a7 6-221 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"Crim. Proc.\")). According to the Court of Special Appeals, this discretion is limited by the requirement that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   conditions of probation must be reasonable and have a rational basis. They must not be the product of arbitrariness or capriciousness. Moreover, the conditions imposed must be clear, definite and capable of being properly comprehended and understood not only by the individual upon whom they are imposed but by those responsible for their enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Watson v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2240775\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/17/263/#p274\">\n    17 Md.App. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%2026\">\n    301 A.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-32 (1973) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals acknowledged that several federal cases cited by Petitioner indicated that a sentencing court must find evidence which unambiguously shows that the defendant is a danger to his own children before restricting access to them, (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lonjose,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880306,5882383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1292/\">\n    663 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (10th Cir.2011), and further discussing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bear,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266751\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1221/#p1229\">\n    769 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (10th Cir.2014), and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wolf Child,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632395\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/1082/#p1093\">\n    699 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1093 (9th Cir.2012) ). However, the Court remarked that that those cases are not binding in Maryland, and those cases \"are directly at odds with Maryland's approach to limiting the custody and visitation rights of individuals who have previously abused or neglected a child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding Maryland's approach, the Court observed that, under Md. Code (1984, Repl. Vol. 2012), \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article (\"Fam. Law\"), \"an individual who has abused or neglected any child has no right to any unsupervised visitation unless he or she is able to persuade the court that there is no likelihood of further abuse of neglect.\" (emphasis omitted) (footnote omitted). The Court pointed out that \u00a7 9-101 \"applies regardless of whether the child abused or neglected was the child whose custody or visitation is currently in issue.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption No. 12612,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704390\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/353/209/#p234\">\n    353 Md. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704390\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/353/209/#p234\">\n    725 A.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049-50 (1999) ). Thus, according to the Court of Special Appeals, Maryland courts take a default position that a parent who has abused or neglected a child will be denied unsupervised contact with his or her own child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Turning to the no-unsupervised-contact condition, the Court of Special Appeals observed that the condition did not impose an outright ban on contact, just unsupervised contact, and was limited to the five year period of active probation. The Court of Special Appeals also noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [A] condition to the granting of probation which compels a defendant to give up a fundamental or constitutional right is not in and of itself unconstitutional or invalid. [A] court will not strike down conditions of release, even if they implicate fundamental rights, if such conditions are reasonably related to the ends of rehabilitation and protection of the public from recidivism. Such a condition cannot stand [only] if it is not related to the crime of which defendant has\n   been convicted and if it has no reasonable relation to future criminality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Henson v.

The Court concluded that the condition of probation imposed \"was sufficiently related to the crime for which [Petitioner] was convicted,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   sexual assault of a child residing in his household.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The case at bar presents a dispute over the requirement that conditions of probation \"must be reasonable and have a rational connection to the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Petitioner proffers that none of the activities detailed in the mental health assessment-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   addiction to pornography and sending explicit photos via the internet/text message-involved boys of any age, and notes that he only reported sexual fantasies of a heterosexual nature. Petitioner contends that the DHMH psychologist \"was not concerned with his sexualized behavior generally but that she was instead concerned about that behavior in front of girls under the age of eighteen.\" Petitioner similarly highlights that the pre-sentence investigation only recommended that he not have unsupervised contact with minor females, but was silent about contact with his minor son. Accordingly, Petitioner contends that the no-unsupervised-contact condition was not reasonably related to the protection of minors, including F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We disagree. While the reasonableness standard required that the record justify the no-unsupervised-contact condition, Petitioner erroneously contends that the condition could not include his own child, unless the victim of the defendant's abuse was the same gender as his child, and/or was a blood relative of Petitioner. Although some of the cases discussed by Petitioner seem to impose such a requirement, we decline to read such a requirement into Maryland's reasonableness standard. Furthermore, notwithstanding the disparities in gender and blood relation between B. and F., the no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of minors, including F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

We believe the same logic counsels caution in allowing defendant to reside with his own child when he has been convicted of taking indecent liberties with a minor not his child, particularly, as here, when defendant took advantage of the fact that he was residing with the minor victim to facilitate the abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, the victim in the instant case was related to defendant through marriage. To the extent that defendant might feel tempted to sexually abuse a minor child when it and defendant are residing under the same roof, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1343(b2)(4) also serves the purposes of sentencing and probation of rehabilitation by removing defendant from the temptation to repeat his crimes.

In light of the fact that defendant repeatedly molested a child while living in the same household as his wife and mother-in-law, we hold that a restriction prohibiting defendant from residing in a household with any child, regardless of the gender or relationship of defendant to the child, is not unreasonable, or violative of defendant's constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 197-98,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    609 S.E.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The reasonableness standard applied by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   -rejecting a standard where \"[t]he trial court would ... be required to tailor the conditions of a defendant's probation to his [or her] particular form of predatory behavior\"-is most consistent with the nature of parental rights and probation in Maryland.

As noted above, \"probation is considered to be a matter of grace and an act of clemency\" which generally takes the place of a term of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p680\">\n    445 Md. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p680\">\n    128 A.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

This distinction is important because a sentencing judge in Maryland, by imposing probation, is allowing the defendant substantially more liberties than he or she would otherwise enjoy while incarcerated; whereas a judge who imposes supervised release is imposing additional restrictions after incarceration. Accordingly, while heightened scrutiny may apply to a condition of supervised release that infringes upon the fundamental right to parent, there is little rationale for applying this heightened standard where a sentencing judge has allowed the defendant substantially more liberties by placing him or her on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Lastly, as a matter of sound policy, conditions of probation should not be subjected to the \"heightened\" scrutiny called for by Petitioner-requiring a sentencing court to tailor conditions of probation \"to the peculiar sexual desires of a child sex offender[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland, supra.\n   </em>\n   The studies discussed by the State illustrate that sex offenders do not necessarily limit their criminal behavior to one specific \"type\" of victim, and that offenders may abuse both relatives and non-relatives, and both males and females.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levenson et al. and Simons,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   While we do not opine on the frequency with which \"crossover\" occurs, our holding allows the sentencing court, when faced with the protection of minors at the expense of parental rights, to exercise its discretion in furtherance of the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, we adhere to the requirement that \"conditions of probation must be reasonable and have a rational connection to the offense[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p680\">\n    445 Md. at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p680\">\n    128 A.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). However, in doing so, we decline Petitioner's invitation to hold that this standard cannot be satisfied by a condition that restricts the defendant's contact with his children, unless the victim of the defendant's abuse is the same gender as the defendant's children, and/or is a blood relative of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of children and Petitioner's future criminality.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In applying this standard, we believe that the no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of children, including F. Petitioner's focus on the gender of his victim overlooks the fact that B. was the half-sister of F., and that Petitioner took advantage of his living arrangement with B. to commit the sexual abuse for which he was convicted and sentenced. In light of the mental health assessment, which \"gave [the sentencing court] a lot of concern[,]\" there was a deterrent value in preventing the Petitioner from occupying such a position with respect to F. According to that assessment, Petitioner failed to\n   recognize the inappropriate nature of his behavior, and repeatedly attempted to minimize his actions. Regarding the exposure of his penis, Petitioner reported that B. may have inadvertently seen the tip of his penis because he routinely sits on the couch with his hands down the front of his pants. Petitioner opined that \"everyone sits like that.\" Regarding the incidents of grabbing B.'s chest, Petitioner attributed this to \"horsing around.\" In general, Petitioner expressed that he was upset with the charges against him, and revealed that \"he does not believe that his crime was a sex offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The aforementioned evidence indicates that the no-unsupervised-contact-condition was reasonably related to the protection of F. Contrary to Petitioner's arguments in this Court and the Court of Special Appeals, the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by neglecting to tailor the condition to the specific attributes of Petitioner's victim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   by imposing a condition of no-unsupervised-contact with minor females, or all non-blood-related minors. As we noted above, such a requirement would place the sentencing court in the precarious position of trying to delineate \"the peculiar sexual desires of a child sex offender\" where those desires may change and evolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Lastly, assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo,\n   </em>\n   that we did apply a heightened scrutiny standard, the no-unsupervised-contact condition was narrowly tailored in the sense that it prevented only\n   <em>\n    unsupervised\n   </em>\n   contact with F., and only lasted during Petitioner's five year probationary term.
