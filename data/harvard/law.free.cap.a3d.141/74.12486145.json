Today we address whether a court abused its discretion in awarding joint custody in spite of evidence that, to put it mildly, the parents could not communicate and reach shared decisions for their two children. As a related matter-one not addressed explicitly in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   -we consider the propriety of the use of provisions in joint custody awards that grant one parent the authority to make a decision about a matter affecting the child when the parents cannot agree. We call these tie-breaking provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adam Santo (\"Father\") and Grace Santo (\"Mother\") married in 2000 and divorced in 2011. They have two sons, who were eight and five years old, respectively, at the time of the divorce. Following a 2011 order of joint legal custody, the Santos renewed the battle over their children by filing more motions. Custody was modified in 2013 to, among other things, facilitate joint custody through the use of a parenting\n   coordinator. Several other motions are indicative of their ongoing struggle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The precise motion that led to the question we review today was Father's 2014 motion to modify custody. Therein Father sought sole custody of his sons so that, he maintains, \"the children will not remain in a combat zone forever.\" Following a three-day hearing, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied Father's motion and preserved a joint custody arrangement.

The record and the Circuit Court's findings, Father contends, reflect a tale of \"parties [who] have been and remain at war with one another.\" He thus maintains that it was an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court to have granted an award of joint custody to parents whom it knew could not communicate effectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother disagrees, and reads\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   as merely setting forth \"nonexclusive factors\" for a court to apply in a custody dispute.

To use words from Father's brief, no \"robotic recitation that a custody award proposed by a custody court is in the 'child's best interest' serve[s] as a replacement for the serious consideration\" of the\n   facts and circumstances of each case. This is especially so in those cases where a court considers awarding joint legal custody to parents\n   who cannot communicate effectively.

Reading this section of the statute literally, Father avers that Maryland courts have two options-award sole\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   joint custody-but no option to create \"hybrids of the two.\" He also fears that the use of tie-breaking provisions \"has exponentially expanded\" into \"spheres of major importance.\" Finally, Father argues that, as a practical matter, tie-breaking provisions may promote conflict or simply be ineffective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shenk v.

Thus, the court reasoned that \"the children will do best if they see each parent regularly\" and that \"the children need to see each of you and have a close relationship with both [of] you.\" The court's discussion reveals that, in maintaining joint legal custody, it was focused on what was in the children's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court candidly and repeatedly acknowledged that the parents were unable to communicate or cooperate well, but was concerned about the children's need to stay involved with both parents.

That is, FL \u00a7 9-104 states that \"access to medical, dental and educational records concerning the child may not be denied to a parent because the parent does not have physical custody of the child.\" FL \u00a7 9-104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Circuit Court's statement is better understood, in context, as reflecting its concern that Father was \"dictatorial,\" and that his actions deprived Mother of information about her children, information that goes beyond the scope of FL \u00a7 9-104, which simply entitles parents to\n   <em>\n    records. See\n   </em>\n   FL \u00a7 9-104.

The court evidently believed that it was in the children's best interests to \"have a close relationship\" with Mother-as well as with Father. For Mother to have an effective relationship, though, she would need access to information about her children; granting Father sole legal custody would undermine that objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Circuit Court's determination-predicated on its thorough review of the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factors, deliberation over custody award options, sober appreciation of the difficulties before it, and use of strict rules including tie-breaking provisions to account for the parties' inability to communicate-was rational and guided by established principles of Maryland law.

As\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   permits, here, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ordered joint legal custody, notwithstanding evidence of the parties' inability to effectively communicate with each other.

The rationale for joint legal custody being the unusual case where parents are unable to communicate seems obvious; children should not be placed\n   in a contentious environment, between embattled parents, unless there is no other alternative that achieves the goal of serving their best interests. The Majority did not alter\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   to reach the correct result in this case. I fear, however, that in endorsing a trial court's ability to order joint legal custody where the evidence establishes that the parties are unable to communicate effectively and make joint decisions, the Majority did not include the caveat explicitly set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   that such a result is to be the unusual or infrequent case.
