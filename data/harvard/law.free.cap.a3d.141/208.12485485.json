At the conclusion of an investigation, the department is to determine whether child abuse is \"indicated,\" \"ruled out,\" or \"unsubstantiated.\" The department may make a finding of indicated child sexual abuse if, among other things, an individual commits an act of sexual exploitation\n   or molestation against the child while the individual has \"temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of the child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, the Respondent, a martial arts instructor, engaged in sexually explicit communications by email and telephone with a 15-year old student who regularly attended his class. All of this inappropriate behavior occurred outside of class while the instructor and student were in separate locations, usually their respective homes. Petitioner Wicomico County Department of Social Services found that the instructor had engaged in child sexual abuse under the statute. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") concluded that this finding should be reversed because the instructor did not have \"care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of\" the student when she was not in his class and there was no evidence of inappropriate behavior on the instructor's part while the student was in the instructor's presence-a decision that the Circuit Court for Wicomico County and Court of Special Appeals affirmed on judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the record before us, there was substantial evidence to support the decision of the ALJ and the lower courts. The instructor's out-of-class behavior was clearly inappropriate and may have violated some other statute, but it did not constitute child sexual abuse under the current statutory definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Under the statute, \"abuse\" includes \"sexual abuse of a child.\" FL \u00a7 5-701(b)(2). \"Sexual abuse\" is defined, in pertinent part, as \"any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child....\" FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Examples of acts that involve sexual molestation or exploitation of a child, such as human trafficking or rape, follow in the next statutory provision. FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(2). This list is not exhaustive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crispino v.

The Department's regulations elaborate that \"sexual molestation or exploitation\" means \"sexual contact or conduct with a child\" and includes a list of examples. The pertinent regulation provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Sexual Molestation or Exploitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) \"Sexual molestation or exploitation\" means sexual contact or conduct with a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) \"Sexual molestation or exploitation\" includes, but is not limited to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) Exposure, voyeurism, sexual advances, kissing, or fondling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ii) Sexual crime in any degree including rape, sodomy, or prostitution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (iii) Allowing, encouraging, or engaging in obscene or pornographic display, photographing, filming, or depiction of a child in a manner prohibited by law; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (iv) Human trafficking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   COMAR 07.02.07.02B(42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a local department of social services receives a report of child abuse, it (or appropriate law enforcement agency, or both) must investigate. FL \u00a7 5-706(b). Possible civil outcomes of the investigation are: (1) abuse is \"indicated,\" meaning \"a finding that there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur\"; (2) abuse is \"ruled out,\" meaning \"a finding that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did not occur\"; or (3) abuse is \"unsubstantiated,\" meaning \"a finding that there is an insufficient amount of evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out.\" FL \u00a7 5-701(m), (w), (y). The Department's regulations elaborate on the evidence-or lack thereof-that supports each of those findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 07.02.07.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When the local department makes a finding of \"indicated\" or \"unsubstantiated,\" the department must inform the individual alleged to have abused the child of the finding, and the individual may request a contested case hearing under the State Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), Maryland Code, State Government Article (\"SG\"), \u00a7 10-201\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FL \u00a7 5-706.1 ; COMAR 07.02.26. The ALJ may uphold the local department's finding or modify it. COMAR 07.02.26.14. The individual or local department may seek judicial review of the ALJ's decision in accordance with the APA. SG \u00a7 10-222 ; COMAR 07.02.26.14F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under this statute, the local department keeps records of individuals who have been found responsible for \"indicated\" child abuse, or for \"unsubstantiated\" child abuse for a specified period of time, but no further consequences necessarily follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-707, 5-714.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The definitions of child abuse in the Family Law Article are similar to those that appear in the statute that creates criminal liability for child neglect and abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article (\"CR\"), \u00a7 3-601\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   For example, criminal child abuse, which can be in the first or second degree depending on its severity, is abuse committed by a \"parent, family member, household member, or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor.\" CR \u00a7 3-601(b)(1), (d)(1). This criminal provision thus uses the same phrase as the civil provision in the Family Law Article: a \"person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor.\" This is unsurprising, as the civil and criminal provisions originated as parts of the same statute with the same set of definitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The pertinent facts, as they appear in the administrative record, are uncontested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent B.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is an instructor at a martial arts school in Salisbury. He has been a friend of the family of V.K., since before Ms. K.'s birth in 1995. Ms. K. took martial arts instruction from Mr. A. as a small child and, after a break, resumed taking classes with him regularly in October 2010 when she was 15 years old. During these classes, according to Ms. K., Mr. A. was \"really friendly\" to Ms. K. She testified that Mr. A. \"spen[t] more time with [her] than with everybody else,\" and he spoke with her after class about her \"personal life\" and \"how [she] was doing.\" He referred to her as \"Sunlight,\" a pet name that only he used for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November 2010, Ms. K. missed class due to illness, and Mr. A. texted her to ask how she was doing. He added that the class missed her and that he hoped that she felt better. After this, the two of them continued to exchange texts, at first occasionally but over time with increasing frequency. Around February 2011, they also began to exchange emails. They created email addresses that did not identify themselves by name and that they used to communicate only with each other. Ms. K.'s 18-year old boyfriend, D. P., also had access to Ms. K.'s account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Around February and March 2011, their conversations turned increasingly to sexual topics. By email, Mr. A. sent Ms. K. pictures of erotically posed women and told her that he would like her to pose for pictures, but she declined to do so. Ms. K. testified that she and Mr. A. had several telephone calls, including one in which he said that he wanted to teach her a martial arts kick in class that would cause her to lift her leg onto a railing so that he could \"slyly touch [her] vagina.\" In telephone calls and in emails, he told her that he existed on a spiritual plane and that if she \"felt anything,\" he was having sex with her on the spiritual plane. In another telephone call, which Ms. K. said lasted approximately five hours, Mr. A. said that he was \"hard\" and that he wanted to have sex\n   with her. She testified that they spoke again by telephone the next morning and he told her that he was touching himself. On several occasions, he invited her over to his house, nominally to \"work off\" the price of her gi (a martial arts uniform) by helping him with gardening or other chores, but she declined to go. During February and March 2011, Mr. A. expressed concern that others would not understand their relationship and that Ms. K. should delete the messages that he sent to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to Ms. K., they continued to correspond in much the same vein until May 2011. Around May 19, 2011, Ms. K. showed her boyfriend a message from Mr. A. that said that the boyfriend was not good enough for Ms. K. About two weeks later, the boyfriend confronted Mr. A. in his office at his martial arts studio, with Ms. K. present. According to the boyfriend, Mr. A. alternately apologized for, attempted to excuse, and denied the inappropriate communications with Ms. K. After that confrontation, Mr. A. continued to communicate with Ms. K. outside of class, but he did so with declining frequency and without sexual content. At some point in 2011, Ms. K. attempted to switch out of Mr. A.'s class and by November, she was no longer in his class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ found that none of the sexually inappropriate conduct occurred during class. In class, Mr. A. did not touch or speak to Ms. K. in a sexual manner. She reported that he touched her hips with his hands at least once to help her with a position, but did no more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Investigation and Finding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 3, 2011, the Wicomico County Department of Social Services (\"Department\") received a report that Mr. A. had sent Ms. K. sexually explicit text messages and emails. On November 4, 2011, Amy Giordano, an experienced investigator for the Department, conducted recorded interviews with Ms. K. and her boyfriend about the allegations. Detective John Seichepine assisted in the investigation and obtained copies of some of the email exchanges between Mr. A. and Ms. K. and copies of their telephone records. Through his attorney, Mr. A. declined to be interviewed by the investigators. On January 6, 2012, after completion of the investigation, the Department, through Ms. Giordano, found Mr. A. responsible for indicated child sexual abuse based on the out-of-class communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Administrative Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. A. requested a hearing. On June 12, 2012, the ALJ held a contested case hearing. At the hearing, Mr. A.'s attorney argued that nothing inappropriate occurred while Ms. K. was under the care of Mr. A. at the martial arts school and that the sexually explicit communications recounted by Ms. K. occurred by telephone or electronically during off-hours when she was in her own home. The Department's representative conceded that there was no actual sexual contact, but argued that the abuse lay in Mr. A.'s \"grooming\" of Ms. K. during the period he was her instructor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ALJ issued a decision on July 20, 2012. The ALJ found that it was undisputed that Mr. A. had inappropriate \"sexually exploitive\" communications with Ms. K. However, the ALJ noted that there was a clear temporal break between the instructor-student relationship of Mr. A. and Ms. K. at the martial arts studio and the inappropriate sexually explicit communications that took place when they were not physically together. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded, Mr. A. did not have care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K. at the time of the sexually exploitative conduct and thus did not commit abuse under FL \u00a7 5-701(x). Pursuant to COMAR 07.02.26.14D, the ALJ ordered the Department to modify the finding of \"indicated\" abuse to \"ruled out.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Judicial Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Department filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. On December 21, 2012, the Circuit Court held oral argument, and on March 22, 2013, it affirmed the decision of the ALJ. The Department appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which also affirmed the ALJ in an unreported opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Department then filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   with this Court, which we granted. The issue presented by the Department in its petition was whether the Department's original finding could be supported by \"grooming\" behavior by Mr. A. during class-when Mr. A. had responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K.-in conjunction with the out-of-class communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Following briefing and oral argument on that issue, we requested supplemental briefing on three questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   1. In an ongoing instructor-student relationship, can \"temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child\" pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) be established through remote electronic communications?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   2. Can \"temporary care\" pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) be established without the mutual consent, expressed or implied, of the one legally charged with the care of the child and of the one purportedly assuming the \"temporary care\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   3. Does an instructor who has temporary care or responsibility for a child on a repeated, ongoing basis, commit child abuse within the meaning of FL \u00a7 5-701 by sexually explicit communications made via texts, telephone calls or other electronic means to the child, provided there exists a significant connection between the abusive conduct and the in-person care or responsibility?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties filed supplemental briefs and additional oral argument was held on those questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

As indicated above, child sexual abuse means \"any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member.\" FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1). There appears to be no question that Mr. A. engaged in sexually exploitative conduct with a child-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   an individual under the age of 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. K. was 15 years old at the time of most of the communications and turned 16 part way through the relevant time period. Mr. A. appears to have committed at least one act enumerated in the definition of \"sexual abuse,\" namely encouraging a child to engage in obscene or pornographic photography or poses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(2)(i) ; COMAR 07.02.07.02B(42)(b)(iii). Other out-of-class communications between Mr. A. and Ms. K. could also be characterized as sexually exploitative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

He was not Ms. K.'s parent, nor was he a household or family member, nor did he have any permanent responsibility for her. Therefore, the only possibility is that he was an \"other person who has ... temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of\" Ms. K. It appears to be undisputed that he did have temporary responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K. during the time that she was in his martial arts class. However, the key question is whether he had such status in relation to Ms. K. at the time he engaged in sexually exploitative conduct. The ALJ concluded that he did not-a conclusion affirmed by the courts below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Caretaker Status and Temporal Breaks\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The resolution of this case depends to some extent on the construction of the pertinent statutory language-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   what it means to have \"temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of\" a child.

Mr. A. had responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K. when she was in his class, but that responsibility ended when she departed the martial arts studio and her parents resumed their responsibility-thereby terminating the implied consent of the parents and the instructor's duty to supervise. Mr. A.'s subsequent inappropriate behavior in emails and telephone calls occurred when Mr. A. did not have responsibility for her supervision during a temporal break in the teacher-student relationship, when Ms. K. was usually in her own home. By the time\n   Ms. K. got home and exchanged the emails and telephone calls with Mr. A., her parents had responsibility for her supervision, and Mr. A. did not. Therefore, Mr. A.'s out-of-class behavior was not an \"act ... by a ... person who\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   ... temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a child.\" FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reprehensible as some of Mr. A.'s conduct might be, without more it did not fall within the definition of child abuse under this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Department has essentially conceded this but argued, both before the ALJ and on appeal, that there is more here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that Mr. A. engaged in grooming behavior in class that linked the time he was responsible for Ms. K.'s supervision to his sexually explicit out-of-class communications with her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Grooming\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Department contends that Mr. A.'s interactions with Ms. K. during, or immediately after, class constituted systematic \"grooming\" designed to make her susceptible to sexual exploitation. It points to her testimony that Mr. A. paid special attention to her in class and sometimes spoke to her about personal matters. The Department describes this as \"inextricably intertwined with his conduct outside of class\" and \"part of one continuous chain of events.\" The Department suggests that\n   what Mr. A. did during class enabled what he did outside of class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although the Department in its closing argument at the administrative hearing urged the ALJ to find that grooming occurred,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ALJ found that there was no evidence of inappropriate behavior during class. Moreover, most of the behavior that the Department points to-chatting with Ms. K., sometimes about personal matters, and being \"really friendly\"-is the same behavior one might expect of a family friend instructing a student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In their out-of-class communications, Mr. A. spoke at least once about the possibility of engaging in sexual contact during class, such as touching Ms. K. inappropriately while she ostensibly practiced a kick, but he apparently never acted on that idea. The Department also points out that Mr. A. at least once \"put his hands on [Ms. K.'s] hips during class,\" but martial arts classes frequently involve this sort of contact and even Ms. K. said that it was to assist her with a position in class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We cannot say that the ALJ's conclusion is clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. From our review of the record, there is nothing like the in-school conduct and communications of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Walker v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). In\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   a teacher's aide at an elementary school who frequently hugged and held hands with a third grade girl at the school was found to have exchanged notes in school with her that, among other things, professed his love for her, confessed that he dreamed of sleeping with her in his arms, and analogized their relationship to one depicted in a teenage romance novel. In\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   the defendant conceded that he engaged in this behavior while he had \"care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of\" the girl at school. This Court held that giving the girl the notes constituted sexual exploitation because \"the content and the context of the notes ... satisfy the 'sexual' element of exploitation\" and \"[t]he great pleasure [he] repeatedly describes from exchanging with [the girl] notes that carried a sexual undertone lead us to conclude that he 'received a benefit' from his actions and therefore exploited her.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, in this case, the ALJ found that \"[n]one of the sexually explicit telephone conversations, texting or emails ... occurred during [Ms. K.'s] taekwondo classes [and Mr. A.] did not have any sexually inappropriate conversations or touch [Ms. K.] in a sexual manner when [Ms. K.] was ... receiving instruction from [Mr. A.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Of course, as\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   indicates, context is not irrelevant. In some circumstances, actions that, by themselves, do not seem sexually exploitative might, in context, be so. For example, seemingly innocuous actions may nonetheless be sexually exploitative if they meet the standards described in\n   <em>\n    Walker:\n   </em>\n   they are sexual in context, and the adult performing the actions receives a benefit from them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What matters for this case is what Mr. A. did\n   <em>\n    during class,\n   </em>\n   or in its immediate context (as in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ). We cannot simply import all of Mr. A.'s out-of-class behavior into class to satisfy the statutory definition; rather, there must be evidence that Mr. A. engaged in acts that involved sexual exploitation of Ms. K. at\n   the time he had responsibility for her supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Department urges that this obstacle may be overcome by adopting an expansive understanding of child sexual abuse in order to protect children.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribbitt v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688587\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/638/\">\n    403 Md. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688587,3688611\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/943/1260/\">\n    943 A.2d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (sexual abuse can be predicated on conduct that does not constitute a sexual offense in any degree or otherwise violate any provision of Maryland law);\n   <em>\n    Crispino,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697212\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/31/#p44\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (sexual abuse can be predicated on French kissing, even though that is not one of the enumerated acts in the statute). It is true that the statute refers to \"any act that\n   <em>\n    involves\n   </em>\n   sexual ... exploitation\" (emphasis added), and this allows the statute to reach more broadly than if it simply referred to sexual exploitation. One meaning of \"involves\" is \"includes,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/involve, so any conduct that partly is not sexual exploitation and partly is sexual exploitation nonetheless\n   <em>\n    involves\n   </em>\n   sexual exploitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, the Department has not pointed to a single action (or course of actions) that Mr. A. took during class that, in context, is even partly sexual exploitation. Being \"really friendly\" to a student is not sexual exploitation. Talking to a student about how she is doing and what she has done that day is not sexual exploitation. Touching a student's hips during a martial arts class to help the student with a position ordinarily is not sexual exploitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Building trust with a student during class is not sexual exploitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Department argues that Mr. A.'s\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   behind his actions during class was to prepare Ms. K. for out-of-class sexual exploitation. The Department contends that this intent means that his in-class behavior \"involves\" sexual exploitation under the statute, even if it is not itself sexually exploitative. We do not rule out this possibility-that is, that an act can \"involve\" sexual exploitation because it is performed specifically in order to facilitate sexual exploitation in the future. But it is not enough to show that a teacher built trust with the student during class and subsequently attempted to sexually exploit the student outside of class. There would need to be a showing that the teacher took some specific action during class with the specific intention of facilitating sexual exploitation outside of class (rather than, for example, building trust merely in order to facilitate the physically demanding and potentially dangerous martial arts class, as any teacher might do). The fact that Mr. A. did try to sexually exploit Ms. K. outside of class is not, by itself, enough to prove his intentions during class. In any event, the record reports very little of what happened during class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   If Mr. A. had given clear indications of romantic feelings during class, then the outcome might be different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. at 624-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If he had said or done anything inappropriate during their conversations immediately after class, while Ms. K. was still at the martial arts center, then the outcome might be different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    372 Md. at 295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    812 A.2d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If there was any evidence that he intentionally attempted to use in-class time specifically for the purpose of facilitating out-of-class sexual exploitation of his student, the outcome might be different. But no facts in the record here necessarily lead to an inference that Mr. A. sexually exploited Ms. K. while he had temporary supervisory responsibility\n   for her, and that is what the statutory definition covers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Summary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mr. A. engaged in sexually suggestive telephone and electronic communications with a 15-year-old girl. He thus engaged in sexual exploitative conduct with a child. However, there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's conclusion that Mr. A. did not have responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K. at the time of this conduct-which occurred outside of class while Mr. A. and Ms. K. were not in each other's presence. Mr. A. did have responsibility for the supervision of Ms. K. while she was at the martial arts school, but none of the sexually exploitative conduct occurred at that time. Although grooming behavior in class could, in conjunction with sexually exploitative conduct outside of class, support a finding of indicated child sexual abuse, the ALJ's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence for such a finding here was not clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We note that the Department relies on a few out-of-state cases construing statutes that appear to be broader than the Maryland statute.

Chapter 221, Laws of Maryland 1966,\n    <em>\n     then codified in\n    </em>\n    Maryland Code, Article 27, \u00a7 11A. That law specified civil and criminal consequences for the same conduct. It was later recodified as Article 27, \u00a7 35A. Chapter 500, Laws of Maryland 1970. A definition of \"abuse\" was added to the statute in 1973. Chapter 835, Laws of Maryland 1973. A definition of \"sexual abuse\" was added the following year. Chapter 554, Laws of Maryland 1974. The civil and criminal consequences thus related to conduct based on the same definitions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    In 1984, as part of the creation of the Family Law Article, the civil provisions were moved to the new Family Law Article. Chapter 296, Laws of Maryland 1984. Identical versions of the pertinent original definitions in Article 27 were included with the civil provisions in the Family Law Article and were also retained with the criminal provisions in Article 27. The criminal provisions were later recodified as part of the new Criminal Law Article. Chapter 26, Laws of Maryland 2002. The provision concerning child sexual abuse in both the Family Law Article and the Criminal Law Article both continue to describe conduct by a \"person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of\" a child.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    CR \u00a7 3-602(b); FL \u00a7 5-701(x).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The evidence at the administrative hearing in this case consisted of the testimony of Ms. K., her boyfriend, the investigating police officer, and the representative of the local department who received and investigated the complaint.

Although Mr. A. did not stipulate to the facts, he elected not to testify at the hearing and, in this civil context, one may infer, as the ALJ apparently did, that the events recounted by Ms. K. and the other witnesses are true.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The Court of Special Appeals granted a motion to refer to B.A. by his initials.

The ALJ concluded that this regulation was excessively vague and improperly extended the definitions in FL \u00a7 5-701(x) to individuals who did not have contemporaneous care, custody, or responsibility for the supervision of a child. The ALJ consequently declined to apply the definition of \"caretaker\" in COMAR. After the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the ALJ that this regulation exceeded the reach of the statute, the Department abandoned its reliance on the regulation in this Court, so we do not consider it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    That regulation authorizes an ALJ, after a hearing, to order a local department to modify a finding of child abuse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    FL \u00a7 5-701(e).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    In her dissent, Judge Adkins suggests that we might construe the definition of \"sexual abuse\"-and, more specifically, its description of caretaker status-more broadly than the Court has construed its criminal counterpart in cases such as\n    <em>\n     Anderson.\n    </em>\n    Tempting as this approach might be, it fails because the definitions in the civil and criminal provisions originated as one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    footnote 2 above. This is not to say civil and criminal enforcement are in all respects the same. For a variety of reasons, it may be easier to prove child abuse in a civil proceeding than in a criminal prosecution. The State has a lighter burden of proof in a civil case; unlike a criminal case, adverse inferences may be drawn from a defendant's silence; and the formal rules of evidence do not apply in a civil administrative proceeding. But the legislative DNA of the definition of \"child abuse\" in the two statutes is identical.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    In her dissent, Judge Watts argues that one may have \"temporary care\" of a child by engaging in remote communications with the child-\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    by sending an email or a letter that expresses concern or by providing psychological comfort to the child. She offers several reasons for this position. She points out that this would comport with a dictionary definition of \"care,\" which includes providing psychological comfort. In addition, she argues that \"care\" must be read in this fashion or else it will be redundant with \"responsibility for supervision\" elsewhere in the statute. She also urges that it would be consistent with the underlying legislative purpose of protecting children.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Perhaps this idea would have some merit if the statute said \"provide care\" or \"offer care\" instead of \"has ... care\" which, like \"has ... custody,\" denotes a greater responsibility. In any event, as Judge Watts concedes, the Court has already interpreted \"temporary care or custody\" as equivalent to \"\n    <em>\n     in loco parentis,\n    </em>\n    \" which is inconsistent with Judge Watts' suggested reading of the phrase, and has construed \"responsibility for supervision\" to cover one who is not\n    <em>\n     in loco parentis\n    </em>\n    but who nonetheless has responsibility for a child. Thus, these concepts are not redundant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    In any event, the approach suggested in Judge Watts' dissent would go well beyond this Court's past decisions that sought to interpret the child abuse statutes to carry out the purpose of protecting children consistent with the statutory text and constitutional principles.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pope,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2083330\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/284/309/#p323\">\n     284 Md. at 320-25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20A.2d%201054\">\n     396 A.2d 1054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting issue as to whether child abuse statute was unconstitutionally vague and construing concepts of \"care or custody\" and \"responsibility for supervision\");\n    <em>\n     Anderson v.

His inappropriate sexual advances to the minor by texts and during telephone calls occurred remotely, in the evening. Accordingly, the implied parental consent to transport a child home from school that was central to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   simply does not sustain us here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   I think the statute reaches B.A.'s conduct not by a theory of implied parental consent, but by a settled rule of statutory construction-that a civil, remedial statute, if ambiguous, should be interpreted in favor of furthering the legislative remedial purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opert v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689359\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/587/#p593\">\n    403 Md. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689359\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/587/#p593\">\n    943 A.2d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"If ... we conclude that 'the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute's legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.' \") (citations omitted). It cannot be disputed that the remedial purpose of Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) of the Family Law Article (\"FL\") is the protection of children. As the statute reads, \" '[s]exual abuse' means any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child [.]\" FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) (emphasis added). We need to decide whether, in this civil statute, the phrase, \"other person who has ... temporary care or custody or responsibility\" imposes a strict temporal requirement in order to invoke inclusion of B.A. in the \"confidential computerized database that contains information regarding child abuse[.]\" FL \u00a7 5-701. I emphasize that this statute is civil, because I would differentiate our holding from any criminal case with similar facts. Also the registry on which B.A. and this incident would be included is only accessible by \"(1) the protective services staff of the Administration; (2) the protective services staffs of local departments who are investigating a report of suspected abuse or neglect; and\" (3) law enforcement personnel who are investigating a report of suspected abuse or neglect. FL \u00a7 5-714.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   One reasonable way to interpret this section is to read the phrase \"other person who\n   <strong>\n    has\n   </strong>\n   ... temporary care or custody or responsibility\" liberally to mean that the section would prohibit sexual exploitation of a child, so long as the adult, in an\n   <em>\n    ongoing relationship\n   </em>\n   exercises responsibility and in person care for the child, with the further proviso that there be a\n   <em>\n    significant connection\n   </em>\n   between the abuse and the in-person care. I would require that the care be in person, but the abuse may occur by other means. The evidence in this case can readily support a factual conclusion that would meet this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Like Judge Watts's dissent, my analysis depends on the strength of a teacher's relationship with, and influence on, the child, which may be presumed. The authority exercised by this instructor, together with the student's desire to excel in this martial arts program could bolster that presumption. The telephonic communications would support a conclusion that B.A. repeatedly drew upon the martial arts culture, calling her a \"warrior,\" and saying that he was \"very proud that [she was] working out so hard,\" and that \"You ARE strong ... among many other wonderful traits.\" (Ellipsis in original.) He also offered, more than once, to drive her to a workshop on tai chi. In another email, he wrote \"I'm sorry that you got hurt in class. I ... can only hope that you're alright? ... [Y]ou're beyond beautiful and wonderful.\" He exerted his authority as a martial arts instructor by threatening to discipline V.K.'s boyfriend, writing that the boyfriend's jealousy was a problem, and that B.A. \"[could] not allow this type of vibe/attitude in my work[ ]place. He's either going to fix it or I'm talking to him. And if it still doesn't change I'm going to be forced to not allow him to come anymore[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   V.K. responded to some of his emails and texts and engaged in a five-hour phone conversation with him. It is reasonable to conclude that she would not have done so, absent the student-teacher relationship. In short, there was more than enough evidence to support a conclusion that there was a substantial connection between the martial arts instruction and the telephonic sexual abuse. This leads me to a conclusion that the ALJ erred in concluding that because there was \"a clear temporal break in the taekwondo-instructor/taekwondo-student relationship when the sexual correspondence took place ... the local department failed to show an instructor-student relationship between\" B.A. and V.K. when the sexual communication occurred. To be sure, there was a temporal break, but in this civil case, that, on its own, does\n   not eliminate the possibility that B.A. violated FL \u00a7 5-701.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In conclusion, unlike the Majority, I would vacate the judgment and opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, and remand to that Court with instructions to remand to the Circuit Court for further remand to the ALJ to make additional findings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   WATTS, J., dissenting, in which HARRELL, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Respectfully, I dissent. The Majority narrowly construes a statute that the General Assembly enacted to protect children-the most vulnerable members of society-from sexual predators. In doing so, the Majority chips away at the legal deterrents against sexual exploitation of children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition to exposing children to harm, the Majority Opinion is non-forward-looking. In today's digital age, with increasing frequency, children engage in remote communications (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   e-mails, telephonic conversations, or text messages) with people who have permanent or temporary care, custody, or responsibility for the supervision of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This issue in this case is whether a teacher can commit \"sexual abuse\" as defined by Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\"FL\") \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) (\" 'Sexual abuse' means any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member.\") by sexually exploiting a student through remote communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Majority narrowly construes FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) so that it applies only to in-person contact between a child student and a teacher who is a sexual predator. I respectfully disagree with the Majority's reasoning, and would hold that a teacher can commit \"sexual abuse\" as defined by FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) by sexually exploiting a student through remote communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This case's material facts are undisputed. On January 11, 2012, the Wicomico County Department of Social Services (\"the Department\"), Petitioner, notified B.A.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent-the \"grandmaster\" of Park's Martial Arts (\"Park's\"), a martial arts school in Salisbury, Maryland-that the Department had found B.A. responsible for indicated child sexual abuse. B.A. appealed. On June 12, 2012, an administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings conducted a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On July 20, 2012, the ALJ issued a decision in which the ALJ found the following facts, which I summarize. From October 2010 through Spring 2011, V.K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was a fifteen-year-old female student at Park's, where B.A. was V.K.'s teacher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record reveals that V.K. was in B.A.'s classes up to three times per week, and that V.K. believed that B.A. obtained her cell phone number and e-mail address from school records. In December 2010, B.A. texted V.K. to ask for a photograph of her. In February 2011, B.A. e-mailed V.K. and attached photographs of naked women who were posing in an erotic manner. In his e-mail, B.A. informed V.K. that he wanted her to pose like the women in the photographs. At one point, B.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   remotely informed V.K. that he could go \"out of his body[,]\" and that, \"if she felt anything[,] it would be hi[s] having sex with her in a spiritual manner.\" At approximately midnight on a night in February or March 2011, B.A. telephoned V.K., initiating a conversation that lasted until approximately 5:00 a.m. According to V.K., during this conversation, B.A. told V.K. that he wanted to \"talk dirty\" to her; said that he was \"hard\"; said that he wanted her to touch his penis; said that he wanted to have sex with her; and said that, to show her how much he loved her, he wanted to touch her vagina while he was teaching her to do a kick during martial arts class. The following morning, B.A. telephoned V.K. again, and, while breathing heavily, told V.K. that he was masturbating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The ALJ admitted into evidence the following e-mails between B.A. and V.K.

Plainly put, a teacher does not stop being a teacher when he or she leaves the school grounds; regardless of the location, a teacher and a student are in an \"indivisible, ongoing relationship\" that \"is based on the student's trust and acquiescence to [the] teacher's authority[,]\" \"influence[, and] control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    at 296, 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    812 A.2d at 1023, 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It is logical that a teacher who is in an ongoing teacher-student relationship with a student, and who undertakes care for the child outside of the school grounds, must not be permitted to take advantage of the student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Just as a teacher is able to exert authority, influence, or control over a student in person while both are outside the school grounds, the teacher is able to exert authority, influence, or control over the student via remote communications while both are outside the school grounds. In any remote communication that calls for a response-even something as simple as an e-mail in which a teacher asks: \"How are you?\"-the teacher, by virtue of the teacher-student relationship, obligates the student to share information and spend time and effort, however little, on a response. The teacher-student relationship plays an even greater role where the teacher directly or indirectly refers to the relationship-for example, a teacher could e-mail a student\n   to state: \"You were unusually quiet in class today. Are you okay?\" If the student chooses to respond to the teacher's remote communication, the student's choice is at least partially driven by the teacher-student relationship; the student sees the teacher on a regular basis at the school, and the student is aware that, if the student chooses to ignore the teacher's remote communications, the student risks having an uncomfortable and/or awkward in-person encounter with the teacher at the school. By way of hypothetical comparison, if a random stranger e-mailed, telephoned, or texted a minor requesting information about the minor's life, the minor would almost certainly refrain from responding. The only plausible explanation for a student's responses to a teacher's remote communications is the ongoing teacher-student relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Significantly, my conclusion is supported by FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1)'s purpose, which is to protect vulnerable children from sexual predators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To conclude otherwise would exempt teachers who happen to be such predators from liability for \"sexual abuse\" as defined by FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) -and, by logical extension, liability under FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1)'s criminal counterparts CR \u00a7\u00a7 3-601(b)(1), (d)(1) (Child Abuse) and 3-602(b)(1) (Sexual Abuse of a Minor)-simply by virtue of the circumstance that the predators preyed on students remotely instead of in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Additionally, my conclusion is consistent with FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1)'s legislative history. The first statute to use the phrase \"temporary care or custody\" in illegalizing harm to a minor was Md.Code Ann., Art. 27 (1957, 1963 Supp.) (\"Art.27\") \u00a7 11A (Assault on Child), which the General Assembly enacted in 1963. Art. 27 \u00a7 11A stated: \"Any parent, adoptive parent[,] or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody of a minor child under the age of fourteen years who maliciously beats, strikes, or otherwise mistreats [ ] such minor child to such degree as to require medical treatment for such child shall be guilty of a felony[.]\" Obviously, the acts that Art. 27 \u00a7 11A illegalized (beating, striking, and physically mistreating) could occur only in person; however, eleven years later, the General Assembly broadened the category of illegal harm to a minor by adding sexual exploitation without physical injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.Code Ann., Art. 27 (1957, 1971 Rep. Vol., 1974 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 35A(a) (\"Any parent, adoptive parent[,] or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor child under the age of eighteen years who causes abuse to such minor child shall be guilty of a felony[.]\"); 35A(b)(7)(B) ( \" 'Abuse' shall mean ... any sexual abuse of a child, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\" (Emphasis added)); 35A(b)(8) (\" 'Sexual abuse' shall mean any act or acts involving sexual molestation or exploitation [.]\" (Emphasis added)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   It would be illogical to conclude that the General Assembly broadened the category of illegal harm to a minor to include sexual exploitation without physical injury, yet intended to limit such illegal harm to in-person contact between an adult and a child. Of course, in 1974, many modern methods of remote communication, including e-mail, text messaging, and instant messaging, were not in widespread use; however, other methods of remote communication, such as telephonic conversation and letter writing, existed in 1974 and remain in widespread use. Indeed, even today, sexual predators use these older methods of remote communication to contact\n   victims. For example, in this case, B.A. engaged in telephonic conversation with V.K.; and, in\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    432 Md. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719409\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/432/587/#p625\">\n    69 A.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a school employee wrote \"to an eight-year-old female student a series of notes in which he repeatedly professed his love for her, shared fantasies of kissing and holding her, and expressed jealousy about her having a boyfriend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   My conclusion, of course, would not alter the principle that \"responsibility for supervision of a minor child may be obtained only upon the mutual consent, expressed or implied, by the one legally charged with the care of the child and by the one assuming responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    372 Md. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    812 A.2d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In other words, consent remains an element of \"responsibility for supervision.\" I simply recognize that mutual consent, express or implied, is not required for \"care.\" This Court has interpreted \"responsibility for supervision\" to require mutual consent, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   'Responsibility' in its common and generally accepted meaning denotes 'accountability,' and 'supervision' emphasizes broad authority to oversee with the powers of direction and decision.... Absent a court order or award by some appropriate proceeding pursuant to statutory authority, we think it to be self-evident that responsibility for supervision of a minor child may be obtained only upon the mutual consent, expressed or implied, by the one legally charged with the care of the child and by the one assuming responsibility. In other words, a parent may not impose responsibility for the supervision of his or her minor child on a third person unless that person accepts the responsibility, and a third person may not assume such responsibility unless the parent grants it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972760\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/372/285/\">\n    812 A.2d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ellipsis in original) (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted). As stated above, \"care\" has a broader definition, including the provision of what is necessary for the health, welfare, maintenance, and protection of a child, and the administration of psychological comfort, which does not necessarily require mutual consent, express or implied. To conclude otherwise would lead to illogical results. For example, suppose that a child is playing outside and injures herself. A neighbor invites the child inside to get a bandage. Once inside, the child is sexually molested by the neighbor. In this scenario, the child's parent did not consent to the neighbor's providing care for the child. Simply stated, an adult who undertakes to provide care of a child without a parent's consent should be held accountable for any abuse or molestation or exploitation of the child, despite the circumstance that there may have been no mutual consent, express or implied, for the adult's care of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the above reasons, a teacher commits \"sexual abuse\" as defined by FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) where the teacher takes advantage of an ongoing teacher-student relationship to exert authority, influence, or control over the student via sexually exploitative remote communications. I note that my conclusion is expressly tied to a teacher-student relationship that is \"ongoing,\" and I do not express an opinion on whether FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1) applies where there is a former teacher-student relationship or no teacher-student relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Additionally, my conclusion would obviously not apply where a teacher does not engage in \"any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation\" of a student.

For example, in one e-mail, B.A. referred to V.K. as a \"warrior,\" which, ostensibly, was a reference to the fact that V.K. was a student of martial arts. On a related note, in the same e-mail, B.A. offered to drive V.K. to a workshop on tai chi, which is an exercise that is similar to martial arts. B.A. once e-mailed V.K. to state that her boyfriend \"always seem[ed] so serious\"\n   <strong>\n    at the school.\n   </strong>\n   Later, B.A. e-mailed V.K. to state that, \"even b[efore you] started training[\n   <strong>\n    at the school,\n   </strong>\n   your boyfriend] was serious and somber [,] more so than any other\n   <strong>\n    student\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). Still later, B.A. e-mailed V.K. to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   I'm sorry that you got hurt\n   <strong>\n    in class\n   </strong>\n   .... [D]ue to ... our \"\n   <strong>\n    professional relationship\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" this could be seen as weird to virtually anyone....

[Y]our varying moods and cavalier attitude when I do see you [\n   <strong>\n    at the school\n   </strong>\n   ] do[ ]n't necessarily instill the utmost confidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks omitted). On the same day, B.A. e-mailed V.K. to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Not sure why all of a sudden [your boyfriend's] jealousy has reached such a state that he's acting that way towards me [\n   <strong>\n    at the school\n   </strong>\n   ]....

Additionally, during a telephonic conversation, B.A. told V.K. that he wanted to touch her vagina while he was teaching her to do a kick\n   <strong>\n    during martial arts class.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   B.A. utilized the ongoing teacher-student relationship to exert authority, influence, or control over V.K. by sending remote communications that either called for responses or included instructions to V.K. In one e-mail, B.A. offered to drive V.K. to a workshop. In one e-mail and one text message, B.A. asked V.K. for a photograph of her. In three e-mails, B.A. asked V.K. how she was doing. In one such e-mail, B.A. stated: \"It would be good to hear from you\"; in another such e-mail, B.A. stated: \"I would LOVE to hear from [yo]u MUCH MORE. Tell me more about [yo]ur\n   life, thoughts, [yo]ur inner workings, etc.\" In three e-mails, B.A. asked V.K. for information about her boyfriend. In one such e-mail, B.A. complained about what he perceived to be jealousy on V.K.'s boyfriend's part, and instructed V.K. to \"fix it[.]\" In another e-mail, B.A. instructed V.K. to \"erase all of [their] past correspondences NOW\"; to \"use no personally identifying questions or comments unless [V.K.] immediately erase[d] them\"; \"to ONLY discuss 'normal or professional' things using [their] original 'normal' e-mail addresses\" if V.K. \"wish[ed] to share [their] e-mails with others\"; and to refrain from \"shar [ing]\" \"any[ ]thing about [his] life ... with anyone EVER unless [B.A.] specifically sa[id] otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The fact that V.K. responded to many of B.A.'s remote communications offers even further support for the conclusion that B.A.'s remote communications constituted exertions of authority, influence, or control over V.K. In replies to B.A.'s e-mails, V.K. provided information about her life in general and her boyfriend in particular. In one e-mail, V.K. thanked B.A. for a compliment. In another e-mail, V.K. declined to provide a photograph of herself. On one occasion, after B.A. telephoned V.K. at approximately midnight, V.K. participated in the telephonic conversation for approximately five hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In sum, B.A., while providing \"temporary care\" for V.K., took advantage of the ongoing teacher-student relationship to exert authority, influence, or control over V.K. via remote communications. As the ALJ concluded (and as B.A. fails to dispute), B.A.'s sexually explicit remote communications with V.K.-namely, informing her that he wanted her to pose in an erotic manner, propositioning her for sexual intercourse, and telling her during a telephonic conversation that he was masturbating-constituted sexual exploitation. Thus, the ALJ erred in concluding as a matter of law that the Department had not met its burden to prove that B.A. was responsible for indicated \"sexual abuse\" as defined by FL \u00a7 5-701(x)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   At oral reargument, the Department's counsel stated that she did not believe that B.A. had temporary care of V.K. when B.A. sexually exploited V.K. through remote communications. Of course, a party's erroneous concession of law does not bind this Court, which independently decides legal issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Heather B.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191161\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/369/257/\">\n    369 Md. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266 n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191161\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/369/257/\">\n    799 A.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 n. 9 (2002) (\"We independently decide issues of law and are not bound by a party's concession of law in a particular case.\" (Citation omitted));\n   <em>\n    Imbesi v.
