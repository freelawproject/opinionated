The case centers around petitioner's November 3, 2011 written request for information under the Maryland Public Information Act (hereinafter \"MPIA\"), Maryland Code (2014), \u00a7 4-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   of the General Provisions Article (\"GP\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   related to the value of unclaimed property accounts in the custody of the Comptroller of Maryland. Petitioner requested a list of the names and addresses of individuals with the 5,000 largest accounts of unclaimed property, ordered from the largest value to the smallest. Based upon the Comptroller's interpretation of the statute that the requested information was prohibited under the MPIA, the Comptroller denied the request on the grounds that the records contained \"information about the finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.\" GP \u00a7 4-336(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. He filed a motion to seal the case record on the grounds that the record contained his trade secret (his technique for soliciting the information in question in this case), which the Circuit Court granted. The Circuit Court ordered the Comptroller to disclose the requested records in value order as petitioner requested, and the Comptroller appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special\n   Appeals affirmed in part, and reversed in part.\n   <em>\n    Comptroller of Treasury v.

In Maryland, \"abandoned property\" is defined as tangible and intangible personal property considered abandoned under the title. CL \u00a7 17-101(b)(1). The Comptroller is the Administrator under the Abandoned Property Act. CL \u00a7 17-101(c). After reporting the property to the Comptroller, the property holder must then deliver the abandoned property to the Comptroller, CL \u00a7 17-312, who acts as custodian for the owner.

Further information about an account, including the\n   amount or description of the property, is reserved for \"any person who possesses an interest in the property,\" and such information may be obtained by addressing inquiry to the Comptroller. CL \u00a7 17-311(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Before this Court, petitioner argues that the plain language of the MPIA and the Abandoned Property Act require disclosure of the information he requested, and that the purpose of those statutes is served by disclosure. He argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in adding language to the MPIA prohibiting disclosure of incremental financial information based on comparative value. Petitioner argues that the purposes of the two statutes are disclosure of public information favored over non-disclosure, and return of property to true owners favored over unjust enrichment by holders of abandoned property. Also, petitioner argues that the purpose of the disclosure requirement of the Abandoned Property Act is meant to halt the unjust enrichment of the State's general fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioner argues that the lower courts improperly required him to modify his MPIA request, as it is not within the purview of the courts to act beyond the remedies prescribed in GP \u00a7 4-362(c)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that because the Legislature has contemplated and regulated his profession, the Legislature intended for his profession to be profitable. Petitioner asserts that the request as ordered by the Circuit Court-for the names and last known addresses for all account holders with accounts valued over $100 reported within 365 days, not in any value order-would prevent him from making any profit. Petitioner cannot enforce contracts with account holders unless the account has been with the Comptroller over 24 months. CL \u00a7 17-325. Further, he cannot run his business efficiently by seeking the holders of the most valuable accounts without a value-ordered list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Petitioner argues that it was improper for the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals to rescind their initial orders sealing the cases that have resulted in this appeal, as a description of his technique for soliciting the information at issue in this case is a trade secret under CL \u00a7 11-1201(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner argues that although his technique was made public in two published opinions of the Court of Special Appeals, this action does not leave him without the remedy of now sealing the cases from further publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Comptroller argues that the information petitioner seeks goes beyond the information he is required to disclose under the Abandoned Property Act, and that the additional information at issue is information about the finances of individuals, including assets, bank balances and financial activities. The Comptroller argues that he is required under the Abandoned Property Act to reveal publicly a particular subset of the information he holds about abandoned property accounts. That information includes the names and last known addresses of individual account holders in alphabetical order, but that excludes the value of the property. The Comptroller maintains that the General Assembly could have required the Comptroller to make publicly available the information in his possession about asset value, but it declined to do so. The Comptroller further argues that the Circuit Court did not err in modifying petitioner's MPIA request, and that the Circuit Court faithfully executed the mandate of the Court of Special Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Immanuel I,\n   </em>\n   as the intermediate appellate court held in\n   <em>\n    Immanuel II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Comptroller argues that the lower courts were correct to rescind previous orders sealing this case or refusing to seal the case, contending that unless petitioner is actually entitled to the information he seeks, his method of requesting it cannot possibly constitute a trade secret. Further, the Comptroller argues that the technique petitioner seeks to protect has been published in two opinions of the Court of Special Appeals and is described almost exactly in the 1992 Attorney General's Opinion on this subject.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   77 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. 188 (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We shall first address petitioner's arguments that the plain language of the MPIA and the Abandoned Property Act require the Comptroller to disclose the information petitioner requested in the format in which he requested it, and that disclosure supports the legislative purposes and history of the MPIA and the Abandoned Property Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The question of whether the Comptroller must disclose the records as petitioner requested depends upon the Legislature's intent in enacting the MPIA-does the intent of the Legislature to exempt certain records from disclosure under the MPIA include the information petitioner seeks in the ordered format in which he requested it, even in light of the disclosure requirements of the Abandoned Property Act? This is a matter of statutory interpretation, the principles of which are well settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We seek to \"discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Prop. &amp; Cas.

Lepelletier was an independent money finder, essentially the same profession as petitioner, who sought release of the names of depositors with unclaimed funds at three banks for which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was the receiver after the FDIC released a list of the amounts of all unclaimed deposits. The FDIC refused to release the names of corresponding living people and corporations under exemption 6 of FOIA. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit balanced the public interest-which the Court regarded as \"no clearly discernible public interest ... because such a release would not inform the public of what the FDIC is 'up to,' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668034,1381315\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/37/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 47 -with the conflicting interests of the individual in their privacy and alternatively in being reunited with their funds. The Court resolved this conflict as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"In this case, a number of the depositors have a significant pecuniary interest at stake, and disclosure of their names will greatly increase the probability that they (or their heirs) will be reunited with their funds. Thus, it is overly paternalistic to insist upon protecting an individual's privacy interest when there is good reason to believe that he or she would rather have both the publicity and the money than have neither. Accordingly, the list-of-names information sought by Lepelletier may be released under FOIA. However, because we remain particularly concerned with the possibility of invading the privacy of the depositors, and because there is no discernible public interest in disclosure,\n   <em>\n    we believe any release of the depositors' names must be limited in two significant ways.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    First, any release of names associated with the unclaimed deposits should not be matched with the amount owed to that individual. We believe that this 'unmatched' list constitutes a lesser privacy invasion than a matched one.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, any list that is released under FOIA may only contain the names of those with unclaimed deposits, and may not provide the corresponding unclaimed amount. (The FDIC has already released a list containing the amounts of each deposit; thus, in the end, it is possible that there will be two separate lists: one of names, and one of amounts.).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668034,1381315\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668034,1381315\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/37/\">\n    at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Op. Att'y Gen. 188. The Attorney General took into account the public disclosure requirement in the Abandoned Property Act, concluding that because CL \u00a7 17-311 requires the Comptroller to publish the names and last known addresses of abandoned property account holders, that information is not confidential under State Government Article \u00a7 10-617(a) (now GP \u00a7 4-328).

This intent is discernable from the language of the statute, which includes the specified exemptions, including GP \u00a7 4-336, and from how we have interpreted those varied protections. In this way, the MPIA tracks its federal counterpart, FOIA; it is a powerful tool for understanding the activities and actions\n   of the State government, but it should not be a means of invading the privacy of individuals merely because the State has collected information about those people or their property. The MPIA is constructed to protect this boundary. Information about the value of individual accounts, even incremental information deduced from an ordered list, does not offer the citizen a better understanding of how the government of the State of Maryland is functioning or what it is up to. Such information offers no discernable insight into governance that would warrant overcoming the individual privacy interest in personal financial information codified in GP \u00a7 4-336.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Were it not for the publication requirement in the Abandoned Property Act, CL \u00a7 17-311, conceivably, the information the Comptroller holds about the individual abandoned property accounts might be exempted entirely from disclosure under the MPIA. General Provisions \u00a7 4-304 requires that \"[u]nless otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall deny inspection of a public record\" of the kinds described in the exemptions. The publication requirement in the Abandoned Property Act, however, is just such an exception. The Comptroller must publish certain limited information about the abandoned property accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Legislature enumerated specifically the information about the accounts that the Comptroller shall publish. The Comptroller is required to publish the names in alphabetical order and last known addresses, if any, of persons entitled to notice. CL \u00a7 17-311(b)(1). The Legislature could have required that the Comptroller publish further information, but it did not. By stating that the Comptroller's notice \"shall contain\" the particular kinds of information listed, we consider that the specific kinds of information detailed in the statute are enumerated to the exclusion of other information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Immanuel II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360862\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/581/#p594\">\n    225 Md.App. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360862\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/581/#p594\">\n    126 A.3d at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Simply put, the only individual financial information that the Abandoned Property Act requires the Comptroller to disclose is that the public list contains claims valued at over $100 and received within the last 365 days.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute further states that such further information \"may be obtained by any person who possesses an interest in the property, by addressing an inquiry to the [Comptroller],\" CL \u00a7 17-311(b)(2), reserving the information for those persons and restricting others from obtaining it. The property owner is entitled to further information but petitioner is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In order to harmonize the two statutes, we give value to the choice that the Legislature made in selecting for publication just the included information about each account, and the specificity with which it described the information. Importantly, the statute specifically calls for the Comptroller to publish \"the names in alphabetical order.\" CL \u00a7 17-311(b)(1). This is significant in that the statute does not\n   leave the ordering of the publication subject to the Comptroller's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals added language to the MPIA in prohibiting disclosing the comparative value of accounts in the Comptroller's custody. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that ordering the accounts based on value, even with the actual value removed, adds information about the relative value of each individual account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Immanuel I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002053\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/216/259/\">\n    216 Md.App. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159688,4002053\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/878/\">\n    85 A.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is why petitioner seeks to have the list ordered according to value-because the additional information afforded by the ordering would be useful and valuable to him. The purpose of listing the names in alphabetical order, rather than in another order, is to only offer that limited information about the accounts, the names themselves paired with an address. To permit the Comptroller to disclose such additional information about the accounts would not only be contrary to the exemption in the MPIA, but it would contravene the plain language of the Abandoned Property Act by disclosing information beyond that which the Act specifies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Petitioner is not entitled to information from the Comptroller's database beyond that which the Comptroller must publish per CL \u00a7 17-311. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that this precludes disclosure of the incremental information afforded by ordering the list of accounts based on the values, as a value-ordered list \"discloses incremental financial information about the claim beyond the information the Abandoned Property Act requires the Comptroller to disclose.\"\n   <em>\n    Immanuel I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002053\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/216/259/\">\n    216 Md.App. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159688,4002053\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/878/\">\n    85 A.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
