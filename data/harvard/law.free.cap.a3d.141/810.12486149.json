The defendant, Andrew Dickson, was charged with a variety of offenses after he shot the victim, Albert Weibel, during an attempted robbery. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to preclude Weibel from making an in-court identification of the defendant on the ground that in-court identification procedures are unnecessarily suggestive. In the alternative, the defendant requested that the trial court require that Weibel select him from a group of individuals of similar appearance. The trial court denied the motion pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   and Weibel identified the defendant as his assailant in court. The jury found the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and the trial court rendered judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming, among other things, that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying his motion to preclude Weibel's in-court identification of him or, in the alternative, to order an alternative identification procedure. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant's claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Smith;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude that, contrary to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   in cases in which identity is an issue, in-court identifications that are not preceded by a successful identification in a nonsuggestive identification procedure\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   implicate due process principles and, therefore, must be prescreened by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also conclude that the admission of the in-court identification here was harmless and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on this alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record reveals the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found and procedural history. Akeem Lyles arranged to meet Weibel and Matthew Shaw at Terrace Circle in Bridgeport on the night of January 9, 2010, for the purpose of selling them an all-terrain vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly before the arranged meeting time, Lyles met with Jovanni Reyes and the defendant in a nearby apartment, explained that he planned to rob Weibel and Shaw and asked Reyes and the defendant if they would help him. Reyes and the defendant agreed. The three men left the apartment armed with guns at approximately 9:30 p.m. At that point, Weibel, who was in a pickup truck with Shaw at the arranged meeting place, called Lyles. Lyles told Weibel that he was outside in back of the building with the all-terrain vehicle and that Weibel should come and \"check it out.\" As Weibel approached Lyles, Lyles put a gun to Weibel's head and\n   demanded money. Weibel then turned around and saw Reyes and the defendant with guns. They also demanded money. As Weibel covered his head, called for help and attempted to return to the pickup truck, the men hit him, demanded money and took his cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lyles then broke from the group and approached the pickup truck. He tapped on the window with his gun and pointed the gun at Shaw's head. Shaw got out of the pickup truck and Lyles grabbed him, threw him against a parked car and demanded \"the money.\" When Shaw told Lyles that he did not have the money, Lyles took Shaw's cell phone and wallet. Lyles also took between $40 and $50, an iPod and a global positioning system from the pickup truck. Someone then yelled \"this is taking too long\" and Lyles and Reyes ran from the scene. At that point, the defendant held a gun to Weibel's head, threw him against a dumpster near the pickup and said, \"You're a dead man.\" The defendant then shot Weibel in the leg and neck. Weibel was seriously injured but survived. When Lyles later asked the defendant why he had shot Weibel, the defendant replied, \"because we didn't get any money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately one year after the shooting, Weibel viewed a police photographic array that included a photograph of the defendant, but he was unable to identify the defendant as his assailant. Both Weibel and Shaw, however, were able to identify Lyles from a photographic array as the person who had first approached Weibel and who had approached Shaw while he was in the pickup truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant was arrested and charged with numerous offenses arising from the incident. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine in which he contended that any in-court identification of the defendant by Weibel would be so highly and unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to an irreparable misidentification of\n   the defendant as to violate the defendant's due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. In the alternative, the defendant, who is African-American, requested that the court order that Weibel be required to select him from a group of individuals of similar age, weight, height, complexion and hair style. The defendant orally renewed the motion in limine after the jury was selected and before the presentation of evidence. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the prosecutor asked Weibel if he saw the person who had shot him in court. Weibel responded in the affirmative and identified the defendant, who was sitting next to counsel at the defense table. Except for a judicial marshal who was in uniform, the defendant was the only African-American male in the courtroom. The jury found the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and the trial court rendered judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court had violated his due process rights under the\n   fifth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution when it denied his motion in limine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, he contends, such identifications should be subject to prescreening by the court, just like other identifications that are the result of unduly suggestive identification procedures. This is a question of law over which our review is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Environmental Protection v. Farricielli,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20787\">\n    307 Conn. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20A.3d%20789\">\n    59 A.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"[w]hether [a party] was deprived of his due process rights is a question of law, to which we grant plenary review\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree with the defendant. First, and most importantly, we are hard-pressed to imagine how there could be a\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   suggestive identification procedure than placing a witness on the stand in open court, confronting the witness with the person who the state has accused of committing the crime, and then asking the witness if he can identify the person who committed the crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If this procedure\n   is not suggestive, then\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   procedure is suggestive. Indeed, the present case starkly demonstratesthe\n   problem, in that Weibel was unable to identify the defendant in a photographic array, but had absolutely no difficulty doing so when the defendant was sitting next to defense counsel in court and was one of only two African-American males in the room. Second, because the extreme suggestiveness and unfairness of a one-one-one in-court confrontation is so obvious, we find it likely that a jury would naturally assume that the prosecutor would not be allowed to ask the witness to identify the defendant for the first time in court unless the prosecutor and the trial court had good reason to believe that the witness would be able to identify the defendant in a nonsuggestive setting. Indeed, such an assumption would be correct in the case of an in-court identification following an unnecessarily suggestive\n   <em>\n    out-of-court\n   </em>\n   identification procedure. Thus, a first time in-court identification procedure amounts to a form of improper vouching. See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Fourth, we cannot perceive why, if an in-court identification following an unduly suggestive pretrial police procedure implicates the defendant's due process rights because it is the result of state action, the same would not be true when a prosecutor elicits a first time in-court identification. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our research has revealed no case holding that this conduct does not constitute state action and, indeed, the state makes no such claim.

Specifically, the state contends that the court in\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   held that an identification that is the result of an unduly suggestive identification procedure is excludable only when the procedure has been conducted by \"law enforcement actors\n   involved in extrajudicial investigation, not prosecutors presenting evidence in court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. The question of whether a first time in-court identification orchestrated by a prosecutor could trigger due process protections simply was not before the court in\n   <em>\n    Perry.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the issue was\n   whether an identification that was the result of suggestive\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   conduct triggered due process protections.\n   <em>\n    Perry v.

Accordingly, we do not believe that the court's repeated statements that due process protections are triggered only when unduly suggestive identification procedures are arranged by the police means that due process protections are not triggered when state actors other than the police conduct unfair identification procedures. Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   expressly stated that its prior decisions on this issue \"turn on the presence of\n   <em>\n    state action\n   </em>\n   \"; (emphasis added) id.; and, as we have indicated, the state in the present case does not dispute that a prosecutor's conduct in court constitutes state action.

Although the state is not constitutionally required to do so, it would be absurd to conclude that the state can simply decline to conduct a nonsuggestive procedure and then claim that its own conduct rendered a first time in-court identification\n   <em>\n    necessary,\n   </em>\n   thereby curing it of any constitutional infirmity.

To the extent that the state claims that first time in-court identifications are necessary in cases where the eyewitness had a fair opportunity to identify the defendant before trial but was unable to do so because, otherwise, the state will not be able to present an eyewitness identification to the jury, to state this claim is to refute it. The state is not entitled to conduct an unfair procedure merely because a fair procedure failed to produce the desired result. Moreover, if the state declines to conduct a nonsuggestive identification procedure before the in-court confrontation, or if it attempts to do so but the eyewitness is unable to identify the defendant, the state is not barred from presenting\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence regarding the defendant's identity and guilt. The state still can question the eyewitness about his observations of the perpetrator at the time\n   of the crime, including his observations of the perpetrator's height, weight, sex, race, age and any other characteristics that the eyewitness was able to observe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and present any other evidence that is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We also are not persuaded by the state's argument that first time in-court identifications are necessary because there is no feasible alternative. Specifically, the state contends that it would be entirely impractical to assemble a group of individuals who closely resemble the defendant and arrange for them to appear in court, that it would be dangerous to allow a defendant to sit among the spectators in court, and that there is no source of funds to pay individuals to participate in lineups. Although numerous courts have held that it is within the trial court's discretion to order a nonsuggestive in-court identification,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   we are compelled to conclude that\n   such a procedure is no longer viable in this state since the legislature's enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 54-1p, which governs the procedures for live lineups. Although that statute applies to identification procedures conducted by police, and the defendant\n   makes no claim that it applies to in-court lineups, we believe that it would be inconsistent with the will of the legislature to allow a first time in-court identification that does not comport with the statutory procedures. We further conclude that it would be simply impracticable in a courtroom setting to present the lineup participants to the witness sequentially; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-1p (c)(1) ; and to give extensive instructions to the witness. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-1p (c)(3)(A) through (G). Nevertheless, we reject the state's claim that a traditional in-court identification is the only feasible option. Specifically, the state has not provided any convincing arguments as to why it would not be feasible to arrange for a nonsuggestive\n   <em>\n    out-of-court\n   </em>\n   lineup or photographic array, as is done routinely in cases where identity is at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

Second, it would appear that the reason that eyewitness identifications played a predominant role in early English and American history is that a large proportion of criminals who were brought into court had been caught in the act by private parties, not because first time in-court eyewitness testimony was deemed to be particularly reliable. See J. Langbein, \"The Criminal Trial before the Lawyers,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20263\">\n    45 U. Chi.

We can understand why identification evidence would predominate in an age before professional policing and well before the development of scientific techniques for generating and evaluating many of the types of circumstantial evidence now familiar to us [such as fingerprints].\"). Third, first time in-court identifications became the norm at a time when travel was by foot or by horse, communications were by post, and official investigative resources were very limited. Consequently, it presumably would have been very burdensome both for the government and for eyewitnesses to arrange for a pretrial identification of the defendant. Because the difficulty of conducting a nonsuggestive identification procedure before trial is greatly reduced by the availability of instantaneous electronic communications, ready transportation and photography, the state's interest in continuing the tradition of first time in-court identifications is similarly reduced.

See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Crayton,\n   </em>\n   supra, 470 Mass. at 243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20157\">\n    21 N.E.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a]lthough we generally place the burden on the defendant to move to suppress an identification, that makes little sense\n   where there is no out-of-court identification of the defendant by a witness and only the prosecutor knows whether he or she intends to elicit an in-court identification from the witness\"). The trial court may grant such permission only if it determines\n   that there is no factual dispute as to the identity of the perpetrator, or the ability of the particular eyewitness to identify the defendant is not at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20157\">\n    Id., at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20157\">\n    21 N.E.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding under supervisory powers that, \"[w]here an eyewitness has not participated before trial in an identification procedure, we shall treat the in-court identification as an [impermissible] in-court showup, and shall admit it in evidence only where there is 'good reason' for its admission\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20157\">\n    id., at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20157\">\n    21 N.E.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first time in-court identification may be allowed when eyewitness knew defendant before crime). For example, in cases in which the trial court determines that the only issue in dispute is whether the acts that the defendant admittedly performed constituted a crime, the court should permit a first time in-court identification. In cases in which the defendant concedes that identity or the ability of a particular witness to identify the defendant as the perpetrator is not in dispute, the state may satisfy the prescreening requirement by giving written or oral notice to that effect on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   If the trial court determines that the state will not be allowed to conduct a first time identification in court, the state may request permission to conduct a nonsuggestive identification procedure, namely, at the state's option, an out-of-court lineup or photographic array, and the trial court ordinarily should grant the state's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the witness previously has been unable to\n   identify the defendant in a nonsuggestive identification procedure, however, the court should not allow a second nonsuggestive identification procedure unless the state can provide a good reason why a second bite at the apple is warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the eyewitness is able to identify the defendant in a nonsuggestive out-of-court procedure, the state may then ask the eyewitness to identify the defendant in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   If the trial court denies a request for a nonsuggestive procedure, the state declines to conduct one, or the eyewitness is unable to identify the defendant in such a procedure, a one-on-one in-court identification\n   should not be allowed. The prosecutor may still examine the witness, however, about his or her observations of the perpetrator at the time of the crime, but the prosecutor should avoid asking the witness if the defendant resembles the perpetrator. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Greene,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654311\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/298/#p308\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654311\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/298/#p308\">\n    704 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"if there is a line between resemblance and identification testimony it is admittedly thin\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The state raises a number of objections to these procedures. First, the state contends that it is unclear what\n   level of certainty at a prior nonsuggestive identification procedure would eliminate the need for prescreening of an in-court identification. We recognize that this question may require the exercise of judgment. We conclude however, that, as a general rule, if the state has conducted a nonsuggestive out-of-court identification procedure and the witness has identified the defendant, even with some uncertainty, the in-court identification need not be prescreened for admissibility and the witness' level of uncertainty at the initial procedure should go to the weight of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the level of certainty was so low that it amounted to a failure to identify the defendant, the in-court identification should be prescreened and ordinarily disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the state contends that it is unclear what the consequence would be if a witness who is going to identify the defendant in court during trial had learned that the defendant had been charged with the crime by attending pretrial proceedings and observing the defendant. If the state was not responsible for the pretrial confrontation, this situation is analogous to any other situation in which a witness has learned the identity of the person who has been charged with the crime under suggestive circumstances that are not the result\n   of state action. Such circumstances go to the weight of the identification testimony, not its admissibility. See\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/716/\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/716/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the state was responsible for the suggestive pretrial confrontation, however, it must be treated in the same manner as a suggestive identification procedure, and the trial court must determine under the totality of the circumstances whether the witness would have been able to identify the defendant in court even without the prior suggestive confrontation. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ledbetter,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3149866\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/534/#p553\">\n    275 Conn. at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20290\">\n    881 A.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the answer to that question is yes, the court should allow the in-court identification, subject to cross-examination and argument. If the answer is no, an in-court identification should be precluded, just as an in-court identification that was irreparably tainted by an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, the state contends that, if the trial court precludes the state from\n   obtaining a first time in-court identification, fairness requires that the trial court give a jury instruction explaining that the identification was not permitted. We conclude that, if the state requests such an instruction, the trial court may provide the jury with an accurate statement of the law, specifically, that an in-court identification was not permitted because inherently suggestive first time in-court identifications create a significant risk of misidentification and because either the state declined to pursue other, less suggestive means of obtaining the identification or the eyewitness was unable to provide one. The state is not entitled to an instruction that would suggest to the jury that the eyewitness could have made a reliable identification of the defendant in court if the state had been permitted to request the witness to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the state contends that, if we preclude first time in-court identifications pursuant to our supervisory powers, the new rule must be prospective only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We have concluded, however, that first time in-court identifications implicate constitutional due process rights.

In addition, the identity of the person who assaulted Weibel was in dispute\n   and the defendant was not known to Weibel before the assault. Accordingly, we conclude that the identification testimony should have been prescreened and the state should have been required either to conduct a nonsuggestive identification procedure-in the event that the trial court concluded that the state was entitled to such a procedure even though Weibel had failed to identify the defendant in the photographic array-or to refrain from seeking an in-court identification.

Lyles testified at trial that, before the robbery at issue in the present case, he had engaged in similar robberies with the help of a friend whom he knew only as \"Black.\" On the evening of January 9, 2010, at about 8 p.m., he was at the apartment of a friend, Stephanie Perez, at 455 Trumbull Avenue in Bridgeport. Reyes was also at the apartment. At approximately 9 p.m., the defendant and the defendant's sister arrived. Lyles had known the defendant his entire life because their mothers were close friends. At some point, Lyles left the apartment and the defendant and Reyes followed him. Lyles told the men that he was planning a robbery and they indicated that they wanted\n   to participate. Lyles was armed with a .40 caliber Smith and Wesson handgun, the defendant carried a .38 caliber revolver, and Reyes carried a paintball gun that looked like an assault rifle. Lyles had supplied the weapons. After leaving the apartment, the three men proceeded to Terrace Circle in Bridgeport, where the events previously described in this opinion occurred. As Lyles and Reyes were leaving the scene after the robbery, the defendant was holding his gun to Weibel's head. Lyles then heard two gunshots. He and Reyes returned to the parking lot behind the apartment building at 455 Trumbull Avenue and got into a Cadillac owned by Perez. Approximately two minutes later, the defendant joined them. They then drove to the residence of Lyles' friend \"L\" on Louis Street in the south end of Bridgeport. At that point, Lyles asked the defendant about the shooting and the defendant stated that he had shot Weibel in the head and leg \"because we didn't get any money.\" Both Weibel and Shaw were able to identify Lyles and their testimony at trial corroborated Lyles' testimony concerning the events at Terrace Circle, specifically, that Lyles was not the shooter.\n   Lyles further testified at trial that he was currently incarcerated and that, as a result of the incident on the night of January 9, 2010, he had been charged with accessory to assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, larceny in the fifth degree, violation of probation, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit robbery. He had negotiated a tentative plea agreement with the state, which had not yet been signed, pursuant to which he would be sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, suspended sometime between three and seven years, with five years probation. He had also signed an agreement to cooperate with the state in its investigation of the present case. Pursuant to that agreement, if Lyles testified untruthfully at trial, he would serve the maximum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Lyles how he could be sentenced to the maximum sentence of approximately forty years imprisonment if he testified untruthfully when he had not yet pleaded guilty to the charges. Lyles acknowledged that the maximum sentence was not reflected in his agreement to testify. He also acknowledged that the police were investigating the three robberies that he had committed with \"Black\" and that he would not be charged in any of those cases. Lyles denied that \"Black\" was his cousin, Rasheem Davis, who was the only other person who had access to the e-mail account that Lyles had used to lure his robbery victims. Lyles admitted that he had been arrested in December, 2009, after he helped Perez steal items from a department store where he was employed, and that he had not been charged with another theft from that store. He further admitted that he had lied repeatedly to the police during their investigation of the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   On redirect examination, Lyles testified\n   that he had lied to the police before he entered into the agreement to cooperate with the state requiring him to speak truthfully.\n   The defendant presented alibi evidence in the form of testimony by his mother and his aunt that he had been with his family at a sports bar in Bridgeport watching a playoff game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys on the evening of January 9, 2010. The defendant's mother testified that kickoff was at approximately 8:30 or 9 p.m., but she did not testify as to whether the defendant was in the bar at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's aunt testified that the defendant arrived at the bar before kickoff, but she could not remember the precise time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant left the bar with his\n   mother when the game ended at approximately 11:30 p.m. The defendant's mother remembered the evening very clearly because she was an ardent Eagles fan and her husband was an ardent Cowboys fan. When the Cowboys defeated the Eagles in that football game, the defendant's mother and father had an intense argument. The defendant's aunt specifically recalled that the defendant left the bar with his mother because he stated that he was going to have to act as a referee when they got home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As we have indicated previously, Weibel acknowledged at trial that he had been unable to identify the defendant from a photographic array approximately one year after the shooting. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that Weibel's in-court identification of the defendant was nevertheless credible because \"[l]ooking at photographs is very different from looking at people. We look different from photographs.\" The prosecutor also stated, \"What kind of an impression did those moments of being hit with the gun and being shot make on [Weibel]? What burned into his mind-what image burned into his mind at that point, but the face of the person who shot him.\" Defense counsel argued that, to the contrary, the in-court identification was unreliable because Weibel had been unable to identify the defendant in the photographic array, the crime scene was dark, and the identification was not corroborated by other evidence. Defense counsel further contended that, because the defendant was the only black male sitting in the courtroom other than the uniformed marshal, and because\n   the defendant was sitting at the table with defense counsel, the in-court identification \"[was] practically a neon light pointed to the [defendant]....\" The trial court gave a lengthy instruction\n   on eyewitness identification testimony in which it stated that certainty did not correlate to accuracy and that, in determining what weight to give to Weibel's identification, the jury could consider the suggestiveness of the identification procedure, the fact that the eyewitness had failed to identify the defendant in a photographic array, and the fact that a lineup procedure is generally more reliable than a one-on-one showup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude on the basis of this record that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict even without Weibel's in-court identification of the defendant. First, although the defendant presented\n   evidence that Lyles had lied to the police in the past, there is no evidence that Lyles made any material misrepresentations or misstatements during his testimony at trial. Second, although Lyles clearly had a motive to cooperate with the state, the record does not reveal any motive for Lyles to have falsely identified the defendant as Weibel's assailant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Weibel and Shaw testified unequivocally that Lyles was not the person who had shot Weibel, and Lyles did not deny his involvement in the crime. Thus, Lyles clearly was not attempting to shift blame from himself to the defendant. In addition, the undisputed evidence\n   shows that Lyles had known the defendant his entire life and had been on friendly terms with him. Thus, there is no evidence that Lyles had a motive to harm the defendant. Third, Lyles' testimony regarding the events on the night in question was corroborated in all material respects by Weibel and Shaw. Fourth, neither of the alibi witnesses testified unequivocally that the defendant had been in the sports bar with his family at 9:30 p.m. on January 9, 2010, when the crime occurred. See footnotes 38 and 39 of this opinion. Moreover, to the extent that the testimony of the defendant's mother and aunt would support that conclusion, both witnesses had a clear motive to attempt to convince the jury that the defendant was in the bar at that time. Finally, the weaknesses in Weibel's identification testimony were highlighted both by the defendant during closing argument and by the trial court in its jury instructions. Accordingly, we conclude that the improper admission of Weibel's first time in-court identification was harmless. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court upholding the defendant's conviction on this alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, EVELEIGH and McDONALD, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   ZARELLA, J., with whom ESPINOSA, J., joins, concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Distilled to its essence, the question the court must answer in the present case is whether first time in-court identifications violate the rights guaranteed to criminal defendants under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. In addressing this question, I am mindful of the fact that the constitution\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   require the \"best practice\" or a perfect trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, my objective is not to determine which of the many alternative identification procedures is the \"best\" or is likely to result in the most reliable identification. Instead, I must consider only\n   whether first time in-court identifications are constitutionally permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the present case, the majority crafts what it describes as a \"prophylactic constitutional [rule]\" requiring the prescreening of first time in-court identifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Footnote 11 of the majority opinion. The majority's rule prohibits a first time in-court identification that is not preceded by a nonsuggestive out-of-court identification in which the eyewitness identified the defendant, unless the defendant's identity or the witness' ability to identify the defendant is not at issue in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It may well be that such prescreening\n   would be a better practice than a first time in-court identification. Indeed, I encourage law enforcement personnel to secure an out-of-court identification, through a procedure consistent with General Statutes \u00a7 54-1p, at the earliest reasonable time following the commission of a crime. My concern in the present case, however, is not what the ideal identification procedure is but whether first time in-court identifications pass constitutional scrutiny. After a review of the relevant federal authority, I conclude that they do, as long as the defendant is afforded the traditional protections of our adversary system, such as confrontation, the attendant right to cross-examine state witnesses, closing argument, jury instructions, the presumption of innocence, and the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

He further argues that the trial court abused its discretion by not excluding the identification or by not permitting a less suggestive in-court identification procedure. In addition, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court's actions were permitted by\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559687\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/465/#p469\">\n    200 Conn. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    512 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

In\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   the victim of a robbery and sexual assault was presented with an array of six photographs, from which she identified the defendant, Patrick D.

The victim was less than certain, however, about her identification.

On appeal, Smith did not challenge the photographic array but, instead, argued that the in-court identification procedure, namely, the requirement that he approach the victim and speak, was unnecessarily suggestive.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Smith conceded, however, that in-court identifications were not per se unduly suggestive.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This court rejected Smith's argument, reasoning that all trials convey the message that the state believes the person charged committed the crime, and that factor is what creates suggestion.

We also noted that the constitution requires suppression of in-court identifications only when they are tainted by unnecessarily suggestive out-of-court identification procedures and, even then, only under certain circumstances, and that there is no constitutional right to have an in-court identification conducted by lineup or some other less suggestive means.

In the present case, however, the defendant correctly asserts that such a claim has been preserved.

Second, although the facts of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and the present case are distinguishable, the governing principles employed in addressing Smith's first claim-that the in-court identification was unnecessarily suggestive-are equally applicable in the present case. As this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   in-court identifications must be excluded when they are tainted by unnecessarily suggestive out-of-court identification procedures that are conducive to irreparable misidentification.

Finally, and relatedly, notwithstanding the nearly thirty years that have passed since our decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   it remains an accurate statement of federal constitutional law regarding in-court identifications.

Citing cases in which the United States Supreme Court-a federal court established by article III, \u00a7 1, of the United States constitution-has exercised its authority to create prophylactic rules is no answer. It seems to me that the power to craft prophylactic rules under the federal constitution rests solely with the United States Congress; see, e.g., U.S. Const. amend.

As I previously stated, the defendant contends that, in light of developments in social science regarding eyewitness testimony and the inherent suggestiveness of in-court identifications,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   should be overruled. The defendant argues that first time in-court identifications either should be prescreened for reliability or excluded entirely, except for good reason. The majority agrees with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After concluding that in-court identifications are suggestive, the majority holds that first time in-court identifications\n   must be prescreened. The screening procedure that the majority adopts, however, is largely unlike any of the procedures advocated by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 5 of this opinion. First time in-court identifications are inadmissible, pursuant to the majority's approach, unless they are preceded by nonsuggestive out-of-court identifications, with a few narrow exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has not directly addressed the issue in the present case, namely, the admissibility of first time in-court identifications under the suggestive circumstances of a trial. In addition, the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have split on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After reviewing the federal jurisprudence on the admissibility of identification evidence, however, I conclude that first time in-court identifications are admissible and are not subject to prescreening. I further conclude that the approach that the majority adopts is an inappropriate prophylactic rule under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Arkansas v.

An identification made during an unnecessarily suggestive out-of-court identification procedure, however, is distinct from an identification made in court. The ills that gave the court pause in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   are not present when the first identification occurs in court\n   <em>\n    and in the presence of the judge, jury, and defense counsel.\n   </em>\n   For example, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   would exclude evidence of a lineup identification conducted without the presence of counsel and require screening of an in-court identification following such a lineup, due to the extreme difficulty of discerning, and recreating for the judge and jury, what occurred during the lineup. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wade,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p229\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   388 U.S. at 230,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p229\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, an in-court identification following an uncounseled lineup is prescreened because the absence of counsel at the lineup deprives the defendant of an opportunity to effectively scrutinize the identification at trial. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p229\">\n    id., at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p229\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court again, while discussing the reliability of identification evidence, voiced its concern regarding\n   police manipulation of eyewitness recollection, intentional or not, during the identification procedure in\n   <em>\n    Manson v.

See\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/716/\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/716/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 724-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the\n   present case, however, none of these concerns appears. First, this is not an identification procedure arranged by the police. In fact, police officers took no part in the challenged identification, ensuring that officers did not distort the witness' recollection of the perpetrator. Second, the identification occurred before the judge, jury, and defense counsel, and, therefore, defense counsel's inability to recreate the identification or discern what occurred during the identification is no longer a factor. And, third, because the identification takes place in front of defense counsel, counsel is not hindered in his cross-examination of the identifying witness.

In my view, the majority's decision is yet another instance\n   in which this court acts under the mistaken belief that justice is served when this court crafts a new legal rule in order to allow itself to step in and perform a function that is the proper province\n   of the trial court. I therefore agree with and join the concurring opinion of Justice Zarella. I particularly note my agreement with him that the majority lacks authority to announce a prophylactic rule predicated on federal constitutional law. If any court has that authority-an issue I need not resolve as it is not implicated in this appeal-it is the United States Supreme Court. The majority's failure to offer any explanation for its authority to issue such a rule, even resisting the increasingly popular resort to this court's supervisory powers, highlights the fact that the majority lays claim to a power that is without any foundation. Compounding the error, the majority not only acts without authority, but in doing so it micromanages the trial courts-again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   this court acknowledged that there is always an \"element of suggestiveness\" involved in an in-court identification procedure;\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559687\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/465/#p469\">\n    200 Conn. at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    512 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; because such a procedure \"conveys the message that the state has arrested and placed on trial a person it believes has committed the crime.\" Id., at 468-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    512 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further recognized, however, that, unless the in-court identification had been preceded by an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure that was \" 'conducive to irreparable misidentification,' \" the suggestiveness involved in an in-court identification does not implicate the due process clause. Id., at 470,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    512 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court explained, because the \"manner in which in-court identifications are conducted is not of constitutional magnitude,\" the admissibility of such identifications \"rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20A.2d%20189\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Justice Zarella's concurring opinion thoroughly and cogently explains why the principles that this court relied on in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   to conclude that in-court\n   identifications do not violate a defendant's right to due process remain valid and controlling. Today, however, the majority departs from all other jurisdictions by adopting a prophylactic rule that applies to all first time in-court identifications. In doing so, the majority invades the province of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The unwieldy nature of the majority's rule illustrates that it attempts to perform a task more suited to the trial court. In order to make its general rule \"fit\" to the task, the majority tries to anticipate possible contingencies, constructing a rule that reads like a complicated flowchart. A brief summary of the general rule and all of its permutations is illustrative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The general rule announced by the majority is that \"in-court identifications that are not preceded by a successful identification in a nonsuggestive identification procedure ... must be prescreened by the trial court.\" (Footnote omitted.) So, when there has been no pretrial identification, and the state intends to present a first time in-court identification, it must first ask permission from the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But what if the defendant is a person known to the witness? In that case, the majority explains, the state need only give notice to that effect on the record to satisfy the prescreening requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   What if the defendant fails to dispute or concedes the ability of the witness to identify him? The state must provide notice on the record of that fact to satisfy the prescreening requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   What if the defendant concedes that he performed the actions at issue, and only disputes that his actions constituted a crime? The state must provide notice on the record of such concession to satisfy the prescreening requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   If the trial court determines that the state may not perform a first time identification\n   in court, then the state may request permission to perform an out-of-court identification procedure, and the court\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   should grant the state's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   But what if the witness already has participated in a nonsuggestive identification procedure, and failed to identify the defendant? In order to be allowed to conduct a second identification procedure, the state must \"provide a good reason\" why the court should allow it. The majority acknowledges that it cannot \"catalogue\" all of the reasons that could justify a court's decision to allow a second identification procedure, but offers two examples: if the state already conducted a photographic array and now wishes to conduct a lineup, or when the witness was threatened or intimidated before the first identification procedure. See footnote 30 of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   If the witness did identify the defendant in a previous, nonsuggestive procedure, but with \"some uncertainty,\" the majority states, due process generally does not require that the court prescreen the in-court identification. The level of uncertainty goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. If the uncertainty of the witness during the prior identification procedure was so great that it amounted to a failure to identify the defendant however the in-court identification procedure would be subject to prescreening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   What if the witness learned that the defendant had been charged with a crime and the witness attended pretrial proceedings, thus observing the defendant? If the state was not responsible for the pretrial confrontation, then those facts go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   What if the state was responsible for the presence of the witness at the pretrial proceedings? In that case,\n   the trial court must determine under the totality of the circumstances whether \"the witness would have been able to identify the defendant in court even without the prior suggestive confrontation.\" If the answer is yes, then the in-court identification should be allowed. If the answer is no, then no in-court identification should be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The many alternatives that the majority attempts to anticipate in its rule reveal that it has taken upon itself a task for which this court is not suited. The supervision of procedures and the managing of evidence should be left to the sound discretion of the trial court. The defendant's protections against the suggestiveness of an in-court identification, as Justice Zarella explains in his concurring opinion, are the \"traditional protections of our adversary system, such as confrontation, the attendant right to cross-examine state witnesses, closing argument, jury instructions, the presumption of innocence, and the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The trial court, presiding over the proceedings, is in the best position to ensure that all of these traditional protections operate to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. The majority's effort to substitute its own broad rule for the myriad decisions that a trial judge must make as a case evolves is ill-adapted to the task at hand, as illustrated by the multiple contingencies that the majority attempts to anticipate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   What is more troubling than the poor fit of the majority's rule is that today's decision is part of an emerging pattern of judicial activism in this court. I have already noted this trend in a previous dissenting opinion, but because of the risk posed to the rule of law, the observation bears repeating. Today's decision is one among a disturbing line of cases in which this court has exceeded \"the constitutional bounds of its power in order to impose its personal notion of what justice and fairness\n   require.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For instance, in the present case, as Justice Zarella explains thoroughly in his concurring opinion, by announcing its prophylactic rule predicated on federal constitutional law, the majority purports to exercise authority that,\n   <em>\n    if enjoyed by any court at all,\n   </em>\n   belongs only to the United States Supreme Court. See\n   <em>\n    Ohio v.

Moreover, as Justice Robinson observes in his concurring opinion, because the state has prevailed in this appeal, the majority's conclusion is \"virtually unreviewable,\" unless the United States Supreme Court departs from its normal practice of denying petitions for certiorari filed by prevailing parties. As I have explained in this concurring opinion, the majority's rule also encroaches on the role of the trial court by attempting to supervise proceedings at that court by universal rule, rather than allowing the trial court to manage the proceedings in each case as they develop. Because I believe that this court best serves the rule of law and justice by recognizing the limits of its role and acting within those limits, I respectfully concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    This court held in\n    <em>\n     State v.

We do not agree with Justice Zarella that this language clearly indicates that Justice Ginsburg believed that state courts lack the authority to adopt prophylactic rules to protect rights guaranteed by the federal constitution. Rather, it appears to us that Justice Ginsburg may have incorrectly assumed both that prophylactic rules, like the one adopted in\n    <em>\n     Miranda,\n    </em>\n    are adopted pursuant to a court's supervisory powers and that supervisory rules adopted by the United States Supreme Court are binding on the states. Although our decisions announcing federal constitutional rules are, for reasons of\n    <em>\n     federalism,\n    </em>\n    not binding on other state courts, it is beyond dispute that this court has the authority to announce federal constitutional rules that, in our opinion, have force in all jurisdictions; see, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Giaimo v. New Haven,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963505\" index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/481/#p509\">\n     257 Conn. 481\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 509,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2033\">\n     778 A.2d 33\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001) (for purposes of invoking due process provisions of federal constitution, \"an applicant for a statutory benefit ... has a protected property interest in the benefit when, under the governing statute, the decision-making body would have no discretion to deny the application if the applicant could establish at a hearing that it met the statutory criteria\"); and we have concluded in the present case that the procedures that we adopt herein are required to protect due process rights under the federal constitution. Of course, if other states disagree with our decision, they can decline to follow it and, if the United States Supreme Court disagrees, that court has the authority to overrule our decision. That would not mean, however, that we lacked the authority to adopt prophylactic rules that we believe are necessary to protect rights guaranteed by the federal constitution in the first instance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    In her concurring opinion, Justice Espinosa states that, by adopting this prophylactic rule, we have \"[laid] claim to a power that is without any foundation,\" and she suggests that our decision is \"part of an emerging pattern of judicial activism in this court.\" There simply is no doubt, however, that this court has the power to interpret the federal constitution and to apply its interpretation to actions of the state and its constituent parts, including prosecutors and trial courts. Indeed, Justice Espinosa and Justice Zarella make no claim to the contrary, but simply disagree with our conclusion that first time in-court identifications violate the due process provisions of the federal constitution when the witness would not have been able to identify the defendant in a nonsuggestive out-of-court procedure. In our view, having found that first time in-court identifications implicate the due process provisions of the federal constitution, it is indisputable that our power to take steps to prevent such constitutional violations is an inherent aspect of our basic constitutional function of interpreting the law, and certainly does not constitute judicial activism.

Moreover, \u00a7 54-1p expressly describes procedures for avoiding undue suggestiveness. If the defendant's appearance has changed since the time of the crime, the state has the option of producing a photographic array with photographs of the defendant as he appeared at the time of the crime and similar looking individuals or of conducting a lineup with individuals who look similar to the defendant at the time of the trial. If the defendant's appearance has changed so much from the time of the crime that the eyewitness would not be able to recognize the defendant in a nonsuggestive lineup, it is no solution to allow the state to conduct a suggestive in-court identification. The possibility of the defendant's appearance changing over time is one of many reasons that the state should conduct an identification procedure at the earliest possible time when identity is at issue in a case.\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.

Even if it is true that police have stopped using lineups because it is difficult to conduct them in a nonsuggestive manner, that, again, is no reason to allow a highly suggestive in-court identification.

Indeed, the court in\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    expressly stated that its prior decisions on this issue 'turn on the presence of state action' ... and ... the state in the present case does not dispute that a prosecutor's conduct in court constitutes state action.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.) Part II of the majority opinion. Certainly, the court in\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    did use state action and police conduct interchangeably. On the other hand, the majority overstates the state's concession regarding state action. In fact, the state contends that \"the [United States Supreme] Court clearly mean[t] to signify police or other law enforcement actors involved in\n    <em>\n     extrajudicial\n    </em>\n    investigation,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    prosecutors presenting evidence in court.\" (Emphasis added.) The state further claims that\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    cannot be read to mean that the presentation of evidence in court by a prosecutor is the kind of state action that triggers the\n    <em>\n     Biggers\n    </em>\n    due process protections. The state may be correct. If the majority's reading of\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    is correct, it produces a confounding result. I can think of no reasonable basis for distinguishing between the state action of a prosecutor entering into evidence a suggestive out-of-court identification, not arranged by law enforcement, and the state action of a prosecutor eliciting a first time in-court identification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-119\">\n   ROBINSON, J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I share the majority's concern about the inherently suggestive nature of first time in-court identifications at criminal trials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I am, however, concerned about the majority's election to decide the merits of the\n   federal constitutional issues concerning such identifications raised by the defendant, Andrew Dickson, under these circumstances. In my view, this court's analysis more appropriately starts and ends with part V of the majority opinion, which \"assume[s] that [the] in-court identification of the defendant [by one of the victims] was improperly admitted,\" but nevertheless \"conclude[s] that any due process\n   violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Given this conclusion, I believe that parts I through IV of the majority opinion appear to be inconsistent with our long held commitment to avoid unnecessarily deciding constitutional issues.

The ultimate judgment of the United States Supreme Court would have no practical effect whatsoever on the judgment of this court affirming the defendant's convictions. Thus, given the majority's conclusion in part V of its opinion that the state has proven any identification error in this case harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not think it advisable to rely on the prospect of the United States Supreme Court's review to encourage us to go out on a federal constitutional limb with respect to the complex constitutional\n   issue presented by the merits of the defendant's challenge to his first time in-court identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I join in the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    I adopt the majority's terminology in that I use \"first time in-court identification\" to refer to instances \"in which the witness has not successfully identified the defendant in a prior out-of-court identification procedure\"; footnote 3 of the majority opinion; either because the witness did not have such opportunity or had the opportunity but nonetheless was unable to identify the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    In this opinion, I use the word \"nonsuggestive\" as the majority does, namely, to refer to an identification procedure that is not unnecessarily suggestive. See footnote 2 of the majority opinion. I also note that the majority does not-nor could it-overrule our existing case law regarding the admissibility of evidence of out-of-court identifications or in-court identifications that follow successful out-of-court identifications. Thus, if the nonsuggestive out-of-court identification required by the rule that the majority announces today is in fact an unnecessarily suggestive identification, a subsequent in-court identification is not necessarily inadmissible. Instead, the admissibility of such an identification will be determined by applying our current two-pronged test: \"[F]irst, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and, second,\n    <em>\n     if it is found to have been so,\n    </em>\n    it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the totality of the circumstances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State v.

Third, the court could review the reliability of first time in-court identifications using the factors that social science has identified as influencing the reliability of eyewitness identifications generally (system variables and estimator variables); see, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     State v.
