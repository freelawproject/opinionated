The plaintiff, Lisa J. Cefaratti, brought a medical malpractice action against the defendants, Jonathan S. Aranow, Shoreline Surgical Associates, P.C. (Shoreline),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Middlesex\n   Hospital (Middlesex), alleging that Aranow had left a surgical sponge in the plaintiff's abdominal cavity during gastric bypass surgery. She further alleged that Middlesex was both directly liable for its own negligence during the surgery and vicariously liable for Aranow's negligence, because Middlesex had held Aranow out to the public as its agent or employee. Thereafter, Middlesex filed a motion for summary judgment claiming, among other things, that the plaintiff did not have a viable claim of vicarious liability against it because Aranow was not its actual agent or employee and the doctrine of apparent agency is not recognized in tort actions in this state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court agreed with Middlesex and granted its motion for summary judgment on the vicarious liability claim. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti v. Aranow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%201\">\n    154 Conn.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20265\">\n    105 A.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). We then granted the plaintiff's petition for certification to appeal on the following issue: \"Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the\n   doctrine of apparent authority does not apply to\n   actions sounding in tort?\"\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti v. Aranow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20919\">\n    315 Conn. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20960\">\n    107 A.3d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We answer that question in the negative. We also conclude that, because we are adopting a new standard for establishing an apparent agency in tort actions, the case must be remanded to the trial court to provide the plaintiff with an opportunity to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of the doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record, which we view in the light most favorable to the plaintiff for purposes of reviewing the trial court's rendering of summary judgment, reveals the following facts and procedural history. At some point prior to December, 2003, the plaintiff decided that she wanted to undergo gastric bypass surgery. The plaintiff knew that Aranow performed this type of surgery because he had performed the procedure on her partner's mother, with very good results. The plaintiff researched the matter and determined that Aranow was considered to be the best gastric bypass surgeon in the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before Aranow would accept the plaintiff as a patient and perform the surgery, the plaintiff was required to attend a seminar that Aranow conducted at Middlesex. In addition, she attended a number of informational sessions at Middlesex that were conducted by Aranow's staff. The plaintiff received a pamphlet at one of the informational sessions that had been prepared by Middlesex and that stated that \"the health care team who will be caring for you has developed an education program that is full of important information.\" In addition, the pamphlet stated that \"[t]he team will go over every aspect of your stay with us. We will discuss what you should do at home before your operation, what to bring with you, and events on the day of surgery.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff assumed that Aranow was an employee of Middlesex because he had privileges there, and she relied on this belief when she chose to undergo surgery at Middlesex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 8, 2003, Aranow performed gastric bypass surgery on the plaintiff at Middlesex. On August 6, 2009, after being diagnosed with breast cancer by another physician, the plaintiff underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan revealed the presence of foreign material in the plaintiff's abdominal cavity. On September 9, 2009, the plaintiff met with Aranow, who informed her that the object in her abdominal cavity was a surgical sponge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action alleging, among other things, that Aranow\n   had negligently failed to remove the surgical sponge from her abdominal cavity during the gastric bypass surgery and that Middlesex was vicariously liable for Aranow's negligence because it had held Aranow out as its agent or employee. Middlesex then filed a motion for summary judgment in which it contended that the plaintiff's claim of vicarious liability was barred because Middlesex was not Aranow's employer and the doctrine of apparent authority is not recognized as a basis for tort liability in this state as a matter of law. The plaintiff objected to Middlesex' motion for summary judgment claiming that, contrary to its contention, the doctrine of apparent agency has been recognized in this state. The plaintiff also contended that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Middlesex had held out Aranow as its agent or employee and whether the plaintiff had acted in reliance on her belief that that was the case. Relying on the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    L &amp; V Contractors, LLC v. Heritage Warranty Ins. Risk Retention Group, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780225\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/662/\">\n    136 Conn.App. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20A.3d%20887\">\n    47 A.3d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), the trial court concluded that the doctrine of apparent agency has not been recognized in this state. See id., at 670,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20A.3d%20887\">\n    47 A.3d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"this court has held that the doctrine of apparent authority cannot be used to hold a principal liable for the tortious actions of its alleged agent\"). Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff's claim of vicarious liability against Middlesex was barred as a matter of law and it rendered summary judgment for Middlesex on that claim. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti v. Aranow,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%201\">\n    154 Conn.App. at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20265\">\n    105 A.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This certified appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims on appeal that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the doctrine of apparent agency has not been recognized in the state as a basis for vicarious liability in actions sounding in tort. Middlesex contends that, to the contrary, the plaintiff has confused the doctrine of apparent authority, which expands the authority of an actual agent, with the doctrine of apparent agency, which creates an agency relationship that would not otherwise exist, and the Appellate Court properly held that the doctrine of apparent agency has been expressly rejected as a basis for tort liability in this state. Middlesex further contends that, even if the doctrine of apparent agency is generally applicable in tort actions, hospitals may not be held vicariously liable for the medical malpractice of their agents or apparent agents. Finally, Middlesex contends that, even if hospitals may be held vicariously liable for medical malpractice, the plaintiff has failed to establish the elements of the doctrine in the present case.\n   \"The standard of review of a trial court's decision granting summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary.... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in\n   the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gold v.

This authority to act as agent may be conferred if the principal affirmatively or intentionally, or by lack of ordinary care, causes or allows third persons to act on an apparent agency. It is essential to the application of the above general rule that two important facts be clearly established: (1) that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in question, or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority; and (2) that the person dealing with the agent knew of the facts and acting in good faith had reason to believe and did believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority. The apparent power of an agent is to be determined by the acts of the principal and not by the acts of the agent; a principal is responsible for the acts of an agent within his apparent authority only where the principal himself by his acts or conduct has clothed the agent\n   with the appearance of authority, and not where the agent's own conduct has created the apparent authority. The liability of the principal is determined in any particular case, however, not merely by what was the apparent authority of the agent, but by what authority the third person, exercising reasonable care and prudence, was justified in believing that the principal had by his acts under the circumstances conferred upon his agent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20A.2d%20347\">\n    Id., at 496-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20A.2d%20347\">\n    18 A.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After setting forth these legal principles, this court concluded that, under the specific facts of the case, \"Plant was not acting ... even in the apparent or ostensible scope of his authority.

Although this court in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   did not expressly analyze the issue of whether the doctrine of apparent authority should apply, it clearly believed that the doctrine did apply in tort cases. Nothing in the language of this court's decision suggests that this court had merely assumed, without deciding, that the defendants could be held vicariously liable for the tortfeasor's negligence. Moreover, this court has characterized its decision in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   as \"\n   <em>\n    applying\n   </em>\n   \" the doctrine of apparent authority in a tort case. (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

Rather, it contends that there is a distinction between the doctrine of apparent authority and the doctrine of apparent agency, and that\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   recognized only the former. We agree with Middlesex that\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Co.\n   </em>\n   involved the doctrine of apparent authority, not the doctrine of apparent agency, and that there is a useful semantic distinction between the two doctrines. Specifically, the doctrine of apparent authority expands the authority of an actual agent, while the doctrine of apparent agency creates an agency relationship that would not otherwise exist. See footnote 6 of this opinion. We do not agree, however, that this distinction between the two doctrines justifies recognizing one, but not the other. As in many\n   other jurisdictions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   it has been the rule in this state for courts to use the terms apparent agency and apparent authority interchangeably.

See footnote 26 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nevertheless, although their doctrinal underpinnings are not entirely clear, we ultimately are persuaded by the cases that have concluded that, under certain circumstances, proof of detrimental reliance is not required to establish an apparent agency in tort actions. Specifically, many courts, especially in cases seeking to hold a hospital vicariously liable for a physician's malpractice, have concluded that an apparent agency is established when the plaintiff proves that he or she looked to the principal to provide services and the principal, not the plaintiff, selected the specific person who actually provided the services and\n   caused the plaintiff's injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   These courts have not required the plaintiff to\n   establish detrimental reliance on the principal's representations\n   that the tortfeasor was the principal's agent or employee, i.e., that the plaintiff would not have\n   accepted the tortfeasor's services if the plaintiff had known that the tortfeasor was not the principal's agent. Indeed, many cases have held that the plaintiff is not even required to present affirmative evidence that he or she actually and reasonably believed that the tortfeasor was the principal's agent or employee. Rather, the cases appear to hold that such belief may be presumed from the fact that the plaintiff chose the principal and the principal chose the specific person who provided the services,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the fact the principal was the actual\n   cause of the relationship between the plaintiff and the tortfeasor that resulted in injury is sufficient justification to apply the doctrine.

First, cases in which the plaintiff accepted a principal's offer of services and the principal then chose the specific person who would provide the services have contractual overtones, and detrimental reliance is implicit in a contractual relationship. See 1 Restatement (Second), Torts, supra, \u00a7 8, comment (d), p. 33 (\"it is not irrational to hold that merely entering into a contract is a change of position which would enable the third person to bring an action against the principal\" for negligence of independent contractor employed by principal). Second, when an entity has held itself out as providing certain services to the public-and, indeed, may have made great efforts to persuade members of the public to avail themselves of those services, and\n   benefited from doing so\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and has selected the specific individual who will provide\n   those services to particular members of the public, we do not believe that it is unfair to hold that entity liable for the individual's negligence. Third, and relatedly, holding principals liable under these circumstances is consistent with the fundamental purposes of the tort compensation system of deterring wrongful conduct and shifting the blame to the party who is in the best position to prevent the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Mendillo v.

A party must also prove reliance upon the representation and a change of position to his detriment in reliance on the representation.\"); 1 Restatement (Second), Agency, supra, \u00a7 267 (\"[o]ne who represents that another is his servant or other agent and thereby causes a third person justifiably to rely upon the care or skill of such apparent agent is subject to liability to the third person for harm caused by the lack of care or skill of the one appearing to be a servant or other agent as if he were such\"). It would make little sense to hold a principal vicariously liable for the negligence of a person who was not an agent or an employee of the principal when the plaintiff would have dealt with the apparent agent regardless of the principal's representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, we adopt the following alternative standards for establishing apparent agency in tort cases. First, the plaintiff may establish apparent agency by proving that: (1) the principal held itself out as providing certain services; (2) the plaintiff selected the principal on the basis of its representations; and (3) the plaintiff relied on the principal to select the specific person who performed the services that resulted in the harm complained of by the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff may establish apparent agency in a tort action by proving the traditional elements of the doctrine of apparent agency, as set forth in our cases involving contract claims, plus detrimental reliance. Specifically, the plaintiff may prevail by establishing that: (1) the principal held the apparent agent or employee out to the public as possessing the authority to engage in the conduct at issue, or knowingly permitted the apparent agent or employee to act as having such authority; (2) the plaintiff\n   knew of these acts by the principal, and actually and reasonably believed that the agent or employee or apparent agent or employee possessed the necessary authority; see\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co. v.

We emphasize that this standard is narrow, and we anticipate that it will be only in the rare tort action that the plaintiff will be able to establish the elements of apparent agency by proving detrimental reliance.

Those who are learned in the law, however, understand that this is an oversimplification of our constitutional order. Since before the founding, judges in England, from whom the judiciary takes many of its traditions, and this country, acting as stewards of the common law, have engaged in lawmaking. As such, judges, not legislators, at least in the early years of our republic, tended to the development of the law in such areas as property, contract, and tort. Thus, a disconnect exists between our elementary understanding of the separation and delegation of the powers and duties of government, on the one hand, and the actual allocation of work among the branches, on the other. In addition, there is a small area over which both the judiciary and the legislature have the authority to enact policy. In the beginning, such dual authority was relatively unproblematic. Legislatures largely dealt with public law, and the courts tended to private law. See, e.g., D. Farber &amp; P. Frickey, \"In the Shadow of the Legislature: The Common Law in the Age of the New Public Law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20875\">\n    89 Mich. L.Rev. 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (1991). In the age of the regulatory state and statutory proliferation, however, the legislature has\n   become increasingly involved with private law; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 30-102 (abrogating common-law negligence cause of action against purveyors of alcohol for injuries caused by intoxicated persons); General Statutes \u00a7 52-557d (abolishing common-law defense of charitable immunity); General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (b), (c) and (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) (eliminating, in certain cases, doctrine of contributory negligence, providing for proportionate, rather than joint and several, liability in cases involving multiple tortfeasors, and abolishing doctrines of last clear chance and assumption of risk); raising this pragmatic question: What is the role of the common-law judge in the era of the ever engaged legislature? The present case brings this question to the forefront.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Before I reach that question, however, I must attend to a preliminary matter. The plaintiff in the present case, Lisa J. Cefaratti, claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the doctrine of apparent agency does not extend to tort actions, thereby preventing her from holding the defendant Middlesex Hospital (hospital) vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of the named defendant, Jonathan S. Aranow, a surgeon who is not an employee of the hospital but who has privileges to and does perform surgeries at the hospital. The plaintiff argues that such conclusion is contrary to our holdings in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co. v.

In response to the hospital's\n   argument that this court has extended apparent\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   to tort actions but has not, and should not, extend apparent\n   <em>\n    agency\n   </em>\n   to such cases, the plaintiff\n   contends that this court's jurisprudence does not distinguish between the two doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I need not decide whether our case law recognizes a difference between apparent agency and apparent authority or, if it does, whether such distinction provides a principled reason for applying one doctrine to tort actions but not the other. Instead, I conclude that this court has never decided whether either doctrine should be available to plaintiffs seeking to hold individuals or entities vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of another. I must, therefore, consider that question as a matter of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.,\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff insurer brought a subrogation action against the defendant country club (club), among others, to recover for amounts the insurer had paid to its insured for damages caused to the insured's vehicle by an employee of the club.\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co. v.

The majority reasons that the there is no language in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   to suggest that the court was simply assuming, without deciding, that the club could be held vicariously liable for the employee's negligence under that doctrine. In addition, the court in\n   <em>\n    Hanson,\n   </em>\n   the majority and the plaintiff argue, recognized\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   as applying apparent authority in tort actions. Finally, the majority cites the hospital's acknowledgment that\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   extended the doctrine of apparent authority to tort actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the plaintiff's and the majority's reading of\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.,\n   </em>\n   and their rationales for such a reading. First, I doubt that this court adopted a liability expanding doctrine without some consideration and discussion. Generally, this court weighs the relevant policy considerations when deciding whether to expand or limit tort liability by adopting new doctrines or creating new causes of action. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Campos v.

In the absence of any indication that the court in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   gave any thought to the policy considerations implicated by a decision to extend liability to purported principals by adopting the doctrine of apparent authority in tort actions, I will not so readily assume that it did. Second, neither the plaintiff insurer nor the defendant club in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   briefed the issue of whether apparent authority should apply in tort actions;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   see generally\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co. v.

Thus, I return to the question that I previously raised: What is the role of a common-law judge in the era of the ever engaged legislature? In this particular case, which involves the allocation of liability among the different functionaries in a complex and highly regulated industry, I believe it is wise to defer to the legislature to address this issue in the first instance. Of course, I do not dispute that this court has the authority to decide the issue presented, as I have framed it. Instead, I simply suggest that we should refrain from doing so, as a matter of prudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This court has long espoused the principle that the legislature, and not this institution, shall set the policy of the state.

I acknowledge, as I must, that many of these cases involved statutory law rather than the common law and, therefore, are different from the present case, which falls within the common-law sphere of torts.

There are a variety of questions that arise in the context of considering whether to expand liability and, relatedly, who should bear the burden for such liability. For example,\n   in the present case, in determining whether hospitals should be vicariously liable for the malpractice of non-employee physicians and surgeons, a policy maker might desire a comprehensive understanding of general staffing arrangements at area hospitals, gather data regarding the number and outcomes of malpractice actions, and query the current remedies available to malpractice victims and the inadequacy, if any, of such remedies. Prior to making a determination, the decision maker might also consider General Statutes \u00a7 20-11b (a), which requires certain medical providers to maintain minimum liability insurance, and collect cases, if any exist, in which such minimum coverage was insufficient to adequately compensate patients who had been victims of medical malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional factors ripe for consideration are (1) the impact such expansion of liability has had in other jurisdictions, on both hospital financing and medical malpractice actions, and (2) the myriad regulations that currently govern the health-care industry and health-care providers. Through public hearings, the legislature can collect data and receive testimony in regard to such matters from industry leaders and affected members of society, including the plaintiff's bar. The legislature may also consult outside experts and elicit input from state regulators. Moreover, the legislature can enact comprehensive reform, establishing the boundaries of liability and providing predictability to health-care institutions and their insurers. Finally, determining who should bear the burden for harm caused by medical malpractice is a value judgment, and the legislature, as an elected body, may be\n   held accountable if the allocation it makes is not in line with societal values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, the Judicial Branch is ill equipped to methodically address questions of liability expansion with potentially far-reaching societal consequences. In answering such a question, courts are limited to the record created and the evidence introduced by the parties. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    West Farms Mall, LLC v. West Hartford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668826\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/1/#p27\">\n    279 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%20649\">\n    901 A.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (observing that appellate \"review is limited to matters in the record\"). Moreover, courts, unlike the legislature, are not free to consult outside sources and to collect their own data. Instead, they are confined by rules of judicial\n   notice. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"698231\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/173/120/#p121\">\n    173 Conn. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%201085\">\n    376 A.2d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (\"[o]ur own cases have attempted to draw a line between matters susceptible of explanation or contradiction, of which notice should not be taken without giving the affected party an opportunity to be heard ... and matters of established fact, the accuracy of which cannot be questioned ... which may be judicially noticed without affording a hearing\" [citations omitted] ). In addition, courts are limited to deciding the cases and questions before them. Consequently, they develop policy on an ad hoc basis and on the basis of the facts presented in each case, which creates uncertainty. The present case provides an example. Despite holding that hospitals, in some cases, may be vicariously liable for the negligence of nonemployee physicians and surgeons, the majority does not decide whether an exception for such liability should exist when the hospital informs patients that certain physicians or surgeons are not employed by the hospital. See footnote 27 of the majority opinion. Instead, the majority simply states that that question is not before the court in this case, and, therefore, it must be left for another day.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%201085\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Finally, members of this court, unlike\n   the elected bodies of government, cannot be held accountable for the value judgments they reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally, deference to the legislature seems to be a particularly prudent course of action in the present case because hospitals are highly regulated institutions within a highly regulated industry. Hospitals are subject to certificate of need requirements, limiting their ability, for example, to purchase certain equipment or to add and discontinue certain services without first receiving approval from the Department of Public Health. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-638 (a). In addition, hospitals are licensed by the Department of Public Health and must comply with regulations regarding, among other things, physical plant, medical staffing, medical records, and emergency planning. See, e.g., Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 19-13-D3, 19-13-D4a and 19-13-D5. As a payor of health-care services, the state also has a large impact on hospital financing. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 17b-239 (a)(2) ( \"Medicaid rates paid to acute care and children's hospitals shall be based on diagnosis-related groups established and periodically rebased by the Commissioner of Social Services\"). Due to the complex regulatory scheme governing health-care facilities, it is my view that this court should not disturb the careful balance that the legislature has achieved by exposing hospitals to vicarious liability for injuries caused by nonemployees. Instead, I would defer to the judgment of the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, the arrival of any new era is necessarily accompanied by the end of another. Thus, the modern age of growing complexity and rapid change, in my view, brings to an end the period in which this court should make sweeping, common-law jurisprudential changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the legislature, which has become\n   ever engaged in the common-law sphere, is institutionally better equipped to continue the development of the common law. Moreover, the legislature, an elected body with public processes, is designed to reflect the morality and experience of our time. Law giving by the legislature is more democratic, and it also is less likely to do serious\n   harm. Accordingly, I conclude that this court should refrain from recognizing the doctrine of apparent agency in tort actions and, instead, defer to the judgment of the legislature regarding whether hospitals should be subject to vicarious liability for the malpractice of nonemployee health-care providers. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The plaintiff alleged that Shoreline was Aranow's employer and that Shoreline was directly liable to her for its own negligence.

Moreover, although the issue is not before us, we note that a principal that is held vicariously liable for another's negligence under the doctrine of apparent agency may be able to seek indemnification from the tortfeasor, an option that is not available to an insurer.

The amicus further contends that liability insurers will be unable \"to rate, review, and collect premiums\" for this risk. The amicus has not explained, however, why liability insurers will lack this ability. Insurance companies regularly insure large and immensely complex enterprises. Indeed, the doctrine of apparent authority has been widely adopted; see footnote 26 of this opinion; and the amicus has pointed to no evidence of an insurance crisis in the states where it is recognized.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Many of these cases use the phrases \"apparent authority\" and \"apparent agency\" interchangeably.
