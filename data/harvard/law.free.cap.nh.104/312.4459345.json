H. 111, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The plaintiff introduced testimony through the clerk of court that \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d a joint letter, dated May 11, 1961 properly addressed, was sent to the attorneys of both parties, notifying them of the hearing to be held on May 23, 1961. This was evidence that such a letter was received by the defendant\u2019s clerk (1 Wigmore, Evidence, (3d <em>ed.) s. </em>95) as it indisputably was by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. On the defendant\u2019s denial that it received notice, all of the evidentiary facts were to be weighed, and the question then became one for the Presiding Justice to resolve upon the evidence before it. <em>Magazine Repeating Razor Co. </em>v. <em>Weissbard, </em>125 N.
