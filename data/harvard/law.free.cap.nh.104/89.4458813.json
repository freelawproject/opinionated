Contrary to the usual argument advanced in such cases it is urged that it says too much rather than too little.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Pleadings should be stated with sufficient conciseness and clarity so that the \u201ccase may be rightly understood.\u201d RSA 514:8. \u201cThe defendant is entitled to be informed of the theory on which the plaintiffs are proceeding and the redress they claim as a result of defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Morency </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>96 N. H. 344, 346. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration fails to meet this standard. Certain of his \u201cClaims\u201d state no separate cause of action and the declaration is so prolix that it does not inform the defendant of the theory on which the plaintiff is proceeding. <em>Morency </em>v. <em>Plourde, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">While the defendant was not entitled to have the action abated, the plaintiff should be required to amend to state more precisely the grounds upon which he seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
