Watkins. On August 27, 1925, Watkins conveyed to the plaintiff John Cragin and C. H. Goldthrite a tract of land on Blaisdell Lake in Sutton, New Hampshire, hereinafter known as Tract #1, which was bounded and described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\u201cBeginning at iron pin in a stone on the shore of said lake thence running southerly 48 feet to iron pin in stone \u2014thence westerly by land of said Watkins land 80 feet to iron pin in stone \u2014 thence northerly by right of way 40 feet to iron pin in stone \u2014 thence easterly by land of said Watkins 80 feet to first named bound the said Goldthrite and Cragin have the right of way to cross land of said Watkins at any and all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">As later appears, the former Watkins tract to the north of this lot is now owned by the defendants, C. George and Evelyn L. Woollett. The tract bounding #1 on the south, hereinafter known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>as Tract #2, wras deeded by Watkins to the plaintiff John Cragin and Goldthrite on August 18, 1927. It was bounded on the south by the land of Elizabeth Woodward and described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cA certain tract of land located on the shore of Blaisdell Lake in Sutton, N. H. Bounded and described as follows \u2014 Beginning at a, iron pin on the shore of said lake running southerly 48 feet to iron pin and land of Elizabeth Woodward \u2014 Thence running westerly 80 feet to iron pin \u2014 Thence northerly 40 feet to iron pin \u2014 Thence easterly 80 feet to first named bound.\u201d There is no mention here of any right of way across what is now the defendants\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Both of these tracts, at the time they were conveyed, were reached from the state highway by a rough road running north and south over Watkins\u2019 land and lying westerly of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. This road was later accepted by the town and named Watkins Avenue, but when the deeds were passed it had no name. The layout of the road by the town left a narrow strip between it and the plaintiffs\u2019 tracts 80 feet long from north to south, 11 feet wide at the north end and 22 feet wide at the south end.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">On June 14, 1935, Watkins deeded this strip, hereinafter called plaintiffs\u2019 Tract #3, to John Cragin and Goldthrite. It is described as running \u201cnorth-westerly by said Watkins Avenue, a distance of 80 feet.\u201d Again there is no mention of any right of way across what is now the defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">After the death of Goldthrite, his widow deeded her share of all three of the above lots to the plaintiff John Cragin on April 7, 1953 and he, at the same time, deeded them to himself and his wife, the plaintiff Catherine. The description of these lots in the deeds followed the descriptions in the three original deeds from Watkins to Cragin and Goldthrite.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The two tracts immediately south of the plaintiffs\u2019 lands were conveyed by Watkins to Elizabeth A. Woodward, the first on August 27, 1925, the same date as the first conveyance to the plaintiff John Cragin and Goldthrite, and the second on September 11, 1926. The first deed, covering a lot of land hereinafter to be known as Woodward\u2019s #1, included \u201cthe right of way across said Watkins land at all times,\u201d but the deed of the second lot, hereinafter known as Woodward\u2019s #2, included no such grant but was bounded on the west by a \u201cright of way.\u201d Both parcels had the same depth of 80 feet as the plaintiffs\u2019 lots. On November 6, 1930, Watkins deeded to Woodward a strip lying between her two lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and what is now Watkins Avenue. Again there was no mention of any right of way across that portion of Watkins\u2019 land which is now the defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The plaintiff John Cragin testified unequivocally that Mrs. Woodward entered the lot she first purchased on August 27, 1925 \u2014 the same day the plaintiff made his first purchase \u2022\u2014 directly from Watkins Avenue. He added that to do so she came in from the state road, \u201cthe same road that [he] did,\u201d passing by what is now the defendants\u2019 lot and then by the plaintiffs\u2019 #1 and #2 lots, without crossing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Watkins retained the tract next north of plaintiffs\u2019 #1 lot until his death. It apparently then passed to his brother, and upon his decease to his brother\u2019s wife. She conveyed it to Dorothy Killam on September 6, 1940. There was a reservation in the deed of a six-foot passway on the north of the lot from Watkins Avenue to the lake, but no mention of any right of way such as claimed by the plaintiffs now. Mrs. Killam, on September 23, 1955, deeded to the defendants. In this instrument also there is no mention of the right of way claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The deed of plaintiffs\u2019 first tract, as previously stated, describes its westerly boundary as running \u201cnortherly by <em>right of way </em>40 feet to iron pin . . . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">As the plaintiffs assert in their brief, \u201cThe evidence is uncontradicted that in the descriptive reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 westerly boundary . . . wherein it states \u2018thence northerly by right of way 40 feet,\u2019 the right of way referred to was the right of way which subsequently became known as Watkins Avenue, although actually not being named that at the time of the conveyance . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The Master, in reaching his conclusions, had before him in addition to the above, the other deeds from Watkins to the plaintiff John Cragin, to Mrs. Woodward, and the conveyance by Alice Watkins to the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title. In none of these instruments was there mention of a right of way such as the plaintiffs claim across that portion of Watkins\u2019 land which the defendants now own. The Master also had a view of the premises and heard the testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">It was his duty to consider all this evidence and in construing the disputed deed to place himself as nearly as possible in the position of the parties at the time the instrument was executed, to gather their intention in the light of all the circumstances. <em>North Hampton District </em>v. <em>Society, </em>97 N. H. 219, 220. The sharp conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>in the testimony were for him to resolve. <em>Clover &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith Co., </em>96 N. H. 491, 493. In so doing, he could accept or reject such portions of the testimony as he saw fit <em>(Giguere </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 294, 298), and he was not bound to believe uncontradicted evidence. <em>Bill </em>v. <em>Company, </em>90 N. H. 453, 456-457.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is true that the interpretation of a deed presents a question of law for this court, and the Master\u2019s conclusion is reviewable here. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Lebel, </em>95 N. H. 95. However, upon the entire record we believe his decisive finding is sustainable that the right of way \u201cto cross Watkins\u2019 land at any and all times\u201d meant the right to use what is now Watkins Avenue, which then ran through his land west of the tracts of the plaintiffs and the defendants. This interpretation satisfies the description in the deed of \u201cthe right of way to cross land of said Watkins at any and all times.\u201d The Master\u2019s subsidiary finding that Watkins Avenue then ran in part, at least, along the westerly boundary of the plaintiffs\u2019 lot, was also permissible. With the Master\u2019s construction of the disputed deed we are therefore content. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Lebel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It follows that his exclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 proffer of parol evidence relating to a matter he found that the parties plainly covered in the description in the deed, was proper, and the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions thereto are overruled. <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>74 N. H. 409; 9 Wigmore, Evidence, 3d <em>ed., s. </em>2430.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final exception to the finding that they had no prescriptive rights to cross over the defendants\u2019 property does not require extended consideration. The record again contains conflicting evidence upon this issue, and the Master was entitled to believe the defendants\u2019 version. <em>Clover &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith Co., </em>96 N. H. 491, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-10\">Duncan and Lampron, JJ., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b242-11\">Duncan and Lampron, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVT\"><em>dissenting: </em>At the hearing before the Master there was evidence that when the plaintiff received his first deed in 1925 there were two rights of way in the vicinity of the land conveyed to him, either of which answered the description of a \u201cright of way to cross land of Watkins.\u201d One of these passed along the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>west boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land, and w.as used to reach the Richardson land to the south. The other branched off from the first one before reaching the plaintiff\u2019s land and entered it across its northerly boundary. This way was used by the plaintiff for many years before the defendants\u2019 southwest corner was established and Watkins Avenue was laid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In these circumstances parol evidence was admissible to identify the way intended by the parties to the deed in 1925. <em>French </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>43 N. H. 30. \u201cThe meaning of the deed being doubtful, parol evidence of a competent character is admissible to show the meaning ... For such purpose evidence of acts and statements preliminary to the writing or in the course of negotiations . . . and of the conduct of the parties afterwards as a practical construction of the instrument ... is to be admitted.\u201d <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Huckins, </em>82 N. H. 342, 347. See also, <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Chapter, </em>86 N. H. 419, 431; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Keroack, </em>103 N. H. 297, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff offered to prove that Watkins told him when he was buying the land \u201cthat he would have a right to use this driveway [across the north boundary] to get into his property.\u201d Upon objection the evidence was excluded subject to plaintiffs\u2019 exception. In our opinion the evidence should have been received, and we would sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 exception.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
