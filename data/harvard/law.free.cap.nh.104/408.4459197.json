Tierney \u201cwith force and arms about the hour of 8:00 o\u2019clock in the nighttime of the . . . 2nd day of August, 1961, the building of one . . . Myslivy . . . situated at 31 Auburn Street in . . . Manchester, feloniously did break and enter with intent the monies, goods and chattels of the said . . . Myslivy, in the said building then and there being, then and there feloniously did steal, rob, take and carry away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">This indictment is not recommended as a prototype. In view of the intricacies of our statutes relating to burglary and breaking and entering buildings <em>(State </em>v. <em>Mihoy, </em>98 N. H. 38, 41) the preparation of an indictment thereunder calls for particular care on the part of prosecutors. In this case, the question is raised whether the offense charged is under RSA 583:3 or RSA 583:4. Both of these sections carry the same penalty. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Messenger, </em>58 N. H. 348. If the word \u201cto\u201d is read for the word \u201cdid\u201d as the seventh word from the end of the above quoted portion of the indictment it clearly alleges an offense in violation of RSA 583:4. The omission of a description of any article actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>stolen is also substantiation that \u25a0 an offense under that section was' being charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>92 N. H. 308, 309; <em>Bays </em>v. <em>State, </em>240 Ind. 37; 9 Am. Jur., Burglary, s. 46, <em>p. </em>262.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It is the breaking and entering with felonious intent which is essential to the offense prohibited by section 4. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skillings, </em>98 N. H. 203, 208; 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, s. 410, \u25a0 <em>p. </em>30. As drawn, the indictment literally charged both breaking and entering, and larceny, although no conjunction preceded the latter allegation. An intent to commit larceny is included in a charge of larceny <em>(State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>59 N. H. 139; <em>Petition of Carson, </em>141 Me. 132) and the charge that the respondent \u201cdid steal\u201d is a charge that he intended to steal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra. </em>The Trial Court instructed the jury that the defendant was being tried for a violation of B.SA 583:4 and by their verdict the jury must have found him guilty of that offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>97 N. H. 141, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">To be valid an indictment need not conform to \u201ca scientific system of allegations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>101 N. H. 62, 63. \u201cThe administration of criminal law should be conducted in accordance with the dictates of common sense.\u201d <em>Petition of Carson, supra, </em>134. \u201cIn the light of modern conditions any complaint or indictment should be considered adequate if it informs the defendant \u2018of the nature and- cause of the accusation with sufficient definiteness\u2019 so that he can prepare for trial.\u201d <em>State v. Ball, supra. </em>We are of the opinion this indictment met that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The state had the burden of proving that the entry was made by the defendant with the felonious intent to commit larceny. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skillings, supra. </em>There was evidence that the defendant entered the building in which he was found by breaking a window, hoisting himself up on a truck parked nearby and jumping inside. There was testimony that he was found \u201chiding under a bottom of a rack,\u201d in the stockroom of: the City Motor Service and Supply Company, the building which he had entered. There was further evidence that the following morning a file cabinet in the office of the company was found \u201cjimmied\u201d and damaged. A police officer testified that the defendant when questioned by him at the police station said \u201cI must have been in there after money.\u201d The jury could properly find on the evidence that the defendant broke and entered the building in question with intent to commit a larceny which was the issue submitted to the jury. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>agreed during the course of the trial that the entry made at about eight o\u2019clock in the evening of August second was in the daytime within the provisions of RSA 583:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
