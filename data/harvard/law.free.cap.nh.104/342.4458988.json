It also appears that there is pending before the Attorney General a request to file a petition in the nature of <em>quo warranto </em>to determine the legality of the appointment of the Commissioner of Agriculture, which is a well-established procedure to determine title to public office. <em>Stickney </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>96 N. H. 500. Inasmuch as these pending proceedings may develop facts and issues in addition to those contained in the question transmitted by the Governor and Council, or may serve to make the issues more specific and definite, orderly procedure requires that no advisory opinion be given as requested by the Governor and Council. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N. H. 531, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Frank R. Kenison.</p>\n<p id=\"AOc\">Laurence I. Duncan.</p>\n<p id=\"AIk\">Amos N. Blandin, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">Edward J.
