Now, of course, the fact that there was an accident, even the fact that the accident occurred by reason of a skid, is not the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>thing we are examining when we are examining the conduct of Mr. Bruzzese. We are attempting to examine the conduct of Mr. Bruzzese up to the actual point in which he was engaged, first, in the accident in which he was engaged; that involves an appraisal by you of his operation of his truck up to the time of the actual accident which he had. It involves an appraisal by you of his actions, the weather conditions, the speed at which he was traveling, his control of the truck, his operation of the truck, his observations, his opportunities for observation, and all the other factors that went into his operation of the truck. Once you have examined that conduct in your mind from the evidence you have heard in the Court Room, you will make a determination in your own mind as to whether he was or he wasn\u2019t negligent under all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It appears that when the defendant Bruzzese left Berlin, New Hampshire, around 12:30 A. M. on the night in question, it was \u201cblowing snow\u201d and the storm increased as he drove south. Just north of the place where the accident happened, as he came onto a curve, he testified that \u201cI felt myself slipping. I could feel it sliding on me, and looked into my right mirror and saw the box brushing up against the snow bank. I knew I was starting to jack. I touched the trolley lightly and fed it a little bit of gas to try and straighten it out. That\u2019s all I remember after that . . . As far as I was concerned at the time I jacked and flipped over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Based on this testimony, a keystone of Bruzzese\u2019s defense to the claim that he was negligent was that the accident was caused by skidding and was not his fault. Although it was not necessary that the Court charge upon this issue in the specific language of the defendants\u2019 request <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>94 N. H. 107, 109), it was nevertheless essential that the jury be told that the fact Bruzzese\u2019s unit skidded was in and of itself no evidence of his negligence. <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>104 N. H. 36, 38. We do not believe that the language of the Court gave the jury an adequate understanding of this simple principle or its application to this case. The defendants\u2019 exception must therefore be sustained. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Company, </em>94 N. H. 321, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Since the question may arise in future proceedings, we deem it advisable to pass upon the defendants\u2019 exception to the Court\u2019s charge to the jury that Bruzzese could be found to have violated the so-called flare statute (RSA 263:52), with reference to trucks parking on public highways at night, which reads as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cEvery truck, bus, or tractor when operated outside of the lighted area of towns or cities . . . must . . . place one oil-burning light or flare or reflector-type flare one hundred feet in front and another one hundred feet in the rear of such vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The essence of the defendants\u2019 contention on this issue is that Bruzzese was rendered unconscious by the accident for an indeterminate period, and after he recovered his senses he lacked the \u201creasonable time\u201d which the law allows within which to set up his flares and warn the plaintiff. <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Appleyard, </em>94 N. H. 362, 365. They argue that a motor vehicle operator who becomes suddenly unconscious from an unforeseen event cannot be found at fault. <em>Savard </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>103 N. H. 234, 236. However, it is undisputed that no flares were set out, and once this was established, the burden of going forward and showing that Bruzzese\u2019s violation of the statute was excused because he was unconscious, rested on the defendants. <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Appleyard, supra, </em>365.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Bruzzese\u2019s testimony regarding his condition, in addition to that previously set forth, was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cA. I remember getting up off the seat of the truck and getting out of the truck on the driver\u2019s side and getting out and looking for my hat. I was surprised at the whole mess and saw the [trailer] body lying in the road. I was looking for a hat. Finally I came to my senses and knew I had to get up some flares and I went to the flare box to get some flares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cQ. Do you have any idea, Mr. Bruzzese, how long you were unconscious?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know ... I really don\u2019t know ....</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u201cQ. What is your best judgment as to how long you had been walking around the area before you saw the Adley truck coming?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u201cA. I really don\u2019t know. All I know is I looked around the area, looking for a hat I had brought, looking for a hat. I don\u2019t know. Like I say, I was dazed, and how long I was there, I don\u2019t know. I have no idea whatsoever.\u201d He had walked only a few feet north with the unlighted flares when the Adley truck came around the curve, and being unable to stop, \u201cjacked\u201d and \u201cslid\u201d into the overturned trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The defendants correctly point out that disbelief of testimony is no substitute for proof and that the jury could make no affirmative finding that Bruzzese did not lose consciousness merely because they disbelieve his statement that he did. <em>Bissonnette </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>100 N. H. 197, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>However, in the present situation, this principle does not help him. It is undisputed that he was in full possession of his faculties immediately before the accident. The jury could therefore disbelieve his statement that he was rendered unconscious and find, as they apparently did, that his condition of consciousness continued at all times. <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>94 N. H. 345, 347; 2 Wigmore on Evidence (3d <em>ed.) s. </em>437, <em>p. </em>413. It was therefore within the jury\u2019s province to determine that Bruzzese violated the statute requiring the setting out of flares (RSA 263:52) and that his violation was causal. <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>96 N. H. 479, 481; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Welch Co., </em>92 N. H. 74, 76. It follows that the Court\u2019s charge on this issue was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">What we have decided renders unnecessary consideration of other questions and the order in all cases is</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
