The accident occurred in the daytime in a wet snow storm which made the highway \u201cslippery\u201d and \u201cicy and slushy.\u201d The defendant was proceeding downgrade on a curve when his car commenced to skid, and the collision occurred on level ground at the foot of the grade. Following the collision the defendant signaled a northbound truck to stop, and the truck skidded into a ditch on the easterly side of the road, as the operator sought to avoid another collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The defendant testified that he \u201cwent into a skid\u201d as he was going down the hill at a speed of twenty to twenty-five miles an hour, and that he skidded for a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet before the collision occurred. He testified that he tried to pull out of the skid by turning the wheels and \u201cpumping\u201d the brakes, but was unable to prevent the car from swerving into his lefthand lane. It appeared that the defendant was traveling without chains or snow tread tires, but that his \u201cregular tires\u201d had been purchased new in the preceding November.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The plaintiff testified that she could not tell whether or not the defendant\u2019s car skidded, but her report to the Motor Vehicle Commissioner filed the day after the accident stated that the defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cskidded across road in front of my car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The defendant requested the Trial Court to instruct the jury that \u201cthe fact that the defendant\u2019s car skidded into the plaintiff\u2019s car is not evidence of negligence in the absence of carelessness in the manner of its operation,\u201d (citing <em>Grigas </em>v. <em>Exchange, </em>94 N. H. 232) and that \u201cunder the law . . . skidding in and of itself is no evidence of negligence. If you find on the evidence that this accident was caused merely because the car skidded or that it was a pure accident then your verdict must be for the defendant. It is a matter of common knowledge that a car may skid on a slippery road without fault either on account of the manner of handling the car or on account of its being there\u201d (citing <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>86 N. H. 167).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In discussing the requests prior to instruction to the jury, the defendant advised the Court that he thought that he was \u201centitled to some sort of instruction regarding skidding . . . because it\u2019s a very vital point in this case\u201d and urged that the language of the <em>Grigas </em>case be followed. The Court commented that he saw no objection to an instruction on \u201cpure accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The charge to the jury contained the customary instructions regarding negligence and contributory negligence. The plaintiff relied upon the statute (RSA 250:1) which requires a traveler to turn to the right of the center upon meeting another vehicle. The jury was instructed that if the defendant violated the statute, and if the violation was causal, and the plaintiff free from negligence, \u201cthen you would find a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d The Court stated that the \u201cdefendant claims that it was an unavoidable accident, a pure accident, and that there was no fault on the part of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthat it was the fault of the plaintiff.\u201d The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>was then instructed that if the plaintiff was guilty of causal negligence, \u201cyou would, of course, find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Whether an instruction with respect to pure accident, or unavoidable accident should be given, rested in the discretion of the Trial Court. <em>LaDuke </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>97 N. H. 122, 124. While the Court stated that the defendant claimed that it was such an accident, the charge neither defined \u201cpure accident\u201d nor instructed the jury as to the consequences which would follow a finding that it was unavoidable. Thus the effect of the instructions given was to direct a verdict for the plaintiff on the basis of the statute unless she was causally negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The defendant\u2019s primary defense was that any violation of the statute on his part was due to skidding. He further claimed that skidding alone, not caused by careless operation, was not evidence that he was negligent or at fault and he asked for an instruction covering this issue. The Court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury in some appropriate form upon this correct and applicable principle of law was error. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>86 N. H. 167, 169; <em>Grigas </em>v. <em>Exchange, supra, </em>94 N. H. 232; <em>LaDuke </em>v. <em>Lord, supra, </em>123-124. See also, <em>Calley </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>92 N.
