On reargument counsel are invited to include among the issues to be discussed by them the following matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">\u201c1. The specific practical necessities in the government and regulation of the land and naval forces which justify court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents overseas; the practical alternatives to the exercise of jurisdiction by court-martial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The historical evidence, so far as such evidence is available and relevant, bearing on the scope of court-martial jurisdiction authorized under Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14, and the Necessary and Proper Clause, and bearing on the relations of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in interpreting those clauses. In particular, the question whether such historical evidence points to the conclusion that the Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14, power was thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>to have a fixed and rigid content or rather that this power, as modified by the Necessary and Proper Clause, was considered a broad grant susceptible of expansion under changing circumstances.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b810-8\"><em>Frederick Bernays Wiener </em>for Covert and Krueger, petitioners. <em>Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg </em>and <em>Richard J.
