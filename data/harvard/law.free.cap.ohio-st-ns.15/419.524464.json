The defendant\u2019s lessor has been in possession, or rented and controlled the land, ever since. After the execution of the' sheriff\u2019s deed, and the taking of possession under it, on the 12th of September, 1861, the devisee executed to the plaintiff a general warranty deed, in fee for the premises. It does not appear that the devisee ever had any family</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">The only issue made in the case, was as to the title or right of possession of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">The court of common pleas found in favor of the defendant, and rendered judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">On petition in error, the district court affirmed the judgment ; and it is to reverse the judgment of the latter court, that this petition is filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-9\"><em>J.

H. 298.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-11\">A testator can not so devise his lands as to \u2019defeat his own creditors, but he may legally devise his real estate so that it can not be taken to pay the debts of another man. A testator is not bound, legally or morally, to provide for the payment of the debts of his devisee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-12\"><em>T. W. Bartley, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1-\">The intention of the testator here to give his son Nicholas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>an estate in the land, for his own use, for a term of years, fully as great as his life, with the remainder to his legitimate children, is fully manifest, and effective. But the direction, that the estate should not be taken and sold to pay the debts of his son Nicholas, was simply inoperative and void, because against not only the policy of the law, but against the statutes of the state. 4 Kent Com. (marginal page) 335, note b; S. &amp; C\u2019s. Stat. 1063-4-5-6. These statutes, founded upon the great and controlling rules of public policy, can not be evaded by the mere phraseology of a devise in a will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">In truth and in fact, no <em>substantial and actual trust </em>was created by this will; and the mere pretense of creating a trust by the circumlocution used, was plainly a mere shift to evade the laws of the state, making a man\u2019s property liable to the payment of his debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">But admit that a trust was created in the devisee Nicholas, the entire interest, possession, use, and control of the land for a period greater than his lifetime was at the same time devised to him. The trust would be necessarily merged in the use and legal interest granted to Nicholas. 1 Grreenleaf\u2019s Cruise, p. 384; <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Paget, </em>1 Bro. C. C. 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">No doctrine is better settled than that, where the legal and equitable estates become vested in the same person,- the latter will be absorbed and merge in the former, for the manifest reason that a man can not be a trustee for himself. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>1 Halst. Ch. 5; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Stark, </em>10 Sm. &amp; M. 128; Ibid. 268; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>2 Sandf. Ch. 433; <em>James </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 J. C. R. 417.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">If a testator could protect the interests in real estate, devised to his children, from liability to the payment of debts, by simply connecting that interest with the declaration of a trust having reference to the course of descent most desirable to him, a very large portion of the real estate of the country would soon be 'covered with such kind of trusts, real or fictitious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">The devisee, Nicholas Snyder, had an interest in this land liable to be sold on execution; it was sold and acquired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>defendant\u2019s landlord, and is now held by him. The subsequent conveyance by Nicholas to the plaintiff gave him no title superior to that acquired by the sale on execution. If Nicholas could sell and convey to a stranger, and thus divest himself of all trust as to this particular land, why could not his interest be sold on execution ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">A mere possessory interest in land may, it seems, be sold on execution. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>7 Ohio Rep. (part 1), 228; 5 Ohio Rep. 48; 8 Ohio Rep. 21; <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>10 Ohio Rep. 403. And where a person, in addition to the mere possessory right, has the actual use in himself, for a time at least, as well as full power of <em>control and disposition at pleasure over the land </em>for his own benefit, it would be a novel doctrine to say that his interest was not such as to be liable to sale to pay debts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-6\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB4\">This will is certainly a legal curiosity. The precise sense and meaning of much of its language is obscure, and some of it seems to be without sense or meaning at all. Its provisions are apparently conflicting, and they give rise to many curious questions of law. We are, however, relieved to find, that the present case does not require us to decide more than one or two of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The general object of the testator seems to have been, to give to the devisee an absolute <em>ownership </em>of the land, and yet to shield it from the <em>payment of his debts. </em>This is simply impossible. The law makes what a man <em>owns </em>\u2014 whether held by legal or equitable title \u2014 liable to the payment of his debts, unless it be property specially exempted. No legal acumen or skill Can evade this policy of the law, and as often as it is attempted it must result in one of two things \u2014 either in the devisee taking <em>nothing </em>by the will, or in leaving what he does take liable for the payment of his debts. The <em>liability </em>attaches to the <em>ownership, </em>and it is beyond the power of any draftsman to invent a form of devise, or conveyance, that shall separate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The only question in this case is, whether the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the present legal title, and the consequent right of possession. It is not denied, that both of these were in the devisee at the time of the sale on execution, and that they both passed to the defendant\u2019s lessor by sheriff\u2019s deed. But it is claimed that they were defeated, or that they passed from him to the plaintiff, by the sale and conveyance subsequently made tc the latter by the devisee, under the power contained in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The power given in .the will is one coupled with an interest. When that interest is divested, either by act of the party -or by law, the power, as to <em>that interest, is </em>exhausted, and ceases to exist; and then becomes only a power as to the interest of <em>other parties. </em>If the interest with which the power is coupled be the <em>whole interest, </em>then, of course, the whole power <em>ceases to exist, </em>upon the divestment of the interest. A grant of power to sell one\u2019s own property is a mere <em>nullity, </em>because the power exists without the grant, and no disposition of that interest made by law, can be defeated by any subsequent exercise of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">What estate and interest, then, did the devisee have in this land, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale ? He had the legal title, and right of possession, for the term of ninety-nine years, subject to be defeated only by <em>his own voluntary act, </em>and he was in actual possession. So much it is certain he had. What he had beyond the term of ninety-nine years, we need not now inquire. It will be time enough to decide that question after ninety-nine years shall have elapsed, and when his children, if he ever have any, shall claim to take the remainder in fee, as devisees, or, if there are no children, whenever the heirs of the testator shall claim it as a reversion descending to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">It is true that, during the term of ninety-nine years, there is an obligation imposed \u2014 we do not say whether it rests upon him alone, or is in the nature of a charge upon the <em>land </em>\u2014 to <em>support himself, </em>and <em>if </em>he should ever have a \u201cfamily,\u2019\u2019 <em>to support it </em>also. But he has no family, and he is surely bound to support himself, if not his family also, independently of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the devise. If the right to support is to be held an equitable charge upon the land, it is enough, as to <em>his </em>equitable right, to say, that it <em>merges </em>in his legal estate, and passes with it under the sale on execution. As to the rights of the \u201c family,\u201d it will be time enough to decide when one appears, and sets up a claim for support. When one does appear, or when, at the end of ninety-nine years, the children of the devisee, or the heirs of the testator appear, and set up a claim, then all these questions can be decided. At the end of the term, and not properly before, it can be decided how far the obligation to make <em>improvements </em>is binding in the face of the provision against <em>impeachment for waste; </em>in the face of the provision that he may <em>sell </em>and <em>resell, </em>and <em>render no account </em>to \u201c any person whatever,\u201d or to <em>\u201c </em>any court,\u201d for the purchase money; and in the face of the provision that he may dispose of the land by last will and testament, to whomsoever he pleases, not, however, to defeat the \u201c <em>purposes aforesaid.\u201d </em>It can <em>then </em>be determined what those \u201c purposes aforesaid \u201d were\u2014 whether they are to be understood as <em>bona fide </em>looking to the benefit of the <em>family, </em>as between them and the devisee, or to the benefit of the devisee, as between him and his <em>creditors. </em>In short, it can then be decided whether the devisee does, or does not, take an absolute estate in fee in the land ; and if not, whether the family, or the heirs, must look to him, to his grantee, or to the land, for their indemnity. All these questions we leave undecided, as not necessarily arising in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">But we are clear in the opinion that the present <em>right of possession </em>is in the defendant. We think the legal term for ninety-nine years, passed to his lessor by the sheriff\u2019s deed, subject at most to an equitable claim for support, to be set up by some member of a \u201c family,\u201d of devisee, during the term; and that it will be time enough to decide upon the validity of such claim when it shall be asserted. The subsequent exercise of devisee\u2019s alleged power to sell, whatever effect it might have upon the remainder or the reversion, or upon the supposed equitable right of the family to support, worked no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>divestment or transfer of the title and interest of the devisee himself, already vested by the sheriff\u2019s deed in the lessor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-6\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Scott, Day and White, JJ., con* curred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
