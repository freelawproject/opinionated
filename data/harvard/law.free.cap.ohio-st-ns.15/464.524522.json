Pleading a former judgment upon the same matter in favor of defendant, in the su-. preme court of Indiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-13\">The cause was submitted to the court, which found for the plaintiff below, and rendered judgment against the plaintiff in error for the amount due on the bill of exchange. A motion for a new trial, on the ground that the finding was against the-law and the evidence, was overruled, and a bill of exceptions-was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-14\">The bill of exceptions shows the facts of the case, substantially as follows: , '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-15\">Richard Tyner, a merchant in Brookville, Indiana, in the-year 1854, was, and for a long time had been, in the habit of borrowing money, at the branches of the State Bank of In-., diana, and in Cincinnati, Ohio, upon notes and bills of exchange, drawn or indorsed in blank by the defendant George Holland, an attorney at law, and resident of Brookville, to be sold- or discounted at such branches or elsewhere, as occasion-required, for the accommodation of Mr. Tyner.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-16\">In the fall of 1854, Hatch &amp; Langdon, the assignors of\u2019 plaintiff, were bankers in Cincinnati, and held the of \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Tyner, with the name of Holland upon it, for a sum not far from <em>the </em>amount of <em>the </em>bill sued on in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">Mr. Tyner was not prepared to pay the paper held by Hatch &amp; Langdon when it became due, and on the day or before the day that paper became due, he called at the office of Hatch <em>&amp; </em>Langdon, in the. city of Cincinnati, Ohio, with the skeleton printed bill of exchange, with the name of George Holland written on it as the drawer, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">\u201cNo. . $- 185 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMU\">\u201c Pay to the order of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlH6\"><em>u </em>dollars,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">\u201c Yalue received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">\u201c To <em>\\ </em>\u201c /</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6o\">Geo.

Mr. Tyner says: ,,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-14\">\u2022 \u201c This bill I handed to Hatch &amp; Langdon, to fill up themselves. I did not tell them a word about putting, or not,putting, in the waiver of valuation or appraisement laws.\u2014 They handed me the bill to look at, after it Ayas filled. I cast \u2022my eyes on .the, amount and the time for Avhich it was drawn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and did not look at or notice the rest of it. I then handed it back to them, my acceptance and the other names being on it before I first handed it to them,\u201d .etc. \u201c It was in this shape when I handed the bill to the plaintiffs to be filled up, and they filled up the rest of it as it now stands. Among business men, ninety-nine out a hundred of notes given by me in the \u25a0 eastern cities and in Cincinnati on my own account for goods, had that clause in them. I have taken motes of my debtors' in that way. It is, so far as I know, the general usage of business men here (Brookville) and in Cincinnati to take and give notes in that way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">. Hatch &amp; Langdon, before they assigned to Hatch, brought s/uit against Holland in the circuit court of Indiana, and recovered a judgment for the amount of the bill. The case was taken by Holland to the supreme court of Indiana, by writ of error, and the judgment of the circuit court was there reversed \u2014 the supreme court holding that the bill was void as to Holland, by reason of the unauthorized insertion of the valuation or appraisement clause; and the cause was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings. When the case came back to the circuit court, the plaintiffs, Hatch &amp; Langdon, voluntarily became non suit. Hatch &amp; Langdon having subsequently assigned to Hatch, the latter brought the present suit in the superior court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-6\"><em>Collins &amp;\u00a1 Herron, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">1.

The superior court erred in holding that Holland was liable on a bill which, in point of fact, he never made. He never proposed to make such a contract; he never authorized any one to make such a contract for him. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bosson, </em>11 Ohio, 62; <em>Holland </em>v. <em>The State Bank, </em>11 Ind. 151; <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>11 Ind. 497; <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Allen (Mass.), 477; <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>1 Allen, 512; <em>Bell et al. </em>v. <em>The State </em>Bank, 7 Blackf. 456; <em>Master </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>4 Term Rep. 320; Smith\u2019s Lead.

The superior court rightfully held that Hatch &amp; Lang-don and their assignee were not concluded by the proceedings disclosed in-the case as having taken place in Indiana. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>2 Gallison, 216, 228, 230; <em>Davis et al. </em>v. <em>Clemson, </em>6 McLean, 622, 624; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>5 Sandford, 230, 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">2. The superior court rightfully held that Holland was liable on the bill, on the merits of the case as disclosed in the record. <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Sturges, </em>4 Ohio St. Rep. 529, 534; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Langstaff, </em>Douglass, 514; <em>Jessup et al. </em>v. <em>The City Bank, of Racine, </em>14 Wisconsin, 331.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-9\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYH\">The plaintiff in error insists that there was error in the finding and judgment of the superior court, for two reasons: 1st. The plaintiff below was <em>estopped </em>by the judgment of the supreme court of Indiana; and 2d. The bill of exchange is not the bill of Holland, because of the unauthorized insertion of the words \u201c without relief from valuation or appraisement laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">It seems to us, that when the judgment of the Indiana circuit court was reversed in the supreme court of that state, and tire cause remanded, again to the circuit court for further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u00bfeedings, the ease stood in the circuit court as it did before trial pr judgment. The judgment of the circuit court had become a <em>nullity </em>by the reversal. The judgment of the 'supreme court was the only thing left to estop the parties, and that simply estops them from denying that the judgment below was reversed, and that the cause .was remanded. And the final judgment below seems to \u00e9stop them from denying that the case ended in a <em>non suit, </em>and not in a judgment upon the <em>merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We are therefore unable to see how this judgment of the supreme court can be held to estop a party to it from asserting that Holland executed the bill of exchange in question. The only verdict and judgment as to <em>that fact </em>were against Holland. But as that finding and judgment have been set aside, and the cause again reinstated, and dismissed, both parties are free, as they were before suit, to make any averments the cause or defense might seem to require, as to the merits of the original cause. Both are estopped from denying the reversal, the remanding of the cause, and the <em>non suit, </em>and they are estopped no further; and surely no one will deny, that the effect of a <em>non suit </em>is to leave the plaintiff at liberty to bring a new action.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The other defense interposed seems to me* to present a question of fact:. Was Tyner authorized, <em>under all the circumstances, </em>to insert the words \u201c <em>without any relief from valuation or appraisement laws </em>f \u2019 It is not the case of an <em>altered </em>bill. The bill was in its present form when finally delivered to Hatch &amp; Langdon for discount. It is a question of <em>authority </em>to fill up the bill, with the objectionable words inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">No question is made as to the authority to fill the other blanks in the skeleton bill \u2014 the date, the amount, the time of payment, names, etc. The form of the paper, and the law merchant, alone, raise a legal presumption of' authority for the filling of these. The authority to add the words objected to, must depend on all the <em>circumstances </em>of the parties, as tending to show whether the intention did <em>in fad </em>exist, to give to the agent Tyner authority to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>I think the circumstances are sufficient. The agent, Tyner, who was intrusted with the blank bill, and therefore, with authority to fill up ordinary and usual blanks, had often been intrusted by Holland, with power to waive relief from valuation or appraisement laws, by negotiating them in the Indiana banks. ' He had often so negotiated them, with the approval of Holland, who himself drew most of his own notes with that clause inserted. The bill in question was to be discounted for the special purpose of discharging paper due to Hatch &amp; Rangdon, on which Holland\u2019s liability .had become fixed; and its proceeds were so applied, and the paper was taken up or canceled. Moreover, Tyner admittedly had authority to discount the paper in an Indiana bank, where the effect would have been the same, without the insertion of the objectionable clause. Holland lived in India\u00f1a, and knew the laws of Indiana, and he gave his name to this skeleton, with the name of the <em>payee, </em>and of the <em>place of discount </em>blank, and <em>must </em>have <em>intended </em>to give authority to negotiate it in such form, or in such <em>place, </em>as to deprive him of the relief from valuation or appraisement\" laws. Whether this authority was exercised by negotiating the bill in an Indiana bank, or by negotiating it in Cincinnati, with the provision inserted, seems to me immaterial. My brethren, however, do not concur in this view of the case, not being satisfied that the insertion of the words was unauthorized under the circumstances. But a majority of us concur in affirming the judgment below, upon a different ground. And that is upon the ground that there is a complete bill without these words, and that they may be rejected, as forming no part of it, and affecting in no \"way its validity. \u25a0These added words relate exclusively to the <em>remedy, </em>and are no part of the bill proper. They have much the same relation \u25a0to the bill as would be that of the usual warrant of attorney, added to bills and notes, to confess a judgment for their amount. The one is as readily and distinctly separable therefrom as the other. This view seems to be within the principle settled in <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Sturges, </em>4 Ohio St. Rep. 529. It sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ply draws a line, where that is practicable, between what is authorized and what is unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">If the bill is to be considered as drawn in Ohio, and not in Indiana \u2014 and such appears to be the law, as settled in <em>Davis et al. </em>v. Clemson, 6 McLean, 622 \u2014 then it would seem, that the words objected to may be rejected as mere surplusage, because in no sense altering the legal effect of the bill, even as to any <em>remedy </em>upon it; such would be the fact at least, should the remedy be sought in Ohio, where it is presumed that parties can not effectually bind themselves in contracts to waive relief from valuation and appraisement laws, applicable thereto. The power given, authorized the filling up of the bill in the usual way, and the addition of these unauthorized words does not render it invalid. Whatever their legal effect, if any, there is a completeJbill of exchange without them. The insertion of these words was the mere unauthorized act of the agent, and therefore void as to the principal, and if separable \u25a0from the authorized bill, should not be allowed to viciate it, or destroy its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The judgment of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-8\">Scott, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b489-9\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Dat, J., dissented as to the second proposition of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
