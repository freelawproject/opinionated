Testimony was taken, and the master reported a balance due Gill of $1576.06</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">The master finds that, on the 6th day of December, 1843, the parties entered into a contract for the manufacture of \u25a0iabinet ware, which continued until March, 1856, upon the following terms: Geyer was to furnish all the capital, the salesroom, and to receive two thirds of the profits; and Gill was to superintend the manufacture, furnish his own shop-room, and receive one third of the profits; but that a partnership never existed between them. It is further found in the master\u2019s report, that a loss of the stock of furniture on the 22d day of February, 1854, amounting to $20,000 \u2014 less one third of the money received from the insurance company \u2014 \u25a0 should be credited in cabinet account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">To these, with other findings of the .master, Geyer filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">The superior court, at special term, overruled the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tions, affirmed tbe report, and rendered judgment against Geyer; to which ruling and judgment he excepted, without embodying in his bill of exceptions the evidence taken before the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">The case was taken on error to the superior court in general term; and, at the March term thereof, 1862, the judgment at special term was reversed, and the cause was remanded to special term for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">Gill excepted to the holding and judgment of the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">The case was again heard at special term of July, 1862, and the exceptions of Geyer, as to the loss by fire, February 22, 1854, were sustained; and the court finds the balance due from Gill to Geyer to be $3723.94, and judgment was rendered for Geyer. To all which Gill excepted; and, at his request, the facts were specially found by the court: and, so far as material to the questions now raised, are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-8\">On the 6th- day of December, 1843, the plaintiff and defendant entered into an arrangement by which they were to carry on, together, the business of manufacturing and selling \u201c cabinet ware \u201d in the city of Cincinnati. The business, under said arrangement, was carried on under the name of \u201c John Geyer.\u201d ' The plaintiff claims and testifies that he was to furnish the capital to commence said business on, only. The defendant claims and testifies that the plaintiff was to furnish the entire capital to carry on the business. Without deciding between these conflicting statements, as to what the original agreement, in this particular, was, the court finds as to the manner in which the business was actually conducted, that the commencement of the account shows a few entries of small sums advanced in cash by Geyer to buy materials, pay hands,, etc., but, that almost from the beginning, the business was-carried on as a credit business, viz: material was purchased in part, if not mainly, on credit; the cabinet ware, after the same was manufactured, was sold in part, if not mainly on. credit; promissory notes were taken from the purchasers,, which were afterward discounted, and the proceeds carried-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>into the business; and money was borrowed which was placed in the business, the interest paid for the same being charged in the account representing the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">By said arrangement, the defendant was to furnish the shop-room, free of charge, and superintend the manufacture of cabinet ware, which, when manufactured, was to be taken to the plaintiff\u2019s salesroom and sold by the plaintiff, and that the profits were to be divided between the plaintiff and defendant as follows: The plaintiff was to receive two thirds and the defendant one third of said profits. No written agreement in relation to said business was ever entered into by the parties, nor was anything ever said as to how long the arrangement should continue, nor as to when or how often settlements were to be made, or the profits ascertained. The plaintiff kept an account of sales of their ware which was called \u201c cabinet sales account.\u201d A book was provided to be kept by the defendant at-the shop, in which were entered the cost of all the materials purchased, the amounts paid the workmen for wages, and all other items entering into the cost of manufacturing the \u25a0cabinet ware. The defendant was also charged in said ac-' -count with all moneys received by him for his individual use, \u25a0which last named items were distinguished by adding the word \u25a0\u201cself.\u201d This book was known between the parties as the <em>\u25a0\u201c </em>cabinet account book \u201d \u00f3r \u201c cabinet expense book.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiff from the commencement of said business, from time to time, took out policies of insurance in his' own mame, as well on the building as on the stock of cabinet ware. And regularly one third of' all amounts paid for premiums for insurance\" on said stock, was charged in said \u201c cabinet expense account,\u201d with the knowledge of the defendant, but without his expressly assenting thereto, or dissenting therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">One third of the expenses of the salesroom, such as clerk hire, advertising, etc., were charged in the cabinet expense account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">Losses from bad debts occurred from time to time, of which the suspended debt, amounting to $3752.93, - still remained \u00bfunpaid, but such losses were never entered in the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The parties entered into partnership with John Hughes, in the manufacture of cabinet ware, at Hughes\u2019 shop, sold the ware at plaintiffs salesroom, charged themselves with the ware, and all losses thereon, in cabinet expense account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The business carried on under said arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant was continued until the latter part of March, 1856. During that time two losses by fire occurred, viz: a partial loss in November, 1852, and a heavy loss on the 22d of February, 1854, involving almost the entire destruction of the stock of furniture at the salesroom. The amount of the loss of furniture by the last fire is found by the master to have been $20,000.00. One third of the money collected from the insurance companies for the loss on stock by the first fire (being the proportion of the furniture to the chairs and upholstery) was credited in the cabinet sales account. And for the loss on cabinet ware by the second fire, the sum of $4500.00 was collected from the insurance companies, which was-also credited in the cabinet sales account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">During the continuance of the business, the defendant drew from time to time, and was charged in the cabinet expense account with the sum of $10,005.16. The gross amount of sales, as per cabinet sales account (including the moneys collected for losses by fire) was $140,770.52. The gross amount of the cabinet expense account less Gill\u2019s individual account, was $130,026.85. Said accounts were never balanced, nor were the profits ever stated or ascertained during the entire time the business was carried on. The defendant, at all times, had free access to the books, made frequent entries in the cabinet sales account and cabinet expense account, and never objected to the form of keeping said accounts or to any of the entries therein above referred to, until after the termination of the business and after the present controversy had arisen between him and the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">The court further find that said cabinet expense account includes the cost of manufacturing all the cabinet ware that was burned in the fire of February 22, 1854, but that said cost, less the amount credited from the insurance companies, ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>not to be deducted from the cabinet expense account. And the court also find, as a conclusion of law, that said accounts are not now to be adjusted as if settlements had been made from time to time, and the defendant had drawn his share of the profits as declared upon settlement, but that the gross amount of the cabinet expense account (without deduction for said 'loss by fire) must be taken from the gross amount of the cabinet sales account; that of the balance th\u00e9 defendant is entitled to one third as his share of the profits, and that all moneys received by him beyond that amount is an overdraft, which the plaintiff is entitled to recover back, the amount so overdrawn being before found in the account as above stated by the court; to which conclusion of law the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">The defendant Gill thereupon filed his petition in error in the superior court in general term; but the court in general term, affirmed the judgment at special term. To correct the supposed error thus committed, the present petition in error is prosecuted in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-6\"><em>Collins $ Herron, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-7\">1. The first judgment at special term in Gill\u2019s favor, was never legally reversed. The superior court in general term erred in undertaking to review the judgment at special term without any of the evidence before them, on which that judgment was predicated. Code, sec. 292; <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>1 Ohio St. Rep. 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-8\">2. The judgment of the superior court is, that the loss by the fire of February 22, 1854, is to be borne by the parties in the ratio of one third by Gill and two thirds by Geyer. It is the same, in effect, as if Gill had been the absolute owner of one third interest in the stock \u2014 that is, he must lose one third of its value, and Geyer two thirds. We affirm this to be erroneous. Geyer was exclusive owner of the stock burned, and the entire loss fell on him, save that Gill lost a portion of profits on sales which might otherwise have been made. Gill was not the partner, but only an employee of Geyer. <em>Hearn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 B. Mon. 159; Story on Partnership, secs. 27, 28, 29, 38; Kent\u2019s Com.

Hull, </em>20 Wend. 70; <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>8 Cush. 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-5\">3. Although nothing was said between the parties as to how often the books should be balanced and the profits ascertained, yet the presumption is that each contemplated what is usual in such cases, viz: periodical settlements as often, at least, as once a year, perhaps semi-annually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">That Gill was to receive his portion of profits, and withdraw them from the business as well as from hazard by fire must have been contemplated. He was an employee. His portion of profits was to be as a compensation for his services, and in lieu of wages, which are always paid as they accrue. He is not the capitalist. He is working for his subsistence, and is expected to withdraw his profits from time to time to support his family.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">The dealings of the parties fully demonstrate that this was their mutual understanding. Gill did dr\u00e1w from time to time, on an average, about eight hundred dollars per annum, without any objection on the part of Geyer. The fact that the books were not balanced can not give Geyer any advantage. That should have been done, and equity will consider it as done.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-8\"><em>JSf. Headington, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">1. The court below did not err in finding that the cost of manufacturing the cabinet ware burned in the fire of February 22,1854, less the amount credited from the insurance companies, ought not to be deducted from the cabinet expense account. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>3 Devereux, 90, 91; <em>Brown\u2019s Ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Higginbotham, </em>5 Leigh, 586-7; <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Steinmeyer, </em>4 Richardson, 314; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Butt and Banks, </em>14 Georgia, 706-7; <em>Sampson et al </em>v. <em>Feltz, </em>1 McCord\u2019s Ch. 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-10\">2. The court below did not err in holding that the accounts are not now to be adjusted as if settlements had been made from time to time, and Gill had drawn his share of the profits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>as declared upon settlement, but that they are to be balanced as they stand upon the books. <em>Colgin </em>v. <em>Cummins, </em>1 Porter, 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">3. A partnership existed between Geyer and Gill. Smith\u2019s Merc.

The question passed upon by th.e superior court upon the first petition in error, is not presented upon the record in such form that this court can review it. The law presumes that that judgment of reversal was correct until error is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-8\">If Gill felt aggrieved by that judgment and desired to have this court pass upon the question of its correctness, he should have applied at once for leave to file his petition in error. This, however, he did not do, but acquiesced in the judgment and went to trial a second time in special term. Having thus speculated upon the chances of another judgment in his favor, and lost, it is- too late for him to attempt to take advantage of any supposed error in a judgment Avhich, for the purposes of the case, he treated as properly reversed.1,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b424-9\">Dat, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">The principal questions, arising upon the record and discussed by counsel, are, whether the loss by the fire of February 22, 1854, ought to be deducted from the cabinet expense account, and Avhether the accounts are now to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>adjusted as if settlements had been made, and Grill had drawn his share of the'profits as declared upon such settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">It should be borne in mind, that no question of contribution arises between the parties, but the object sought is, simply, the proper adjustment of the matters appertaining to their joint business through a series of years, with the sole view of ascertaining the amount of profits to be divided between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">To accomplish this, reference must be had to the original \u201carrangement\u201d made between the parties, to any subsequent modification thereof by them, to the circumstances that surrounded them, and to their conduct, in carrying on the business, explaining their construction and understanding of their relations and obligations under their joint arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We do not deem it material for us to determine whether or not these parties were partners; for, if that was their relation, the profits to be divided between them would be the remainder of their earnings after all expenses and losses were paid; but if not, and their relation was that of employer and employee, then the profits to be divided by way of compensation to Grill, under their arrangement as explained by their subsequent conduct, were understood by them to be, and therefore were, the <em>net profits </em>of the joint business. The amount in either ease would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The time and manner of ascertaining the amount of such profits were not provided for by any express agreement between the parties; nor, during the long time that they were engaged in the business, did they settle and liquidate the amount. The parties themselves having so left their joint business, the court below very properly held, that its duty was, to ascertain the amount of the net profits of the whole business as it stood when the parties brought it there for liquidation,</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">This being the condition in which the rights of the parties stood, it follows that the loss by the fire of February 22, 1854, ought not to be deducted from the cabinet expense account ; and, it also follows that, since the parties were undei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>no obligation to make intermediate settlements and neglected to do so, neither party can now compel the other to adjust the accounts as if such settlements had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">It is, also, claimed on the part of the plaintiff in error, that the judgment, rendered in his favor on the first trial at special term, was not legally reversed. The reason assigned is, that-the superior court in general term, reviewed the judgment of the special term, without any of the evidence before them on which that judgment was predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">It is provided in the seventeenth section of the \u201c act to establish the superior court of Cincinnati,\u201d that the' proceeding at general term to reverse a judgment rendered at special term, \u201c shall be the same as those provided by the code of civil procedure upon petitions in error, except that it shall not be necessary to file with the petition a transcript of the proceedings, as required by section 517 of the code; but the petition in error shall be heard upon the original files, pleadings and proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">It appears upon the record, that the plaintiff below presented to the master exceptions to his report, and that the master returned the same with his report as follows: \u201c Which exceptions are allowed and signed by said master, and returned with and made a part of the report herein; and all the testimony taken in the case was reduced by him to writing, and the same, together with the exhibits therein referred to, are returned with and made a part of his report herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">It further appears from the bill of exceptions, taken at the special term when said judgment was rendered, that the court, upon the <em>master\u2019s report and the evidence filed therewith, </em>found that the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">It also appears that, in the final disposition of the case, the court ordered, \u201c that, in recording said master\u2019s report, the clerk shall omit the evidence and exhibits therewith returned, without prejudice, however, to the claim of the plaintiff that the same form a part of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">It does not affimatively appear upon this record, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>superior court at general term did not have before it the evidence upon which the court at special term found its judgment. On the contrary, since the reviewing court was required, by the statute, to hear the case \u201c upon the original files, pleadings and proceedings,\u201d it is quite probable that, as stated in the bill of exceptions, the evidence filed with the master\u2019s report was before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">But whether the <em>evidence </em>was before that court or not, the record shows that the master\u2019s <em>report </em>and exceptions to it ,were a part of the files and proceedings in the case, and, therefore, were properly before it. There was error appearing in the report itself, in overruling the exceptions to the report, and in sustaining and affirming the finding of the master,\u2014 that the loss by the fire of 1854 \u201cshould be credited in cabinet <em>account; </em>\u201d therefore the judgment was properly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The judgment of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-7\">Brinkerhoee, O.J., and Scott, White and Welch, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
