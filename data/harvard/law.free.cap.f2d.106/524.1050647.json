With respect to the reinstatement of the thirteen employees, however, it may be well to make clear that such reinstatement does not mean that they must .be furnished employment at a period when due to the seasonal nature of the respondent\u2019s business no employment is available, but merely that they be restored to their former position and given work when other like employees are given work. Likewise, the order with respect to back pay does not mean that the employees are to be paid wages for the entire period that has elapsed since their discharge, but merely that they shall be paid what they would have earned during that period if they had not been discharged, taking into account the seasonal character of the employer\u2019s business. This we understand to be the intent and meaning of the Board\u2019s order. Should attempt be made, as respondent fears, to apply the order otherwise, the action of the Board will be subject to review upon petition properly filed with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-28\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
