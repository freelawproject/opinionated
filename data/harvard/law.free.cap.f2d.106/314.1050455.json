He seeks a decree declaring the defendant a trustee ex maleficio of these patents and enjoining their exploitation by the defend</p>\n<p id=\"AzHi\">. The defendant denied that the plaintiff made any disclosure to its employees and averred as an additional defense that the basic idea of the application of the principies of rectification to metals was not novel at the time of the alleged disclosure by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"AC4\">The trial court in its opinion pointed out that the testimony as to the alleged disclosures by the plaintiff was conflicting and it found that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged disclosure was insufficient to enable the defendant to appropriate and practice his idea. As we have frequently stated, the findings of a tribunal charged with the duty of determining the facts are not to be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence. Canfield v. Blaw-Knox Co., 3 Cir., 98 F.2d 805; Frank <em>v. </em>Atwood, 3 Cir., 75 F.2d 918; Gill v. Benjamin Franklin Realty &amp; Holding Co., <em>3 </em>Cir., 43 F.2d 337; Wald v. Longacre, 3 <em>Cir., 34 </em>F.2d 25; Hazelwood Brewing Co. v. United States, 3 Cir., 3 F.2d 721</p>\n<p id=\"AQ1\">The evidence also fully supports the finding of the District Court that at the time \u00b0i the alleged disclosure the plaintiff\u2019s idea was not novel. Consequently, even if he had succeeded in convincing the triai CQUrt ^ he had disclosed his idea t0 thc dcfendant&gt;s empioyeeS; he stm failed to sustain the burden upon him of proving that the idea was novel. This it was necessary for him to do in order to impose an implied agreement upon the defendant to refrain from its use.</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">The decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
