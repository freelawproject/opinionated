The sinking fund, held for the benefit of the holders of such bonds and such judgment liens, constitutes a separate trust fund for such owners and holders in such capacity in a separate right.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">2. The paving fund, held for the benefit of the holders of such paving or improvement bonds, constitutes a separate trust fund for such owners and holders in such capacity in a separate right.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">3. The firemen\u2019s fund for the firemen\u2019s relief and pensions constitutes a trust fund held in such separate capacity and distinct right or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">4. The meter fund, made up of deposits in trust for specific purpose, cpnstitutes a separate trust held for such owners in such separate right and capacity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">However, the paving fund, the pension fund, and the meter fund, if grouped with the general fund in one item as a total sum would neither exceed nor equal $5,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">The findings of fact as made by the trial court, the case being tried without the intervention of a .jury, are supported by substantial evidence, and his conclusions of law are in conformity therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Costs. \u2014 The question is raised as to costs. Appellant being a governmental agency, costs should neither be awarded in its favor nor against it in this action, and the adjudication against the defendant as to costs is eliminated.
