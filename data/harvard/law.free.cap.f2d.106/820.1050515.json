Oregon Code, Ann.1930, \u00a7 13-301 provides: \u201cEvery person * * * is liable to punishment by the laws of this state for a crime committed by him therein, except where such crime is by law cognizable exclusively in the courts of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Appellant was convicted in the state court and sentenced, and rightly, unless the state court was without jurisdiction. The state court was without jurisdiction, if larceny of property belonging to the United States is \u201ccognizable exclusively in the courts of the United States\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Larceny of property of the United States is made a crime by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547 provides: \u201cNothing in sections 1 to 553 * * * of this title shall be held to take away or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Jurisdiction is conferred on the United States courts by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">\u201cThe jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States in the cases and proceedings hereinafter mentioned, shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States:</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">\u201cFirst. Of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority -of the United States * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Appellant alleged in his petition that he had made a \u2018motion in arrest of judgment and stay of execution in the state court and that the legality of his detention had not been previously adjudged upon application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court below denied the petition and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">The above facts require application of the rule that \u201cthe appropriate way to raise questions involving the validity of a commitment under a state law is by application to the state courts, and if denied by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d. Palmer v. McCauley, 9 Cir., 103 F.2d 300, 301, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-17\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
