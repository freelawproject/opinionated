On May 19,1933, such contract was modified \u201cto include the fuel oil requirements of any and all vessels owned, chartered and/or operated\u201d by W. L. Comyn &amp; Sons, hereinafter called Comyn. Subsequently, and before the ships in question were chartered by Comyn, the contract was further modified and required appellee to bill Comyn direct for oil used by the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">Comyn chartered for a specified time the motorships Brand and Stjerneborg, the charter parties requiring Comyn to provide and pay for all oil. Comyn chartered the \u201cStjerneborg\u201d on January 27, 1934, and the \u201cBrand\u201d on March 8, 1934. On April 26, 1934, appellee delivered fuel oil to the \u201cBrand\u201d at Point Wells, Washington, and on May 11, 1934, made a further delivery to the \u201cBrand\u201d at San Pedro, California. All deliveries were made on the orders of Comyn. Appellee issued invoices for these deliveries, totalling $4,631.71 to the \u201cBrand and Owners\u201d in care of Comyn. On May 15, 1934, appellee delivered fuel oil to the \u201cStjerneborg\u201d at Astoria, Oregon, and issued its invoice for $3,824.65 to the \u201cStjerneborg and Owners\u201d in care of Comyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">In July, 1934, Comyn by a pledge, created a lien on certain securities in favor of appellee, which lien was second to one held by a Seattle bank. Thereafter appellee waived its lien on the securities by permitting the Seattle bank to obtain a paramount lien on the securities as security for a subsequent loan of $900. Upon sale of the securities, appellee released its claim to $1,474.96 of the proceeds to which it was entitled, and signed a Creditors\u2019 Agreement granting Comyn a year\u2019s extension of time to meet its obligations. In April, 1935, Comyn released appellee from such Creditors\u2019 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">The pledge agreement contained a provision that it would not preclude appellee from collecting any obligation without resorting to the securities pledged, and that such pledge agreement should not constitute \u201cany release or waiver of any lien\u201d appellee might have against the vessels. The Creditors\u2019 Agreement contained a provision that the execution thereof by appellee should not constitute \u201cany release or waiver of any lieu or the right to a lien\u201d which appellee might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">After delivery of fuel oil to it, the \u201cBrand\u201d left for Europe. Upon its return, it was docked at Los Angeles for one day, and then left for Vancouver, B. C., and thence to the Orient. Upon its return, it docked at certain points in California and Washington from March 28, 1935, to April 13, 1935. It then left for the Orient and upon its return was libelled in this cause on June 5, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">After delivery of the fuel oil to it, the \u201cStjerneborg\u201d left for Australia and other foreign countries, and upon its return, was docked at various points in California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Washington and Oregon from December 30, 1934, to January 14, 1935. It then left for the Orient, and upon its return was libelled in the instant cause on May 11, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The answers filed by the owners of the vessels alleged that (1) the owner and the vessels were not liable because the oil was not furnished upon the order of the owner or anyone authorized by it; (2) the oil was furnished upon the credit of Comyn and not that of the vessels; (3) the liens, if any, were waived by appellee\u2019s release of its claims upon the securities and proceeds thereof, under the pledge, and by execution of the Creditors\u2019 Agreement. The causes were consolidated for .trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The facts above mentioned being stipulated, the Court adopted such stipulation as its findings and concluded that the fuel oil delivered was necessary for the voyages contemplated, was furnished upon the credit of the vessels, that liens were created and not waived. A decree in favor of appellee was entered in each cause, with interest, from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 971 provides: \u201cAny person furnishing * * * supplies * * * to any vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order * * * of a person authorized by the owner, shall have a maritime lien on the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem, and it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 972 provides: \u201cThe following persons shall be presumed to have authority from the owner to procure * * supplies. * * * any person to whom the management of the vessel at the port of supply is intrusted. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">First. Appellants contend that no lien arose because \u201cappellee did, by the terms of its blanket contract and by its course of dealings thereunder, rely solely upon the individual credit of\u201d Comyn, and that there is nothing to show that Comyn \u201cwas ever granted authority to bind the vessels by imposing a lien thereon\u201d. Marshall &amp; Co. v. President Arthur, 279 U.S. 564, 49 S.Ct. 420, 423, 73 L.Ed. 846, is heavily relied on, but we think it is not applicable. It was there held that: \u201c * * * the libellant, having made specific contracts for an express security, instead of resting on the lien which the law would otherwise give, must rely on the contracts it made for itself, and cannot now, in a change of circumstances, resort to the lien it would have had in the absence of the special agreements; and tjaat by taking other and different security, upon which it relied, and which it still retains, without stipulating for the retention of the lien, it has waived the lien which it otherwise would have had.\u201d The controlling factor in that case was that at the time of delivery of coal libellant insisted upon and obtained security for the amount owing it. A like fact is absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The instant case is controlled by The Portland, 9 Cir., 273 F. 401 and The Golden Gate, 9 Cir., 52 F.2d 397, certiorari denied 284 U.S. 682, 52 S.Ct. 199, 76 L.Ed. 576, which hold adversely to appellants\u2019 contentions. Appellants ask us to again consider the contentions made implying that the cases mentioned should be overruled. The rule of The Portland, supra, was re-examined in the Golden Gate, supra, and again in The Luddco 41, <em>9 </em>Cir., 66 F.2d 997. No compelling reason requires re-examination now. The owners are not without a means of protection. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\"> Second. Appellants further contend that if a lien arose it was waived by appellee because it entered the creditor\u2019s agreement and accepted security by the pledge agreement. It will be recalled that by both agreements the rights to liens were retained. Appellee had the right to rely on the credit of both the vessels and the charterer. Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U.S. 1, 10, 41 S.Ct. 1, 65 L.Ed. 97. There is nothing inconsistent in appellee\u2019s actions to show that it was renouncing the liens, but in fact retention thereof was specifically provided for. We think appellee did not waive its rights to the liens. See: El Amigo, 5 Cir., 285 F. 868; The Golden Gate, supra, 52 F.2d 400. In Marshall &amp; Co. v. President Arthur, supra, 279 U.S. 572, 49 S.Ct. 420, 73 L.Ed. 846, and in The City of Seattle, 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 763, 764, there were waivers of the liens, but in both there was no reservation of the lien. The inference is that had there been such a reservation, as here, there would have been no waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\"> Third. Appellants also contend that \u201cin admiralty interest may be properly disallowed or reduced because of unusual delay in the prosecution of \u00a1an admiralty cause\u201d. Appellants concede that they are responsible for a part of the delay, but that \u201cthere is a substantial excess of delay justly chargeable to appellee.\u201d The record does not disclose which of the parties caused the delay. The allowance of interest is dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>cretionary. The Albert Dumois, 177 U.S. 240, 255, 20 S.Ct. 595, 44 L.Ed. 751. In the absence of anything in the record disclosing who may be blamed for the delay, we are not warranted in holding that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
