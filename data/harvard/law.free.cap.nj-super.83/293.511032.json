A. </em>47:1A-1 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cThe Right to Know Law\u201d; (2) the second sentence of paragraph one and the whole of paragraph two of Executive Order No. 9, effective October 1, 1963; and (3) the regulation of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, dated July 31, 1963 and effective October 1, 1963. Plaintiff also prays that the Commissioner be permanently enjoined from the enforcement of such regulation and that it may be granted such .other and further relief as may be proper and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>By <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73, effective July 1, 19&gt;63, the Legislature declared \u201cit to be the public policy of this State that public records shall be readily accessible for examination by the citizens of this State, with certain exceptions, for the protection of the public interest.\u201d All records which are required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file by any board, body, agency, department, commission or official of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, or by any public board, body, commission or authority created pursuant to law by the State or any of its political subdivisions, or by any official acting for or on behalf thereof, are, subject to the exception hereinafter noted, deemed under this law \u201cto be public records.\u201d Excepted from the citizen\u2019s right to inspect and copy are those public records otherwise provided for by statute, resolution of either or both houses of the Legislature, executive order of the Governor, rule of court, any federal law, regulation or order, or by any regulation promulgated under the authority of any statute or executive order of the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><em>L. </em>1963, <em>c. </em>73 provides that any citizen of this State who has been or shall have been denied for any reason the right to inspect, copy or obtain a copy of any such record, to whose inspection he is entitled, \u201cmay apply to the Superior Court of New Jersey by a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ for an order requiring the custodian of the record to afford inspection, the right to copy or to obtain a copy thereof, as provided in this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Governor\u2019s Executive Order No. 9, after reciting in its preamble that <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73 represents a right supplemental to the existing common law right of the public to examine and copy public records, subject to the limitation that exercise of the right is \u201cnot detrimental to the public interest,\u201d specifies certain named records in paragraph 3 of the order which shall not be deemed to be public records subject to inspection. We are not concerned herein with those specific records. However, the Governor\u2019s order, particularly in paragraph 2, authorized and empowered the head or principal executive of each principal department of State Government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>with respect to the records of his department and any agencies, authorities and commissions assigned or allocated to such department or under its supervision, to adopt and promulgate, from time to time, regulations setting forth which records under his jurisdiction shall not be deemed to be public records, subject to inspection and available for copying, pursuant to the provisions of <em>L. </em>1963, <em>c. </em>73. The second sentence of paragraph 1 of this executive order provided that such records, so covered by departmental regulation, shall not be deemed to be public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Acting upon the authority vested in him by Executive Orders Nos. 7, 8 and 9, the Commissioner of Labor and Industry adopted and promulgated a regulation, effective October 1, 1963, the challenged portion thereof reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cThe following records shall not be deemed public records, copies of which may be purchased or reproduced under the provisions of Chapter 73, P. L. 1963:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">a. All records required by statute to be made, maintained or kept on file pursuant to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, R. S. 34:15-1 et seq., <em>if the purpose of the inspection or copying is to provide employers with information concerning prospective employees.\u201d </em>(Italics ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">This 1963 regulation had a history. Plaintiff has for several years conducted a business which it styles \u201cAn Independent Research Service Dedicated to the Prevention and Reduction of Accidents in Industry and on the Highways.\u201d In 1968, or prior thereto, it published and circulated an advertising brochure entitled, \u201cHow Much Do You Really Know About the Man You Are About to Hire?\u201d This publication advised employers of the costly mistakes of hiring persons \u201cwhose record of physical disabilities and mental handicaps disqualifies them for the jobs to which they have been assigned.\u201d It noted that \u201call too often the employer finds that he has unwittingly put on his payroll a workmen\u2019s compensation \u2018professional.\u2019 It is only when an injury is reported and a claim filed that the hapless employer finds that he has Teen taken.\u2019 Then it is too late.\u201d It solicited insurance companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>and employers for membership at an annual fee of $25 and, for a report charge of only $5, engaged that it would furnish \u201ca complete history of previous injuries and claims by any individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On March 26, 1958 the Attorney General took note of plaintiff\u2019s brochure and rendered an opinion, at the request of the then Commissioner of Labor and Industry, in which he stated that the Commissioner could refuse to permit plaintiff to search the records of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u201cwhere the purpose of the search is to provide employers with information concerning prospective employees.\u201d The rationale of that conclusion is summed up in the following language of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cNo person can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public good. * * * The service as outlined by Accident Index Bureau, Inc. is designed to discourage the employment of the handicapped and would frustrate the efforts of the Department of Labor and Industry to effectuate the policy of this State concerning industrial injuries and employment of the handicapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">On September 23, 1958 the executive vice-president of the New Jersey State Council of the C.I.O. wrote a letter to the then Director of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, therein called attention to plaintiff\u2019s aforesaid brochure, complained that plaintiff\u2019s operation was influencing employers to reject applicants for employment who had previously sustained compensable injuries and questioned whether the Division should permit plaintiff to inspect the workmen\u2019s compensation flies.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Despite this letter and the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, plaintiff was not prohibited from inspecting and copying workmen\u2019s compensation records for reports to prospective employers prior to October 1, 1963, when the departmental regulation now under review became effective. The present Director of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation advised plaintiff\u2019s Mr. Grosman, by letter of October 29, 1963, that inspection of the Division\u2019s records would not be permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\"where the purpose of inspection of our records is to furnish an employer with information concerning prospective employees,\u201d but no one would be subject to the restriction where the purpose of inspection was other than that. On December 13, 1963 the Director issued a directive requiring persons searching the records to represent in writing that their purpose is not to supply employers with information concerning prospective employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Workmen\u2019s compensation records are required by law to be made, maintained and kept on file. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-58. The Secretary of the Bureau is required by law to file the record of each case left with him by the official conducting the hearing, and to \u201ckeep a card index of such record in such manner as to afford ready reference thereto. <em>Such records shall be open to the inspection of the public.\u201d </em>(Italics ours). <em>R. S. </em>34:15-59. Hence, there can be no doubt that, by express legislative pronouncement, they are essentially \"public records,\u201d in the same general category as judgment records of courts of law. For a definition of a \u201cpublic record,\u201d see <em>Moore v. Bd. of Freeholders of Mercer County, </em>76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>396, 406-407 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962), modified 39 <em>N. J. </em>26 (1962); <em>Josefowicz v. Porter, </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>585, 591 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954); 76 <em>C. J. S., Records, </em>\u00a7 1, <em>p. </em>112; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>47:3-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The right of a citizen to inspect public records has never been an unlimited one. <em>Rex v. Shelley, </em>3 <em>T. R. </em>141 <em>(K. B. </em>1789); <em>Ferry v. Williams, </em>41 <em>N. J. L. </em>332 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1879); <em>In re Freeman, </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>329 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1907); <em>Moore v. Bd. of Freeholders of Mercer County, supra. </em>76 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>407. The right to inspect public records has been subject to the requirement of a lawful, proper and legitimate purpose not adverse to the public interest. <em>Cross, The People\u2019s Right to Know </em>(1953), <em>p. </em>36; <em>Taxpayers </em>Association <em>of Cape May, New Jersey v. City of Cape May, </em>2 <em>N. J. Super. </em>27, 31 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949); <em>Casey v. MacPhail, </em>2 <em>N. J. Super. </em>619, 624 <em>(Law Div. </em>1949). Thus, the inspection may not interfere with the performance of official duties. <em>Tax</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>payers Association of Cape May, New Jersey v. City of Cape May, supra, </em>2 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>29; <em>Casey v. MacPhail, supra, </em>2 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>624. So, too, it has been properly said, \u201cThere is no right o\u00ed inspection of a public record when the inspection is sought to satisfy a person\u2019s mere whim or fancy, to engage in a pastime, to create scandal, to degrade another, to injure public morals, or to further any improper or useless end or purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Harrison, </em>130 W. <em>Va. </em>246, 250, 43 <em>S. E. 2d </em>214, 218 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. </em>1947). Even <em>L. </em>1963, <em>c. </em>73, \u201cThe Light to Know Law,\u201d declaratory of the State\u2019s public policy that public records shall be readily accessible for examination by the citizens of this State, expressly notes \u201cthe protection of the public interest\u201d as an exception thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The solicitude of our State for those disabled and handicapped by industrial accidents is understandable and commendable. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act itself and the liberal interpretation of this remedial legislation by our courts attest to that solicitude. <em>Morris v. Hermann Forwarding Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>195, 197-198 (1955). The provisions in the law for the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped for placement in remunerative employment, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:16-20 <em>et seq., </em>and the creation of the One Percent Eund, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-94 <em>et seq., </em>to encourage the hiring of the handicapped, evince our public policy to help rather than hinder the disabled in their search for employment. <em>Richardson v. Essex National Trunk and Bag Co., Inc., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>47, 52 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1937); W<em>exler v. Lambrecht Foods, </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>489, 501 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">But this noble purpose will not justify the State\u2019s precluding employers from ascertaining the prior workmen\u2019s compensation history, if any, of prospective employees. The proper placement of the disabled and handicapped in positions suitable to their physical capabilities should be a matter of grave concern to a conscientious employer. Existing disabilities can be easily aggravated and dormant physical conditions can flare into activity, with serious consequences to the worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and the employer, if the worker is given duties to perform beyond his physical capacities or is required to perform them under conditions adverse to some underlying ailment. So, too, an employer has a right to protection against the fraudulent claimant, who is not entitled to the State\u2019s benignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Defendants do not contend that an employer is not entitled to the information concerning a prospective employee\u2019s previous workmen\u2019s compensation history. Indeed, an employer could ask the prospective employee to furnish that information completely in his application for employment. Pive minutes after the applicant had been placed on the payroll, the employer could avail himself of plaintiff\u2019s services and plaintiff could inspect and copy the workmen\u2019s compensation records without violating the regulation, because it is limited to \u201cprospective employees.\u201d Thus, the regulation discriminates unreasonably between an employer who seeks the information immediately before the hiring and one who seeks the same information, through the same service, immediately after the hiring. A deceived employer would not be likely to retain his deceiver in his employ. Such an illusory regulation would only serve to expose an employer to the risk of a workmen\u2019s compensation claim in the short interval while the fraud was being uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendants tell us that they take no position in this litigation \u201cas to the right of prospective employers themselves to come in and inspect these records on their own initiative.\u201d They regard the regulation in issue as being directed more particularly against plaintiff\u2019s commercial enterprise \u201cwhich affirmatively and aggressively places this information under the noses of prospective employers who might not otherwise have considered it significant in their hiring policies.\u201d It is significant to note at this point that plaintiff does not make a report as to the workmen\u2019s compensation history of an individual, unless and until the prospective employer specifically requests that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The reluctance of the Commissioner of Labor to take a position as to whether his own regulation prohibits employers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>themselves from inspecting workmen\u2019s compensation files of prospective employees points np the dubious, illusory and arbitrary nature of the regulation. If an employer may not look at these records for the legitimate purpose of selection and placement of employees, the State would be unjustifiably depriving him of his right to know facts essential to his economic interest, contained in public records which the Legislature has expressly declared shall be open to public inspection. <em>B. S. </em>34:15-59. It is fair to assume that the Legislature did not intend the 1963 \u201cBight to Know Law\u201d to take away by an administrative regulation a right which employers had enjoyed prior to adoption of the 1963 act. We are satisfied that the Legislature did not contemplate that this liberal legislation would serve as a basis for a departmental regulation which would literally pull the wool over the eyes of prospective employers, even in aid of the State\u2019s policy to help the handicapped. Sound public morality does not subscribe to the rule, \u201cThe end justifies the means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On the other hand, if wo assume that, employers themselves are not precluded by this regulation from inspecting workmen\u2019s compensation files of prospective employees, it follows that they may, and in the case of corporate employers must, deputize some <em>alter ego </em>to make the inspection for them. It would be arbitrary and discriminatory for the Commissioner of Labor to permit one prospective employer, or his agent, to make the inspection and to deny the same right of inspection to another employer, merely because the latter sought the same information through the medium of plaintilf\u2019s services. If the right to inspect is made to turn upon whether the inspector is an \u201cagent\u201d of the prospective employer, rather than an authorized \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d it is obvious that such an arbitrary distinction could bo readily annihilated by the employer\u2019s designation of plaintiff as its \u201cagent\u201d for the purpose of inspection. Thus, the regulation reduces itself to an absurdity and contravenes substantive due process of law. It would serve no good and remedy no evil under such a flexible makeup. Its only <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>would be discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tion against plaintiff and similar organizations rendering services for, and at the request of, employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We appreciate the proper concern of defendants and organized labor for helping the disabled and handicapped to obtain gainful employment and the important public interest involved in achieving that objective. But that objective cannot be legitimately advanced or soundly accomplished by taking advantage of unwary and uninformed employers. At the same time, we do not, in declaring the regulation in issue invalid, place our <em>imprimatur </em>upon the contents of plaintiff\u2019s brochures. This scare-type advertising has a tendency to be unduly alarming and disserves the public policy of encouraging employers to hire the disabled. There is an emphasis upon the \u201cprofessional\u201d workmen\u2019s compensation claimant and an inadequate counterbalance of information in favor of the honest, but unfortunate victims of industrial accidents. However, we are not called upon herein to determine the propriety of plaintiff\u2019s advertising methods, or its constitutional right of freedom of speech and of the press in soliciting business by means thereof. We decide only that the challenged regulation is invalid for the reasons noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">It is axiomatic that courts will not decide constitutional issues not necessary to the disposition of the case before them. <em>Ashwander v. T. V. A., </em>297 U. <em>S. </em>288, 347, 56 <em>S. Ct. </em>466, 80 <em>L. Ed. </em>688 (1936); <em>Rottschaefer on Constitutional Law </em>(1939), <em>p. </em>26; <em>Weaver, Constitutional Law </em>(1946), <em>p. </em>69. Eor that reason, having determined that the regulation of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry is invalid and, therefor, dispositive of the case before us, we deliberately refrain from passing upon the other constitutional issues raised by plaintiff, namely, the constitutionality of the underlying statute, <em>L. </em>1963, <em>c. </em>73, and Executive Order No. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We adjudge and declare the challenged regulation of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, dated July 31, 1963 and effective October 1, 1963, to be invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
