J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">The Passaic County grand jury returned an indictment in two counts charging defendant with carnal abuse of L, a 14-year-old girl, in violation of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:138-1. The first count charged the offense was committed on October 5, 1961 and the second count charged an offense in November 1961. A jury trial resulted in a verdict of guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second. The County Court judge imposed a State Prison sentence of 3-5 years. On this appeal defendant contends that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case and in not setting the verdict aside as against the weight of the evidence; (2) plain error by the trial court in permitting the jury to consider the doctrine of assenting silence as probative of guilt; (3) plain error in the court\u2019s failure to caution the jury with respect to the inherent weakness of the doctrine of assenting silence; and (4) plain error in failing to charge the jury that it might draw an unfavorable inference against the State because it did not call certain witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Defendant had from time to time lived with L\u2019s mother in Paterson and was called \"stepfather\u201d by her children. L tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tif\u00eded that on October 5, 1961 she and a younger brother rode with defendant from their home to his store, where he was to give them some groceries for the house. The three descended to a cellar where defendant said the groceries were kept. He then sent the boy upstairs, held a knife to the girl\u2019s throat, ordered her to disrobe, and had sexual relations with her. They then rejoined the boy, who had been waiting upstairs for 15 to 35 minutes. The girl had been crying and her eyes were red. To make sure her mother would not suspect anything, defendant drove L and her brother around for a while before taking them home. The girl further testified that she did not tell her mother of what had happened for several months because she was in fear of defendant. She said that sometime in November 1961 \u2014 she could not fix the date \u2014 defendant again took her to the same cellar and again carnally abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">L\u2019s pregnancy came to light in February 1963. On March 13 an older brother lodged a complaint against defendant with the Paterson police. The girl gave the police a statement the next day, in the course of which she said there had been two occasions when defendant sexually abused her, the first on August 4, 1961 and the second on February 33, 1963. Defendant was present when this statement was given, but remained silent throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The indictments, as noted, charged defendant with carnal abuse on October 5, 1961 and in November 1961. To explain the discrepancy in dates, L testified that \"at that time I didn\u2019t know my months in Spanish so good, and my mother told me it was on August, and I don\u2019t know what month in English, so I told that month and when I got home my mother told me I told the wrong month because it was supposed to be October, because I didn\u2019t know my months in Spanish and she told me in Spanish.\u201d She insisted, however, that the correct date of the first incident was October 5, 1961, and the second had happened in November.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Defendant asserts that L changed her mind about the dates and testified that the acts in question took place on October 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>and in November 1961 in order to conform to the fact that her child was born on July 18, 1962. That birth, he says, proved that she had had relations with some male, but not necessarily with him. In his testimony defendant suggested that the complaint lodged with the police on March 13, 1962 was in order to \u201cget even\u201d with Mm because of an argument he had had with the girl\u2019s mother the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> Defendant asks that we reverse the conviction because the trial judge wrongly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. <em>R. R. </em>3:7-6 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">\u201c* * * The court, on motion of a defendant or of its own motion, shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal * * * at the close of the State\u2019s case or after the evidence of both sides has closed, if the evidence is insufficient to warrant a conviction. * * \u00ae\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The test to be applied on a motion made at the close of the State\u2019s case is whether the evidence before the trial court, viewed in its entirety and giving the State the benefit of all legitimate inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom, was such that the jury could properly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the crime charged. <em>State v. Fiorello, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>80, 90 (1961). It is not required that the State\u2019s proofs exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt. <em>State v. Graziani, </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 13 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), affirmed 31 <em>N. J. </em>538 (1960), <em>certiorari </em>denied 363 <em>U. S. </em>830, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>1601, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1524 (1960). Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence adduced by the State established a <em>prima facie </em>case, requiring defendant to present his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Defendant\u2019s argument under this point proceeds on the mistaken assumption that corroborative evidence of the victim\u2019s testimony was legally required. It is clear that in our jurisdiction a conviction for a morals or sex offense may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>be sustained on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. <em>State v. Fleckenstein, </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>399, 405 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), certification denied 33 <em>N. J. </em>109 (1960). Moreover, it appears that in the absence of statute the law elsewhere is generally in accord. 7 <em>Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a7 2061, <em>p. </em>342; Annotation, 60 <em>A. L. R. </em>1124, 1125 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Despite defendant\u2019s assertion that the State\u2019s case rested solely on the girl\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, there were, in fact, other elements of proof pointing toward guilt. There was the testimony of Sergeant Moore, the officer who took defendant into custody for investigation on March 13, 1962, who said that defendant started to fee when approached by him. (When defendant took the stand he denied that he ran.) Although defendant stopped after taking a few steps, the circumstance was some evidence, however slim, tending to prove a consciousness of guilt. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Petrolia, 45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>230 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). Of similar effect was the testimony of L\u2019s brother that defendant hid when the police came to the apartment. <em>Cf. State v. Reed, </em>62 <em>N. J. Super. </em>303, 311 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), reversed on other grounds 34 <em>N. J. </em>554 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Defendant points to several inconsistencies in the girl\u2019s testimony which, it is claimed, renders her testimony suspect. First, there was the question of the dates of the offenses, already referred to. Next, the girl testified that she became pregnant as a result of the October 5, 1961 incident, and that this occurred at a time when she was experiencing her menstrual period. Defendant argues that the child could not have been conceived at such time. (It is appropriate to observe at this point that the instant litigation is not a bastardy proceeding. It is not material that the baby was sired at another time or by another man. The question which the jury had to determine was whether defendant carnally abused the girl on October 5, 1961 and again in November 1961.) And finally, defendant contends that the girl\u2019s testimony is suspect because she failed to make any accusation against defendant for a period of several months, and that no complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>made until after there had been a serious argument between defendant and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The short answer to these alleged deficiencies in the State\u2019s case is that it was for the jury to determine where the truth lay. It was free to believe or disbelieve the girl\u2019s explanation about the dates, or that she was taken advantage of while experiencing her period; and it was for the jury to appraise the delay in bringing a complaint. <em>Cf. State v. Welsch, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>152, 155 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The trial court, then, was correct in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. As for his claim that the verdict should have been set aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence, we note that the defense made no such motion. But even had such a request been made, the trial judge would have been entirely correct in denying it, in light of <em>R. R. </em>3 :7-6 and what we have said as to the motion made at the close of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Defendant would have us reverse the conviction on the ground that it was against the weight of the evidence. Here the provisions of <em>R. R. </em>1:5-1 (a), made applicable to this court by <em>R. R. </em>2 :5, come into play. The verdict of a jury may not be set aside as against the weight of the evidence unless it clearly and convincingly appears that the verdict was the result of mistake, partiality, prejudice or passion. That test is not met under the facts here present. As long as a verdict rests upon testimony competent to sustain the inference implied in such a finding, it is ordinarily conclusive upon us. As has repeatedly been said, our review upon appeal is aimed only at. correcting injustice resulting from obvious failure of the jury to perform its function. <em>State v. Haines, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>550, 565 (1955); <em>State v. Welsch, </em>above, 29 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>155-156. Defendant has not shown that the jury failed to do so, or that it ignored the evidence and rendered its verdict on the basis of mistake, partiality, prejudice or passion\u2014 as against his claim that he received <em>\u201ca </em>raw deal.\u201d On the contrary, the jury displayed a reasoned judgment and a care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ful consideration of the evidence when it returned a verdict of not guilty on the second count charging carnal abuse in November 1961, because the evidence under that charge was vague and indefinite, in contrast to that given in support of the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"> Defendant claims that the court committed reversible error when it failed to charge the jury that it might draw an unfavorable inference against the State for its failure to call the girl\u2019s older brother or her mother to the stand. The defense concedes that no request to so charge was made. In such circumstances a defendant may not avail himself of a failure to charge where the point raised is not fundamental to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument here is, in essence, a variation on his earlier theme of corroboration. As we have said, the rule obtaining in our courts is that corroboration of a victim\u2019s testimony is not legally essential to a conviction. We perceive no prejudicial error in the failure to charge as to the nonproduction of the two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">We come, then, to the real point of the case, which is that the trial court committed plain error in permitting the jury to consider the doctrine of assenting silence as probative of guilt. Defendant\u2019s brief launches a broadside attack against that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The doctrine of assenting silence, first authoritatively projected in the leading case of <em>Donnelly v. </em>State, 26 <em>N. J. L. </em>601, 612 <em>et seq. (E. &amp; A. </em>1857), has in the recent past undergone considerable attenuation. Eollowing the relatively uncritical acceptance of the doctrine in <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>205, 209 (1953), and <em>State v. </em>Landeros, 20 <em>N. J. </em>76, 84 (1955), came <em>State v. </em>Kobylarz, 44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>250 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), certification denied 24 <em>N. J. </em>548 (1957). Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Jayne there discussed the doctrine at some length. He rather clearly indicated his dissatisfaction with the assumptions regarding human nature which are said to support the doctrine, and the fairly rigid application given it by courts of this and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The doctrine of assenting silence, as defined in <em>Donnelly, </em>is out of touch with what the behavioristic sciences have taught us in recent years. One theory upon which the doctrine rests is that failure to deny .an accusation may be taken as a tacit admission of the fact stated. A second theory would have it that whether the accused intended to admit the statement or not, his failure to deny was behavior manifesting a consciousness of guilt of the particular crime. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 247(b), <em>p. </em>258 (1954); 4 <em>Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a7 1071, <em>p. </em>70, and \u00a7 1072(6) (a), <em>p. </em>89; <em>Model Code of Evidence, Rule </em>507, <em>comment </em>(b), <em>p. </em>247 (1942); <em>Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Evidence, pp. </em>163-164 (1963); Brody, \u201cAdmissions Implied From Silence, Evasion and Equivocation in Massachusetts Criminal Cases,\u201d 42 <em>B. U. L. Rev. </em>46, 47-48 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">As Ililles, in his excellent and very comprehensive treatment of the entire subject, points out in his article, \u201cTacit Criminal Admissions,\u201d 112 <em>U. Pa. L. Rev. </em>210 (1963), these theories \u201chave not been empirically tested, but rest solely upon intuitive concepts of normal human conduct.\u201d See <em>Miller v. United States, </em>116 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>45, 320 <em>F. 2d </em>767, 773, <em>n. </em>13 (1963), where Chief Judge Bazelon quotes the statement of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, p. </em>102 (1949-1953); <em>Commonwealth v. Vallone, </em>347 <em>Pa. </em>419, 425, 32 <em>A. 2d </em>889, 892 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943) (Maxey, C. J., dissenting). Although some authorities have expressed the consciousness of guilt theory as the more preferable of the two, an accused may manifest guilt feelings, not as to the particular accusation leveled against him, but from a general sense of guilt, or from guilt of another crime, as Chief Judge Bazelon pointed out in <em>Miller. </em>And see Hutchins and Schlesinger, \u201cSome Ob-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>serrations on the Law of Evidence\u2014Consciousness of Guilt,\u201d 77 <em>U. Pa. L. Rev. </em>725, 737 (1929). As Judge Jayne put it in <em>Kobylarz, </em>\u201chuman emotions and impulses constitute an erratic and unstable pedestal upon which to perpetuate a rule of law. We observe today that so many accused persons deliberately recognize safety in silence and are more interested in protection from eventual prosecution and conviction than in preliminary protestations of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The uncertainty which attends interpreting an accused\u2019s silence as an implied admission of the statement made, or as exhibiting a consciousness of guilt, has led courts to consider such evidence as dangerous and to be received with caution. See, for example, <em>People v. Kennedy, </em>164 <em>N. Y. </em>449, 456-7, 58 <em>N. E. </em>652, 654 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1900); <em>People v. Nitti, </em>312 <em>Ill. </em>73, 91, 143 <em>N. E. </em>448, 454-5 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924) (alternative holding); see also the quotation from the charge in <em>Kobylarz, </em>above, 44 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>261.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Recognizing that the doctrine of assenting silence \u201cat its best brings about the weakest assumption known to the law,\u201d <em>People v. Todaro, </em>256 <em>Mich. </em>427, 435, 240 <em>N. W. </em>90, 93 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932) (dissenting opinion), courts generally have imposed conditions upon the introduction of evidence that an alleged admission by silence has occurred. Thus, it was said in <em>Kobylarz, </em>above, 44 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>259, that to constitute proof of an admission by silence, the evidence must disclose that (1) the statement was extra-judicial; (2) it was incriminatory or accusative in import; (3) it was one to which an innocent man would in the situation and surrounding circumstances naturally respond; (4) it was uttered in the presence and hearing of the accused; (5) he was capable of understanding the incriminatory meaning of the statement; and (6) he was at liberty to deny or reply thereto. And see Hilles, <em>op. cit., </em>at <em>page </em>213, and <em>notes </em>26 through 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Judge Jajme readily acknowledged in <em>Kobylarz </em>that the doctrine of assenting silence has been rejected by many courts of the highest credit. However, he considered it settled in this jurisdiction that evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>not necessarily be excluded merely because, at the time he was confronted with the accusative statment, he was in the custody of police officers, citing <em>State v. Landeros, </em>above, 20 <em>N. J. 76, </em>the then most recent expression of our highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In 1960 Justice Jacobs, writing for the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Butler, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>166, 181\u20142, recognized that authorities throughout the country have divided on the issue of whether courts should admit evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence in the face of an accusatory statement made while he was under arrest or in custody. Despite the fact that the principle first stated in <em>State v. Donnelly, </em>above (1857), had repeatedly been applied by our courts in such circumstances, Justice Jacobs observed that \u201csuch application has recently been brought into serious question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">It has been pointed out that the police are not entirely unaware of the uses to which the doctrine can be put. It is said that it is not uncommon for enforcement officers to accuse one under arrest or in their custody, or to confront him with his accusing victim or with the inculpatory confession of an alleged accomplice, in the hope that this may prompt a confession or a tacit admission by silence. If the accused stands mute, he runs the risk that the prosecution may seek to have testimony regarding his silence introduced at the trial to establish a tacit admission. See <em>Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Evidence, </em>above, <em>loc. cit.; </em>Hilles, <em>op. cit., </em>at <em>page </em>234 <em>et seq., </em>and <em>notes </em>152-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Application of the doctrine of assenting silence presents considerations of a more serious nature when the so-called tacit admission is made in the presence of the police who have the defendant in custody or under arrest. As Hilles observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c* * * Evidence of an admission by silence forces the defendant tactically to elect between Ms right not to testify at trial and the obvious need to explain his reaction to the accusation, thus indirectly affecting his privilege against self-incrimination. This type of evidence also raises a more direct self-incrimination issue to the extent that one purpose of that privilege is to prevent the silence of an accused in the presence of authorities from being used against him at trial.\u201d (112 <em>U. Pa. L. Rev., </em>at <em>page </em>214)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>And see his elaboration of this point at <em>pages </em>247-251, and the discussion of the possible application of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, at <em>pages </em>251-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In the light of the probative weakness of silence and the possibility that such silence in the presence of police authorities results from fear or from a belief in a right of silence or the wisdom of silence, and further, because of considerations of fundamental constitutional importance, a number of courts have adopted the rule (first expressed by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Commonwealth v. Kenney, </em>53 <em>Mass. </em>235 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1847)) that the arrest or taking into police custody of an accused in itself excludes evidence of a subsequent admission by silence. Commentators generally favoring this rule are Brody, <em>op. cit., </em>42 <em>B. U. L. Rev., note </em>257, at <em>pages </em>48-49; Heller, \u201cAdmissions by Acquiescence,\u201d 15 <em>U. Miami L. Rev. </em>161, 173, <em>note </em>99 (1960); Note, 40 <em>Minn. L. Rev. </em>598, 607 (1956); Comment, 6 <em>U. C. L. A. Rev. </em>593, 601-2 (1959); \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Evidence,\u201d 46 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>1138, 1162-3 (1933). Hilles lists 12 jurisdictions as accepting the rule; 20 have rejected it; 6 have reserved the question (New Jersey apparently belongs in this category by reason of <em>State v. Butler, </em>above), and 12 have no clear position. And in the federal system he notes that 5 circuits have accepted the rule, 1 rejected it, 1 reserved the question, and 4 (among them the Third Circuit) have not decided the issue. <em>Op. cit., </em>at <em>pages </em>253-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We have discussed the doctrine of assenting silence generally as a frame of reference within which the more particular factual pattern of the present appeal falls. The recent past has witnessed a reawakened interest in criminal law and criminal procedure. Courts are taking a fresh look at old doctrines, and this one, like the rule which permits a jury to make an inference of guilt from the failure of a defendant to take the stand, invites judicial reexamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Were we at liberty to do so, we would reverse the conviction under appeal by applying the enlightened rule which so many jurisdictions have embraced. We are constrained by the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that our highest court has not yet completely abrogated the principle of <em>State v. Donnelly </em>in a situation like the present \u2022 one. However, what Justice Jacobs said in <em>State v. Butler </em>would appear to point in the direction of the position taken by some of the highest courts in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">It is possible to resolve the question before us within the four corners of what was said in the <em>Kobylarz </em>case. The court there held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201c* * * where an accused is in the custody of the police at a relatively formal meeting deliberately arranged and attended by officers hostile to him and there faced with the incriminatory accusations, the circumstances amid which he remains silent should be shown to be such that no explanation of his silence is reasonable other than his acquiescence in the truth of the accusations.\u201d (44 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>259)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em>Kobylarz </em>was favorably cited, and the quoted language emphasized, by Justice Jacobs in <em>State v. </em>Butler, above, 32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>184.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Defendant was taken into custody on-the evening of March 13, 1962 by Sergeant Moore of the Paterson police, who told him he' was being taken to headquarters for investigation. Detective Sergeant Lynch was assigned to the case the next day and spoke to defendant shortly after 9 a. m. The following portion of his testimony is significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">\u201cQ. And what was the first thing that you did in connection with this investigation? A. I questioned the defendant regarding the accusations made by [L].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">Q. And what, if anything, did he say? A. <em>He denied them and refused to sap anything further regarding the investigation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">Q. And what happened after that? A. A short time thereafter we took a Statement from [L], By \u2018we\u2019 I mean myself and Sergeant Blackman in the presence of defendant.\u201d (Italics ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">L\u2019s statement was taken in question and answer form, and typed out in the policewomen\u2019s office at headquarters. Present were Lynch, Police Woman Sergeant Edwards (formerly Blackman), L, defendant, and the girl\u2019s older brother. Defendant sat within close range as Lynch put the questions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>L gave her answers. Defendant understood and spoke English. He said nothing during the taking of this statment and no one had advised him to participate or not participate in the proceedings. When defendant was asked to sign L\u2019s statement merely as a witness, he refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Knowing all this, the prosecuting attorney should never have introduced evidence regarding the statement and defendant\u2019s silence. Instead, he first had Sergeant Edwards relate all the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and defendant\u2019s silence. He then called Sergeant Lynch to the witness stand, and it was only then that the testimony about defendant\u2019s earlier denial of the accusations and his refusal to say anything further about the matter came out. The trial judge should then and there \u2014 whether there was formal objection or not\u2014-have refused to permit any evidence regarding L\u2019s statement and defendant\u2019s silence. He should also have directed the jury, in the clearest language he could summon, to ignore any such testimony as may have been given before Lynch took the stand. He did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Most courts have excluded all such evidence where the accused, then in police custody or under arrest, initially denied the accusation and then remained silent when subsequently confronted by the person making the accusatory statement. <em>People v. </em>Collins, 234 <em>N. Y. </em>355, 364-5, 137 <em>N. E. </em>753, 757 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1922), and <em>State v. </em>Dills, 208 <em>N. C. </em>313, 180 <em>S. E. </em>571 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), both alternative holdings; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Mazarella, 279 <em>Pa. </em>465, 124 <em>A. </em>163 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924) (apparently ignored by the Pennsylvania Superior Court in later cases, such as <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Dodson, 174 <em>Pa. Super. </em>421, 101 <em>A. 2d </em>411 (1953)). They have said that an accused is not likely to \u201ccontinue to shout his denial,\u201d <em>People v. </em>Nitti, above, 312 <em>Ill. </em>73, 93, 143 <em>N. E. </em>448, 455 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924), or that \u201cit may well be that having denied his guilt on the previous occasion * * * he thought it useless to continue to do so,\u201d <em>People v. </em>Bennett, 413 <em>Ill. </em>601, 609, 110 <em>N. E. 2d </em>175, 178 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>It was reversible error to permit the testimony in question to be received in evidence. That error was magnified by subsequent developments at the trial. The prosecutor stressed the assenting silence in his summation, and the judge in his charge dwelt on the implied admission, leaving it for the jury to determine the applicability of the doctrine\u2014after giving the jury the six conditions laid down by <em>Kobylarz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The judgment of conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
