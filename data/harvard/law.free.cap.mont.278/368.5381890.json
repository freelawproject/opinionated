We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">For purposes of this decision, this Court will discuss only the following dispositive issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">1) Is the mailing of a request for review with the DOR the equivalent of \u201csubmitting\u201d a request under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">2) Did the District Court err in holding that the CTAB did not have jurisdiction to hear Canbra\u2019s appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">In 1993, the Department of Revenue (the DOR) assessed property owned by Canbra at a value of $7,277,136. The DOR mailed an assessment notice to Canbra on June 24, 1993. However, the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>was returned by the Postal Service because the DOR had failed to pay adequate postage. On July 9, 1993, Canbra contacted the DOR inquiring whether an assessment had been sent. In response, the DOR sent Canbra another copy of the appraisal both by mail and facsimile. The facsimile received by Canbra was illegible. Canbra received a legible copy of the appraisal by mail on July 12,1993. The DOR argues that Canbra received notice of the classification and appraisal on July 9, 1993, the date on which the DOR provided the information to Canbra via facsimile; thus, the deadline to file an appeal would have been fifteen days from July 9, 1993. The District Court, however, adopted the July 12th date upon which Canbra received notice by mail. Since the DOR has not appealed from that ruling, the date of July 12,1993, will be used as the date upon which Canbra received notice of the classification and appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Canbra disagreed with the DOR\u2019s $7,277,136 assessment of the property. On July 27,1993, Canbra mailed a Form AB-26 requesting that the DOR review the assessment. On the same day, Canbra also mailed an appeal of the assessment to the CTAB. The DOR rejected Canbra\u2019s request for review of its valuation finding the request was not timely. Although the DOR did not conduct a review of the valuation of the property, the CTAB reduced Canbra\u2019s property assessment to $4,000,000 in response to Canbra\u2019s appeal. Despite the reduction, Canbra appealed the CTAB\u2019s decision to the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB) which dismissed the appeal finding that Can-bra\u2019s original July 27,1993 appeal to the CTAB was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Canbra appealed the STAB\u2019s decision to the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. In its appeal, Canbra maintained that mailing its request for review to the DOR was a sufficient means of \u201csubmitting an objection\u201d under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993). In addition, Canbra contended that mailing a notice of appeal was a sufficient method of filing an appeal with the CTAB. The District Court disagreed, holding that a timely filing of the appeal was a jurisdictional prerequisite which could not be waived. The District Court reasoned that, \u201can application for reduction of a property valuation must be <em>filed </em>with the county tax appeal board within 15 days after receiving either a notice of classification and appraisal or a determination after the review provided for in \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The District Court posed the question as follows: \u201c[w]hether an appeal or request for review is considered \u2018filed\u2019 on the date it is placed in the mail by a petitioner[?]\u201d The District Court then concluded that, for purposes of requesting a review with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the DOR or appealing to the CTAB, mailing is not the equivalent of filing. Thus, the Court held, since Canbra did not timely \u201cfile\u201d either the request for review or the appeal, CTAB did not have jurisdiction to hear Canbra\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">1) Is the mailing of a request for review with the DOR the equivalent of \u201csubmitting\u201d a request under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993)? [1] Whether a mailing constitutes \u201csubmitting\u201d under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993), is a question of law. The standard of review for an administrative agency\u2019s conclusions of law is whether its interpretation of the law was correct. <em>Leahy v. Department of Revenue </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 94, 97, 879 P.2d 653, 655 (quoting <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 803 P.2d 601).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Section 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">If the owner of any land and improvements is dissatisfied with the appraisal as it reflects the market value of the property as determined by the department or with the classification of the land or improvements, the owner may request an assessment review <em>by submitting an objection in writing to the department, on forms provided by the department for that purpose, within 15 days after receiving the notice of classification and appraisal from the department. ... </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Section 15-15-102, MCA (1993), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">The valuation of property may not be reduced by the county tax appeal board unless either the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s agent makes and files a written application for reduction with the county tax appeal board. The application must be filed on or before the first Monday in June or 15 days after receiving either a notice of classification and appraisal or determination after review under 15-7-102(3) from the department of revenue or its agent, whichever is later. If the department\u2019s determination after review is not made in time to allow the county tax appeal board to review the matter during the current tax year, the appeal must be reviewed during the next tax year, but the decision by the county tax appeal board is effective for the year in which the request for review was filed with the department. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In the present case, the District Court held that Canbra\u2019s July 27, 1993, mailing did not constitute a \u201cfiling\u201d of a request for reduction of property valuation under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), within the requisite fifteen days. Rather, the District Court held that \u201cfiling\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>requires that the document be delivered to the designated office such that it is \u201creceived\u201d by the clerk or officer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The District Court\u2019s analysis relied on the filing requirement set forth in \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993). We note that \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), is somewhat confusing. It speaks of filing a \u201cwritten application for reduction\u201d rather than filing \u201can appeal.\u201d However, it then goes on to talk about the CTAB reviewing \u201cthe appeal.\u201d Accordingly we treat the filing of an application for reduction of property valuation under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), as synonymous with filing an appeal to the CTAB. As of 1993, \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), has provided that an application for reduction had to be filed before the first Monday in June or within fifteen days after receiving the DOR assessment review under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA, whichever is later. The court\u2019s analysis focused on the requirement that an appellant file his or her appeal within fifteen days after receiving notice of appraisal. However, the District Court ignored the fact that, under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), the fifteen-day \u201cfiling\u201d requirement for an appeal is extended if the taxpayer has \u201csubmitted\u201d a timely request for assessment review with the DOR under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993). That is, if there were a timely request for assessment review -under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993), the requirement that an appeal be \u201cfiled\u201d with the CTAB was not triggered until the DOR completed its assessment review and notified the appellant of the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>The request for assessment review:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Section 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993), does not require that the request for assessment review be \u201cfiled.\u201d Instead, it provides that the taxpayer could request an assessment review by <em>\u201csubmitting </em>an objection in writing to the department. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 15-15-102, MCA (1993), allows the taxpayer fifteen days after the DOR\u2019s determination on review to file an appeal. Thus, if a taxpayer \u201csubmitted\u201d a timely request for review by the DOR, he or she had fifteen days after receipt of the department\u2019s determination on review to \u201cfile\u201d an appeal. In the present case, Canbra mailed its appeal and its request for review on the same day, July 27, 1993. That mailing presents two questions: 1) does a mailing constitute \u201cfiling\u201d an appeal with the CTAB; and 2) does a mailing constitute \u201csubmitting\u201d an objection to the DOR under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993)?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We must first address the question of whether mailing constitutes \u201csubmitting\u201d a request for review under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993). If we answer that question in the affirmative, then, since the time for \u201cfiling\u201d an appeal under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>triggered until the DOR first conducted its assessment review, we need not address the question of whether a mailing satisfied the requirement that an appeal be \u201cfiled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Tax statutes are to be strictly construed against the taxing authorities and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Butte Country Club v. Department of Revenue </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 424, 430, 608 P.2d 111, 115. In the instant case, \u00a7 15-7-102(3) MCA (1993), required Canbra to \u201csubmit\u201d its request for assessment review to the DOR within fifteen days of receiving the appraisal. Here, the issue is whether Canbra\u2019s July 27, 1993, mailing satisfied the requirement that a request be \u201csubmitted\u201d within fifteen days of Canbra\u2019s receipt of the appraisal on July 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Although we have not had occasion to interpret the meaning of the term \u201csubmit,\u201d we note that the North Dakota Supreme Court in <em>Husebye v. Jaeger </em>(N.D. 1995), 534 N.W.2d 811, 815, addressed the distinction between \u201cfiling\u201d and \u201csubmitting.\u201d The North Dakota Court was asked to determine the constitutionality of a state statute requiring that referendum petitions be submitted to the Secretary of State by 5:00 p.m. on the day designated as the deadline. The North Dakota constitution does not require that a referendum petition be filed; rather, it provides that it \u201cmay be submitted\u201d only within 90 days. Art. II, Sec. 5, N.D. Const. Prior to 1978, the constitution had provided that such petitions be \u201cfiled.\u201d In deciding that the petition could be submitted until midnight on the 90th day, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3S\">As construed in the prior cases, \u201cfiling\u201d requires not only presentment of the document to the public official, but the officer\u2019s action of accepting it and placing it into the official records of the office for public examination. Similarly, this court has held, in the context of liens, that filing requires more than merely leaving the documents in the office of the appropriate official. <em>Powers Elevator Co. v. Pottner, </em>16 N.D. 359, 113 N.W. 703 (1907). Filing implies not only presentation, but official action to place the document into the permanent record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>Husebye, </em>534 N.W.2d at 815. The court then went on to contrast the requirement of \u201cfiling\u201d with \u201csubmitting.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">By contrast, the term \u201csubmit\u201d has a much less restrictive meaning. Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 1418 (2nd ed. 1982), defines \u201csubmit\u201d as \u201cto present or refer to others for decision, consideration, etc.\u201d <em>See also </em>83 C.J.S. Submit (1953) [\u201cThe verb \u2018submit\u2019 is defined generally as meaning to present for determination\u201d] . Submitting does not imply any required action on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of the recipient, but would be complete upon presentation. We conclude that, by changing the constitutional requirement from \u201cfiled\u201d within 90 days to \u201csubmitted\u201d within 90 days, the people intended a less restrictive requirement. The rationale of those cases holding that petitions must be filed by the close of normal business hours is inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><em>Husebye, </em>534 N.W.2d at 815. We agree that \u201csubmit\u201d is a less restrictive requirement than \u201cfiling;\u201d that the term \u201csubmit\u201d implies that the receiving party is not required to act; that a unilateral action on the part of a taxpayer will suffice. Thus, Canbra\u2019s unilateral act of mailing the AB-26 Form on July 27, 1993, satisfied the statutory requirement that the request be \u201csubmitted\u201d to the DOR within fifteen days of its receipt of the appraisal on July 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2) Did the District Court err by finding that the CTAB did not have jurisdiction to hear Canbra\u2019s appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The District Court concluded that because Canbra failed to file its appeal with the CTAB in time, the CTAB lacked jurisdiction to hear its appeal. The District Court explained that Canbra\u2019s letter to the CTAB did not satisfy the requirement that it \u201cfile\u201d its appeal within fifteen days of receiving notice of the classification and appraisal. The District Court concluded that the STAB\u2019s decision to dismiss Canbra\u2019s appeal was correct because Canbra\u2019s appeal to the CTAB was not filed in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Canbra\u2019s appeal to the CTAB was based on \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993). This statute requires a taxpayer to file an appeal with the county tax appeal board. However, a taxpayer is not required to file an appeal until the first Monday in June or fifteen days after receiving notice of classification and appraisal <em>or determination by the DOR pursuant to \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993). </em>Section 15-15-102, MCA (1993). Section 15-15-102, MCA (1993), clearly provides that, in the event a taxpayer requests the DOR to conduct an assessment review, the fifteen-day period for filing an appeal does not commence until the DOR has responded to the request for review under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993). Thus, since we have held that Canbra\u2019s July 27, 1993 mailing constituted a \u201csubmission\u201d of a request for the DOR review under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993), it was incumbent upon the DOR to conduct such a review. Until such time as that review has been conducted and Canbra has received notice of the DOR\u2019s determination, the fifteen days for filing an appeal to the CTAB has not yet commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>We hold that Canbra\u2019s July 27, 1993 appeal to the CTAB under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993), was premature since, having submitted a request for assessment review, Canbra has until fifteen days after it receives notice of the DOR\u2019s determination in response to the review to file an appeal to the CTAB. If Canbra is aggrieved by the DOR\u2019s appraisal after the review, it can then appeal to the CTAB within fifteen days after receiving notice of the DOR\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">We hold that Canbra submitted a timely request for an assessment review under \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA (1993); that the DOR has yet to address the merits of that request for assessment review; and that Canbra has fifteen days after receipt of the DOR\u2019s determination of that review within which to file an appeal to the CTAB under \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceeding consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-6\">JUSTICES ERDMANN, NELSON, TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
