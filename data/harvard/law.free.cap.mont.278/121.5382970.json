We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Jones\u2019 counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">The State of Montana (State) charged Jones with felony assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA, alleging that Jones purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to Kirby Sowers (Sowers) by striking Sowers \u201cabout the head and face with a beer bottle....\u201d T. R. Halvorson (Halvorson) was appointed to represent Jones and, thereafter, Jones pled not guilty to the charged offense. Trial was set for November 3, 1994. Two days prior to trial, Halvorson moved to withdraw as Jones\u2019 counsel. The State opposed the motion and requested an evidentiary hearing on the grounds for withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The hearing on Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw as Jones\u2019 counsel was not, strictly speaking, an evidentiary hearing; no sworn testimony was presented. The District Court merely invited Halvorson to establish a factual basis for his motion and Halvorson did so through narrative statements and various arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Halvorson based his motion, in part, on Rules 1.16(a)(1) and (b)(1), Montana Railes of Professional Conduct (MRPC). In this regard, Halvorson told the District Court that Jones had stated an intent to testify falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Halvorson also based his motion on Rule 1.16(b)(3), MRPC. The bulk of Halvorson\u2019s statements, disclosures and arguments in support of his motion to withdraw were based on his belief that Jones\u2019 decision to reject the plea agreement Halvorson had negotiated with the State and proceed to trial was repugnant or imprudent. Halvorson detailed the offense and Jones\u2019 role in it, and disclosed Jones\u2019 admission that he \u201cpunched [Sowers] with a bottle of beer in [Jones\u2019] right hand.\u201d Halvorson indicated that a felony assault had occurred and that Jones admitted having committed it. In addition, Halvorson stated that he did not have a defense to present to a jury on Jones\u2019 behalf. He opined that it was repugnant to deny criminal culpability to a jury where on an \u201copen and shut basis... there is guilt.\u201d Halvorson also indicated that Jones\u2019 decision to go to trial rather than accept a plea agreement \u201cwhen [Jones] stands virtually no chance of an acquittal\u201d was repugnant to him and constituted good cause for his withdrawal as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Jones denied that he had communicated an intent to testify falsely to Halvorson and stated that, in fact, he did not intend to testify at his trial. He asserted that Halvorson had \u201clied about a few things\u201d and that \u201c[he] disagreed] with everything [Halvorson] said, and that\u2019s fine if [Halvorson] drops out of [the] case.\u201d The District Court indicated that it was accepting Jones\u2019 statements as \u201cargument and testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Based on Jones\u2019 statement that he did not intend to testify, the District Court denied Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw. Several months later, a jury convicted Jones of felony assault and the District Court sentenced him and entered judgment. Jones appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw as Jones\u2019 counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Jones argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw. While advancing alternative bases for his argument, Jones\u2019 primary contention is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Halvorson had a conflict of interest which resulted in a denial of Jones\u2019 constitutional rights to a fair trial and to the effective assistance of counsel. The State disagrees, arguing that no conflict of interest existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The grant or denial of a lawyer\u2019s motion to withdraw is within the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Keys </em>(9th Cir. 1995), 67 F.3d 801, 807; <em>Petition of Jones </em>(1963), 143 Mont. 309, 309-10, 387 P.2d 712, 712. We review such discretionary matters to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Craig </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 140, 149, 906 P.2d 683, 688 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>GENERAL DUTIES OF ATTORNEY TO CLIENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to the assistance of counsel. Mere representation by counsel is not sufficient, however; the assistance must be effective to give true meaning to that right and to the right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Enright </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 225, 228, 758 P.2d 779, 781. Moreover, a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel is comprised of two correlative rights: the right to counsel of reasonable competence and the right to counsel\u2019s undivided loyalty. <em>State v. Christenson </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 351, 355, 820 P.2d 1303, 1306 (citations omitted). In the latter regard, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel contemplates the assistance of an attorney devoted \u201csolely to the interests of his client.\u201d <em>Frazer v. United States </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 18 F.3d 778, 784 (quoting <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 725-26, 68 S.Ct. 316, 324, 92 L.Ed. 309, 322). The duty of loyalty is \u201cperhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">An attorney owes a duty of confidentiality to his or her clients. Rule 1.6, MRPC. The duty of confidentiality is correlative to an attorney's duty of loyalty. <em>See, e.g., Damron v. Herzog </em>(9th Cir. 1995), 67 F.3d 211, 215. Thus, a defense attorney\u2019s disclosure of confidential information in violation of Rule 1.6, MRPC, necessarily implicates the attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty as well as the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>DISCLOSURE OF PERJURY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Rule 1.16, MRPC, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>(a)... a lawyer... shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">(1) the representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">(b)... a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client... if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">(1) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer\u2019s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Halvorson contended that his continued representation of Jones would result in a violation of a rule of professional conduct or other law because Jones intended to commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Rule 1.16(a)(1), MRPC, requires an attorney to withdraw where continued representation will result in a violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law. Halvorson stated that he had a conversation with Jones in which Jones communicated an intent to testify falsely and, in response, he informed Jones of the consequences of pexjury and that he could take no part in presenting perjured testimony to the District Corut. He further stated that he gave Jones a weekend over which to further consider Jones\u2019 intent to commit peijury and his advice in this regard. The record does not reflect that Halvorson checked back with Jones after the weekend passed, to ascertain whether Jones had reconsidered based on his advice, before filing his motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Halvorson conceded at the hearing on his motion to withdraw that Jones may have reconsidered and decided not to testify falsely. Thus, the record before us contains only an alleged possible intent to commit perjury. It does not support Halvorson\u2019s contention that his continued representation of Jones <em>would </em>result in a violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law and, as a result, it also does not support his motion to withdraw under Rule 1.16(a)(1), MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Rule 1.16(b)(1), MRPC, on which Halvorson also based his motion, permits an attorney to withdraw if the client persists in a course of conduct the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent. Webster\u2019s Ninth New College Dictionary (1988) defines \u201cpersist\u201d as \u201cto go on resolutely or stubbornly in spite of opposition, importunity, or warning.\u201d Here, nothing of record indicates that Jones was \u201cpersisting\u201d in his alleged intent to testify falsely after considering Halvorson\u2019s advice and warning. The record before us does not support withdrawal based on Rule 1.16(b)(1), MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In this regard, Jones and the amici curiae urge our adoption of a variety of standards of knowledge which an attorney should be required to possess prior to moving to withdraw based on a criminal defendant client\u2019s intent to commit peijury. Jones contends that a \u201cfirm factual basis\u201d must exist. The Criminal Defense Section of the State Bar of Montana asserts that counsel must be \u201cabsolutely convinced in his own mind, and in fact beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the client will commit perjury before moving to withdraw. The State Bar of Montana Ethics Committee recommends that counsel must <em>\u201cknow\u201d </em>that the defendant intends to perjure himself or herself and that a maintained and reiterated statement of intent to do so should be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We decline to adopt a particular knowledge standard in this case where no findings of fact have been made by the trial court. Moreover, it is unnecessary to do so in this case because it is clear that Halvorson did not meet any standard of knowledge prior to moving to withdraw. Because the record does not support any persistence by Jones in the alleged intent to commit perjury it follows that Halvorson could not, in the language of Rule 1.16(b)(1), MRPC, reasonably believe that Jones was persisting in a course of action involving Halvorson\u2019s services which was criminal or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Halvorson also relied <em>on Nix v. Whiteside </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 157, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123, in support of his motion to withdraw as Jones\u2019 counsel because of Jones\u2019 alleged intent to commit perjury. In <em>Nix, </em>the defendant was charged with murder, but claimed that he had stabbed the victim in self-defense. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 160, 106 S.Ct. at 990-91. He told his attorney that the victim \u201c \u2018was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow on the bed[,]\u2019 \u201d but admitted that he had not actually seen a gun. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 160, 106 S.Ct. at 990-91. During trial preparation, however, the defendant told his attorney for the first time that he had seen something \u201cmetallic\u201d in the victim\u2019s hand; his explanation for the change was that \u201c[i]f I don\u2019t say I saw a gun, I\u2019m dead.\u201d The attorney explained that it was not necessary to prove the victim actually had a gun to succeed on a claim of self-defense, but the defendant continued to insist on testifying falsely. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 161, 106 S.Ct. at 991. The attorney advised that he would not allow the defendant to testify falsely and that, if the defendant did so, he would be required to advise the court that the defendant was committing perjury and would move to withdraw as counsel. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 161, 106 S.Ct. at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The defendant testified at trial that he \u201cknew\u201d the victim had a gun, but conceded on cross-examination that he did not actually see a gun in the victim\u2019s hand. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 161-62, 106 S.Ct. at 991-92. He was convicted of second-degree murder and subsequently moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair trial due to his attorney\u2019s admonitions not to testify that he saw something metallic in the victim\u2019s hand. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 162, 106 S.Ct. at 991-92. The trial court denied the motion and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed, holding that neither the right to counsel nor the attorney\u2019s duty to his client extended to assisting the client in committing peijury. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 162, 106 S.Ct. at 991-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The defendant filed a federal habeas corpus petition alleging, among other things, that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney's refusing to allow him to give perjured testimony. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 162, 106 S.Ct. at 991-92. The issue before the United States Supreme Court was whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated when an attorney refuses to cooperate with a criminal defendant in presenting perjured testimony. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 159, 106 S.Ct. at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Supreme Court observed that the first part of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires a defendant to establish \u201cconstitutionally deficient\u201d performance by counsel. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 164-65, 106 S.Ct. at 992-93. Having recognized counsel\u2019s duty of loyalty in <em>Strickland, </em>the <em>Nix </em>Court determined \u201cthat duty is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth.\u201d <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 166, 106 S.Ct. at 993-94. While an attorney\u2019s duty of confidentiality and loyalty extends to a client\u2019s admission of guilt, it does not require the attorney to assist the client in presenting false evidence. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 166, 174, 106 S.Ct. at 993-94, 997-98. Thus, whether the attorney\u2019s conduct in <em>Nix </em>was seen as a successful attempt to persuade the defendant not to commit peijury, or as a threat to withdraw and disclose the defendant\u2019s peijury if and when it occurred, the Supreme Court held that the attorney\u2019s representation of the defendant fell \u201cwell within accepted standards of professional conduct and the range of reasonable professional conduct acceptable under <em>Strickland.\u201d Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 171, 106 S.Ct. at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In reaching its conclusion in <em>Nix, </em>the Supreme Court surveyed and set forth various rules of professional conduct and interpretations of such rules. For example, the Supreme Court stated that it is \u201cuniversally agreed\u201d that an attorney's first duty when confronted with a client\u2019s stated intention to testify falsely is to attempt to dissuade the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>client from the unlawful course of conduct. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 169, 106 S.Ct. at 995. Moreover, where the client actually gives perjured testimony, an attorney may reveal the perjury to the trial court. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 170, 106 S.Ct. at 995-96. In addition, withdrawal may be appropriate where a client states an intent to testify falsely. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 170, 106 S.Ct. at 995-96. The Supreme Court was carefiil to note, however, that it was not intruding into the proper authority of the states to define and apply standards of professional conduct applicable to those admitted to practice in state courts. <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 165, 106 S.Ct. at 993. Indeed, as pointed out by Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion, \u201cthe Court\u2019s essay regarding what constitutes the correct response to a criminal client\u2019s suggestion that he will perjure himself is pure discourse without force of law.\u201d <em>Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 177, 106 S.Ct. at 999 (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Neither the facts nor the holding in <em>Nix </em>support Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw based on Jones\u2019 alleged intent to testify falsely in this case. The only pertinent facts in <em>Nix </em>were the attorney\u2019s advice, in response to the client\u2019s stated intent to commit perjury, that he would not allow the client to testify falsely and, if the client did so, he would disclose the perjury to the trial court and move to withdraw; the client did not commit perjury. Here, in response to Jones\u2019 alleged intent to testify falsely, Halvorson advised of the potential consequences. To this extent, Halvorson\u2019s actions mirrored those of counsel in <em>Nix. </em>Halvorson, however, followed his advice by moving to withdraw and making disclosures to the District Court of client confidences. These significant facts were not present in <em>Nix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Moreover, the holding in <em>Nix </em>on the Sixth Amendment issue presented by the facts referenced above is that counsel's advice to his client about the potential consequences of the client\u2019s intent to commit perjury did not fall outside the range of reasonable professional conduct required by <em>Strickland. See Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 171, 106 S.Ct. at 996. The case now before us does not involve the propriety or constitutionality of Halvorson\u2019s advice to Jones; rather, it involves, initially, the propriety of Halvorson\u2019s actions thereafter in moving to withdraw from further representation of Jones. In this regard and based on the record before us in this case, we concluded above that neither subsection (a)(1) nor subsection (b)(1) of Rule 1.16, MRPC, authorized Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Furthermore, while we agree with the Supreme Court that an attorney's \u201cuniversally accepted\u201d initial duty when faced with a client stating an intent to commit perjury is to attempt to dissuade the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>from doing so <em>(see Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 169, 106 S.Ct. at 995), we also agree with Justice Brennan that the Supreme Court\u2019s extensive survey and discussion regarding standards of professional conduct under various rules and commentaries is, for the most part, dicta and without force of law. <em>See Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 177, 106 S.Ct. at 999-1000 (Brennan, J., concurring). In the <em>Nix </em>context, that survey and discussion is background material which bears little relationship to the facts and actual issue in that case. It is neither binding, nor necessarily persuasive, authority to this Court regarding the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct and our interpretation of those Rules vis-a-vis regulating the conduct of attorneys in the courts of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">As a final argument relating to Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw based on Jones\u2019 alleged intent to commit perjury, the State contends that the disclosures Halvorson made to the. District Court in this regard were required by Rule 3.3(a)(2), MRPC. Rule 3.3, MRPC, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">(2) fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The State asserts that Halvorson knew Jones intended to commit perjury and, as a result, that Rule 3.3(a)(2) imposed an obligation to disclose Jones\u2019 intent to testify falsely to the District Court in order to avoid assisting Jones in the criminal or fraudulent act of perjury. However, as discussed above, Halvorson did not know Jones\u2019 intent in this regard. Therefore, Rule 3.3 does not support Halvorson\u2019s disclosure of Jones\u2019 alleged possible intent to commit pexjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We conclude, on the record before us, that Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw was improper under Rules 1.16(a)(1) and (b)(1), MRPC, and was not supported by <em>Nix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\n<em>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">An attorney who abandons his or her duty of loyalty may create a conflict of interest. <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 782. A defense attorney who essentially joins the prosecution\u2019s efforts in obtaining a conviction and acts on a belief that the defendant should be convicted \u201csuffers from an obvious conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 782 (citation omitted). Such an attorney \u201c \u2018fail[s] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government\u2019s adversary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>at 782 (quoting <em>United States v. Swanson </em>(9th Cir. 1991), 943 F.2d 1070, 1074).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">While defense counsel in a criminal case assumes a dual role as a \u201czealous advocate\u201d and as an \u201cofficer of the court,\u201d neither role would countenance disclosure to the Court of counsel\u2019s private conjectures about the guilt or innocence of his client. It is the role of the judge or jury to determine the facts, not that of the attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVB\"><em>United States ex rel. Wilcox v. Johnson </em>(3rd Cir. 1977), 555 F.2d 115, 122. Where an attorney wilfully discloses confidential information communicated by his client, he inhibits mutual trust necessary for effective representation. <em>Wilcox, </em>555 F.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Here, the record clearly establishes that Halvorson put his personal interest in not wanting to take Jones\u2019 case to trial ahead of Jones\u2019 constitutional right to an attorney devoted solely to Jones\u2019 interest in exercising his right to a trial by jury. Halvorson informed the District Court that he had negotiated a favorable plea agreement for Jones and indicated that he considered Jones\u2019 decision to decline the agreement and exercise his right to trial repugnant. In the coruse of further explaining Jones\u2019 \u201crepugnant\u201d decision, Halvorson reminded the court of the pending felony assault charge, premised on the State\u2019s allegation that Jones committed the assault by striking Sowers \u201cwith either a beer bottle, or a glass, or some glass object[,]\u201d and disclosed a confidential admission Jones made to him that Jones \u201cpunched [Sowers] with a bottle of beer in [Jones\u2019] right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This disclosure was improper. As discussed above, Rule 1.6, MRPC, expressly prohibits the disclosure of information relating to the representation without the client\u2019s consent except in specified circumstances where the duty to disclose necessarily overrides the duty of confidentiability and loyalty. Rule 3.3(a)(2), MRPC, provides an additional duty to disclose under carefully limited circumstances, even when compliance would reveal information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6, MRPC. The circumstances contained in Rule 3.3(a)(2), MRPC, relate to disclosure necessary to avoid assisting in a client\u2019s criminal or fraudulent act, however, and bear no relationship to Halvorson\u2019s extensive disclosure in this case regarding his \u201crepugnance\u201d to taking Jones\u2019 case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Moreover, Halvorson\u2019s contention that Jones\u2019 \u201crepugnant\u201d decision to exercise his right to a jury trial, rather than accept a plea agreement, constitutes good cause for withdrawal rims directly afoul of Rule 1.2(a), MRPC, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APV\">The obligations imposed by this Rule are paramount, and unqualified. Thus, while Halvorson may not have agreed with Jones\u2019 decision to decline a plea agreement and exercise his right to a jury trial, that decision did not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 constitute cause for withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Halvorson also indicated that, in his opinion, on an \u201copen and shut basis ... there is guilt and is the plea [sic] that probably should be entered.\u201d To illustrate his point, Halvorson detailed for the District Court and the prosecution why he believed Jones was so clearly guilty. He laid out the facts leading up to the alleged assault, which involved Sowers physically removing Jones from a bar and, immediately thereafter, walking into the bar covered with blood. He then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">Now, on probabilities, who else would have done it? [Jones] just had this physical disagreement with [Sowers].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">There is no other person that the State has ever suspected, and there\u2019s no other person that [Jones] has indicated should be a suspect, and there\u2019s no other person that any witness I know of has indicated should be a suspect. So, you know, the range of possible explanations ... is narrow. It would be like threading a needle to come up with any other explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">In my mind, under the study of Montana law, there\u2019s no doubt but what that [sic] beer bottle is a weapon, and, even if it weren\u2019t, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the degree of injury ... is serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">It\u2019s a felony assault, and my client has admitted to me, essentially, that he did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Halvorson\u2019s narrative detailed for the District Court and the prosecution why he believed Jones was guilty of felony assault and should not go to trial. The State cites to no authority, and we have found none, supporting disclosure by a defense attorney of a client\u2019s confidential admission of guilt and detailing for the court and the prosecution the reasons his client is guilty in support of a motion to withdraw from further representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The record before us establishes that, at the hearing on Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw, Halvorson totally abandoned his adversarial role on Jones\u2019 behalf against the State, essentially joining the prosecution\u2019s efforts in obtaining a conviction. In acting on his own belief that Jones should be convicted and in essentially joining the State\u2019s efforts in obtaining a conviction, we conclude that Halvorson created \u201can obvious conflict of interest\u201d and abandoned his duty of loyalty to Jones. <em>See Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Ordinarily, a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel is violated only when counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, and the defendant must establish both elements. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The <em>Strickland </em>Court noted the availability of \u201cpresumed prejudice,\u201d however, in situations where counsel is \u201cburdened by an actual conflict of interest. In those circumstances, counsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized an exceptional situation regarding the prejudice requirement where an egregious actual conflict of interest exists of record between the client\u2019s interests and the attorney\u2019s sympathies. <em>See Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 782-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Frazer, </em>the Ninth Circuit addressed a defendant\u2019s allegations that his appointed counsel had called him a \u201cstupid nigger son of a bitch and said he hopes I get life [;] \u201d the conversation allegedly was overheard by others and the defendant attempted without success to have a different lawyer appointed. <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 780. He subsequently filed a pro se motion for relief from the sentence imposed, alleging that the treatment he received from counsel was so fatally defective as to constitute an abandonment of the attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge dismissed Frazer\u2019s assertions as mere conclusory allegations and, in any event, determined that Frazer was not prejudiced because counsel\u2019s actual performance was not demonstrably erroneous. <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The issue on appeal in <em>Frazer </em>was whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. The Ninth Circuit held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">the facts as alleged in this case, if proved, would render so defective the relationship inherent in the right to trial counsel guaranteed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>by the Sixth Amendment that Mr. Frazer would be entitled to a new trial with a different attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 784. According to the Ninth Circuit, the defect, if proved, would be so egregious that a presumption of prejudice would be appropriate without review of the attorney\u2019s actual conduct at the trial. <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 785 (citing <em>United States v. Cronic </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 648, 660, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2047, 80 L.Ed.2d 657, 668).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Notwithstanding the differences in procedural context and bases for abandonment of the duty of loyalty between <em>Frazer </em>and the case before us, we adopt and apply the <em>Frazer </em>rationale here. Our duty as judges is \u201cto ensure that the right to counsel, as a jurisdictional prerequisite to depriving a person of his or her liberty, is fully honored.\u201d <em>Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 784. The record before us in this case is clear. Halvorson totally abandoned his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to Jones by putting his personal interest in not wanting to take Jones\u2019 case to trial ahead of Jones\u2019 interest in representation by an attorney devoted solely to his interest in exercising his right to trial. The conflict between Halvorson\u2019s sympathies and Jones\u2019 rights and interests is unmistakable and egregious and, under such circumstances, Halvorson can be said to have represented Jones only \u201c \u2018through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Frazer, </em>18 F.3d at 782-83 (citation omitted). We conclude that this case constitutes the very rare instance in which a presumption of prejudice is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We will continue to require strict compliance with the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland </em>in ordinary ineffective assistance cases involving allegations of deficient performance by counsel. In that regard, our deference to counsel\u2019s tactical and strategic decisions will continue unabated. Given this record, however, we refuse to indulge in nice calculations regarding the amount of prejudice attributable to the clear and unequivocal conflict of interest Halvorson created.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We hold that, faced with Halvorson\u2019s clear conflict of interest and abandonment of his duty of loyalty to Jones, the District Court abused its discretion in denying Halvorson\u2019s motion to withdraw as Jones\u2019 counsel. We vacate Jones\u2019 conviction and sentence and remand this case to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER, ERDMANN, LEAPHART and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
