We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in finding that a particularized suspicion existed to justify an investigative stop of Broken Rope under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The following facts are undisputed. On March 21,1995, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Deputy Kevin Evans (Evans) of the Yellowstone County Sheriff\u2019s office was on patrol near the Lockwood Kwik Way convenience store in Billings, Montana. He observed a vehicle occupied by two individuals, later identified as Elton Belgarde (Belgarde) and Broken Rope, traveling west on Highway 87 East. Evans ran the vehicle\u2019s license number through a records check which revealed that the vehicle was registered to Belgarde and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest for fish and game violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">When Belgarde and Broken Rope arrived at the Kwik Way, they left the vehicle and went inside the store. Evans watched the two men from his patrol car, planning to wait until they were back in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>vehicle before approaching them. Belgarde and Broken Rope exited the store after a short time. When they noticed Evans, they began using the telephone, moving around in the store\u2019s parking lot, and staring at Evans. Evans decided that Belgarde and Broken Rope were not going to get back into Belgarde\u2019s vehicle while he was present, so he radioed his backup, Deputy M. J. Mullikin (Mullikin), for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">When Belgarde and Broken Rope saw Evans and Mullikin drive into the immediate area, they began putting their hands into their pockets. The deputies told them to keep their hands out of their pockets and, when Broken Rope attempted a second time to put his hands into his pockets, the deputies told him again to keep his hands out of his pockets. Evans then arrested Belgarde on the outstanding fish and game warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Mullikin frisked Broken Rope and asked him if he had any weapons, knives or needles on his person. Broken Rope said that he had a knife in his belt. In addition to the knife, Mullikin found a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson handgun in Broken Rope\u2019s waistband under his shirt. When asked about additional weapons or drugs, Broken Rope said that he had some marijuana in his pants pocket. Mullikin searched Broken Rope a second time and felt a hard object in Broken Rope\u2019s pants pocket which Broken Rope identified as a marijuana pipe. Evans also searched Broken Rope and, in addition to the marijuana pipe containing suspected marijuana residue, he found a black canister containing a white powdery substance in Broken Rope\u2019s other pants pocket. Broken Rope was taken to the Yellowstone County detention facility and booked. Evans then removed the back seat of his patrol car and found a baggie containing a rock-like substance under where Broken Rope had been sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The State of Montana (State) charged Broken Rope by information with the felony offenses of carrying a concealed weapon and criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and the misdemeanor offense of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. After pleading not guilty, Broken Rope moved to suppress the evidence seized by the deputies. The parties agreed that the District Court could decide the issue without a hearing, and the court subsequently denied Broken Rope\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Broken Rope later pled guilty to the charged offenses, reserving the right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The District Court entered judgment and sentence and Broken Rope appealed. The court and the parties filed an \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts for Record on Appeal\u201d pursuant to Rule 9(e), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Did the District Court err in finding that a particularized suspicion existed to justify an investigative stop of Broken Rope under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In denying Broken Rope\u2019s motion to suppress, the District Court found that Evans had a particularized suspicion, based on his training and experience as a peace officer and Broken Rope\u2019s actions, that Broken Rope had been or was engaged in criminal activity. On that basis, the District Court concluded that the investigative stop and search of Broken Rope was justified and denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Broken Rope contends that the District Court\u2019s finding regarding Evans\u2019 particularized suspicion to justify the investigative stop pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, is clearly erroneous and, therefore, that the court erred as a matter of law in applying the statute and denying his motion to suppress. We review such findings of fact by a district court to determine whether they are clearly erroneous; we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Bauer v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 119, 122, 910 P.2d 886, 888; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 459, 462, 904 P.2d 1019, 1021 (citing <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 188, 860 P.2d 89, 94).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">When a law enforcement officer seizes a person, such as in an investigative stop, the right against unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies. <em>Bauer, </em>910 P.2d at 889. As a result, the Montana legislature amended Montana\u2019s investigative stop statute in 1991 to conform with both United States Supreme Court and Montana Supreme Court case law on that subject. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 46, 49, 899 P.2d 540, 542. Section 46-5-401, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Investigative stop. In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in <em>circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">In light of the requirement that some objective manifestation must exist to support a particularized suspicion that a person is engaged in criminal activity before a stop can be made, we have adopted a two-part test to determine whether an officer had sufficient cause to stop a person. <em>Anderson v. State Dept. of Justice </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 259, 263, 912 P.2d 212, 214 (citing <em>State v. Gopher </em>(1981), 193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Mont. 189, 631 P.2d 293). First, the State must establish objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences. Second, the State must show a resulting suspicion that the person is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>Anderson, </em>912 P.2d at 214. Whether a particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact which is dependent on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Anderson, </em>912 P.2d at 214 (citing <em>Reynolds, </em>899 P.2d at 542-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The initial, and primary, thrust of the analysis is whether objective data existed from which an experienced officer could conclude that the person stopped is, or has been, engaged in criminal activity. In <em>Bauer, </em>for example, the deputy observed Bauer driving well over the speed limit, crossing the center line more than once and braking hard around curves. <em>Bauer, </em>910 P.2d at 887, 890. We concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, the evidence supported the deputy\u2019s particularized suspicion that Bauer had committed an offense. <em>Bauer, </em>910 P.2d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Similarly, <em>in Anderson, </em>the officer testified that she saw Anderson shuffle and stumble toward his car between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. and fail to use his vehicle\u2019s turn signals at every turn for several blocks; in addition, he did not stop when she asked him to. <em>Anderson, </em>912 P.2d at 213. The officer also testified that, even from ten to fifteen feet away, she could smell a very strong odor of intoxicants emanating from Anderson. <em>Anderson, </em>912 P.2d at 213. Those facts were sufficient, under the totality of the circumstances, to support the officer\u2019s particularized suspicion that Anderson had committed the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>Anderson, </em>912 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In other cases, however, this Court has held, under the totality of the circumstances, that the evidence did not support a particularized suspicion that the person stopped had committed, or was committing, an offense. In <em>Reynolds, </em>the deputy sheriff testified that he observed a pickup moving through an intersection \u201cbordering on traveling too fast\u201d for the conditions and hesitating seven to ten seconds at the intersection where the deputy was waiting, but that the driver had not necessarily violated the law. <em>Reynolds, </em>899 P.2d at 542-43. Other than those observations, the deputy did not see any violations of the law and Reynolds did not exhibit behavior consistent with a person driving while under the influence of alcohol. <em>Reynolds, </em>899 P.2d at 543. We concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, a possible traffic violation \u2014 in the absence of any other objective evidence of criminal activity \u2014 did not support a particularized suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>that Reynolds had been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Reynolds, </em>899 P.2d at 543. On that basis, we held that the investigative stop was not justified under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. <em>Reynolds, </em>899 P.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In the present case, the objective data Evans observed was Broken Rope entering and leaving the Kwik Way at approximately 1:00 a.m., using the telephone, moving around in the Kwik Way parking lot, putting his hands in his pockets, and staring at Evans. These actions do not support a particularized suspicion that Broken Rope was, or had been, engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The State contends that Evans and Mullikin also relied on the existence of an outstanding warrant for \u201cone of the men\u201d as objective data supporting their investigative stop and search of Broken Rope. However, the undisputed fact is that the warrant for fish and game violations was for Belgarde, not for Broken Rope. The State cites to no authority under which a person merely being in the company of someone for whom an arrest warrant has been issued is sufficient\u2014 on either a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with objective data of the type that existed in this case \u2014 to create a particularized suspicion that that person had committed, or was committing, an offense so as to justify an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The State also contends that the deputies could draw upon their training and experience as peace officers to conclude that Belgarde and Broken Rope were acting in a suspicious and nervous manner, thereby justifying an investigative stop. At the outset, we observe that the agreed facts before us contain no information about the deputies\u2019 training and experience or how such training and experience could lead them to conclude that Belgarde and Broken Rope\u2019s activities were \u201csuspicious\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d Indeed, no agreed fact states that the deputies reached such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Moreover, there is nothing inherently suspicious about Broken Rope using a pay telephone, moving around in a convenience store parking lot, putting his hands in his pockets or staring at a sheriff\u2019s deputy. As to whether these activities were \u201cnervous,\u201d many law-abiding citizens may well be nervous when their activities are being watched by law enforcement officers. On this record, Broken Rope\u2019s actions did not form the basis for inferences resulting in a particularized suspicion that Broken Rope was, or had been, engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, the record is insufficient to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Evans had a particularized suspicion that Broken Rope was engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>in criminal activity; therefore, the court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous. On that basis, we further conclude that the District Court erred in determining that the investigative stop of Broken Rope was justified pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The remainder of the State\u2019s arguments relate to the officers\u2019 entitlement to \u201cfrisk\u201d a person and seize certain objects pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA. According to the State, however, \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA, applies \u201c[o]nce a peace officer has lawfully stopped a person under \u00a7 46-5-401 ....\u201d Based on our conclusions that no particularized suspicion existed and that the investigative stop of Broken Rope was not justified under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, we need not address the remainder of the State\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We hold that the District Court erred in denying Broken Rope\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b457-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE,</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The District Court found that Deputy Sheriff Kevin Evans had particularized suspicion for a reasonable investigative stop of the defendant and subsequent search for weapons as reasonable police procedure for officer protection. This finding and the order denying suppression of the criminal contraband found on the person of defendant is supported by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">The majority\u2019s review of the objective data in this case is notable for its brevity. Now the rest of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">At approximately 1:00 a.m. on March 21,1995, Deputy Evans was patrolling a rural area of Yellowstone County near the Lockwood Kwik Way convenience store when he observed a vehicle with two occupants traveling west on Highway 87. After running a license plate record check, the deputy was notified that the vehicle was registered to Elton Belgarde and that a warrant for Belgarde\u2019s arrest was outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">The Belgarde vehicle stopped at the Kwik Way convenience store, and the two occupants entered the store. The two individuals, one of whom was Elton Belgarde and the other the defendant herein, Joseph Broken Rope, exited the store, noticed Deputy Evans\u2019 car, began using the telephone and stared at the deputy. Deputy Evans called for Deputy Sheriff Mullikin to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Upon seeing the deputies pull into the immediate area, Belgarde and Broken Rope began putting their hands into their pockets. The officers told them to take their hands out of their pockets. Defendant Broken Rope again reached to put his hands into his pockets and was told not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Deputy Evans placed Belgarde under arrest on the outstanding warrant. Deputy Mullikin, in preparing to frisk defendant Broken Rope, asked him if he had any weapons. Broken Rope told the deputy he had a knife on the back of his belt concealed under his shirt. Deputy Mullikin proceeded with a frisk of the defendant and in addition to the concealed knife found, also concealed in his waistband under his shirt, a five-round, fully loaded Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. In addition, he found on defendant\u2019s person certain contraband drugs and a marijuana pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Notwithstanding the unjustified reversal of the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress based on a claim of unconstitutional search and statutory violation, the rational and reasonable officer\u2019s protection procedure in finding the concealed .38 may not only have saved the deputies from harm, but may have prevented one more dead convenience store clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The District Court carefully and correctly articulated its reasoning in holding that the stop and search of the defendant complied with applicable constitutional, statutory and case law. The District Court\u2019s order states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">Regarding the Defendant, upon his exiting of the Kwik Way store, the Deputy believed that he and Mr. Belgarde were acting in a nervous and suspicious manner. The two men were closely watching the Deputy. They walked around the parking lot, made some telephone calls, and evidenced an intention not to return to their automobile. In addition, because the Deputy knew about the warrant for Mr. Belgarde, their nervous actions were all the more suspicious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">As a result, the Deputy stopped, frisked and arrested Mr. Belgarde on the warrant. In addition, pursuant to <em>State v. Gopher </em>and sections 46-5-401 and 46-5-402, MCA, the Defendant was stopped and frisked. The stopping and frisking of the Defendant was proper because the Deputy had \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d that the Defendant had been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>See Gopher, </em>631 P.2d at 296. The \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d was based on the previously mentioned suspicious actions of the Defendant and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Belgarde upon leaving the Kwik Way store. In addition, it was appropriate to pat down the Defendant for safety purposes in order to secure the situation for the arrest of Mr. Belgarde based on the warrant. Section 46-5-402(1), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">Additionally, it was appropriate for the Deputy to ask the Defendant if he possessed any weapons, knives or needles prior to the pat down for officer safety purposes. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">The Defendant admitted possessing a concealed knife on the back of his belt under his shirt. (Defendant\u2019s brief in support of motion to suppress, p. 2, line 16 &amp; 17) However, the Deputy found not only a concealed knife, but also a fully loaded .38 caliber handgun hidden in the waistband of the Defendant\u2019s belt under his shirt. <em>(Id. </em>at line 18 &amp; 19) Based on these discoveries, three conclusions are inescapable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">First, upon uncovering the concealed weapons, the Deputy had probable cause to arrest the Defendant for carrying concealed weapons. As the Court in <em>State v. Sharp, </em>217 Mont. 40, 702 P.2d 959 (1985) stated, \u201cA founded suspicion to stop for investigative detention may ripen into probable cause to arrest through the occurrence of facts or incidents after the stop.\u201d <em>Sharp, </em>217 Mont, at 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Second, the discovery of the concealed weapons verified the Deputy\u2019s reasonable belief that a pat down was reasonably necessary for officer protection. And third, the discovery of concealed weapons demonstrated the necessity to search further. The Defendant had stated that he was carrying a knife, but made no mention of the handgun. As a result, the Defendant\u2019s comments as to the contents in his front pants pockets, i.e., marijuana and a marijuana pipe, did not render the subsequent officer safety search unreasonable. On the contrary, it was entirely reasonable to believe the Defendant possessed other weapons even though the Deputy specifically asked him if he had any drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">Therefore, because the Deputy had particularized suspicion that an offense had been, was being, or was about to be committed, based on the actions of the Defendant and the training and experience of the Deputy, a reasonable investigative stop and search of the Defendant was appropriate. An arrest of Mr. Belgarde was appropriate based on the issued warrant for his arrest. After stopping the Defendant and frisking him for officer protection, concealed weapons were found. Further officer protection search, demonstrated to be reasonable based on the previously uncovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>weapons, resulted in discovery of controlled substance possession by the Defendant. The Court believes that all the uncovered evidence can properly be used against the Defendant in a criminal trial. As a result, the Court is persuaded that the Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure have not been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">I agree with the District Court and therefor dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
