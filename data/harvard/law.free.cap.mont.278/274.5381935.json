We answer the certified question \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">The certified question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">Section 33-23-203, MCA, prohibits the stacking of the uninsured motorist coverage available under a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance. Does Section 33-23-203, MCA, prohibit the stacking of the medical payment coverage and the underinsured motorist coverage available under a policy of motor vehicle liability insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>anee where a premium is charged for coverage of each motor vehicle listed within that policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">In the insurance policy at issue, a premium is charged on each motor vehicle listed within the policy for medical payment coverage and a premium is charged on each motor vehicle listed within the policy for underinsurance coverage. The premium for the underinsured motorist coverage is included as part of the premium for the uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In its Order Certifying Question to the Supreme Court of Montana, the District Court submitted a statement of agreed facts. The facts that this Court finds dispositive of the question are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">4. That, at approximately 0450 hours, on November 9, 1991, a vehicle insured by the Plaintiff under the policy issued to Wade and Diana Brown, namely a 1971 Ford pickup with VIN F10GKL66406, being driven by Lori Watson, in which Scott Hankel and Gary Lee Leonard were passengers, was involved in a one-vehicle accident in Jefferson County, Montana, on Interstate 90 at milepost 233.4, 15.6 miles west of Whitehall, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">5. Subsequent thereto, at approximately 0510 hours, at [sic] 1983 Ford pickup truck, VIN 1FTHF26L5DPA15458, owned by Darrel M. Storey and driven by Darrel Maynard Storey, Jr., was traveling east on Interstate 90 when the driver lost control of the vehicle as he attempted to slow for the accident scene and went into a sideskid. The Storey vehicle struck the right rear comer of the trailer attached to the subject 1971 Ford pickup, VIN F10GKL66406. Such contact pushed the trailer into the ditch and onto its left side. The Storey vehicle then rapidly rotated. Mr. Leonard\u2019s coat became entangled on the hitch of the Storey pickup which caused Mr. Leonard to be dragged under the Storey vehicle until after it went backwards into the ditch on the south side of the road. Mr. Leonard died as a result of the injuries sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">6. The Storey vehicle was insured by State Farm Auto Insurance Company under Policy No. 138 6224-405-226 and State Farm subsequently paid out its policy limits under the liability portion of its policy limits in the amount of $25,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">7. Prior to signing a Release, the Estate of Gary Lee Leonard made demand upon Plaintiff for the uninsured (underinsured) motorist coverage and auto medical payment coverage provided for in the Business Auto Policy of Wade and Diana Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>8. Plaintiff has refused to make any payments of uninsured (underinsured) motorist coverage and auto medical payment coverage to the heirs and/or Estate of Gary Lee Leonard, deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">Answering the question certified by the United States District Court requires this Court to construe \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. In construing a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The rules of statutory construction require the language to be construed according to its plain meaning. <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), [276 Mont. 67], 915 P.2d 175, 178 (citing <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088). If the language is clear and unambiguous, then no further interpretation is required; we will resort to legislative history only if the intent cannot be determined from the plain wording of the statute. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088. Where the intention of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts may not go further and apply other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088 (citing <em>Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The question certified is a narrow one. We are asked only to determine whether \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, prohibits the stacking of \u201coptional\u201d coverages \u2014 here, the medical payments and underinsurance coverages. We do not consider whether the terms of the insurance contract prohibit stacking. Rather, our analysis is confined to an interpretation of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Chilberg v. Rose </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 414, 903 P.2d 1377, is not controlling in this case as <em>Chilberg </em>is a multiple policy case and does not interpret \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. In addition, we note that <em>Sayers v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 336, 628 P.2d 659, cited with approval in <em>Chilberg, </em>is contrary to \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, as <em>Sayers </em>approved the stacking of uninsured motorist coverage under a single policy. Thus, under \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, <em>Sayers </em>is no longer good law because under the terms of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, stacking of uninsured motorist coverage for multiple vehicles insured under a single policy is expressly prohibited unless the policy specifically provides otherwise. Section 33-23-203, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(1) Unless a motor vehicle liability policy specifically provides otherwise, the limits of insurance coverage available under any such policy, including the limits of liability under uninsured mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>torist coverage, must be determined as follows, regardless of the number of motor vehicles insured under the policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">(a) the limit of insurance coverage available for any one accident is the limit specified for the motor vehicle involved in the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">(b) if no motor vehicle insured under the policy is involved in the accident, the limit of insurance coverage available for any one accident is the highest limit of coverage specified for any one motor vehicle insured under the policy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">(c) the limits of coverage specified for each motor vehicle insured under the policy may not be added together to determine the limit of insurance coverage available under the policy for any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">(2) A motor vehicle liability policy may also provide for other reasonable limitations, exclusions, or reductions of coverage which are designed to prevent duplicate payments for the same element of loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">From the language of the statute, it is clear that \u201cstacking\u201d is not allowed \u201cunless a motor vehicle liability policy specifically provides otherwise.\u201d It is equally clear that the \u201canti-stacking\u201d provisions of the statute apply to a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u2019 (MVLP). The term MVLP is defined in \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, as \u201cany policy of automobile or motor vehicle insurance against liability <em>now or hereafter required </em>under Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The dissenters argue that \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, refers to required \u201cpolicies\u201d rather than required \u201ccoverages.\u201d It makes no sense, however, to discuss \u201cpolicies\u201d in a vacuum. Apolicy of insurance is nothing more than the coverages which are provided within the policy. In \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, the legislature was obviously correlating the anti-stacking statutes with the fact that policies with specific types of coverage are required by Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3. In particular, the per person, per vehicle and property damage coverages mandated by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In interpreting \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, three points are apparent; it is directed at insurance <em>against liability. </em>Secondly, it is directed at insurance coverage which is \u201crequired\u201d by law; and finally, it is concerned with liability insurance which is not only required, but is required by <em>both </em>part 1 and part 3. There are only three variations of insurance coverage which meet the above criteria; that is, liability coverage which is required by both the MVSRA and the Motor Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Liability Act. Those three coverages are the per person, per vehicle and property damage coverages which are required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, and which are incorporated into the Motor Vehicle Liability Act by \u00a7 61-6-301, MCA. Unlike the third-party coverage mandated by MVSRA and the Motor Vehicle Liability Act, underinsurance and medical payment do not qualify as insurance <em>against liability. </em>Rather, underinsurance and medical pay coverage are designed to protect the first party insured. Furthermore, there is nothing in MVSRA, the Motor Vehicle Liability Act or Title 33, chapter 23, MCA, which would \u201crequire\u201d underinsurance and medical pay coverage. To the contrary, the MVSRA specifically excludes coverages which are in excess of the required per person, per vehicle and property damage coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">The MVSRA, \u00a7 61-6-103(8), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy, and the excess or additional coverage is not subject to the provisions of this part. With respect to a policy which grants the excess or additional coverage, the term \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d applies only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As Justice Erdmann\u2019s dissent points out, the above provision specifically refers to coverage which is required \u201cby this section.\u201d Although \u201cthis section\u201d refers to the MVSRA, the Motor Vehicle Liability Act has also incorporated those same \u201ccoverage\u201d requirements; $25,000 because of bodily injury to any one person, $50,000 for bodily injury in any one accident, and $10,000 for property damage. There is nothing in the Motor Vehicle Liability Act which would suggest that the liability coverage requirements incorporated from MVSRA are any broader than those required under MVSRA. Since MVSRA specifically does not require any excess or additional coverage such as underinsurance, it is reasonable to conclude that the Motor Vehicle Liability Act likewise treats medical pay coverage and underinsurance as in \u201cexcess\u201d or in addition to the coverages which are specifically required by both Acts in question. Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As medical payment coverage and underinsured motorist coverage .are \u201cexcess or additional coverage\u201d which are not required under either the MVSRA or the Motor Vehicle Liability Act, we determine that these coverages are not part of the MVLP under \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA. Accordingly, the prohibition against stacking required cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ages in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, does not apply to underinsurance and medical payment coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">This Court has recognized that \u201cMontana has no statutory insurance requirement concerning underinsured motorists.\u201d <em>Grier v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 457, 458-59, 812 P.2d 347, 349. While coverage in excess of the minimum amounts mandated by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, and additional coverages such as comprehensive, underinsured, medical payments, or towing may be purchased by the insured, the mandate of Title 61, chapter 6, part 1, MCA, and the term MVLP apply only to the third-party liability coverage required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Section 33-23-201, MCA, requires that the insurer offer first-party, uninsured motorist coverage in the same amounts as required for third-party coverage under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA. The distinction between the uninsured motorist coverage and the third-party coverage is that by rejecting the uninsured coverage the insured may waive the first-party uninsured coverage benefitting himself, but he cannot waive the minimum liability coverages benefitting the third-party. Importantly, however, in the absence of the insured affirmatively rejecting the coverage, the policy is issued with the 'uninsured motorist coverage. Accordingly, under Montana\u2019s statutory scheme the minimum third-party liability coverages under \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, and the minimum first-party, uninsured motorist coverage under \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, are required coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Section 33-23-203, MCA, initially references the MVLP and coverage available under such a MVLP policy and continues: \u201cincluding the limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d This latter inclusion of uninsured motorist coverage was necessary because uninsured motorist coverage is not required as part of the MVLP. Uninsured motorist coverage is, nonetheless, a coverage which is required by \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, subject to rejection by the insured. Accordingly, we determine that the \u201canti-stacking\u201d provision of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, applies only to those coverages required under the MVLP or \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Farmers Alliance argues that the \u201cavailable coverage\u201d language in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is broader than the required coverages and that the statute includes underinsurance coverage. We reject this argument. The only insurance coverage available under both part 1 and part 3, as the MVLP has been restrictively defined by the legislature, is the minimum third-party coverage required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA. This definition of \u201cavailable coverage\u201d follows because the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>MVLP does not encompass any other \u201cexcess\u201d or additional coverage. Section 61-6-103(8), MCA. The limits of coverage available under any such policy must refer to the required third-party minimum coverages, required under both parts 1 and 3 of Title 61, chapter 6. Furthermore, \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined in \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, which provides that \u201c[a]n uninsured motor vehicle is a land motor vehicle, the ownership, the maintenance, or the use of which is not insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident.\u201d This definition does not include \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d within its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">Although Farmers Alliance asserts that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Grier </em>holds that underinsured coverage is part of the uninsured motor vehicle coverage, we determine that <em>Grier </em>is distinguishable. Our holdings in <em>Grier </em>were based upon an interpretation of the policy language and are not controlling as a matter of statutory construction. In <em>Grier, </em>we stated that \u201cunder these circumstances, the \u201cunder-insured\u201d coverage is part of the uninsured motor vehicle coverage.\u201d Our holding, however, was prefaced with the caveat \u201cunder these circumstances.\u201d We recognized that the \u201cunique fashion\u201d of the <em>Grier </em>policy was determinative. We noted that \u201cthe insurance policy in this case <em>[Grier] </em>is set up in a unique fashion ... the \u201cunderinsured\u201d motorist provision is part of the section on uninsured motorist coverage ... there is no separate policy section providing for underinsured motor vehicle coverage.\u201d <em>Grier, </em>812 P.2d at 349. In addition, we noted that \u201cthe declarations page makes no mention whatsoever of under-insured motor vehicle coverage.\u201d <em>Grier </em>812 P.2d at 349. Most importantly, we were interpreting the language of the <em>Grier </em>policy \u2014 not the statute. Here, however, our conclusion is based on \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. Further, unlike the policy at issue in <em>Grier, </em>the instant policy sets forth the underinsurance coverage on the declarations page. We determine that <em>Grier </em>is not determinative on this issue as it interpreted the insurance contract, not \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The legislature has mandated that motor vehicle liability policies provide two types of coverage: coverage for injury to third-parties, Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3, and first party coverage for uninsured motorists, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA. Likewise, the legislature has provided that, absent contractual language to the contrary, such required coverages cannot be \u201cstacked\u201d when numerous vehicles are insured under one policy. Section 33-23-203, MCA. The question of whether excess or additional coverages, such as underinsurance coverage, can be stacked was left as a matter of policy interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative. Section 33-23-203, MCA, does notprohibit the stacking of the medical payment coverage and the imderinsured motorist coverage available under a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance where a premium is charged for coverage of each motor vehicle listed within that policy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b306-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AGQq\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">I concur in our answer to the certified question. In doing so, I also agree with Justice Gray that the statutes at issue are neither a model of clarity nor do they track well. If anything, that is an understatement. As demonstrated by the Court\u2019s opinion and by the dissents, reasonable interpretations lead to diametrically opposed results. Whether one interpretation is more \u201cabsurd\u201d than the other is more a function of perception than it is logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">One thing, however, is obvious: if the legislature wanted to prohibit the stacking of underinsured and med-pay coverage, it could have simply said so in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. It had no trouble saying that with respect to uninsured coverage. It could have used an equally simple, clear and unambiguous approach to underinsured and med-pay coverage. The fact is it did not, and we are, thus, left with the task of trying to make sense out of a mishmash of overlapping statutes, adopted and amended at different times and, with one possible exception, absent any clear unifying rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">That possible exception is, as our opinion points out, where the legislature has explicitly or implicitly mandated third-party or first-party coverage, it has clearly prohibited stacking, absent agreement between the insurer and the insured. Where, on the other hand, it has not statutorily mandated coverage in one fashion or another, the legislature has not clearly prohibited stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Finally, I note that, if in discharging our task of statutory interpretation, the majority has erred on the side <em>of </em>the insured, then, our opinion is at least consistent with this Court\u2019s historical approach in numerous other insurance cases wherein we have enforced Montana\u2019s strong public policy favoring coverage where either the policy language or the law was not clear. See <em>Leibrand, v. Nat. Farmers Union </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 1, 6, 898 P.2d 1220, 1223; <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 358, 849 P.2d 190, 192-93; <em>Head v. Central Reserve Life </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 188, 200, 845 P.2d 735, 742.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b307-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>JUSTICE ERDMANN</author>\n<p id=\"Adm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Initially, it is important to note that in its discussion of the certified question, the majority has omitted Agreed Fact No. 3 contained in the Order Certifying Question, which\u2019provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">That on or about May 31,1991, Plaintiff issued to Wade and Diana Brown, the named insured and parents of Scott Hankel, a policy of auto insurance, a true, correct, and complete copy of which is marked \u201cExhibit A\u201d attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Thus, although the certified question from the Federal District Court is somewhat narrow, it is also clear that both the parties and the Federal District Court contemplated that this Court address the certified question with reference to and in the context of the provisions of the specific insurance policy in this case. While resolution of the certified question requires an analysis of the language of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, such an analysis should not be in a vacuum separate and apart from the policy involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">After narrowing an already narrow certified question, the majority embarks on a strained statutory construction analysis to reach its ultimate result. The majority correctly sets forth the rules upon which this Court relies when construing a statute. If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, then no further interpretation is required. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088. Where the intention of the Legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088 (citing <em>Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864). Under this framework, I would hold that the clear language of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, prohibits the stacking of underinsured motorist and medical payment coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Section 33-23-203(1), MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Unless a motor vehicle liability policy specifically provides otherwise, the limits of insurance coverage available under any such policy, including the limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage, must be determined as follows, regardless of the number of motor vehicles insured under the policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">(a) the limit of insurance coverage available for any one accident is the limit specified for the motor vehicle involved in the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(c) the limits of coverage specified for each motor vehicle insured under the policy may not be added together to determine the limit of insurance coverage available under the policy for any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The majority opinion focuses on the term \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d (MVLP) as it is used in \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA. As noted by the majority, MVLP is defined in \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, as any policy required under Title 61, Chapter 6, Parts 1 <em>and </em>3. The majority opinion ignores the reference to Part 3 and improperly imposes the restricted definition of MVLP in Part 1 to \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">It is important to understand the different purposes of Parts 1 <em>and </em>3 of Title 61, Chapter 6, MCA, which are referenced in \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA. Part 1 is the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act (MVSRA) which was enacted to require that drivers who have had an accident involving a motor vehicle, or drivers who have an outstanding unsatisfied judgment against them as the result of a motor vehicle accident, provide proof of financial responsibility. Proof of financial responsibility requires proof of an MVLP as defined in \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA. <em>See Boldt v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 337, 443 P.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Section 61-6-103, MCA, defines MVLP for purposes of the MVSRA and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">(1) A \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d, <em>as the term is used in this </em>part, means an owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s policy of liability insurance, <em>certified as provided in 61-6-133 or 61-6-134 as proof of financial responsibility </em>and issued, except as otherwise provided in 61-6-134, by an insurance carrier duly authorized to transact business in this state, to or for the benefit of the person named therein as insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(2) The owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">(b) insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using any motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of the named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each motor vehicle, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(i) $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and subject to said limit for one person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-3\">(ii) $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">(iii) $10,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(8) Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy, and the excess or additional coverage is not subject to the provisions of this part. With respect to a policy which grants the excess or additional coverage, the term \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d applies only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The majority relies on subsection (8) to conclude that since under-insured motorist and medical payment coverages are not included in subsection (2)(b), they are not part of an MVLP under \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA. If the majority was only construing .\u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, they would be correct in their interpretation. However, in the present case the Federal District Court has requested our interpretation of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. When several statutes apply to a given situation, this Court\u2019s job is to adopt a construction that will give effect to all. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>See also Schuman v. Bestrom </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 410, 693 P.2d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The definition of MVLP in \u00a7 61-6-103(1), MCA, applied by the majority to \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is restricted by its own terms to Part 1 of Chapter 6 and to only those policies <em>certified </em>under \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-133 or -134, MCA, for individuals who are required to provide proof of financial responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-6-131, MCA. The language of \u00a7 61-6-103(8), MCA, reasonably construed, means that the strict require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ments of the MVSRA apply to the liability coverage required by subsection (2)(b), but not to the additional or excess coverages available in a policy certified for a \u201cbad driver.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">This construction is further supported by reviewing Part 3 of Chapter 6 which contains the mandatory liability limits for all Montana drivers. As noted, \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA, defines MVLP as any policy required under Title 61, Chapter 6, Parts 1 <em>and </em>3: Policies can be issued under either Part 1 or Part 3 and the two parts are independent. <em>See Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 173, 656 P.2d 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Part 3 of Chapter 6 references and incorporates only the liability limits contained in \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, and the remaining provisions of the MVSRA are not incorporated into Part 3. If, therefore, a policy is issued under Part 3, it is not subject to the provisions of Part 1. <em>See Boldt, </em>443 P.2d at 35-36; <em>Transamerica, </em>656 P.2d at 822-23. The facts included with the certified question do not reflect that the policy was issued under Part 1, and it is apparent from the policy itself that it was issued under Part 3.1 therefore believe the majority\u2019s conclusion that the definition of MVLP in the MVSRA applies in its entirety to \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is in error and ignores the reference to Part 3 in \u00a7 33-23-204(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In my view \u00a7 61-6-136(1), MCA, conclusively establishes that the Legislature intended the definition of MVLP in the MVSRA apply only to policies issued under the MVSRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">Other policies not affected. (1) This part [part 1] shall not be held to apply to or affect policies of automobile insurance against liability which may now or hereafter be required by any other law or this state ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Here the policy was issued under Part 3 and the restrictive definition of MVLP in Part 1 clearly was not intended to apply to policies issued under the part requiring mandatory liability limits for all drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Even if an MVLP under \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, was as limited as the majority holds, the clear language of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, still leads to the conclusion that the statute prohibits stacking of underinsured motorist and medical pay coverages. Section 33-23-203(1), MCA, provides that stacking is prohibited for insurance coverage <em>\u201cavailable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>under any such [MVLP] policy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Legislature did not prohibit stacking for insurance coverage \u201crequired\u201d by the policy, which according to the majority is only the liability limits found in \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, but rather, prohibited stacking for coverages \u201cavailable\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">Under the plain language of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, stacking of both medical payment and underinsured motorist coverages is prohibited since both were \u201cavailable\u201d under the policy. Where the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous, and certain, the function of the court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, and not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. <em>See also Reese v. Reese </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 101, 637 P.2d 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Further, the majority\u2019s conclusion that an MVLP policy, as it is used in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is limited to the $25,000/$50,000/ $10,000 requirements of \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, is simply not consistent with the other language of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. Section 33-23-203(1), MCA, provides that stacking is prohibited for insurance coverage \u201cavailable under any such [MVLP] policy <em>including </em>limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, an MVLP includes only the financial limitations found in \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA. Clearly, uninsured motorist coverage is not required by that provision, but is specifically recognized by the Legislature as being available under an MVLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In an effort to avoid this clear statutory language, the majority concludes that uninsured coverage is required coverage. Uninsured coverage, to the degree it is required, is not required by Part 1 of Chapter 6, Title 61, MCA, but rather by \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language in \u00a7 61-6-103(8), MCA, relied upon by the majority, clearly states that when a policy grants coverage in excess of the coverage required by an MVLP, the term MVLP \u201capplies only to that part of the coverage <em>which is required by this section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Since uninsured coverage is not required by \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, the majority\u2019s logic breaks down.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Finally, the phrase \u201cincluding the limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage\u201d in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, also demonstrates that the Legislature intended that the stacking prohibition apply to coverages other than those required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, and uninsured motorist coverage. The term \u201cincluding\u201d is not a limiting term, but instead is used as an illustrative device. A number of courts have held that the term \u201cincluding\u201d used in similar contexts is not all-inclusive. <em>See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1941), 313 U.S. 177, 61 S. Ct. 845, 85 L. Ed. 1271; <em>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co. </em>(1941), 314 U.S. 95, 62 S. Ct. 1, 86 L. Ed. 65; <em>Schwab v. Ariyoshi </em>(Haw. 1977), 564 P.2d 135; <em>Connerty v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>(Mass. 1986), 495 N.E.2d 840; <em>Cumberland Reclamation v. Secretary Dep\u2019t of Interior </em>(6th Cir. 1991), 925 F.2d 164. <em>See also </em>2A C. Sands, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.23 at 194 (4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">This Court\u2019s prior decisions in this area are admittedly confusing and the majority adds to that confusion by distinguishing several cases that clearly apply to this situation. The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Grier v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 457, 812 P.2d 347, on the basis that in <em>Grier </em>we .interpreted the policy, while here we are restricted to interpreting the statute. As noted earlier, I believe the majority has improperly narrowed the issue presented by the Federal District Court to exclude any consideration of the policy language. By referencing the policy provisions in the certified question and by attaching a copy of the policy to the certified question, both the Federal District Court and the parties intended that we consider the provisions of the policy in responding to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>Grier, </em>the underinsured motorist coverage was part of the policy section on uninsured motorist coverage and there was no separate policy section for underinsured coverage. We also noted that the declarations page made no mention of underinsured coverage. We concluded that under those circumstances, the underinsured coverage was part of the uninsured coverage. In this case, however, the underinsured coverage is also part of the uninsured coverage provision and there is no separate section in the policy for underinsured coverage. While the declaration page does reference underinsured coverage, it specifies that there is no separate premium for underinsured coverage as it is included in the uninsured coverage premium, which was the rationale relied upon in <em>Grier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Therefore, under the rationale of <em>Grier, </em>the underinsured coverage in the policy in question is clearly part of the uninsured coverage and stacking is specifically prohibited by \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">The majority also distinguishes this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Chilberg v. Rose </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 414, 903 P.2d 1377, on the grounds that <em>Chilberg </em>was a multiple policy case and did not interpret \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA. In <em>Chilberg </em>there were multiple policies since the same insurance company issued separate policies for each vehicle rather than insuring all the vehicles in one policy, as was done in this case. The decision in <em>Chilberg </em>was not dependent on the fact that multiple policies were involved, but rather on the fact that Chilberg, like Leonard in this case, was a stranger to the insurance policies, not being the named insured or a family member. Having never paid any premiums on the policies, nor having any knowledge the policies even existed prior to the accident, this Court ruled that Chilberg should not be able to stack the separate underinsured coverage limits. <em>Chilberg, </em>903 P.2d at 1380. Like Chilberg, Leonard had no \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of coverage and, under the rationale of <em>Chilberg, </em>his estate should not be allowed to stack underinsured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In summary, the majority\u2019s strained and restrictive construction of MVLP as used in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is contrary to the clear language of the statute and does not take into account the context in which the statute was written. Under the majority opinion, the only stacking prohibited under \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is for the liability limits for policies issued under the MVSRAfor \u201cbad drivers\u201d and uninsured motorist coverage. Since stacking has never been applied to liability coverages,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the only type of coverage in Montana for which stacking is prohibited is now uninsured motorist coverage. The plain language of the statute is simply not that narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The practical result of the majority\u2019s decision is absurd. Since the majority opinion recognizes the prohibition against the stacking of uninsured coverage limits, if Leonard had been struck and killed by a driver with no liability insurance at all, stacking would not be allowed and the maximum his estate could have recovered under the policy would be $50,000. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ever, since the driver who struck Leonard had the minimum limits, the vehicles under the policy can be stacked and Leonard\u2019s estate is entitled to $350,000. Statutes should be read and construed so as to avoid absurd results if a reasonable construction can avoid it. <em>See Christenot v. State </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 396, 901 P.2d 545; <em>Darby Spar, Ltd. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 376, 705 P.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">I would therefore answer the certified question presented to this Court in the affirmative and hold that \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, prohibits the stacking of medical payment coverage and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">. The majority relies on \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, as authority to apply the definition of MVLP in the MVSRAin Title 61 to the anti-stacking statute in Title 33. Section 1-2-107, MCA, provides, however, that the definition of a phrase in one part of the code may be applied to the same phrase in another part \u201cexcept where a contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d Here, the plain language of \u00a7 61-6-103(1), MCA, restricts the definition of MVLP \u201cas the term is used in this part\u201d and then only for policies certified under \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-133, -134, MCA. It would be difficult to envision a clearer expression of legislative intent. The Legislature intended that the definition of MVLP in \u00a7 61-6-103(1), MCA, be restricted to the MVSRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\">. Policies issued under the MVSRA (Part 1) contain a number of restrictions not found in policies issued under the mandatory liability provision (Part 3). For instance, under the MVSRA the liability of the insurer is absolute after an accident occurs and there are restrictions as to cancellation and increasing premiums. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-6-103(6)-(7), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. In <em>Kemp v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 526, 535, 601 P.2d 20,25, this Court, in a stacking case predating \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, held that: \u201cMontana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute is not mandatory, in the sense that the insured has the right to reject in writing such coverage in policies issued in Montana.\u201d The majority\u2019s holding in this case that uninsured motorist coverage is required coverage is in direct conflict with our holding in <em>Kemp.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">. <em>See Allstate Insurance Company v.

While I think the Court does a relatively creditable job of attempting to mesh statutes which simply do not track well, I am unable to join in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Plainly stated, the question before us is whether the anti-stacking provision contained in \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA, is limited to liability coverages required by law or applies to all coverages contained in a vehicle insurance policy. The Court concludes that the statute prohibits only the stacking of required liability coverages, as the Court creatively defines such coverages. It is my view that, while the statute is not a model of clarity, the legislature\u2019s intent to more broadly prohibit stacking is apparent therein. On that basis, I would answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The Court begins with the \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d (MVLP) language contained in \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, and looks first to \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, for a definition of that term; that definition is stated as \u201cany policy of automobile or motor vehicle insurance against liability now or hereafter required under Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3.\u201d I agree that this appears to be a rational starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Moreover, I generally agree with the Court\u2019s interpretation that the definition of MVLP contained in \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, addresses the third-party per person, per vehicle and property damage liability coverages required by Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3. Finally, I agree that the first-party med pay and underinsurance coverages at issue in this case are not liability coverages within the definitional parameters of MVLP contained in \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">That said, it is important to recall that our resolution of the certified question before us turns on the proper interpretation of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, rather than \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA. In my view, it is the Court\u2019s attempt to force feed the \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>MVLP into \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA, that results in a legally flawed and logically inconsistent analysis which disregards the actual language used by the legislature in \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">Inserting the \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, definition of MVLP into \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA, produces the following rough reading of the first pertinent portion of that statute: \u201cthe limits of liability coverage required by Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3 ... cannot be stacked.\u201d The problem I have with such a reading is that the legislature did not use language even approximating such a reading; it clearly used different words, and words clearly at odds with the Court\u2019s interpretation, in \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA. What the legislature said is that the limits of \u201cinsurance coverage available\u201d cannot be stacked. It is my view that, if the legislature had intended to limit the anti-stacking provision to \u201cliability coverage required by law,\u201d it could and would have done so. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">A more reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA, is that the legislature intended precisely what it said: to prohibit stacking of any and all \u201cinsurance coverage available\u201d in an automobile insurance policy, including the med pay and underinsurance coverages at issue here. In that regard, I conclude that neither the definition contained in \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, nor that contained in \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, is logically transferable to the \u2018limits of insurance coverage available\u201d language contained in \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA. Therefore, while the general rule contained in \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, is that definitions contained in one part of the Montana Code Annotated are applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs, I would apply the ' exception to that rule also contained in \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, and conclude in this case that \u201ca contrary intention plainly appears\u201d with regard to inserting definitions of MVLP into \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">This conclusion is further buttressed by the remaining \u2014 and, in my view, largest \u2014 barrier to the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA. The critical portion of the statute reads \u201cthe limits of insurance coverage available under any such policy, including the limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage. ...\u201d With the Court\u2019s definition of \u201csuch policy\u201d inserted, the statute reads \u201cthe limits of coverage required under Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3 [the $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 amounts of third-party liability coverage] including the limits of liability under uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Whether or not one agrees with the Court\u2019s creative interpretation that uninsured motorist coverage is actually <em>required </em>by \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, and I do not, an inconsistency results on the face of \u00a7 33-23-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>203(1), MCA, when both the Court\u2019s definition of MVLP and the \u201cincluding\u201d clause are considered. It is clear that nothing in Title 61, chapter 6, parts 1 and 3, requires uninsured motorist coverage; the Court\u2019s own analysis makes that clear in pointing out that the \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA/Title 61 required coverages are third-party per person, per vehicle and property damage liability coverage. It is equally clear that the \u201cincluding\u201d clause refers back to what preceded it in the statute \u2014 \u201csuch policy\u201d \u2014 defined by the Court as the \u00a7 33-23-204, MCA, definition of MVLP. The \u201cincluding\u201d clause simply cannot broaden, by any rule of logic, grammar or law of which I am aware, the statutory definition of MVLP which the Court has inserted into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">For these reasons, it is my view that the Court\u2019s analysis is flawed. Amore reasonable reading of \u00a7 33-23-203(1), MCA, requires a conclusion that the legislature intended to prohibit the stacking of all coverages contained in an automobile insurance policy insuring more than one vehicle. I invite the legislature to revisit the statutes addressed in this case by both the Court and the dissenting opinions with an eye toward clarifying statutes which simply do not mesh well under any analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
