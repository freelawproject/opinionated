He received disability and specific compensation and thereafter returned to his former employment without reduction in wages. He worked until September 5, 1930, when he was discharged for lack of work. The present petition relates to compensation for partial disability since that date. He searched in many places for work and was refused because of business conditions. He was given some work by the town in which he lived. He testified that if he had a good hand he could get work. Asked to tell where he could get a job, he replied that he was an old tree trimmer and bug man and could take contracts himself in the fall trimming and cutting trees, and could put on storm doors and windows, except that he could not handle a hammer or screw driver with his hand. There was no other evidence that such work was available to him. He also testified that he had \u201clooked around everywhere he could to find work. He could have got a job but he couldn\u2019t handle the bags. His grip isn\u2019t good.\u201d The finding of the board member, affirmed and adopted by the reviewing board, was that it \u201cwould appear from the evidence that this employee could do pick and shovel work without much difficulty if he could get it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The strong impression derived from reading the record is that the failure of the employee to get work was due wholly to business depression. If that were the fact, there could be no recovery under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 492-493. <em>Driscoll\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 236, 239, and cases cited. In view, however, of the evidence given by the employee as above stated, slender though it is, we do not think it can quite be held as matter of law that there is nothing to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>finding that his injury was a cause of his unemployment. If that finding has any support in the evidence, it must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">There is no sound ground for reversing the finding as to the calculation of the impairment of earning capacity due to the injury. That must be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The award of costs to be paid to the employee by the insurer under St. 1930, c. 208, amending G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, is attacked on the ground that that statute is unconstitutional. That question has been decided adversely to the contention of the insurer by <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, ante, </em>180, where the matter is discussed at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The employee urges that costs be awarded to him under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14, on the ground that this appeal is frivolous. It cannot rightly be said that this appeal was prosecuted without any reasonable ground. <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
