The trial of the action resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendants, and we have this day filed an opinion affirming such judgment. <em>(Imperial Land Co. </em>v. <em>Imperial Irr. Dist., ante, </em>p. 668, [161 Pac. 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The judgment on the merits, which now becomes final, ended the life of the temporary injunction. The defendants have, accordingly, secured every substantial benefit which they could obtain by a reversal of the order which they seek to review by the present appeal. The rights of the parties would not be affected in any way by either an affirmance or a reversal of such order. In this state of facts, the questions presented are merely moot or academic, and the court will not exercise its appellate jurisdiction for their decision. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Cal. 611, [47 Pac. 591]; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Voorsanger, </em>143 Cal. 214, [76 Pac. 1031].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Shaw, J., and Lawlor, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
