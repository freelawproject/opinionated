Proc., sec. 963), and further providing that upon appeal from a judgment the court may review \u201cany order on motion for a new trial.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 956.) Respondent on this motion relies upon the case of <em>San Francisco etc. Railways </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Alameda County, </em>172 Cal. 541, [157 Pac. 604]. But in that case it is declared, touching the right of an appeal from such an order, in the following language: \u201cIt has been held that as to the right of appeal from such an order (granting or refusing to grant a new trial) it is the condition of the law at the time of the denial of the motion for a new trial that controls, regardless of whether the proceeding for a new trial was initiated prior to or subsequent to the change in the law.\u201d To the support of this language is cited <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Colyear, </em>172 Cal. 440, [156 Pac. 475], where it is declared that the statute denying a right of appeal from an order denying a new trial is necessarily applicable in every ease where such order was made- subsequent to the date of the taking effect of the amendment. \u201cIt is the condition of the law at the time of the making of the order that controls\u201d the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The motion to dismiss is therefore granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Sloss, J., Shaw, J., Lorigan, J., Melvin, J., and Lawlor, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
