They also contended that no legal notice of the hearing before the Industrial Accident Commission had ever been served upon any accredited representative of the church until after the testimony had been taken. After the issuance of the writ the cases of <em>Carstens </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>172 Cal. 572, [158 Pac. 218], and <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>172 Cal. 581, [158 Pac. 222], were decided. Thereafter counsel for respondent filed a memorandum in which he recited that as the decisions in said cases determined and ruled all questions raised in this proceeding adversely to respondent\u2019s contentions, he waived further time for filing briefs, and agreed that the award made against petitioner should be annulled so far as the Industrial Accident Commission was concerned. He properly declined to make any waiver on behalf of Augustus Cohnhoff, who was represented here by his own counsel. No brief has been filed by Cohnhoff or his counsel, probably for the reason that .there is no possible way of differentiating the facts involved in this proceeding from those considered by the court in the decisions cited above. We have examined the record and fully agree with learned counsel for the Industrial Accident Commission that those decisions \u201cdetermined and ruled all questions raised and involved in the instant case.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Therefore the award is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Shaw, J., Sloss, J., Henshaw, J., Lawlor, J., and Angellotti, C.
