J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">After fire destroyed an office building known as the Olivewood Medical Arts Center, the four owners of the building contracted with a builder (J.C. Interiors, Inc.) to rebuild the basic structure or \u201cshell\u201d of the building. The contract called for five separate installment payments (or \u201cdraws\u201d) of 18 percent of the $532,226 contract price (approximately $96,000 each) plus a \u201cretention\u201d of 10 percent to be paid 30 days after completion of the project. When the owners failed to pay the third draw after the builder claimed it was due, the builder walked off the job. The owners eventually hired someone else to finish the project. One of the four owners, Omer H. Brawley, sued the builder for lost rents Brawley contended he would have earned if the project had been completed by the deadline set forth in the contract. The builder sued the owners and their owners association for nonpayment of the third draw. Three of the owners and the association paid a $100,000 settlement to the builder. Brawley\u2019s suit against the builder, and the builder\u2019s suit (now only against the fourth owner, Brawley) went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>The month-long trial included detailed testimony and documentary evidence of the progress and occasional setbacks of the construction project, of the owners\u2019 dealings with the builder, and of the owners\u2019 squabbles with each other. The results of the trial were perhaps best described by Brawley\u2019s counsel, Mr. Chartrand, who stated at a posttrial hearing, \u201cthe jury socked it to both sides here.\u201d The jury found that both sides breached the contract. The jury awarded Brawley $19,800 in damages for J.C.\u2019s breach, and awarded J.C. $32,551.52 for Brawley\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court offset Brawley\u2019s $32,551.52 obligation to J.C. with the $100,000 settlement received by J.C. from the other three owners and the association, thus reducing Brawley\u2019s obligation to J.C. to zero. The court entered judgment for Brawley in the amount of $19,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The court found J.C. to be the prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and awarded costs to J.C. in the amount of $26,326. The court denied J.C.\u2019s motion for attorney fees and refused to add any prejudgment interest to J.C.\u2019s recovery of zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In the published portions of our opinion, we address issues pertaining to Code of Civil Procedure section 877 and Civil Code section 3260.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 877 provides in pertinent part that when some of the co-obligors on a contract settle with a plaintiff in good faith before verdict or judgment and obtain a release, the release \u201cshall reduce the claims against the others ... in the amount of the consideration paid for it.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a).) How does a court determine the value of \u201cthe claims against the others\u201d (i.e., the value of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the nonsettling co-obligors) when \u201cthe others\u201d also sue the plaintiff for breach of the same contract and the jury finds that both sides breached the contract and both sides were damaged? In the case before us, the only nonsettling obligor (or \u201cother\u201d) was Brawley. The court valued J.C.\u2019s claim against Brawley at $32,551.52, then reduced this claim to zero by virtue of the $100,000 settlement received by J.C. from Brawley\u2019s co-obligors, then entered judgment for Brawley in the amount of his damages caused by J.C.\u2019s breach ($19,800). We hold in part I. of our opinion, however, that the value of a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaims against the others\u201d is the amount the plaintiff would have recovered in a judgment against the others if there had been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>settlement prior to the verdict or judgment. Thus the court should have valued J.C.\u2019s claim at $12,751.52 ($32,551.52 minus $19,800), reduced this to zero, and entered a judgment awarding no damages to either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Subdivision (g) of Civil Code section 3260 allows a court to award attorney fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in an action brought under circumstances specified in the statute. In part III. of our opinion we hold that this statute, like similar statutes, gives the court discretion to determine whether there is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">THE APPEALS AND THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Presently before us are four appeals. Both Brawley and J.C. have appealed from the judgment. This is case No. F050279. In case No. F051448, J.C. appeals from the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order denying J.C.\u2019s request for attorney fees, and Brawley appeals from what he describes as a postjudgment \u201corder . . . awarding J.C. INTERIORS $17,903.32 in prejudgment interest .. . ,\u201d even though the court in fact awarded no prejudgment interest to J.C. Interiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">\n<em>The Appeals from the Judgment (F050279)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Brawley contends in his F050279 appeal that the court erred in finding J.C. to be the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of the award of costs to J.C. He also contends that the court erred in a prejudgment ruling finding the $100,000 settlement between the three other owners and J.C. have been made in good faith. This contention too is eye-catching in that although the court\u2019s finding of a good faith settlement served to cut off certain rights of Brawley to seek indemnity from the other owners (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877.6), there is nothing to indemnify because J.C. obtained no monetary judgment against Brawley. Furthermore, credit for the $100,000 settlement turned what would have been a $12,751.52 judgment in favor of J.C. and against Brawley ($32,551.52 in J.C. damages for Brawley\u2019s breach minus $19,800 in Brawley damages for J.C.\u2019s breach) into a $19,800 judgment in favor of Brawley and against J.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">J.C. contends in its appeal from the judgment (F050279) that the court erred in awarding Brawley the $19,800 judgment. J.C. contends that the court should have offset J.C.\u2019s $32,551.52 in damages with Brawley\u2019s $19,800 in damages, leaving J.C. with a net award of $12,751.52, which then should have been reduced to zero due to credit for the $100,000 settlement. Under J.C.\u2019s calculation, the correct judgment would have awarded nothing to J.C. and nothing to Brawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>\n<em>The Appeals from the Postjudgment Order (F051448)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The court\u2019s judgment included a determination that J.C. \u201cis the prevailing Party pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1032.\u201d A later, postjudgment order fixed the amount of costs awarded to J.C. at $26,326. The same postjudgment order also denied J.C.\u2019s request for prejudgment interest and J.C.\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">As aforementioned, J.C.\u2019s appeal from the postjudgment order contends that the court erred in refusing to award J.C. any attorney fees. Brawley\u2019s appeal from the postjudgment order contends that the court erred in \u201cawarding J.C. INTERIORS $17,903.22 in pre-judgment interest\u201d even though the court did not in fact award J.C. any prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In part I. of this opinion we will address J.C.\u2019s appeal from the judgment. In part II. we will address Brawley\u2019s appeal from the judgment. In part III. we will address J.C.\u2019s appeal from the postjudgment order denying J.C. attorney fees. In part IV. we will address Brawley\u2019s appeal from the postjudgment order. As we shall explain in part I., we agree with J.C. that the trial court erred in entering the $19,800 judgment for Brawley. The court should have offset Brawley\u2019s $19,800 in damages caused by J.C. with J.C.\u2019s $32,551.52 in damages caused by Brawley. The judgment therefore should have awarded Brawley zero, not $19,800. We find the remaining contentions made by both parties (addressed in parts II., III. &amp; IV.) to be without merit. On appeal No. F050279 we will remand the matter to the trial court and direct that court to amend the judgment so that it awards each party zero. The trial court may also reconsider whether it wishes to make an award of costs to one of the parties. On appeal No. F051448 we will affirm the court\u2019s postjudgment order denying J.C.\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">J.C.\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT (F050279)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">After the jury determined that Brawley\u2019s breach caused $32,551.52 in unmitigable damages to J.C., and that J.C.\u2019s breach caused $19,800 in damages to Brawley, the court gave Brawley credit for the $100,000 settlement paid to J.C. by Brawley\u2019s former codefendants. The court determined that Brawley therefore owed J.C. nothing, and it then entered judgment in favor of Brawley for $19,800. J.C. contends that the court erred in that the court should have offset J.C.\u2019s $32,551.52 in unmitigable damages caused by Brawley with Brawley\u2019s $19,800 in damages caused by J.C., should have viewed the net result of the jury\u2019s verdict to be that Brawley owed J.C. $12,751.52 (i.e., $32,551.52 minus $19,800), should have given Brawley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>settlement credit for the net amount of $12,751.52 he otherwise would have been obligated to pay to J.C., thereby reducing Brawley\u2019s obligation to J.C. to zero, and should have entered a judgment awarding nothing to either party. We agree with J.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Both sides rely on the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 877 itself, which states that a settlement made in good faith by one co-obligor \u201cshall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release, the dismissal or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a).) Brawley contends, and the trial judge apparently agreed, that the value of J.C.\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d against Brawley was J.C.\u2019s $32,551.52 in unmitigable damages. The jury\u2019s verdict, however, determined the actual value of J.C.\u2019s claim to be $12,751.52. Both sides agree that if Brawley\u2019s former codefendants had not paid J.C. $100,000 in settlement of J.C.\u2019s claims against them, and if the court had rendered judgment in the absence of any settlement, that judgment would have been a judgment of $12,751.52 in favor of J.C. and against Brawley (i.e., a \u201cnetting\u201d of each side\u2019s damages). We do not think that the existence of the settlement serves to inflate the real value of J.C.\u2019s claim to $32,551.52. To state this a bit differently, the settlement did not compel the court to value J.C.\u2019s claim at $32,551.52 by ignoring J.C.\u2019s own breach of the very same contract Brawley breached. The term \u201cclaims\u201d in Code of Civil Procedure section 877 \u201cappears to refer to a claim of liability\u201d and \u201c[i]n the context of litigation, a claim of liability against another party generally connotes a cause of action for damages.\u201d <em>(Reed </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 439, 444 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 510].) The value of J.C.\u2019s \u201cclaims against\u201d Brawley (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a)) was the amount J.C. would have recovered in litigation against Brawley if there had been no settlement \u201cbefore verdict or judgment\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877) by Brawley\u2019s co-obligors\u2014$12,751.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Some courts allow a nonsettling defendant to introduce a settlement into evidence, and then instruct the jury to reduce any verdict against the nonsettling defendant by the amount paid in settlement. (See <em>Helling v. Lew </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 434, 440 [104 Cal.Rptr. 789].) Other courts inform the jury of a settlement but also instruct the jury that the jury\u2019s award of damages should be made without considering any amount that the plaintiff may have received in settlement and that \u201c[a]fter you have returned your verdict, I will make the proper deduction from your award of damages.\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instns. (2008) CACI No. 3926; see also BAJI No. 14.64.) Still other courts take the view that \u201c[t]he presentation of evidence concerning the amount or fact of settlement to the jury ... is not only confusing, but also can lead to abuse in argument. ...\u201d <em>(Shepherd v. Walley </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 1079, 1083 [105 Cal.Rptr. 387].) For these courts, \u201can approved procedure is for the court to reduce the verdict award by the amount paid in settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>before entering judgment on the verdict. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Syverson </em>v. <em>Heitmann </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 106, 111 [214 Cal.Rptr. 581].) In the present case the trial court took this third approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">What makes this case different from any other published California appellate case is that here we have not only a settlement, but also a situation where each party has sued the other for breach of contract, and each party was found by the jury to have breached the contract. \u201cA breach of contract may be total or partial. If the breach is total, the injured party has the right to terminate the contract. If the breach is partial, there is no right to terminate, [f] . . . [f] Any breach of contract, whether total or partial, causing measurable injury, gives rise to a claim for damages.\u201d (BAJI No. 10.86; see also <em>Borgonovo v. Henderson </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 220 [6 Cal.Rptr. 236]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Contracts, \u00a7 852.) The jury here was so instructed. The jury apparently concluded that each side partially breached the contract, or that at least the first party to breach committed a partial breach. The jury then determined that each party had been damaged by the other party\u2019s breach. In any event, a finding that each party breached the contract, and that each party is entitled to damages for the other\u2019s breach, is legally permissible. (BAJI No. 10.86; see also <em>Borgonovo, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 220; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 852.) In such a situation, the proper procedure for the court to take is to offset the jury\u2019s damages award findings against each other, just as the court would do if there had been no settlement, and to then apply the settlement credit to any net amount of damages the nonsettling defendant would have been liable for (here, $12,751.52) if there had been no settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Brawley calls our attention to language in <em>Syverson v. Heitmann, </em>stating that \u201c[w]here a plaintiff\u2019s settlement completely offsets the damages assessed against a nonsettling joint tortfeasor, it reduces the judgment to zero by operation of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Syverson </em>v. <em>Heitmann, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 110.) He then argues that the \u201cdamages assessed against\u201d Brawley were $32,551.52 and that J.C.\u2019s settlement with Brawley\u2019s former codefendants \u201ccompletely offsets\u201d this $32,551.52 amount. We are not persuaded. Neither <em>Syverson </em>nor any other case cited by Brawley (or by J.C.) involves a situation in which each side has been damaged by the other\u2019s breach of the parties\u2019 contract. The jury in the case now before us was not asked to make any assessment of damages against a nonsettling joint tortfeasor (or nonsettling co-obligor). The jury was asked to, and did, calculate the amount of J.C.\u2019s damages caused by Brawley\u2019s breach, and the amount of Brawley\u2019s damages caused by J.C.\u2019s breach. Had the jury been asked to make an assessment of damages \u201cagainst\u201d anyone, it would have netted out J.C.\u2019s $32,551.52 in unmitigable damages with Brawley\u2019s $19,800 in damages, and would have \u201cawarded\u201d J.C. the difference\u2014$12,751.52. It did not take this last step because it was not asked to do so. But $12,751.52 was the true value of J.C.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>\u201cclaim\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a)) because this is the amount of the judgment J.C. would have won if there had been no settlement before J.C. litigated its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Brawley next points out that Code of Civil Procedure section 877 \u201cassures that a plaintiff will not be enriched unjustly by a double recovery, collecting part of his total claim from one . . . and all of his claim from another.\u201d <em>(Reed </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 444; accord, <em>Wouldridge v. Zimmerman </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 656, 658 [98 Cal.Rptr. 778].) \u201c \u2018[W]hen the injury arises from a single act, [a plaintiff] cannot, by suing each wrongdoer alone, convert a joint into a several [injury], and thereby secure more than one compensation for the same injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(May v. Miller </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 404, 410 [278 Cal.Rptr. 341], quoting <em>Butler v. Ashworth </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 614, 618-619 [43 P. 4].) Brawley then argues that a reversal of his verdict for $19,800 would result in \u201ca double recovery to J.C. Interiors.\u201d Again, we do not agree. The trial court\u2019s judgment (awarding $19,800 to Brawley and nothing to J.C.) gave J.C. no recovery at all. The judgment we will instruct the court to enter on remand (awarding nothing to Brawley and nothing to J.C.) will still give J.C. no recovery at all. The one and only recovery J.C. has obtained is the settlement it received from Brawley\u2019s former codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">BRAWLEY\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">IH.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">J.C.\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE POSTJUDGMENT ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">The court\u2019s postjudgment order stated in pertinent part: \u201cExercising its discretion, the court denies J.C. INTERIORS motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERD [szc], that J.C. INTERIORS motion for attorney\u2019s fees is denied.\u201d In this case neither side made any contention that their contract had an attorney fee clause. Rather, J.C. contends that Civil Code sections 3260 and 3260.1 required the court to award J.C. attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Civil Code section 3260 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>\u201c(b) The retention proceeds withheld from any payment by the owner from the original contractor . . . shall be subject to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">\u201c(c) Within 45 days after the date of completion, the retention withheld by the owner shall be released. \u2018Date of completion,\u2019 for purposes of this section, means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">\u201c(1) The date of issuance of any certificate of occupancy covering the work by the public agency issuing the permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">\u201c(2) The date of completion indicated on a valid notice of completion recorded pursuant to Section 3093.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">\u201c(3) The date of completion as defined in Section 3086.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-8\">\u201c ...

Additionally, in any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party shall be entitled to his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Civil Code section 3260.1 regarding the payment of progress payments provides: \u201c(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing, the owner shall pay to the contractor, within 30 days following receipt of a demand for payment in accordance with the contract, any progress payment due thereunder as to which there is no good faith dispute between the parties. In the event of a dispute between the owner and the contractor, the owner may withhold from the progress payment an amount not to exceed 150 percent of the disputed amount. If any amount is wrongfully withheld in violation of this subdivision, the contractor shall be entitled to the penalty specified in subdivision (g) of Section 3260.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">The jury\u2019s special verdict answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cWas there a good faith dispute regarding the payment of the 3rd draw payment to J.C. INTERIORS, INC., under the parties contract[?]\u201d The jury\u2019s special verdict also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cWas there a good faith dispute regarding the payment of the retention payment to J.C. Interiors, INC., under the parties\u2019 contract?\u201d The linchpin of J.C.\u2019s contention that the court was required to award J.C. attorney fees is J.C.\u2019s contention that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>was required to deem J.C. to be the \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 3260, subdivision (g). We disagree. Rather, we agree with the trial court\u2019s expressed conclusion that it had \u201cdiscretion\u201d as to whether to award J.C. attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Unlike Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, discussed above in part I. of this opinion, Civil Code section 3260, subdivision (g) contains no definition of the term \u201cprevailing party.\u201d \u201c[C]ourts in cases involving . . . statutes which provide that the prevailing party \u2018shall\u2019 recover attorney fees also have concluded that a court has the discretion to find there is no prevailing party, even though the statute does not expressly say so. (See, e.g., <em>Heather Farms Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1574 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 758] <em>(Heather Farms) </em>[Civ. Code, \u00a7 1354, subd. (f)]; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>National Enquirer, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1277-1278 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 659] (Gilbert) [Civ. Code, \u00a7 3344, subd. (a)]; <em>Damian v. Tamondong </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1128-1130 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 262] . . . [Civ. Code, \u00a7 2983.4].) The determination of whether there is a prevailing party is to be made \u2018on a practical level\u2019 after considering what each party accomplished via the litigation. <em>(Heather Farms, supra, </em>at p. 1575; <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at p. 1277.)\u201d <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1016-1017 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625].) In construing a statute which gives the trial court discretion to determine whether there has been a prevailing party (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717), the California Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[W]e hold that in deciding whether there is a \u2018party prevailing on the contract,\u2019 the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties\u2019 demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings, trial briefs, opening statements, and similar sources. The prevailing party determination is to be made only upon a final resolution of the contract claims and only by \u2018a comparison of the extent to which each party ha[s] succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hsu v. Abbara </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 863, 876 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d 804].)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">\u201cGenerally, where a trial court has discretionary power to decide an issue, an appellate court is not authorized to substitute its judgment of the proper decision for that of the trial judge. The trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse, resulting in injury sufficiently grave as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Rosevear </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 673, 682 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 691].) \u201c \u2018The appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. When two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 272 [279 Cal.Rptr. 576, 807 P.2d 418]; see <em>Shamblin v. Brattain </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 474, 478-479 [243 Cal.Rptr. 902, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>749 P.2d 339]; accord, <em>Nestle v. City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 925 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].) \u201cThe burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 566 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193]; see <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 331 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) \u201c[T]he showing is insufficient if it presents facts which merely afford an opportunity for a difference of opinion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 59, 65 [215 Cal.Rptr. 716]; accord, <em>In re Marriage of Rosevear, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">J.C. argued to the jury that it did not breach the contract. The jury found that J.C. did breach the contract. J.C. argued to the jury that it was not negligent in its construction of the building shell. The jury found that J.C. was negligent in its construction of the building shell. J.C. sought more than $120,000 for Brawley\u2019s breach of the contract. The jury found that J.C.\u2019s unmitigable damages were $32,551.52, but also that J.C.\u2019s breach caused $19,800 in damages to Brawley. The trial court\u2019s judgment awarded $19,800 to Brawley and awarded J.C. nothing. Although, as we explained in part I. of this opinion, the trial court should have also awarded Brawley nothing, the fact remains that J.C. emerged from this hard-fought battle with a net positive of $12,751.52 which was then reduced to zero because of the prejudgment settlement. In assessing the extent to which J.C. succeeded and failed in its contentions <em>(Hsu v. Abbara, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 863), the court acted well within its discretion to refuse to find J.C. to have been the prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code section 3260, subdivision (g). The court\u2019s minute order denying J.C.\u2019s motion for attorney fees was issued one month before its final order. The court\u2019s minute order expressly stated that \u201c[i]n summarizing this litigation and with the benefit of hindsight, it does not appear J.C. Interiors exited in better condition than it began.\u201d Although we concluded in part I. of this opinion that the court erred in entering judgment in favor of Brawley for $19,800, we see no reasonable probability that the correction of this judgment would cause the trial court to conclude that J.C. was the prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code section 3260, subdivision (g). The corrected judgment will still award J.C. nothing on its claims against Brawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">BRAWLEY\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE POSTJUDGMENT ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The judgment awarding Brawley $19,800 is reversed. The matter is remanded to the superior court with directions to enter a judgment awarding Brawley nothing and awarding J.C. Interiors, Inc., nothing. The trial court may also reconsider whether it wishes to make an award of costs to one of the parties. Both sides to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Vartabedian, J., and Levy, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">On April 30, 2008, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\"> To be precise, we note that the jury\u2019s special verdict found J.C.\u2019s breach caused $19,800 in damages to Brawley, and that none of this $19,800 could reasonably have been avoided by Brawley. The special verdict also found Brawley\u2019s breach caused $44,551.52 in damages to J.C., but that $12,000 of this $44,551.52 in damages could reasonably have been avoided by J.C. No one disputes that $32,551.52 (i.e., $44,551.52 minus $12,000) is what J.C. would have been awarded in a judgment if Brawley had not also sued J.C. and if there had been no settlement by Brawley\u2019s co-obligors. We will thus refer to this $32,551.52 amount as \u201cJ.C.\u2019s unmitigable damages\u201d or sometimes simply \u201cJ.C.\u2019s damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-12\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1126.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
