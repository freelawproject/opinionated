Rodriquez, by which it sought to compel Rodriquez to pay support for her 18-year-old son Joshua who, after living with Rodriquez nearly all of his life, began living with Rodriquez\u2019s brother and sister-in-law (the Andersens) full time while he finished his senior year in high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">The trial court found that Rodriquez\u2014who had been designated her son\u2019s custodial parent in a 1993 child support order\u2014had no legal obligation as a custodial parent to pay child support. The court also found that, absent a contractual agreement between Rodriquez and the Andersens for Joshua\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>support, the Andersens could not request the county\u2019s assistance in obtaining a judgment for support against Rodriquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">The complaint was properly dismissed. We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">When Rodriquez and Dean Duchi dissolved their marriage in 1993, the court entered an order designating Rodriquez the primary custodial parent, and ordering Duchi to pay child support of $565 per month. That order was never revoked or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Joshua lived with his mother until 2005, when he moved to Arroyo Grande and began living with Rodriquez\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, the Andersens. Rodriquez, Duchi, Joshua, and the Andersens all agreed that Joshua would continue to live with the Andersens until he completed high school in June 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Duchi continued to make his court-ordered monthly child support to Rodriquez, which she forwarded to the Andersens. For a time, Rodriquez also sent the Andersens $165 a month toward Joshua\u2019s living expenses and sometimes sent him gift cards for fast food.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">In or about August 2006, Rodriquez stopped sending support above and beyond that provided by Duchi. The Andersens then applied to the county for help, explaining that Joshua was living with them \u201cby mutual agreement.\u201d The county promptly initiated this action, in which it sought to compel Rodriquez to pay $576 per month in child support for Joshua. The computer formula used by the county to calculate Rodriquez\u2019s support obligation assumed the Andersens were Joshua\u2019s custodial parents and Rodriquez his \u201cnoncustodial\u201d parent; it assumed no support from Duchi. Nothing in the county\u2019s complaint suggests Joshua is receiving public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">In her answer to the complaint, Rodriquez objected to the amount of the proposed support demand on the grounds the request failed to account for Duchi\u2019s continued payments and overstated her income.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">After a trial at which Rodriquez and a county representative testified, the court found that \u201cthe complaint cannot be substantiated\u201d and dismissed the action. Its \u201cRuling on Child Support\u201d (which it incorporated into the order) first rejected the complaint\u2019s characterization of Rodriquez as the \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d as follows: \u201cAs shown by the underlying dissolution of marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>action, [Rodriquez] is, and has always been the <em>primary custodial parent </em>of Joshua. As such, she has no obligation to pay money for the support of a child in her custody. [The Andersens] are not parties to this action and therefore they have no standing to request the [county]\u2019s assistance in obtaining a judgment for Joshua\u2019s support against [Rodriquez], Although [Rodriquez] has been voluntarily sending money each month, she is under no obligation to do so short of a contractual agreement with the Andersens and there has been no such evidence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Indeed, the court explained, the facts of this case are analogous to a situation in which Rodriquez \u201cdecided to place Joshua in a boarding or military type school for his education. As the primary custodial parent, she would have a right to place him where she felt necessary and appropriate. Assuming the amount of child support paid by [Duchi] was insufficient to meet the financial needs of the school, [Rodriquez] would be required to [enter] into an agreement to pay the difference. This in no way would alter the fact that she still doesn\u2019t have an obligation under the Family code to <em>pay </em>child support as a <em>non-custodial parent.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The county appeals. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">We review orders granting or denying a request for modification of a child support order for abuse of discretion. <em>(Brothers </em>v. <em>Kern </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 126, 133 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 239]; <em>In re Marriage of Pearlstein </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1371 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 910].) The trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion must be \u201cinformed and considered\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Muldrow </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 327, 332 [132 Cal.Rptr. 48]; see <em>In re Marriage of Pearlstein, </em>at p. 1371), and the trial court may not \u201cignore or contravene the purposes of the law\u201d <em>(County of Stanislaus v. Gibbs </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1425 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 819]).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">To the extent the appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings, we review the findings for substantial evidence, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed in the trial court. <em>(In re Marriage of Drake </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1151 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 466].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">\u201cHowever, '\u201cquestions relating to the interpretation of statutes are matters of law for the reviewing court. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Thus, when a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>court\u2019s ruling turns on the interpretation of a statute, the issue is one of law, subject to the independent review of this court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Yuba v. Savedra </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1316 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The county contends in this appeal that once Joshua has ceased to live with her, Rodriquez has a statutory duty to support Joshua, which is not discharged by the 1993 dissolution decree granting her physical custody of him. It also contends the trial court erred in dismissing the action based on the Andersens\u2019 alleged lack of standing to compel Rodriquez to meet her support obligation because the county has independent legal authority to bring an action to establish a support order on Joshua\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\n<em>To a Point, the County\u2019s Assertions Are Correct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">First, Rodriquez <em>does </em>have a statutory duty to support Joshua. The Family Code provides that both parents \u201chave an equal responsibility to support their child in the manner suitable to the child\u2019s circumstances\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3900) and that duty \u201ccontinues as to an unmarried child who has attained the age of 18 years, is a full-time high school student, and who is not self-supporting, until the time the child completes the 12th grade or attains the age of 19 years, whichever occurs first\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 3901, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Second, nor does the existence of a prior dissolution decree granting Rodriquez custodial status necessarily define her subsequent support obligation. (See <em>County of Ventura v. George </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1012, 1016-1018 [197 Cal.Rptr. 245].) \u201c[A] parent\u2019s obligation to provide financial support for his or her children transcends certain technical interpretations of custody . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1018-1019.) Rather, the concept of custodial parenthood should be interpreted in the context within which it is considered; for example, courts considering support orders to recoup public assistance \u201clook beyond the form of the language contained in the decree of dissolution and instead focus [] on the actual relationship of financial support which existed between parent and child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1016 [rejecting reasoning in \u201ccases, as in the present litigation, [wherein] a parent sought to avoid his or her responsibility to provide support by hiding behind the provisions of a decree terminating the marriage\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Third, we also agree that the county is empowered by the Family Code to establish, as well as enforce, a child support order (Fam. Code, \u00a7 17400, subd. (a)), and it may do so \u201cif requested ... on behalf of a child who is <em>not </em>receiving public assistance, including Medi-Cal.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 17400, subd. (h)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\n<em>An Agreement Is Necessary for Enforcement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">But nothing in the statutes permitting the county to establish or enforce child support orders suggests that third party, nonparent family members such as the Andersens may enlist the local child support agency to prosecute an action to collect child support on their behalf. Rather, the statutes provide that an action to establish child support \u201cmay be prosecuted in the name of the county on behalf of the child, children, or a parent of the child or children\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 17404, subd. (a)), and that such an action to establish child support shall be taken by or on behalf of \u201c[t]he parent who has requested or is receiving support enforcement services\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 17404, subd. (a); see, e.g., Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17404, subds. (e)(4), (f)(1), (2), 17406, subd. (f)(1)(B)). The Andersens are not \u201cthe child, children, or a parent of the child or children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Indeed, an applicable Family Code section ignored by the parties shows the Legislature did not intend to assist nonparent family members in collecting child support, absent evidence of an express agreement for compensation by the parent. Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) states that \u201c[a] parent is not bound to compensate the other parent, <em>or a relative, </em>for the voluntary support of the parent\u2019s child, without an agreement for compensation.\u201d (Italics added.) This section, and its predecessor (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 208), have long been interpreted to deny compensation in intrafamily support arrangements of the type at issue here, unless the parties have an express agreement for support. For example, in <em>Crane v. Livingston </em>(1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 699 [220 P.2d 744], when a divorced mother who had been granted sole custody of her children became ill, her sister took custody of the children, and raised them to adulthood. The aunt sought to recover sums for their support from the father, but the court dismissed her complaint. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 700-703.) Notwithstanding the father\u2019s acknowledged general obligation to support his children, the court held that the statute barred the aunt\u2019s recovery of sums she voluntarily spent to support his children. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 701-702; see Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law (The Rutter Group 2004) <em>\u00b6 </em>6:42, p. 6-33 (rev. #1, 2007).)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In a petition for rehearing, the county argues that we should interpret the word \u201ccompensate\u201d in Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) narrowly, as referring to reimbursement for past expenses only, and hold that the statute \u201cdoes not prohibit the adjudication of a request for the establishment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number><em>prospective </em>child support order,\u201d such as the one at issue here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The county contends this construction of the statute is necessary because the statute applies not only to support provided by \u201ca relative,\u201d but also to support provided by \u201cthe other parent.\u201d In the county\u2019s view, if \u201cthe word \u2018compensate\u2019 in this statute\u201d is interpreted \u201cto prohibit a request to establish <em>prospective </em>child support,\u201d then \u201ca custodial parent voluntarily supporting that parent\u2019s child would not be able to establish a court order for <em>prospective </em>child support against the non-custodial parent without the non-custodial parent\u2019s agreement. Such an interpretation would effectively bar the local child support agencies from establishing an order for <em>prospective </em>child support against the non-custodial parent in the majority of their cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We are unpersuaded. If Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) were construed as barring only reimbursement for <em>past </em>support, the statute would be superfluous, because Family Code section 4009 already bars such reimbursement by limiting the retroactivity of child support orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, \u201cwe must strive to . . . avoid interpretations which render statutory language superfluous.\u201d <em>(Mundy v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1405 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 568].) Thus, the rules of statutory interpretation support the conclusion that the application of Family Code section 3951 does not depend on when the support was (or will be) provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Furthermore, the county\u2019s concern that our interpretation of the statute will \u201ceffectively bar the local child support agencies from establishing an order for <em>prospective </em>child support against the non-custodial parent in the majority of their cases\u201d is unwarranted. This is so because Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) applies only to \u201cvoluntary\u201d support. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>county\u2019s concern rests on the belief that a custodial parent who seeks an order for child support from the noncustodial parent\u2014whether in a paternity (or maternity) action or a marital dissolution proceeding\u2014must be treated as a parent seeking \u201ccompensation] ... for the voluntary support of the . . . child\u201d within the meaning of section 3951, subdivision (a). Not so. Under California law, \u201cthe father and mother of a minor child have an equal responsibility to support their child in the manner suitable to the child\u2019s circumstances.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3900.) Given that it is the legal duty of both parents to support their child, support provided by a custodial parent in actually housing, feeding, and caring for the child\u2014even in the absence of a court order\u2014cannot be deemed \u201cvoluntary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, when a custodial parent seeks a child support order against the noncustodial parent, the custodial parent is not seeking compensation for the \u201cvoluntary support\u201d of the child within the meaning of Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a). (See <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Houser </em>(N.D. 1999) 598 N.W.2d 193, 197-198 [holding that an identical statute did \u201cnot prohibit the parent from collecting, on the child\u2019s behalf, support money the other parent has a legal obligation to provide for the child\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Properly understood, then, Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) bars a parent or relative from seeking compensation from the other parent for \u201cvoluntary support\u201d of the child, absent an agreement for compensation, and this bar applies to prospective child support orders as well as to claims for reimbursement. The operative fact is not whether the support at issue was provided in the past or will be provided in the future, but whether the support at issue is (or will be) \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Where, as here, the parent or relative seeking compensation from the other parent has no legal duty to support the child, the support at issue is \u201cvoluntary\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Here, the trial court correctly found that the Andersens had no right to recover child support for Joshua from Rodriquez absent an agreement to that effect, and that there was no evidence of any such agreement. Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s implicit finding that, while the Andersens are not actually parties to the action, they nonetheless effectively initiated the enforcement action by \u201crequesting] the [county\u2019s] assistance in obtaining a judgment for Joshua\u2019s support against\u201d Rodriquez. Joshua was not receiving public assistance; only after Rodriquez indicated to the Andersens that she would no longer be able to contribute $165 per month to Joshua\u2019s support did the Andersens seek the county\u2019s assistance in bringing this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Moreover, substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that the Andersens had no agreement with Rodriquez regarding Joshua\u2019s support. There was testimony that Rodriquez, Joshua and the Andersens \u201cmutually agreed\u201d that Joshua would live with the Andersens until he finished high school in June 2007, but no evidence that this agreement involved any independent support from Rodriquez. Indeed, everyone agreed that when Rodriquez sent the Andersens $165 per month in addition to the support Joshua received from his father, she did so \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The county insists its action on behalf of the Andersens was justified by Family Code section 7641, subdivision (a), a provision of the Uniform Parentage Act (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7600 et seq.), which states that \u201cIf existence of the father and child relationship is declared, or paternity or a duty of support has been acknowledged or adjudicated under this part or under prior law, the obligation of the father may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by any of the following: [j[] (1) The mother. [][] (2) The child. [][] (3) The public authority that has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, confinement, education, support, or funeral. [][] (4) Any other person, including a private agency, to the extent the person has furnished or is furnishing these expenses.\u201d Insofar as practicable, the rules set forth in the Uniform Parentage Act (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7600 et seq.) pertaining to paternity actions apply equally to maternity actions. <em>(Amy G. v. M.W. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1, 10, 12-14 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 297] [presumptions of paternity largely inapplicable in case by father and father\u2019s wife against biological mother to establish that father\u2019s wife is in fact child\u2019s mother].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">And, by the plain language of subdivision (a) of Family Code section 7641, no support obligation can be enforced which has not \u201cbeen acknowledged or adjudicated under this part or under prior law.\u201d Neither part of that predicate is satisfied here. No support obligation has been \u201cacknowledged\u201d by Rodriquez because, as the trial court found, she never had any agreement with the Andersens to support Joshua while he lived with them. Nor can an obligation by Rodriquez to support Joshua while in the Andersens\u2019 care be \u201cadjudicated\u201d in their favor in this proceeding, because under Family Code section 3951, she cannot be bound to compensate relatives who have voluntarily provided support for the parent\u2019s child without an agreement for compensation, i.e., the Andersens, and no other order exists requiring Rodriquez to provide for Joshua\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this action represented an attempt by the Andersens to recover support from Rodriquez for Joshua, and that there was no agreement between Rodriquez and the Andersens for Joshua\u2019s support. It was not error to dismiss the complaint. (See <em>Crane v. Livingston, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.2d at pp. 702-703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The judgment is affirmed. Rodriquez shall receive her costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Sims, Acting P. J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 22, 2008, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\"> The county insists we are bound to grant its petition for rehearing under Government Code section 68081 because \u201c[s]ection 3951 was never raised as a defense by [Rodriquez] during trial, was not expressly cited nor discussed by the trial court in the ruling challenged on appeal, and was not proposed, argued, or briefed by either party on appeal.\u201d The county is mistaken. Government Code section 68081 applies only where a decision is \u201cbased upon <em>an issue </em>which was not proposed or briefed by any party to the proceeding.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68081, italics added.) The <em>issue </em>in this case was whether the trial court erred in ruling that Rodriquez was not obliged to pay child support to her brother and sister-in-law, and Family Code section 3951 is simply a statute that bears on that issue. Government Code section 68081 does not require us to give the parties the opportunity to brief every statute (or other authority) that we may apply in deciding the issues in their case, so long as the parties have had the opportunity to brief the issues themselves. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alice </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 668, 677 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 648, 161 P.3d 163] [\u201cSection 68081 does not require that a party actually have briefed an issue; it requires only that the party had the opportunity to do so.\u201d].) Accordingly, we address the county\u2019s argument regarding Family Code section 3951 by modifying our opinion but denying the petition for rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\"> \u201cAn original order for child support may be made retroactive to the date of filing the petition, complaint, or other initial pleading. If the parent ordered to pay support was not served with the petition, complaint, or other initial pleading within 90 days after filing and the court finds that the parent was not intentionally evading service, the child support order shall be effective no earlier than the date of service.\" (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4009.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\"> Given the general duty of both parents to support their child (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3900), it might be argued that support provided by a parent is never \u201cvoluntary.\u201d However, where a noncustodial parent has been ordered to pay a certain amount of child support and voluntarily chooses to pay more, the additional amount could rightfully be characterized as voluntary. In such a case, Family Code section 3951, subdivision (a) would bar the noncustodial parent from seeking compensation for the overpayments from the custodial parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
