The trial court ruled that due to the District Attorney\u2019s delay in the filing of the petition, the petition was untimely in that the trial could not be commenced at least 30 days prior to Tatum\u2019s release as required by statute. The court also found the District Attorney\u2019s nearly six-month delay in filing the petition was not excused by \u201cgood cause,\u201d and that the proffered explanation for the delay was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ccallous[],\u201d amounting to, at most, \u201cinexcusable negligence.\u201d The court further determined that were the petition allowed to go forward, it would necessitate trial well after Tatum\u2019s release date, requiring a significant extension of Tatum\u2019s involuntary commitment without statutory authorization. Balancing the justification for the delay against the resulting \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ruled that the delay in filing the petition violated Tatum\u2019s constitutional rights to due process, and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On appeal, the District Attorney contends that despite the untimely filing of the MDO petition, the absence of good cause for the delay and the resulting violation of the statute governing MDO commitment, the trial court \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d by dismissing the petition. As discussed below, we disagree and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">While we are, of course, cognizant of the public safety concerns arising from the release of potentially mentally ill offenders who have completed their sentences, we can find no legal flaw in the trial court\u2019s actions. The federal and state Constitutions, as well as California statutory law, require a certain bare minimum of due process before a person can be involuntarily committed to the custody of the state. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 91, 98 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 124, 164 P.3d 557] <em>{Allen).) </em>As the District Attorney\u2019s \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d in filing Tatum\u2019s MDO petition and subsequent delay in providing necessary discovery caused the proceedings in the instant case to fall below that minimum, the trial court acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority in dismissing the petition. Consequently, the trial court did not \u201cerr[] as a matter of law,\u201d and we have no authority to reverse its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We note, as our own Supreme Court has done in recently affirming the dismissal of an MDO petition, that due to the availability of other statutory avenues of involuntary commitment, such as the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS Act) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.), our ruling \u201cdoes not necessarily mean [Tatum] will be released.\u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 95.) \u201cBecause [Tatum] has been evaluated and treated only under the MDO Act up to this point, there has been no occasion to determine whether [he] would be subject to the requirements of the LPS Act. [Citation.] Thus, we underscore that our decision should not be construed as requiring [Tatum\u2019s] release if he is still in need of mental health treatment. Assuming he still requires such treatment, we presume that responsible parties will take appropriate steps to ensure [Tatum] receives custodial treatment, for as long as is necessary, under the LPS Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 108; see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">On February 7, 2007, the District Attorney filed a petition in superior court to commit Tatum as an MDO pursuant to Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 2970. The petition requested that the court appoint counsel for Tatum, that the appointed counsel \u201cprovide discovery\u201d to the District Attorney and that the court set a trial date. The petition stated that Tatum had a \u201csevere mental disorder\u201d and was committed to the state Department of Mental Health under section 2962 as a condition of his parole, where he was receiving \u201ccontinuous treatment.\u201d The petition also stated that Tatum\u2019s mental disorder was not in remission, and \u201cby reason of his severe mental disorder,\u201d Tatum \u201crepresents a substantial danger of physical harm to others.\u201d The petition noted that Tatum had a \u201cmaximum commitment date of March 12, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">After appointing a deputy public defender (Pamela King) to represent Tatum, the court held a hearing on the petition on February 9. Tatum was not present. At the hearing, King stated that the petition was untimely and by law Tatum had a \u201cright to begin trial today.\u201d King noted, however, that as she had just been appointed to the case, had no familiarity with Tatum, and had \u201creceived no discovery,\u201d she was not prepared for trial. She requested that the court calendar a motion to dismiss the petition and stated that her office would \u201cdo our best to prepare ... for trial\u201d before Tatum\u2019s \u201ccommitment expires.\u201d King also requested an order that Tatum be transported to the court for the next hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The deputy district attorney addressed the issue of discovery, stating that to avoid burdening the state hospital with two identical subpoenas (one from the defense and one from the prosecution), he would subpoena Tatum\u2019s mental health records \u201cinto the court.\u201d The deputy explained that the records would then be delivered directly to the court which would notify Tatum\u2019s counsel immediately upon receipt, giving the defense the first \u201copportunity to copy the records.\u201d The court then summarized the representation, reiterating that the District Attorney was \u201cgoing to subpoena all records from the different locations involving Mr. Tatum and make it available for the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The deputy district attorney also acknowledged that \u201c[t]ypically the cases are filed more timely,\u201d and that \u201cthe burden will be on the People to show why it is\u2014it may or may not have been timely.\u201d The court set a hearing date of February 23 \u201cfor motion to dismiss and possible trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">On February 15 Tatum filed a written motion to dismiss the petition. The motion stated that Tatum had served his sentence and had been paroled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Atascadero State Hospital, later being transferred to Patton State Hospital. The state Department of Mental Health had prepared a report declaring that Tatum met the criteria for recommitment under section 2970 on July 26, 2006\u2014199 days prior to Tatum\u2019s discharge date. The District Attorney failed to act on the report for almost six months, until February 7, 2007. Tatum contended that absent a showing of good cause, this delay required dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The District Attorney opposed the motion to dismiss, contending that without a showing of prejudice, the court was not required to evaluate the cause of any delay, and the petition could move forward. The District Attorney acknowledged that a report regarding Tatum\u2019s need for commitment had been mailed to the District Attorney\u2019s Office by the state Department of Mental Health on August 14, 2006. Nevertheless, the District Attorney\u2019s \u201cMDO staff became aware on February 7, 2007, that the filing in this matter was in issue\u201d and, after obtaining the paperwork by fax, filed the petition on that date. In an undated, supporting declaration, the assigned deputy district attorney, Diane Harrison, attested that the first time she recalled becoming aware of the case was on February 7, and she \u201cfiled the case as soon as she became aware of it.\u201d Harrison stated that the case had been entered on the \u201cMaster Calendar, kept only by the lead secretary,\u201d Barbara Stevens, as of August 29, but Harrison was \u201cunaware of where the case might have been since its arrival\u201d in August, \u201cand it is not possible to ask Barbara Stevens now, due to [a] severe medical condition.\u201d Stevens had not worked since January 10, and was in a coma, \u201cunable to speak or write.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The trial court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on February 26. Deputy Public Defender Don Wingfield appeared for Tatum who was, again, not present, and Harrison appeared for the People. At the hearing, the court found that due to the District Attorney\u2019s delayed filing of the petition, the parties \u201ccannot . . . begin trial\u201d as statutorily required\u201430 days prior to the expiration of Tatum\u2019s sentence. Consequently, the trial court ruled, the District Attorney needed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Harrison reiterated the explanation given in her declaration for the delay, adding that her office had never been able to find the original file for the Tatum case, but had relied instead on a second packet of materials rushed from Patton State Hospital to initiate the February court filing. The court then suggested that rather than a full evidentiary hearing, the parties could stipulate that the report from the hospital arrived at the District Attorney\u2019s Office before August 29, 2006, and through negligence, the petition was not filed until February 7, 2007. The parties agreed to the stipulation. The court stated that the District Attorney\u2019s Office \u201csimply dropped the ball,\u201d and \u201c[a]s soon as the ball materialized, they got on it.\u201d The court then ruled, \u201cI cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>find that there is no good cause,\u201d and \u201cbasically it\u2019s . . . simple negligence\u201d; so \u201cI find good cause\u201d for the failure to begin trial at least 30 days before Tatum\u2019s release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">With respect to scheduling trial, Tatum\u2019s counsel then informed the court that he had \u201cjust received\u201d 1,200 pages constituting the prison records relating to Tatum, but was still awaiting the mental health records from Tatum\u2019s commitment at Patton and Atascadero state hospitals. Counsel added that upon receipt of the hospital records, other records might need to be subpoenaed, and the defense would also need to index the records and have them (as well as Tatum) examined by an expert. The trial court set March 2 as the next possible trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">On March 2, Pamela King appeared representing Tatum, who was not present. King informed the court that the defense had still not received any hospital records and consequently could not proceed with trial. King also brought to the trial court\u2019s attention a recently published (and since depublished) case with analogous facts, <em>People v. Price </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 955 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 81], review granted June 13, 2007, S151207 <em>(Price)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d was not \u201cgood cause\u201d for a delay of commitment proceedings past an otherwise applicable release date. The trial judge reviewed the case and noted that it was distinguishable because she had made no finding of \u201cinexcusable negligence.\u201d Rather, the judge explained, she had found that \u201cthe person who can answer the court as to whether or not [the delay] was justifiable, unjustifiable\u201d or even explain \u201cwhat happened\u201d is \u201cin a coma.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge noted that <em>Price </em>appeared to be \u201cright on point,\u201d and that she would reconsider her previous ruling after receiving briefing from the parties. In addition, the judge set a date for trial (Mar. 12)\u2014the last day of Tatum\u2019s then lawful confinement\u2014on the assumption that the defense would receive the subpoenaed medical records by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On March 12, the trial court announced that after reconsidering its ruling regarding \u201cgood cause,\u201d it would not change it. The court explained that there \u201cwas negligence [on] the part of the District Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d but unlike <em>Price, </em>it was \u201cexcusable negligence,\u201d and the \u201creason it is . . . excusable is because we have someone who because of medical issues is not capable of testifying or preparing [a] declaration . . . due to medical issues,\u201d and so \u201cI cannot find that this was a horrific error or a horrific mistake or inexcusable negligence by the District Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Tatum\u2019s attorney, King, then explained that she was unable to proceed to trial because she had still not received Tatum\u2019s hospital records, there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>been no prior commitment hearing and her office had \u201cno history\u201d with Tatum. As a result, King contended, the trial would have to be delayed beyond Tatum\u2019s lawful commitment date and consequently, \u201cthere is clearly . . . actual prejudice.\u201d King argued that \u201c[a]ny minute of\u2019 unauthorized involuntary commitment was a violation of Tatum\u2019s right to due process, particularly as the cause for the delay was, at best, negligence on the part of the District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Deputy District Attorney Harrison stated that her office had received the hospital records the previous week, and she did not \u201cunderstand why\u201d the defense did not have them. Harrison stated the defense \u201cshould have copied them,\u201d and it was \u201cperplexing\u201d why they had not. King responded that despite the fact that her office \u201chas been checking in with the court to find when these records would come in,\u201d and that King herself had \u201cchecked again this morning to make sure that we haven\u2019t gotten these records in\u201d and had personally seen Harrison on Thursday (two days after Harrison said she received the records), King had not been notified of the receipt of Tatum\u2019s hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The court acknowledged King\u2019s frustration, and noted that \u201c[i]t is interesting\u201d that Harrison\u2019s declaration did not say, \u201cI never saw it [the Tatum file], I never touched it,\u201d but the court was \u201cheavily relying on Diane Harrison\u2019s declaration,\u201d and Harrison\u2019s status as \u201can officer of the court,\u201d in establishing that the delay was due to a \u201ccompassionate issue of an ill member of the office.\u201d The court then noted that Harrison\u2019s declaration\u2014\u201csigned by declarant on\u2014\u201d\u2014was not dated, causing defense counsel to assert that it was \u201cnot a valid declaration.\u201d The court agreed, noting as well that the declaration did not explicitly state where it was executed in California. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2015.5 [requiring sworn statements to be \u201ccertified or declared ... to be true under penalty of perjury\u201d and \u201cif executed within this state\u201d to \u201cstate[] the date and place of execution\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The court then inquired into the failure of the deputy district attorney to provide the hospital records to Tatum\u2019s counsel. Harrison stated that her office had received the records through a court subpoena the preceding Tuesday (six days prior), and had \u201ccopied the records sent over from Patton.\u201d Harrison acknowledged that \u201c[n]ormally they [the defense] get them first. This time we got them first.\u201d Harrison conceded that she had not provided the defense with a copy of the records or notified them of her office\u2019s possession of those records. After a short recess in which the court clerk confirmed that the court had never received the hospital records, Harrison explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>original records were picked up directly from Patton State Hospital by a member of her office and had subsequently remained at the District Attorney\u2019s Office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Based on the recent revelations, the trial court stated that it was going to \u201c[s]et aside\u201d the previous rulings regarding \u201cgood cause,\u201d and was requiring the deputy district attorney to submit a valid declaration that addressed both the \u201ccircumstances that lead to the late filing,\u201d as well as the delivery of hospital records subpoenaed to the court directly \u201cto one side\u201d (the District Attorney), which the court deemed \u201cimproper.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On April 13, Harrison filed a declaration, dated April 11, 2007, stating that while she \u201cstill ha[d] no specific memory of having this case assigned\u201d to her, she had located the \u201coriginal request for filing on the Tatum case\u201d during \u201ca third search of . . . her office filing cabinet.\u201d Harrison stated that the third search was distinguished from the preceding searches because she went \u201cthrough each page of documents stapled and/or held together with paper clips.\u201d In the new declaration, Harrison acknowledged she \u201capparently received the request for review and filing . . . from unit secretary, Barbara Stevens, around the date of August 23, 2006.\u201d Harrison noted that there was \u201cprinting on a sticky note on top of the request for review\u201d in her own handwriting, and she \u201cnow believe[d] that she had looked at the case only long enough to write down the number of the underlying criminal conviction.\u201d Harrison noted that this occurred \u201cright before leaving on a two-day vacation.\u201d Harrison speculated that she brought all her pending work with her and \u201cthe Tatum case was with that stack of work,\u201d inadvertently becoming paper-clipped to unrelated documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">On April 27, with Tatum present, the court held its final hearing on the motion to dismiss. At the hearing, Tatum\u2019s attorney, King, again emphasized that there was \u201cclear prejudice [whenever] you cannot commence trial before the parole expires,\u201d highlighting not only the filing delay, but also the fact that the District Attorney directly obtained the medical records regarding the case and held onto them \u201cfor over a week\u201d without notifying her. King argued that despite the court\u2019s earlier finding that the delay could not be explained because of Stevens\u2019s illness, \u201csubsequent declarations make it eminently clear that [the delay] had nothing to do with Barbara Stevens.\u201d King emphasized that the petition should be dismissed and \u201cif Mr. Tatum indeed represents a threat to public safety, there are other statutory schemes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>that can address that issue.\u201d In response, Harrison conceded that an \u201cunfortunate comedy of errors\u201d had led to the motion to dismiss \u201cwith mistakes being made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The court agreed, stating that it would \u201celevate\u201d the characterization of the process \u201cfrom comedy of errors to outrageous errors, to callousness.\u201d The court noted that it was \u201coutraged\u201d by Harrison\u2019s latest declaration, which \u201csays my first and second search did not involve unstapling and taking clips off the pad, oops, of papers. So my third search when I unstapled I found the real reason. In other words, the party submits declarations to the court speculating reasons for delay without even unstapling groups of paper to see whether or not actually the notice was there. That is callousness. That\u2019s outrageous.\u201d The court stated it was also dissatisfied with the District Attorney\u2019s explanation regarding the hospital records: \u201c[T]hey send me a declaration stating\u201d the District Attorney sent someone \u201cto Patton to pick up the paperwork because I knew everybody is in a rush. I got it. I asked them to copy it. Two weeks later or ten days later, I see them on my desk.\u201d The court summarized: \u201cIt really is very callous for the District Attorney\u2019s office not to file on time, then file late, then file declarations stating in it basically untrue, not intentionally, but non-existent reasons for delay, not signing it, not dating it or signing it not under penalty of perjury and then later come and say I unclip[ped] papers and I found the real reason and here is the real reason. It puts the Court in ... a position ... of balancing the safety of the community and the due process [rights] of the defendant.\u201d The court then took the matter under submission, issuing a written ruling on May 2 granting the motion to dismiss. The ruling states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201c[Petitioner filed three separate sets of declarations setting forth under penalty of pequry different reasons for delay in the filing of the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cThe first two sets ... set forth good cause for delay due to a serious medical condition of the person in charge of handling the assignment and the management of the caseload. According to the declarations submitted, this individual was unavailable and unable to provide testimony or prepare a declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201cUnder these circumstances the court found that the unavailability of this witness made it impossible to determine what has happened and what the actual cause of the delay was. . . . [f] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">\u201cAt the conclusion of th[e] second hearing it came to the court\u2019s attention that the declarations submitted by the Petitioner were replete with deficiencies [necessitating a third hearing.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\u201c. . . Petitioner submitted a third set of declarations contradicting previous declarations and asserting that the delay in filing was caused by misfiling of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the case by the deputy in charge of the case. In other words, the medical conditions of the person in charge of the office [case] management no longer were the reason for inability to determine the actual cause of delay. This time the declaration by the deputy DA clearly explained that the cause for delay was her mishandling of the file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cAccepting the third set of declarations, and following the reasoning and holding of <em>People v. Price, . . . </em>this court. . . concludes that there is no need to determine whether the long delay in filing the petition to extend triggers a presumption of prejudice, because the respondent has clearly shown actual prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The court then quoted the following discussion from <em>Price-. </em>\u201c \u2018Against this demonstration of prejudice we must weigh the justification offered for the delay. The only justification offered\u2014an unexplained failure of the district attorney\u2019s office to respond to [the hospital\u2019s] paperwork, resulting in what the trial court characterized as a \u201chuge clerical error\u201d\u2014at best represents a type of inexcusable negligence. Inexcusable negligence will not justify a delay in filing. [Citation.] [|] Weighing the clear prejudice appellant experienced against the inadequate justification provided, we conclude appellant\u2019s due process rights were violated by the lengthy delay in the filing of the petition to extend.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">On appeal, the District Attorney contends that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition. We evaluate this contention after setting forth the applicable statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">A. <em>MDO Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u201c[S]tates must ensure due process protections and safeguard liberty interests when a person is civilly committed.\u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 98, citing <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 418 [60 L.Ed.2d 323, 99 S.Ct. 1804].) This is because \u201c \u2018[c]ivil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Allen, </em>at p. 98; <em>Zinermon </em>v. <em>Burch </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 113, 131 [108 L.Ed.2d 100, 110 S.Ct. 975] [noting that \u201c[p]etitioners do not seriously dispute that there is a substantial liberty interest in avoiding confinement in a mental hospital,\u201d and citing cases].) Thus, while \u201c \u2018 \u201c[s]tates have in certain narrow circumstances provided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable to control their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to the public health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>safety,\u201d \u2019 \u201d these \u201c \u2018 \u201cinvoluntary commitment statutes\u201d \u2019 \u201d will only be upheld by the courts against constitutional challenge where \u201c \u201cthe confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Allen, </em>at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Against the backdrop of these due process requirements, the Legislature has enacted a statutory framework, the Mentally Disordered Offenders Act (MDO Act), codified in section 2960 et seq., which allows civil commitment of certain criminal offenders as a condition of parole, as well as after the expiration of the parole period. (\u00a7\u00a7 2962 [listing qualifying offenses], 2964, subd. (a); see <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 99.) To authorize involuntary commitment under the MDO Act, the state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the prospective parolee has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment; (b) the mental disorder was one of the causes of, or was an aggravating factor in, the commission of his or her crime; (c) the prospective parolee has been in treatment for 90 days or more within the year prior to his or her parole release day; and (d) the prospective parolee has been certified by a designated mental health professional to represent a substantial danger of physical harm to others by reason of his or her severe mental disorder.

The statutory requirement in section 2972, subdivision (a), however, constitutes an implicit requirement that the District Attorney file the petition sufficiently in advance of an offender\u2019s release date to allow trial <em>reasonably </em>to commence 30 days prior to his or her release. If the District Attorney fails to do so, the petition may be deemed untimely, requiring either a waiver by the offender, or a finding of good cause to excuse its untimely filing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A trial court\u2019s finding of \u201cgood cause,\u201d if any, is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Kirkland </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 891, 909 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 863] <em>(Kirkland); Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 128, fn. 7, 133 [stating that \u201cfindings regarding good cause are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion\u201d and applying abuse of discretion standard].) If there is no abuse of discretion, the \u201cgood cause\u201d finding stands and there is no statutory violation. <em>(Kirkland, </em>at pp. 913, 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Even if a statutory violation has occurred, proceedings on the petition may still move forward. This is because, apart from the requirement that a petition be <em>filed </em>prior to the offender\u2019s release date (\u00a7 2972, subd. (e)), the statutory time limits contained in the MDO Act are not \u201cmandatory\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d but \u201cdirectory.\u201d <em>(People v.

Consequently, even if an MDO trial occurs in violation of the MDO Act\u2019s directory time requirements, the commitment proceeding is not rendered invalid absent a due process violation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 936, 943 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 163] <em>(Mitchell) </em>[disagreeing with contention under analogous statute that \u201cthe trial court must automatically dismiss a tardy section 1026.5 petition if the prosecution cannot demonstrate good cause to excuse the violation of the statutory deadlines\u201d]; <em>Williams, </em>at p. 457 [holding that the MDO Act\u2019s time limits are not jurisdictional, and thus can be waived, but recognizing that delay in trial regarding commitment implicates \u201ca defendant\u2019s rights to liberty and procedural due process\u201d].) Similarly, even when the statutory guidelines are complied with, it is still possible that a due process violation has occurred rendering the proceedings invalid. (See, e.g., <em>Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 135 [reviewing for due process violation despite trial court\u2019s valid finding of good cause for delay past 30-day statutory requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The determination of whether the delayed filing of an MDO petition constitutes a due process violation requires consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and a subsequent \u201cbalancing of any prejudicial effect of the delay against the justification for the delay.\u201d <em>(Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 131; see <em>Kirkland, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 910 [recognizing that \u201c[d]elay beyond th[e statutory] deadlines is judged using \u2018[t]he due process test utilized under both federal and state speedy trial decisions[, which] involves a balancing of any prejudicial effect of the delay against the justification for delay\u2019 \u201d]; cf. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 105 [explaining that \u201c \u2018the test\u2019 \u201d for determining whether a due process violation has occurred requires that \u201c \u2018any prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay must be weighed against justification for the delay\u2019 \u201d].) Where there is no prejudice, there is no due process violation, regardless of the reasons (or lack thereof) for the delay. <em>(Fernandez, </em>at p. 131 [\u201cIf the defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice, the court need not consider the reasons for the delay.\u201d]; <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 946.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">C. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding a Statutory Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In the instant case, the first question we must resolve is whether the trial court erred in finding a statutory violation\u2014i.e., a lack of \u201cgood cause\u201d for the District Attorney\u2019s delay in filing Tatum\u2019s MDO petition. Rather than take on this question directly, the District Attorney perplexingly asserts that \u201cthe trial court on several occasions found good cause for not commencing the trial date at least 30 days prior to [Tatum\u2019s] parole release,\u201d and contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>these findings undermine the trial court\u2019s ultimate dismissal of the petition. The record refutes this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">It is true that the trial court <em>tentatively </em>found good cause for the District Attorney\u2019s delay in filing the MDO petition at the first and second hearings on Tatum\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court\u2019s conclusion was based, however, on the facts presented to it during those initial hearings which, the court later determined, were inaccurate. At the conclusion of the second hearing, when the court realized that the deputy district attorney\u2019s declaration setting forth the facts supporting the trial court\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d finding was invalid, the court explicitly \u201c[s]et aside all [its] rulings\u201d so that it could reconsider \u201cthe issues of cause and due process\u201d at the final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">At the third hearing on Tatum\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court implicitly, but unmistakably, found that there was <em>not </em>good cause for the delay. The court\u2019s written ruling stated that the \u201cfirst two sets\u201d of declarations \u201cset forth good cause for delay due to a serious medical condition of the person in charge of handling the assignment.\u201d The court stated that the proffered explanation changed in the final declaration, which showed that \u201cthe medical conditions of the person in charge of the office [case] management no longer were the reason for inability to determine the actual cause of delay,\u201d but instead \u201cthe cause for delay was- [Harrison\u2019s] mishandling of the file.\u201d The trial court, quoting <em>Price, </em>labeled this explanation for the delay \u201c \u2018an unexplained failure of the district attorney\u2019s office to respond to [the hospital\u2019s] paperwork\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018 \u201chuge clerical error\u201d \u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018at best represents a type of inexcusable negligence.\u2019 \u201d Again quoting <em>Price, </em>the court stated \u201c \u2018[inexcusable negligence will not justify a delay in filing.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 943 [recognizing that \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d did not constitute good cause for delay of involuntary commitment proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In light of both its written ruling and oral comments at the final hearing, then, it is clear that the trial court (considering both the six-month delay in filing the petition as well as the delay in providing Tatum\u2019s hospital records to the defense) found no \u201cgood cause\u201d for the District Attorney\u2019s delay. In addition, as we will discuss further in the next section, we can find no fault, and certainly no abuse of discretion, in the trial court\u2019s conclusion. (See <em>Kirkland, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 909 [good cause finding reviewed under \u201cdeferential \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard\u201d]; <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 943 [recognizing that \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d for \u201ctardy filing ran afoul of . . . the statut[e]\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1060 [185 Cal.Rptr. 64] <em>(Hill) </em>[\u201cconfining authorities negligent performance of their duties\u201d was not good cause for delay].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>D. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Due Process Analysis Was Not Erroneous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The District Attorney further contends that even assuming there was no good cause for the delay, the trial court still erred by dismissing the petition. The District Attorney argues that there is nothing \u201cin the statute or case law on the MDO Act to suggest that the absence of a showing of good cause warrants the draconian measure of dismissal.\u201d In essence, the District Attorney contends, dismissal of an MDO Act petition is <em>never </em>permitted regardless of the circumstances of the case, so long as the committed individual is provided sufficient time (while in continued custody) to prepare a defense to the commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The District Attorney\u2019s contention is initially rebutted by the language of section 2972. While concededly not jurisdictional, the statute unambiguously states that an MDO trial <em>\u201cshall </em>commence no later than 30 calendar days prior to the time the person would otherwise have been released, unless the time is waived by the person or unless good cause is shown.\u201d (\u00a7 2972, subd. (a), italics added.) It would be inconsistent with our role in interpreting statutory language to conclude that the Legislature explicitly required a finding of \u201cgood cause\u201d or waiver, but intended that there could <em>never </em>be any consequence (i.e., dismissal) for the absence of \u201cgood cause\u201d or waiver. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Reno v. Baird </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 658 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333] [\u201c \u2018[c]ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible, and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage\u2019 \u201d].)  We recognize, as the District Attorney repeatedly contends, that the overriding purpose of the MDO Act is not to protect the rights of the civilly committed individual, but rather to protect the public. The MDO Act, however, also contains an unmistakable intent to accomplish its purpose without occasioning any deprivation of due process of law. Thus, as our Supreme Court has emphasized, \u201cthe MDO Act\u2019s comprehensive statutory scheme . . . represents a delicate balancing of countervailing public and individual interests\u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 98), and while dismissal might be inconsistent with the purposes of the MDO Act in some circumstances, in other cases, it will be perfectly consistent with the MDO Act\u2019s \u201cdelicate balancing\u201d of individual and public interests. <em>(Allen, </em>at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The District Attorney\u2019s contention is also belied by the numerous cases that either affirm or require <em>dismissals </em>of untimely involuntary commitment petitions under the MDO Act and analogous statutory frameworks. (See, e.g., <em>Zachary v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1037 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 532] <em>(Zachary) </em>[issuing peremptory writ of mandate directing superior court to \u201center a new order granting petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss\u201d MDO petition]; <em>Hill, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 1060 [reversing trial court\u2019s denial of motion to dismiss petition for commitment]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1983) 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Cal.App.3d 984, 987 [189 Cal.Rptr. 126] (Hawkins) [affirming trial court\u2019s dismissal of late-filed petition].) Even those cases that have ultimately ruled in favor of sustaining an MDO petition are premised on an assumption that dismissal, while not <em>required, </em>was also not legally <em>foreclosed. (Williams, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 461 [holding that offender waived claim that petition should have been dismissed by \u201cnot making a proper objection and <em>motion to dismiss </em>before trial\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 943 [disagreeing with contention that trial court \u201cmust <em>automatically </em>dismiss a tardy\u201d commitment petition in the absence of waiver or good cause (italics added)].) Thus, there is simply no basis in the MDO Act or case law for the District Attorney\u2019s contention that the trial court was prohibited \u201cas a matter of law\u201d from dismissing the MDO Act petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It is equally clear, however, that because a violation of the 30-day deadline does not <em>mandate </em>dismissal <em>(Williams, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 457), the trial court, in any case in which good cause is lacking, should not \u201cautomatically\u201d dismiss an MDO petition, but must evaluate whether dismissal is warranted under the circumstances of the case. (See, e.g., <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 943.) Consequently, the question before us is whether the trial court was permitted to dismiss the petition <em>on the facts and circumstances of the instant case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Analyzing the trial court\u2019s determination that the circumstances of the instant case warranted reversal, we find no error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To reach this conclusion, we must first set forth what we believe to be the proper legal framework for analysis of a motion to dismiss in this context because, as the trial court noted, the case law is unsettled in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Consistent with the large body of case law that has developed over the preceding decades, a trial court faced with the question of whether to dismiss a late-filed MDO petition must evaluate the circumstances of the delay and the implications of continuing with trial under a due process rubric. This analysis, which merges to some extent the statutory requirement of \u201cgood cause\u201d and the constitutional mandate of due process, properly recognizes that the MDO Act itself \u201caccommodates procedural due process by requiring the filing of the commitment petition prior to the expiration of the commitment, and requiring trial to commence 30 days prior to expiration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>order to ensure that trial is completed prior to expiration of the commitment.\u201d <em>(Zachary, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">As we have already noted, due process in this context requires a flexible balancing of \u201cany prejudicial effect of the delay against the justification for the delay.\u201d <em>(Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 131 [\u201cIf the defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice, the court need not consider the reasons for the delay.\u201d]; see <em>Kirkland, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 910, 915-916 [noting that MDO due process analysis looks to analogous law under \u201c \u2018federal and state speedy trial decisions,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cemphasizing] that given defendant\u2019s failure to show prejudice, only a minimal showing of prosecutorial diligence was necessary to establish good cause\u201d]; cf. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 514, 530 [33 L.Ed.2d 101, 92 S.Ct. 2182] (Barker) [recognizing \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\u201d as factors to be considered in determining whether dismissal is required for speedy trial violation].) The constitutional inquiry into the \u201cjustification for the delay\u201d necessarily overlaps with the statutory inquiry into \u201cgood cause.\u201d If good cause exists, it is less likely that there will be a due process violation; where good cause is lacking, as in the instant case, a violation is likely if sufficient prejudice is present. In addition, the \u201c[l]ength of delay\u201d will be a relevant factor in evaluating any proffered justification. <em>(Barker, </em>at p. 530.) For example, negligence may be sufficient cause to excuse a minor delay, but becomes less compelling as a justification for an extensive delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">With respect to prejudice, in the context of untimely MDO petitions, the courts have recognized that relevant prejudice will generally take one of two forms: (i) an inability to prepare for trial in the time remaining prior to the offender\u2019s release date (see, e.g., <em>Kirkland, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 917), or (ii) the involuntary confinement of an offender beyond the offender\u2019s statutorily authorized release date. (See, e.g., <em>Zachary, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1036.) Indeed, when an MDO petition is filed just prior to an offender\u2019s release date, the offender is often forced to choose between these two types of prejudice. Either the offender must curtail otherwise necessary trial preparation to ensure a \u201cpreexpiration trial\u201d <em>(Zachary, </em>at p. 1036) or agree to a continuance of the trial date beyond the release date, thus suffering unauthorized postrelease confinement. Synthesizing what has generally been implied in the case law to date, we glean from the case law and statutory authorities that whenever the state\u2019s unexcused late filing of an MDO petition forces an offender to \u201cchoose\u201d between these two types of prejudice, <em>some </em>prejudice is necessarily established. (See <em>Hill, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 1060 [dismissal of involuntary commitment petition required where \u201cit was realistically quite impossible in the brief time that remained\u201d prior to expiration of commitment \u201cto bring this matter to even the most hurried conclusion with any semblance of due process\u201d]; <em>Zachary, </em>at p. 1036 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>[\u201cPetitioner . . . has suffered prejudice, i.e., 24 days of unauthorized confinement in a state mental hospital prior to the filing of the petition for recommitment, followed by continued unauthorized confinement to date.\u201d];<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Dougherty </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 245, 248 [191 Cal.Rptr. 668] [prejudice established where trial preparation was impeded by necessity of conducting trial prior to release date]; <em>Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 133 [rejecting claim of prejudice because \u201cextension of the trial beyond defendant\u2019s scheduled release date was due to his own counsel\u2019s requested continuances, not to the People\u2019s failure to comply with any statutory deadlines\u201d].) This conclusion is consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Allen, </em>evaluating a late-filed petition under section 2972, subdivision (e), that when a delay in filing a commitment petition results in a violation of the MDO Act\u2019s procedural requirements, the delay \u201cmay be deemed prejudicial,\u201d even if recommitment would have been authorized had the petition been timely filed. <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 105 [voiding commitment after untimely filing of petition under \u00a7 2972, subd. (e), and stating that where the MDO \u201cwas denied his <em>annual </em>review under the MDO Act\u201d (i.e., a review of commitment status pursuant to the requirements of the MDO statute), the resulting delay \u201cmay be deemed prejudicial\u201d (italics added)].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The <em>degree </em>of prejudice will depend on various factors such as the time required to properly mount a defense (e.g., generally a more significant time period for an initial MDO commitment, as here, than in subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>yearly reviews), and the requisite length of the delay that will be occasioned by the untimely filing. (Cf. <em>Barker, supra, </em>407 U.S. at p. 530.) Whether this prejudice will be sufficient to warrant dismissal of an MDO petition in a particular case depends, of course, on the severity of prejudice and, on the other side of the due process balance, the justification for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling in the instant case is perfectly consistent with the legal principles we have summarized above. The trial court found that there was no good cause for the delay (i.e., the \u201cjustification for the delay\u201d was minimal), a conclusion whose factual basis is unchallenged by the District Attorney on appeal. The delay at issue was extensive\u2014almost six months\u2014 and the proffered justification trivial: the assigned deputy district attorney \u201cmishandl[ed] ... the file.\u201d Finally, the District Attorney exacerbated the delay of the proceedings, also without justification, through its unorthodox redirection of Tatum\u2019s hospital records at a time when each additional day of delay necessitated an additional day of Tatum\u2019s pretrial confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">It is also significant that, contrary to the District Attorney\u2019s contentions, neither Tatum and his counsel, nor the trial court can be faulted in any respect for the failure to bring the case to trial in the time remaining in Tatum\u2019s parole period, or even soon thereafter. <em>(Fernandez, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 133 [rejecting claim of prejudice based on 12-day postrelease date delay because the \u201cextension of the trial beyond defendant\u2019s scheduled release date was. due to his own counsel\u2019s requested continuances, not to the People\u2019s failure to comply with any statutory deadlines\u201d].) A review of the record reveals that there were only two factors responsible for the failure to commence trial prior to Tatum\u2019s release date: (i) the District Attorney\u2019s nearly six-month delay in filing the petition, and (ii) the District Attorney\u2019s failure to notify Tatum\u2019s counsel of its redirection of the subpoenaed hospital records, and failure to provide those records to Tatum\u2019s counsel. In these circumstances, where the blame for an extensive delay necessitating a postrelease trial rests entirely with the state, the \u201cjustification for the delay\u201d is particularly uncompelling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>With respect to prejudice, the trial court properly recognized that the District Attorney\u2019s almost six-month delay in filing the MDO petition (and subsequent dilatory actions) would necessitate a significant period of postrelease date, pretrial confinement, and thus, there was \u201cclearly . . . actual prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The prejudice in the instant case was particularly severe, as measured by the length of the unauthorized commitment (the time period between Tatum\u2019s release date and the likely commencement of a trial to determine the lawfulness of postrelease confinement), because the MDO trial would constitute Tatum\u2019s first contested commitment proceeding, King had never represented Tatum before, and the District Attorney had delayed the production of necessary discovery (consisting of 2,500 pages of hospital records) <em>until the release date itself. </em>(See <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 946 [highlighting fact that defense counsel \u201chad represented appellant before\u201d in finding no due process violation due to late filed petition].)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At oral argument, the District Attorney highlighted a recent decision by our colleagues in Division Two that suggested (albeit in a slightly different context) that due process is never implicated when an MDO trial is delayed past the offender\u2019s release date, because (analogizing to the preliminary hearing in a criminal prosecution) there has been\u2014at the time that the prisoner is initially committed as a condition of parole\u2014a preliminary finding by the state\u2019s psychiatrists that the defendant is an MDO, leaving the only question remaining for trial; whether the defendant is <em>still </em>an MDO after receiving treatment throughout the parole period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find this argument far too sweeping, however, as it implicitly invalidates decades of California case law (discussed above), and renders meaningless the provisions of the MDO Act intended to protect the offender\u2019s liberty interests (e.g., right to a jury trial). Indeed, if this contention were valid, an offender\u2019s trial need not \u201ccommence no later than 30 calendar days prior to the time the person would otherwise have been released\u201d (\u00a7 2972, subd. (a)), but can instead be held whenever the state desires, regardless of the reasons for any delay or resulting prejudice, because the <em>state\u2019s psychiatrists </em>have already resolved (much of) the issue. (Cf. <em>Zachary, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1036 [rejecting contention that \u201ca presumption of continued dangerousness is effected by the district attorney\u2019s mere filing of a petition for commitment under the MDPA\u201d; \u201c[t]o the contrary, the MDPA requires the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the committed person continues to pose a substantial danger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>physical harm to others\u201d]; see also <em>People v. Gibson </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1425, 1436 [252 Cal.Rptr. 56] [invalidating previous \u201cMDO commitment scheme\u201d as unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because it \u201ccontains one critical and significant difference from all the other[] [commitment schemes]; it does not require proof of any present dangerousness as a result of mental illness for commitment or recommitment\u201d].) In fact, the weakness of the District Attorney\u2019s contention (essentially relying on state psychiatrists to fill the statutory and constitutional role of trial courts) is particularly apparent in the instant case where there appears to be a substantial <em>legal </em>question as to whether Tatum\u2019s underlying \u201ccontrolling\u201d offense (i.e., the offense for which he was on parole)\u2014\u201cgassing\u201d (\u00a7 4501.1, subds. (a), (b))\u2014is a qualifying offense under the MDO Act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a question that a psychiatrist (unlike a trial court) is ill-suited to resolve. Finally, this contention ignores the Legislature\u2019s decree that even if a person is deemed an MDO under the statute, the courts are still called upon to determine whether outpatient treatment is a safe and effective alternative to inpatient commitment, in which case such outpatient treatment (i.e., release from state custody) is mandated. (\u00a7 2972, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In sum, given the circumstances of this case, the justification for the delay did not outweigh the resulting prejudice, and thus there was a due process violation requiring dismissal of the petition. (See, e.g., <em>Hill, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 1060 [delay in filing of petition under analogous statute due solely to \u201cnegligen[ce]\u201d required dismissal of involuntary commitment petition because \u201cit was realistically quite impossible in the brief time that remained to bring this matter to even the most hurried conclusion with any semblance of due process\u201d]; <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 987 [affirming trial court\u2019s dismissal of late-filed petition for extended involuntary confinement where good cause not shown].) Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>It should go without saying that regardless of the strength (or weakness) of the underlying case for Tatum\u2019s involuntarily commitment, that commitment must be accomplished through the procedures set forth by our Legislature and consistent with the due process rights vested in every citizen by the federal and state Constitutions. <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 98; <em>Hill, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1060-1061 [\u201cOur belief in the concept of judicial restraint, and our deference to the powers granted our coequal governmental partners, cannot be limited to those instances where, after viewing the fruits of their labors, we find them good.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We emphasize that where, as here, the District Attorney fails to act in a sufficiently timely manner to enable an involuntary commitment under the MDO Act, the Legislature has enacted other statutory schemes that allow involuntary commitment outside of the parole context, such as the LPS Act, that may apply if Tatum \u201cis a danger to others, or to himself.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5150; <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 105 [highlighting that \u201c[o]ur decision . . . will not necessarily result in Allen\u2019s release\u201d because \u201c[although Allen does not fall under the jurisdiction of the MDO Act, we agree with the Court of Appeal majority that Allen might still be involuntarily committed and treated under the LPS Act\u201d]; <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 560, 565 [196 Cal.Rptr. 31] [same]; <em>Hill, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1060-1061 [same].) Beginning with a 72-hour detention for evaluation and treatment, the LPS Act contains a \u201c \u2018carefully calibrated series of temporary detentions for evaluation and treatment\u2019 \u201d that can ultimately lead to renewable one-year commitments, similar to those permitted under the MDO Act. <em>(Allen, </em>at p. 107.) Thus, we again underscore \u201cthat our decision should not be construed as requiring [Tatum\u2019s] release if he is still in need of mental health treatment. Assuming he still requires such treatment, we presume that responsible parties will take appropriate steps to ensure [Tatum] receives custodial treatment, for as long as is necessary, under the LPS Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 108; Welf. &amp; Inst.

As we will explain, a determination that a petition is untimely, however, does not, by itself, warrant dismissal of the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> Our review of this question\u2014essentially the trial court\u2019s application of constitutional law to undisputed facts\u2014is de novo.

Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183] does not contradict <em>Zachary </em>on this point. <em>Frye </em>is an example of the inherent conflict between the \u201cdefendant\u2019s desire to invoke the right to speedy trial\u201d and \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s request for a continuance,\u201d with the defendant ultimately \u201cexpressly consenting] to [the] continuance.\u201d <em>(Frye, </em>at p. 939.) The high court acknowledged that the defendant may have felt obligated to consent to the delay requested by his counsel, but held that \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, we cannot conclude there was any conflict at all between defendant\u2019s right to speedy tried and his right to competent counsel\u201d because \u201c[s]ome rights are mutually exclusive\u201d and \u201chard choices are not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 939, 940 [illustrating concept of \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d rights by stating that \u201ca criminal defendant has a right to remain silent and a right to testify on his own behalf\u2019 but \u201ccannot do both\u201d].) The appropriate analogue to <em>Frye </em>in this context would be a case where the district attorney timely filed its petition, but the <em>offender\u2019s counsel </em>nevertheless requested a continuance (with the offender\u2019s consent) necessitating trial after the offender\u2019s release date. Here (as in <em>Zachary), </em>however, the necessary sacrifice of Tatum\u2019s rights (Tatum could have either a prerelease trial or adequate representation, but not both) was a direct result of <em>the state\u2019s </em>unexcused untimely filing of the MDO petition and later delay in the production of Tatum\u2019s hospital records, <em>not </em>any inherent conflict between \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d rights. <em>(Frye, </em>at p. 940.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> This conclusion requires us to reject the District Attorney\u2019s suggestion that any analysis of prejudice requires the trial court to defer ruling on a motion to dismiss until after trial. <em>(Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 105 [rejecting contention that offender did not suffer prejudice because he would have been committed regardless of delay, and stating that the fact that he \u201cwas denied his annual review under the MDO Act. . . may be deemed prejudicial\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> We do not believe that the fact that \u201c[t]he district attorney always stood ready to proceed to trial,\u201d is of any significance in this case because the defense could not reasonably have proceeded to trial without Tatum\u2019s state hospital records\u2014the documentary record upon which the MDO proceeding was based.
