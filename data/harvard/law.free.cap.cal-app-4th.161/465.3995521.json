Noelle Claeyssens Burkey, executor of the estate of Pierre P. Claeyssens, appeals from an order denying her petition to refund a $74,411.52 fee imposed pursuant to Government Code former sections 26827 and 68087. To the extent that these statutes authorize the fee, they were enacted in violation of the state Constitution and are of no force or effect. Proposition 6 (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 13301), coupled with the California Constitution (art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (c)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>provide that the Legislature alone may not impose an estate or inheritance tax. We are compelled to reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Pierre P. Claeyssens died testate in 2003, naming appellant as the estate executor. Appellant filed a petition to probate the will and for letters testamentary a week later, and paid (under protest) a $29,197 filing fee based on the estate\u2019s $15 million estimated value. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 26827.) Over the next three years, appellant filed accountings and requested that the probate court review inventories and appraisals on 12 different portions of the estate, including some mineral rights that exceed $20 million in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In 2007, appellant filed a fourth and final account and report which included a request for $240,172.60 in attorney fees and $240,172.60 in executor fees. In order to close the probate, appellant had to pay an additional $45,445.52 and surcharges based on the estate\u2019s adjusted appraised value: $35,657,055.85. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 26827, 68087; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.552(c).) The total filing fee with surcharges was $74,642.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Appellant paid under protest and petitioned for a refund, claiming that the total should be $231. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.552.) The trial court approved the fourth and final account and approved the petition for settlement and final distribution. It denied the petition to refund the filing fee and surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>Abolition of California Inheritance Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u201cAs a general rule, there is no estate tax in California. This policy is set forth in Revenue and Taxation Code section 13301, which provides, \u2018Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state, shall impose any gift, inheritance, succession, legacy, income, or estate tax ... on the estate or inheritance of any person ... by reason of any transfer occurring by reason of a death.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoffman </em>v. <em>Connell </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1197 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 272], fn. omitted.) This statute was added by initiative on June 8, 1982, as Proposition 6. (See <em>Estate of Cirone </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 199, 203 [200 Cal.Rptr. 511].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Revenue and Taxation Code section 13302, however, provides for a state \u201cpickup\u201d tax. The interaction between section 13302 and the federal tax law (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011(a)) works as follows: California \u201cpicks up\u201d an estate tax equal to the credit that the federal tax law allows. <em>(Hoffman v. Connell, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1198.) Because the pickup tax does not place a tax burden on the estate over and above that imposed by the federal estate tax, it is not considered an estate tax. (See <em>Estate of Fasken </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 412, 420-421 [138 Cal.Rptr. 276, 563 P.2d 832]; 9 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Taxation \u00a7 328, pp. 473-474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Here the estate paid a $775,817 California \u201cpickup\u201d tax. It also paid $6,192 million in federal estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>\u201cTransparent Evasion\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Appellant asserts that the $74,411.52 fee is a tax in contravention of Proposition 6. This fee far exceeds typical civil filing fees, which are fixed and generally less than $500. Unlike other fees, a graduated fee is based on the appraised value of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In <em>Fatjo </em>v. <em>Pfister </em>(1897) 117 Cal. 83 [48 P. 1012], our Supreme Court held that an act to impose a graduated fee based on the inventory value of a probate estate was an invalid ad valorem tax. The court stated that the label used to identify the fee was not dispositive. \u201cIt is perfectly plain that the legislature has attempted ... to levy a property tax upon all estates of decedents, infants, and incompetents. The <em>ad valorem </em>charge for filing the inventory is in no sense a fee, or compensation for the services of the [court] officer, which are the same, as respects this matter, in every estate, large or small. To call it a fee is a transparent evasion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 85-86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The Attorney General points out <em>Fatjo v. Pfister, supra, </em>117 Cal. 83, was decided long before the advent of court user fees. Proposition 6, however, provides that: \u201cNeither the state nor any political subdivision of the state shall impose any gift, inheritance, succession, legacy, income, or estate tax, <em>or any other tax, </em>on gifts or on the estate or inheritance of any person or on or by reason of any transfer occurring by reason of a death.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 13301, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>One might argue that \u201cor any other tax\u201d is limited in scope and refers to the enumerated taxes that precede the phrase (see <em>White v. County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 681 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191] [discussing last antecedent rule of statutory construction]), but the voters clearly had more in mind. (See <em>Professional Engineers in California Government v. Kempton </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 1016, 1040 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 814, 155 P.3d 226] [ballot summaries and arguments may be considered in determining voters\u2019 intent].) The ballot arguments in favor of Proposition 6 state that \u201cProposition 6 . . . not only repeals the inheritance and gift taxes, <em>but also prohibits their reenactment under a different name, </em>such as a tax on transfers, succession, legacy, estate <em>or any other tax due to a transfer of property because someone dies. . . </em>.\u201d <em>(Estate of Cirone, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at p. 208, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Our state Constitution provides: \u201cThe Legislature . . . may amend or repeal an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (c).) Proposition 6 does not provide for legislative amendment or repeal of Revenue and Taxation Code section 13301 without the approval by voters. Our own California Supreme Court has expressly recognized this constitutional provision. (P<em>eople v. Cooper </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 38, 44 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 37 P.3d 403]; see also <em>Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights </em>v. <em>Garamendi </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1364 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 354]; <em>Proposition 103 Enforcement Project v. Quackenbush </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1473, 1483-1484 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Attorney General argues that this constitutional provision has no application because the initiative statute, Proposition 6, has not been amended or repealed by the Legislature. It has only enacted a new statute, which provides for a new fee. We cannot agree. This myopic view is tantamount to the \u201ctransparent evasion\u201d condemned by the California Supreme Court over 100 years ago. \u201cA statute which adds to or takes away from an existing statute is considered an amendment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Cory </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 772, 776 [145 Cal.Rptr. 819].) \u201cIn determining whether a particular action constitutes an amendment, we keep in mind that \u2018[i]t is \u201c \u2018the duty of the courts to jealously guard [the people\u2019s initiative and referendum power]\u2019. . . . \u2018[I]t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>right [to local initiative or referendum] be not improperly annulled.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa </em>[(1995)] 9 Cal.4th [763,] 776 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 889 P.2d 1019], quoting <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 591 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038].) Any doubts should be resolved in favor of the initiative and referendum power, and amendments that <em>may </em>conflict with the subject matter of initiative measures must be accomplished by popular vote, as opposed to legislatively enacted ordinances, where the original initiative does not provide otherwise. <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 792; <em>Mobilepark West Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Escondido Mobilepark West </em>[(1995)] 35 Cal.App.4th [32,] 41 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 393].)\u201d <em>(Proposition 103 Enforcement Project v. Quackenbush, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1485-1486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>A Tax for Revenue Purposes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appellant argues that the fee is a tax and was enacted for revenue purposes. Faced with a budgetary crisis for the 2003-2004 fiscal year, the Legislature anticipated that the trial courts would not receive adequate funding to meet expenditures. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alford </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 749, 756 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 310, 171 P.3d 32] [discussing Assem. Bill No. 1759 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill 1759)]; <em>People v. Wallace </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 867, 871-874 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 152] [same].) In 2003, the Legislature budgeted $2.2 billion to operate the trial courts but projected a $150 million budget shortfall. (See Legis. Analyst, Cal. Spending Plan 2003-04: The Budget Act and Related Legislation (Oct. 2003) pp. 48-49.) To meet that shortfall, the Legislature enacted a variety of new fees and court user fees including the graduated probate filing fee. The Legislative Analyst estimated that the graduated probate fee alone would generate $7.3 million for the 2003-2004 fiscal year. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The fee was enacted as part of Assembly Bill 1759.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Wallace, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 873 [discussing Legislative history of Assem. Bill 1759].) \u201cAssembly Bill No. 1759 was one of 24 trailer bills which were part of a \u2018mechanism to implement critical provisions\u2019 of the fiscal year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>2003-2004 state budget. [Citation.] The only expressed rationale for making Assembly Bill No. 1759 an urgency statute was a budgetary reason ....\u201d (120 Cal.App.4th at p. 875.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\n<em>Ad Valorem Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Here the graduated fee operates as an ad valorem tax because probate is an in rem proceeding in which the court supervises the administration of estate assets. <em>(Estate of Wise </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 376, 382 [210 P.2d 497]; see <em>David v. Hermann </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 672, 682 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 622] [no in rem jurisdiction unless there are estate assets].) The amount of the filing fee is based on the appraised value of the estate assets (i.e., the probate \u201cres\u201d) rendering the fee indistinguishable from the ad valorem tax in <em>Fatjo </em>v. <em>Pfister, </em>supra, 117 Cal. 83. Until the graduated filing fee and surcharge is paid, and a receipt is presented to the probate court, there is no final distribution. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.552(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>Regulatory Fees and User Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Citing <em>Sinclair Paint, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at page 874, the Attorney General argues that the word \u201c \u2018tax\u2019 has no fixed meaning, and that the distinction between taxes and regulatory fees is frequently \u2018blurred,\u2019 taking on different meanings in different contexts. [Citations.]\u201d In <em>Sinclair Paint, </em>manufacturers whose products exposed children to lead contamination were required to pay a fee pursuant to the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1991 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 105275 et seq.) to mitigate the cost of adverse health effects caused by their products. (15 Cal.4th at pp. 869-870.) The plaintiff, a paint manufacturer, challenged the regulatory fee as a tax. Our Supreme Court held that, in order to prevail, the plaintiff would have \u201cto prove at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that the amount of fees assessed and paid exceeded the reasonable cost of providing the protective services for which the fees were charged, or that the fees were levied for unrelated revenue purposes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">As discussed in <em>Sinclair Paint, </em>\u201c[m]ost taxes are compulsory rather than imposed in response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sinclair Paint, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 874.) For example, a regulatory fee is not compulsory where the payor chooses to engage in the activity, such as developing property. (See, e.g., <em>Russ Bldg. Partnership v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1987) 199 Cal.App.3d 1496, 1504 [246 Cal.Rptr. 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Unlike a developer fee or the paint manufacturer who decides to sell paint, the probate of the decedent\u2019s estate is not an option. Appellant was statutorily required to file a petition for administration of the estate after learning of the testator\u2019s death and learning that she was named as executor. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 8001.) Although the instant fee is intended to fund the trial courts, the Legislature\u2019s \u201cability to shift the cost of court operations to the parties is limited .... For example, in civil cases litigants properly may be required to pay fixed, incidental court fees that indirectly subsidize a portion of the cost of the judicial system, such as filing fees. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Laff) </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 703, 737 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 323, 23 P.3d 563], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Fixed filing fees are entirely appropriate. But the imposition of the instant fee based on the appraised value of an estate is unprecedented and violates Proposition 6 and the California Constitution, article II, section 10, subdivision (c). Calling a $74,642.52 filing fee a \u201ccourt user fee\u201d does not change the analysis. As reflected in the Proposition 6 ballot arguments, Revenue and Taxation Code section 13301 was \u201ccarefully written to withstand challenges in the courts and to block legislative shenanigans to reimpose the [estate or inheritance] tax under another name . . . .\u201d <em>(Estate of Cirone, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at p. 208.) This language echoes the words of our Supreme Court 100 years ago in <em>Fatjo v. Pfister, supra, </em>117 Cal. 83. \u201cTo call it a fee is a transparent evasion\u201d of Proposition 6.
