J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7s\">This court granted Virginia Brooks\u2019s petition for writ of review from the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) to examine whether a year of industrial disability leave (IDL) payable to state employees under Government Code sections 19869-19877.1 falls within the ambit of the two-year limitation on aggregate temporary disability payments in Labor Code section 4656, subdivision (c)(1), enacted as part of the 2004 workers\u2019 compensation reforms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Sen. Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), chaptered as Stats. 2004, ch. 34, \u00a7 29.) We agree with the WCAB and conclude that under the current statutory scheme state employees are limited to a maximum of two years of combined temporary disability indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts. On October 25, 2004, Virginia Brooks sustained an injury to her right shoulder and psyche arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>out of and in the course of her employment as a correctional officer with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). As a state agency, the CDCR was legally uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation and contracted with the State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) to adjust its workers\u2019 compensation claims. (\u00a7 3700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Brooks earned an average of $1,102.99 per week as a correctional officer at the time of her injury. The SCIF determined that Brooks would be paid $735.66 per week of IDL indemnity over one year and provided her with workers\u2019 compensation temporary disability (TD) of $728.00 per week during the following year through October 26, 2006. While Brooks thereafter remained totally temporarily disabled, SCIF stopped providing TD payments after two years from the date of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">In March 2007, Brooks brought the matter for a hearing before a workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) contending she was entitled to another year of TD because the two-year limitation on those benefits established under section 4656, subdivision (c)(1), as amended in 2004, did not begin running until October 27, 2005, when her initial year of IDL payments ceased. The WCJ disagreed with Brooks, reasoning DDL is the functional equivalent of TD and that the new statutory limit authorized only 104 weeks of combined DDL and TD indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">Brooks petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration, claiming IDL is not TD because \u201cIDL payments are made under different rules, to a limited class of employees, at different rates, and for different periods.\u201d In a report and recommendation to the WCAB, the WCJ primarily relied on the statutory definition under Government Code section 19870, subdivision (a) providing that DDL \u201cmeans temporary disability as defined in\u201d the Labor Code\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation provisions. The WCAB summarily denied reconsideration by adopting and incorporating the WCJ\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Brooks contends the state\u2019s IDL and TD programs are mutually exclusive and independent benefits payable to temporarily disabled state employees. While the parties agree Brooks appropriately received an initial year of IDL and at least one additional year of TD, Brooks argues she is entitled to a second year of TD, for a total of three years of indemnity benefits, while she remained temporarily disabled. Given the parties\u2019 stipulations and lack of any dispute as to the underlying facts, Brooks presents a pure question of law reviewable by this court de novo. <em>(Department of Rehabilitation v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1281, 1290 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 70 P.3d 1076] (Lauher); <em>Signature Fruit Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp.

Appeals Bd. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1165, 1174 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 552, 959 P.2d 1228].) Considering a seasonal worker\u2019s ability to receive TD during her regular unemployment season, this court summarized the appropriate standard of review in <em>Signature Fruit: </em>\u201cIn reviewing a workers\u2019 compensation provision, we give great weight to the WCAB\u2019s interpretation unless it contravenes legislative intent as evidenced by clear and unambiguous statutory language. [Citation.] In addition, we look to the overall scheme of which a provision is a part and consider the consequences that will flow from a particular construction so as to achieve wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity. [Citation.] We must also consider fairness, reasonableness, and proportionality of an enactment and the purposes sought to be achieved. [Citation.] As with other workers\u2019 compensation provisions, statutes regarding temporary disability are construed liberally in favor of granting benefits to injured workers. (\u00a7 3202; <em>Lauher, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1290.) Even a liberal interpretation, however, will not extend temporary disability benefits where they are not authorized. <em>(Lauher, </em>at p. 1293.)\u201d <em>(Signature Fruit, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">A. <em>Industrial Disability Leave</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Originally enacted under Government Code former section 18122 in 1974 (Stats. 1974, ch. 374, p. 735) as part of the Berryhill Total Compensation Act, Government Code section 19871 authorizes an IDL benefit for state officers or employees who are temporarily disabled by illness or injury arising out of and in the course of their employment. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 43, 52 [152 Cal.Rptr. 153].) Except for certain public safety workers falling within a separate disability leave of absence program, IDL applies to all compensated state officers and employees belonging to the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and all non-civil-service employees of the Legislature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 4850; Gov. Code, \u00a7 19869.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">IDL provides industrially injured state employees with up to 52 weeks of indemnity benefits. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871, subd. (a).) Those benefits normally begin on the fourth day after a state employee leaves work due to the injury, but apply from the first day the employee leaves work if the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>causes disability in excess of 14 days, if the employee requires hospitalization, or if the injury is the result of a criminal act of violence. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19875, subds. (a), (b).) For the first 22 days, the employee receives his or her full salary less the amount of the employee\u2019s exemption withholdings for federal income, state income, and Social Security taxes as of the date of disability. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871, subd. (a).) IDL is mandatory for the first 22 days of disability unless it would result in an amount less than that which would be provided by TD. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.759.) The employee receives two-thirds of his or her regular salary throughout the remainder of 52 weeks, during which time the employee may also supplement IDL payments with accrued leave time in an amount approximating the employee\u2019s full net pay. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19871, subd. (a), 19872, subd. (b).) An employee on IDL is also entitled to continue receiving \u201call employee benefits which he or she would have received had he or she not incurred disability.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871.1, subd. (a).) If an injury results from particularly egregious circumstances not applicable here, some state employees are further eligible for enhanced IDL providing the employee\u2019s full net take-home salary for the entire 52 weeks. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871.2; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">An employee\u2019s first level of administrative remedy for complaints arising out of IDL lies with the employing state department. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.768.) Thereafter, complaints arising under the Government Code, such as those related to the payment of IDL and leave administration, must be appealed to the Department of Personnel Administration. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.768, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">B. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Temporary Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">\u201cPursuant to state constitutional mandate, the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides for a compulsory scheme of employer liability without fault for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>(Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 76, 85 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 190, 925 P.2d 1309].) Unlike IDL, workers\u2019 compensation benefits apply to \u201cany or all\u201d California workers and represent the \u201csocial public policy of this State, binding upon all departments of the state government.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) Thus, the \u201cState and every State agency\u201d is expressly included within the definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. (\u00a7 3300, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">The Labor Code\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation provisions nowhere define the term \u201ctemporary disability.\u201d (See 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries &amp; Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed. 2007) \u00a7 7.01[1], p. 7-3.) Notwithstanding the lack of a statutory definition, appellate decisions interpreting the workers\u2019 compensation laws have nevertheless established that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number>\u201ctemporary disability is an impairment reasonably expected to be cured or materially improved with proper medical treatment.\u201d <em>(Signature Fruit, </em>supra, 142 Cal.App.4th at p. 795, citing <em>Western Growers Ins. Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 235 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].) TD benefits provide \u201ca substitute for lost wages during a period of temporary incapacity from working.\u201d <em>(Livitsanos v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 753 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">A state employee may not receive TD or accrued leave benefits while also receiving IDL. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19872; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.759.) Similar to IDL, TD benefits commence on the fourth day after the injured employee leaves work, but apply retroactively to the first day if the disability extends beyond 14 days or the employee requires hospitalization. (\u00a7 4652.) TD payments are calculated at \u201ctwo-thirds of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability, consideration being given to the ability of the injured employee to compete in an open labor market.\u201d (\u00a7 4653.) As with IDL, an employee may elect to supplement TD payments up to his or her full salary or wage with accrued leave time. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19863, 19874.) Unlike IDL, however, the Legislature has artificially restricted an injured worker\u2019s \u201caverage weekly earnings\u201d for purposes of calculating TD to statutorily defined minimum and maximum levels; during Brooks\u2019s injury in 2004, maximum average earnings were limited to $1,092 per week. (\u00a7 4453, subd. (a)(9).) Thus, although Brooks\u2019s stipulated $1,102.99 weekly income as a correctional officer at the time of her injury slightly exceeded the statutory maximum average weekly earnings rate, she was entitled to only two-thirds of $1,092, or $728, of TD indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">After first seeking a departmental administrative remedy, an industrially injured state employee may appeal to the WCAB \u201con matters within the jurisdiction of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act of the Labor Code.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.768, subd. (a).) \u201cSuch matters include but are not limited to determination of liability for provision of medical care, temporary disability payments, vocational rehabilitation, and related items.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">C. <em>Senate Bill No. 899\u2019s Limitation on Workers\u2019 Compensation Temporary Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Government Code section 19874, subdivision (a) establishes that a state employee who continues to be temporarily disabled after exhausting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>IDL is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which include TD indemnity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> TD payments generally end when the employee returns to work, is deemed able to return to work, or achieves permanent and stationary status and becomes eligible for permanent disability. <em>(Lauher, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1291-1292; <em>Signature Fruit, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 802.) The parties agree, however, that none of these traditional grounds for terminating Brooks\u2019s TD applied in the present case. The WCAB instead relied on section 4656, subdivision (c)(1) as amended in 2004, which now provides: \u201cAggregate disability payments for a single injury occurring on or after April 19, 2004, causing temporary disability shall not extend for more than 104 compensable weeks within a period of two years from the date of commencement of temporary disability payment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Brooks contends that under revised section 4656, subdivision (c)(1), she was entitled to 104 weeks of TD following her initial year of IDL benefits. She argues the \u201cstatutory scheme is clear\u201d that the Legislature intended both benefit mechanisms to be distinct sources of indemnity for state employees because IDL and TD are set forth in different codes, i.e., IDL is governed by the Government Code and TD by the Labor Code, and because section 4656\u2019s two-year limit on TD benefits does not reference the term \u201cIDL.\u201d She claims that if IDL and TD comprised the same benefit, there would be no need for Government Code section 19872 to provide that a state employee may not receive both IDL and TD concurrently or for Government Code section 19874, subdivision (a) to state that an employee who has exhausted IDL may subsequently obtain TD. Brooks further asks this court to rely on the lack of any reference in Senate Bill No. 899\u2019s (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) preamble suggesting a new limitation on state employee IDL benefits and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>section 3202\u2019s overriding mandate to construe workers\u2019 compensation provisions liberally \u201cwith the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">We agree that the statutory scheme is clear, but not with Brooks\u2019s conclusion that IDL and TD are distinct classes of benefits that do not overlap. Despite Brooks\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the Legislature has already answered her inquiry. Located within the IDL provisions, Government Code section 19870, subdivision (a) expressly provides that IDL \u201cmeans temporary disability.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because IDL is statutorily defined as the equivalent of TD, then the two-year limitation under section 4656, subdivision (c)(1), necessarily must apply to both IDL and TD. Furthermore, the two-year limitation does not restrict itself only to TD benefits payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or the Labor Code, as it more broadly applies to <em>\u201cAggregate </em>disability payments for a single injury.\u201d (\u00a7 4656, subd. (c)(1), italics added.)  Finding the statutory scheme unambiguous, we need not resort to interpreting alternate statutory constructions or to section 3202\u2019s requirement to construe benefits liberally towards extending benefits. <em>(Brodie v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 1313, 1332 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 156 P.3d 1100] [\u201cSection 3202 is a tool for resolving statutory ambiguity where it is not possible through other means to discern the Legislature\u2019s actual intent.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In reaching the same conclusion, the WCAB, by adopting the WCJ\u2019s report and recommendation, found support in the Fourth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>State of California v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 128 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 606] <em>{Ellison), </em>also involving the SCIF and a state correctional officer. Following initial hearings before a WCJ, the SCIF agreed to provide the employee with seven and a half months of IDL. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 131.) After the SCIF failed to provide the benefits as agreed, the employee petitioned the WCAB demanding payment plus a 10 percent penalty pursuant to former section 5814.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Ellison, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 131-132.) The SCIF subsequently paid the IDL, but the employee continued to seek the penalty award. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 132.) Largely agreeing with the employee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1533\">*1533</page-number>WCAB found \u201c \u2018no excuse for this delay in payment of temporary disability per Government Code section 19871\u2019 \u201d and awarded the 10 percent penalty. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Departing from the employee\u2019s position, the WCAB calculated the penalty award on the amount of TD that would have been due during the disability period rather than on the employee\u2019s higher IDL rate. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">After analyzing the jurisdictional roles of the WCAB and the Department of Personnel Administration, the appellate court in <em>Ellison </em>agreed with the WCAB\u2019s exercise of authority to impose the penalty based on TD even though the employee actually received IDL. <em>(Ellison, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 145-146; see also <em>Blankenship v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1986) 51 Cal.Comp.Cases 38, 39 [writ den.].) Acknowledging that the WCAB maintained jurisdiction over TD but not IDL, the court based its decision in part \u201con the Legislature\u2019s definition of IDL as identical with temporary disability indemnity (TD) under the Labor Code (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19870, subd. (a)) . . . .\u201d <em>(Ellison, supra, </em>at p. 130, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">Brooks claims <em>Ellison\u2019s </em>conclusion that IDL is identical to TD is mere dicta, and that the case instead supports her proposition that an employee is first entitled to a year of IDL before receiving an additional two years of TD. Brooks relies on the <em>Ellison </em>court\u2019s description that \u201cstate workers eligible for IDL are entitled to this benefit, rather than TD, until the IDL is exhausted, at which point the employee who continues to be temporarily disabled is entitled to receive TD.\u201d <em>(Ellison, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 135.) According to Brooks, \u201cThis language is clear\u2014first, the employee gets the one, and then the employee gets the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Although the court in <em>Ellison </em>relied on multiple grounds for reaching the conclusion that the WCAB could award penalties based on the employee\u2019s TD rate where the state did not provide any form of temporary disability indemnity to its injured worker, we find the court\u2019s conclusion that IDL constitutes temporary disability both necessary to the case and more significantly, expressly set forth by Government Code section 19870, subdivision (a). Moreover, while IDL constitutes a form of temporary disability, the benefits are not necessarily calculated at the same rate because IDL is not limited by the artificial \u201caverage weekly earnings\u201d rate and an employee receiving IDL continues to receive his or her other state benefits. Thus, the <em>Ellison </em>court\u2019s assertion that an employee first receives IDL and subsequently receives TD simply describes that an industrially injured state employee first receives temporary disability indemnity at the IDL rate, including state benefits, and then at the TD rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">The WCAB reached a similar conclusion to the present case in <em>Salmon v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 1042 (writ den.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number><em>(Salmon). </em>In <em>Salmon, </em>a Department of Transportation employee received 15 months of IDL payments followed by TD indemnity through two years from the date of injury. The parties disputed whether the two-year limitation on TD under section 4656, as amended by Senate Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), applied to IDL and if any such limitation was constitutional. Denying reconsideration, the WCAB effectively agreed with the WCJ\u2019s reasoning that IDL benefits are the same as TD for purposes of applying the two-year limitation set forth in section 4656, subdivision (c)(1). <em>(Salmon, supra, </em>72 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">In a supplemental briefing request, this court asked the parties whether a 1994 amendment to the basic IDL entitlement statute, Government Code section 19871, subdivision (a), removing language that IDL is \u201cin lieu of workers\u2019 compensation temporary disability payments and payments under Section 19863\u201d carried any legal significance as to whether IDL constitutes temporary disability for purposes of the two-year limitation under section 4656, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Assem. Bill No. 810 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 2, chaptered as Stats. 1994, ch. 1027, \u00a7 2, p. 6244.) The following analysis prepared for an August 17, 2004, Assembly committee hearing and repeated in substance throughout numerous reports prepared by the Assembly, Senate, and Department of Personnel Administration describes the purpose behind the legislation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">\u201cIDL is a salary continuation benefit for state employees which currently may be used in lieu of temporary disability (TD) payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">\u201cIDL not only provides a higher rate of basic income to injured workers than temporary disability, it allows an employee to stay on the employer\u2019s payroll and continue to receive all medical benefits. Because the statute allowed a choice of benefits, each employee had to be provided with an election form outlining three options: (a) TD without supplementation, (b) TD with supplementation, and (c) IDL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">\u201cThis election process was time consuming and delayed the payment of benefits. Additionally, the choice made by the employee could be changed at certain intervals during the process, further complicating the payment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>\u201cAs a result of collective bargaining agreements with several of the state employees\u2019 unions, a new provision was added to the IDL program that allows state employees to supplement the basic benefit with accrued leave credits (e.g., vacation, sick leave). The collective bargaining agreement also stipulated that the employee can no longer elect TD as an option for the period of time he/she is eligible for IDL (52 weeks within a two-year period), and that the supplementation combined with the basic IDL benefit could not exceed the employee\u2019s normal net pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">\u201cThis bill extends the agreement in IDL to state management employees.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Employees, Retirement and Social Security, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 810 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 4, 1994, pp. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">We agree with the SCIF that the removal of the \u201cin lieu of\u2019 language from Government Code section 19871 was a ministerial, and not a substantive, change as it relates to whether IDL constitutes a form of temporary disability. As the bill analysis reflects, one of the goals of the legislation was to speed the commencement of payments to industrially injured state workers by removing the delay associated with the employee election between IDL and TD. Additional goals expressed in the legislative history included eliminating state employees\u2019 ability to earn more than their net pay while on TD with supplementation and carrying over the new collectively bargained IDL provisions to state management employees. In enacting the legislation preventing the employee from choosing between DDL and TD, there was no longer any need in Government Code section 19871 to expressly state that the employee was entitled to receive DDL \u201cin lieu of\u2019 TD. If the Legislature wished to differentiate IDL from TD as entirely distinct and cumulative classes of benefits, Government Code section 19870 defining IDL as TD could have been amended to reflect this intent. As amicus curiae County of Los Angeles in support of respondents articulates, \u201cInstead, the removal of the subject language is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s plan to eliminate the election of TD, which was causing administrative problems in the system, and giving a windfall for employees choosing TD and supplementing with accrued leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">According to Brooks, the removal of the ability of state employees to choose between IDL and TD adopted by the 1994 amendment demonstrates that the benefits carry different purposes and that TD begins only after the IDL \u201csalary continuation benefit\u201d first runs its course. Brooks believes this legislative bill analysis further confirms that IDL is a form of salary continuation that is a \u201cdistinct and enhanced benefit\u201d from TD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">Brooks draws support for the proposition that a salary continuation benefit does not constitute TD from <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 249 (writ den.) <em>(City of Oakland), </em>where the WCAB concluded the 104-week limitation for payment of TD indemnity set forth in section 4656 does <em>not </em>include the period full salary and benefits are paid to certain public safety workers while disabled as provided under section 4850. The WCAB concluded in <em>City of Oakland, </em>\u201c \u2018While salary continuation benefits paid pursuant to section 4850 may be considered compensation, they are clearly not temporary disability benefits and [are] not interchangeable with temporary disability benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Oakland, supra, </em>72 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">While we note that the specific issue presented in <em>City of Oakland </em>is not before us and we therefore make no finding as to the propriety of that decision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the section 4850 salary continuation benefit significantly differs from IDL. For example IDL, like TD, is payable only during an industrially related temporary disability (Gov. Code, 19870, subd. (a)), while a public safety worker continues to receive his or her full salary and benefits regardless of whether an industrial disability causes temporary or permanent disability (\u00a7 4850, subd. (a)). Most significantly for our purposes, the Legislature has expressly established in Government Code section 19870, subdivision (a) that IDL means TD, while no such comparable provision exists defining public safety worker disability leave as TD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Brooks filed a request to consolidate her case with an undecided petition for writ of review pending before this court in <em>Wiley v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(F053859). Both cases ask whether the two-year limitation on TD benefits under section 4656, subdivision (c)(1) applies to IDL benefits, although <em>Wiley </em>entails the application of enhanced IDL rather than regular IDL. Brooks does not set forth any explanation as to how consolidation will expedite or simplify resolution of the matters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We will, however, take judicial notice of the WCAB\u2019s opinion and decision following reconsideration in <em>Wiley </em>solely for the purpose of assessing the WCAB\u2019s \u201ccontemporaneous interpretation and application of the workers\u2019 compensation laws.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 530, 537, fn. 2 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 186]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">We are unclear why Brooks has asked this court to consider <em>Wiley. </em>In our observation, the decision only serves to demonstrate the WCAB\u2019s consistent interpretation that the two-year limitation under section 4656 incorporates benefits paid under the IDL provisions. Reversing the decision of its WCJ, the WCAB in Wiley\u2014as in <em>Salmon </em>and here in Brooks\u2019s case\u2014concluded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>state employee is entitled to only 104 weeks of temporary disability indemnity, whether consisting of IDL, enhanced IDL, or TD, because, as the WCAB again stated in <em>Wiley, </em>\u201cthe Government Code expressly defines IDL as temporary disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">The California Applicants\u2019 Attorneys Association (CAAA) has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Brooks. The CAAA claims the WCAB exceeded its jurisdiction by interpreting the Government Code and limiting IDL benefits. CAAA points to the WCAB\u2019s limited role over workers\u2019 compensation proceedings (\u00a7 5300) and the Department of Personnel Administration\u2019s power to hold hearings \u201cconcerning all matters relating to the department\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d including personnel-related matters. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19815.4, subd. (e); see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 19816, subd. (a).) Contrary to the CAAA\u2019s position, however, we do not view the WCAB\u2019s consideration of the definition of IDL in the Government Code beyond the WCAB\u2019s purview, especially where the Government Code expressly cross-references the Labor Code\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation provisions. Moreover, the WCAB here only determined Brooks\u2019s right to receive continued TD, not IDL, beyond two years from the date of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">The CAAA also disagrees that the definition in Government Code section 19870, subdivision (a) providing that IDL \u201cmeans temporary disability\u201d refers to temporary disability indemnity. Pointing to a lack of statutory definition of temporary disability in the Labor Code, the CAAA suggests the IDL term instead incorporates a medical definition of temporary disability, representing that physical state during which an employee is unable to work and before the employee becomes permanent and stationary, rather than a particular workers\u2019 compensation benefit. CAAA somehow reaches the conclusion this distinction \u201cmaintains the balance between compensation under workers\u2019 compensation laws for periods of temporary disability and compensation under the Government Code for periods of IDL.\u201d However, the Government Code defines \u201cindustrial disability leave,\u201d not the term \u201cindustrial disability.\u201d It would be illogical, as well as grammatically incorrect, for the Legislature to characterize a disability leave program as a physical state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">The CAAA additionally makes the policy argument that the WCAB\u2019s determination will negatively impact the abilities of injured state employees to care for their families and that, \u201cRather than placing the burden of compensation on the employer, said injured workers would be forced to look at various programs funded by the taxpayers for financial relief.\u201d We cannot disagree with the CAAA that the legislative scheme may, in many cases, limit the ability of injured workers to care for their families; however, this is true for all injured workers in the state, whether publicly or privately employed. Moreover, CAAA forgets that whether the state pays IDL, TD, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>unemployment insurance, or state disability insurance, the various programs are <em>all </em>funded by the taxpayers in the case of industrially injured state employees. Providing a third year of temporary disability indemnity to industrially injured state employees does not relieve the state of any financial responsibility simply because the funds are administered through the SCIF rather than the Employment Development Department. Regardless, such budgetary decisions are best made by the Legislature, not the courts. <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 906, 917 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 598].)
