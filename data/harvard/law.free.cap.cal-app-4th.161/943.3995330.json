(the B.\u2019s) for adoption, and declared a dependent of the court. Mother refused to identify the father. The case went directly to permanency planning. Jorge C., Vincent\u2019s biological father and a stranger to Vincent, appeared in the proceeding eight months later and filed a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 388,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asking for presumed father status and family reunification services. The dependency court granted the request, finding that Jorge was a nonstatutory presumed father entitled to reunification services without consideration of Vincent\u2019s best interest. The B.\u2019s appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Relying on <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 435 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 862 P.2d 751] <em>(Zacharia D.), </em>we hold that Jorge is not a presumed father because he does not fall within the definition of presumed father under Family Code section 7611. We further hold that a biological father seeking reunification with a child, who does not come forward in the dependency proceeding until after the reunification period has ended, must establish under section 388 that there are changed circumstances or new evidence demonstrating the child\u2019s best interest would be promoted by reunification services. The rule is the same whether his paternity was concealed from him or not. In reaching these conclusions, we hold that <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] <em>(Kelsey S.) </em>and cases decided thereafter such as <em>In re Baby Boy V. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1108 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 198] <em>(Baby Boy V.) </em>do not support the dependency court\u2019s ruling made at the section 366.26 permanency planning stage that a late appearing father whose paternity was hidden from him by the mother is a presumed father entitled to reunification services without regard to the best interests of the child. Accordingly, we reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">On March 8, 2006, the dependency court declared Vincent a dependent of the court based on sustained allegations under section 300, subdivision (g),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Lena M. (mother) was unwilling to provide for the child and wanted the child to be placed for adoption, mother\u2019s whereabouts were unknown, and father\u2019s identity was unknown. Custody was taken from the parents and given to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (the Department) for suitable placement. Because the parents\u2019 whereabouts were unknown, reunification services were not ordered, permanency planning services were ordered, and a section 366.26 hearing to select the permanent plan was set for July 5, 2006, with adoption as the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On July 5, 2006, Daniel L. appeared in court with a prenatal paternity test report indicating he was the father. Paternity testing was ordered, and the section 366.26 hearing was continued pending receipt of the test results. On August 14, 2006, the B.\u2019s were granted de facto parent status. In September 2006, a DNA test revealed that Daniel was not the father.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The section 366.26 hearing was continued to October 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On October 19, 2006, Jorge appeared in court alleging he was the biological father, counsel was appointed to represent him, and the dependency court ordered paternity testing to determine if he was the biological father. The section 366.26 hearing was continued to November 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">On October 20, 2006, Jorge filed a petition under section 388 requesting to \u201cbe declared presumed [father] commensurate with his conduct and DNA results and corresponding home of parent order or family reunification.\u201d The changed circumstances or new evidence he alleged was that he had lived with mother from December 2003 to December 2005 and neither observed mother was pregnant, nor was informed by mother of the pregnancy and birth. He alleged he moved to New York in December 2005 to get things ready so that she could join him there and continue their relationship, and they stayed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>touch when he was in New York. He alleged that the requested order was in Vincent\u2019s best interest because \u201cupon being informed of his possible paternity!, Jorge] immediately appeared. The child should not be deprived of his father because of the mother\u2019s fraud and concealment. Legislative scheme is family reunification.\u201d The dependency court ordered a hearing on the petition, with the section 366.26 hearing to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">On November 30, 2006, based on the paternity test report that Jorge could not be excluded as Vincent\u2019s biological father,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the dependency court found Jorge was the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Jorge\u2019s section 388 petition was heard on February 14 and 15, 2007. The dependency court took judicial notice of the file and heard testimony and argument. Jorge asked the court to find he was a presumed father under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d) on the basis he would have taken the child into his home but for mother\u2019s concealment. In the alternative, Jorge asked the court to deem him a presumed father under <em>Baby Boy V., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th 1108, in that he timely came forward after learning he was the father. Jorge argued that, as a presumed father, he was entitled to family reunification services unless the court found him to fall into one of the categories for denial of reunification services under section 361.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The dependency court granted the petition, found Jorge to be Victor\u2019s presumed father, not under the statute but under case law, and ordered the Department to prepare a report on Jorge and recommend what services to provide. The court found mother did not tell Jorge she was pregnant, Jorge moved to New York believing she would follow him, and Jorge should have known she could get pregnant. The court did not make a finding Jorge did not know she was pregnant. The court found it did not have enough information to make a finding about whether Jorge should have known mother was pregnant. Finding that Jorge \u201ccame forward at the earliest possible time, after the original paternity test was refuted,\u201d the court had \u201cno choice\u201d but to find he was the presumed father entitled to reunification services without consideration of the child\u2019s best interest, as \u201che meets the criteria set out in the case law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">After the court\u2019s ruling, the following colloquy between the prospective adoptive mother and the dependency court occurred: \u201c[Mrs. B.]: What about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>the intentions of this child, what about Jack,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] what about him? [\u00b6] The Court: Ma\u2019am, I know you are upset. I have a threshold issue that I have to determine and that\u2019s what I have done. That doesn\u2019t allow me to go to the direction that you have asked me to go. If I had the option, we might be in a totally different place. But I don\u2019t have that option at this juncture. [j[] The two of you sat here and you listened to the same testimony that we all listened to and I know that you were no doubt offended by everything that you heard regarding people involved. [][] I don\u2019t have the\u2014I can\u2019t base a decision on these kinds of issues at this point. I can only look at them as they relate to the determination that I have to make today. And a lot of that didn\u2019t help me in making that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The section 366.26 hearing was taken off calendar. The matter was continued to March 19, 2007. On that date, the dependency court ordered reunification services, monitored visits, and an Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children for placement of Vincent with Jorge in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The B.\u2019s timely appealed from the order of February 15, 2006, granting the section 388 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Jorge lived in New York at the time of the hearing on his section 388 petition. In 1996, when he was 18 years old, he had a daughter, Alexis. Following his separation from Alexis\u2019s mother after one year together, he never had custody of Alexis. Alexis lived with her mother, who subjected Alexis to neglect and domestic violence. In 2005, when Alexis\u2019s mother did not want to care for Alexis any longer, Jorge did not seek custody, and Alexis went to Jorge\u2019s father\u2019s home to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Jorge met mother, who lived in Los Angeles, in 1999. In December 2003, he relocated to Los Angeles and moved in with mother. They did not use contraceptives or protection, and mother became pregnant in April 2004. Jorge was \u201cshocked,\u201d \u201coverwhelm[ed],\u201d and concerned about how he could take care of a baby. They discussed terminating the pregnancy. Mother had an abortion in May 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Jorge and mother continued having unprotected sexual intercourse almost every day. He knew she was not using contraception and he used no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>protection. Mother was also having an affair with Daniel L. Mother became pregnant again, but did not tell Jorge. She said she would never tell him, because \u201cit would kill him.\u201d Mother told Daniel, who took a prenatal paternity test, which indicated he was the father.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Jorge testified he never knew or suspected mother was pregnant and never asked her if she was pregnant. She took a maternity leave of absence from her job in the fall of 2004, but told Jorge it was a medical leave because she had \u201cslight arthritis in her hand.\u201d In October 2004, Jorge learned mother was having an ongoing sexual relationship with Daniel; in November 2004, he audiotaped them having sex in his own bed. Jorge was irate with mother. Jorge noticed she was gaining weight, but she was a \u201cbig girl\u201d and he thought she was eating more because she was at home. Daniel observed that mother displayed an obvious weight gain of 40 or 50 pounds by January 2006. When Vincent was bom in February 2006, mother told Daniel that the baby died at birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Jorge moved to New York in late December 2005 to obtain custody of Alexis. He thought mother would follow after she had settled her affairs, but mother did not join him there. Jorge testified he did not suspect that mother had been pregnant and given birth, even though he saw a photograph in May or June 2006 revealing mother had lost significant weight. Mother did not tell Jorge about Vincent until Daniel\u2019s September 2006 paternity test revealed Daniel was not the father. On October 16, 2006, Jorge called the social worker and identified himself as Vincent\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">At the time of the hearing, Jorge still had not taken Alexis into his home. He testified he was ready to have Vincent live with him, with his family\u2019s help, and he would allow mother to be part of Vincent\u2019s life. The dependency court asked: \u201c[W]hy haven\u2019t you made the same preparations to have your daughter with you. . . . [W]hy isn\u2019t your daughter with you?\u201d Jorge said his father felt Jorge was not ready to have her.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In the meantime, Vincent thrived in the B.\u2019s home, where he had been provided with the unconditional love and attention of two loving parents since he was four days old. He was in the 90th percentile of growth. Mrs. B. quit her job to be with him full time. \u201c[The child] and his [foster/adoptive] parents have bonded. He has become an integral part of their lives, families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>and friends.\u201d \u201cJack lights up with smiles and cooing when either of the B.\u2019s walk into the room. His loving, happy interaction is ever present when he is being held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Even when it seemed they might lose custody of Vincent, the B.\u2019s \u201ccontinued to provide [him] with unconditional love and care.\u201d They had a very nurturing relationship with Vincent and their bond was \u201cextremely close.\u201d Vincent was \u201ca very well adjusted happy baby\u201d in their care. The B.\u2019s did not give up hope and continued \u201cto be very committed with providing Vincent a permanent adoptive home.\u201d The B.\u2019s completed the adoptive home study and were approved to adopt Vincent. The foregoing evidence as to the B.\u2019s relationship with Vincent is uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\n<em>The B. \u2019s Have Standing to Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Jorge and Vincent<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contend the B.\u2019s lack standing to appeal the order granting the section 388 petition. They contend that the B.\u2019s are de facto parents who are not aggrieved by the order because the B.\u2019s have no right to custody or placement of Vincent. Under the circumstances of this case, the B.\u2019s have standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">\u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 902 . . . permits appeals by \u2018any party aggrieved\u2019 in a civil action. The case law has interpreted a \u2018party aggrieved\u2019 as any person having an interest recognized by law in the subject matter of the judgment, which interest is injuriously affected by the judgment. ... As the Supreme Court established in <em>[In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 692 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244]], a de facto parent has an interest in the companionship, care, custody and management of the child.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1195-1196 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878], citation omitted.) \u201c \u2018One is considered \u201caggrieved\u201d whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Lauren P. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 763, 768 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 170].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>California law does not restrict a de facto parent\u2019s right to appellate review to the procedural rights provided by California Rules of Court, rule 5.534(e) (former rule 1412(e)) to be present at the dispositional hearing and all subsequent hearings affecting the child\u2019s status, to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence. <em>(In re Joel H., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1194-1196 [the de facto parent had standing to appeal the order under \u00a7 387, removing the children from her custody]; cf. <em>In re P.L. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1357, 1359-1362 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 6] [the de facto parent, in whose home the child was placed pending finding a prospective adoptive home, had no standing to complain about the order removing the child to a prospective adoptive home].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In this case, the B.\u2019s rights and interests were injuriously affected by the dependency court\u2019s ruling. They provided a home for Vincent since he was four days old and abandoned by mother. At disposition, the case proceeded directly to permanency planning on a track of adoption by the B.\u2019s. As the people who, \u201con a day-to-day basis, assume[d] the role of parent, seeking to fulfill both [Vincent\u2019s] physical needs and his psychological need for affection and care,\u201d the B.\u2019s were granted de facto parent status. <em>(In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 692, fn. 18.) They completed an adoption home study and were approved to adopt Vincent. Unlike the circumstances in <em>In re P.L., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at pages 1359-1360, the B.\u2019s always intended to adopt Vincent, and Vincent was placed there with the expectation it was an adoptive home. The dependency court permitted the B.\u2019s to litigate in opposition to the section 388 petition, gave them access to the court file to facilitate their participation, and told them they could appeal the decision on the section 388 petition. The ruling granting the section 388 petition vacated the orders for permanency planning services and setting a section 366.26 hearing to select a permanent plan, thus taking the case off the adoption track. Services would be ordered whose goal is removing Vincent from the B.\u2019s and giving custody to Jorge. As prior final orders are not reviewable in an appeal of a subsequent order, the B.\u2019s will be foreclosed from obtaining a ruling on the correctness of granting this section 388 petition if they cannot proceed in the instant appeal. (See, e.g., <em>In re Megan B. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 942, 950 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">\n<em>Granting the Section 388 Petition Was an Abuse of Discretion Without Consideration of Vincent\u2019s Best Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The B.\u2019s contend the order granting the section 388 petition was an abuse of discretion in that the dependency court failed to consider Vincent\u2019s best interest, and there is no substantial evidence Vincent\u2019s best interest would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>promoted by granting reunification services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that the order granting the section 388 petition was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\n<em>Applicable Law on Presumed Father Status and Reviving the Issue of Reunification Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Section 361.5, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subdivision (b) . . . whenever a child is removed from a parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s custody, the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child\u2019s mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.

He did not show he qualified as a presumed father under the only category that might be relevant\u2014Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d)\u2014because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>he did not receive Vincent into his home and hold him out as his own. Under <em>Zacharia D., </em>Jorge is not a presumed father. <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">As a biological father who did not assert paternity until the case was in permanency planning, Jorge\u2019s \u201conly remedy\u201d was to show, under section 388, that Vincent\u2019s best interest required vacating the permanency planning orders and providing Jorge reunification services so that he might qualify as a presumed father, entitled to custody. <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 453-456.) The dependency court erroneously ruled that Vincent\u2019s best interests were irrelevant to the determination and therefore never addressed the issue of whether providing reunification services to Jorge would be in Vincent\u2019s best interests. By failing to make the necessary determination of the best interests of the child, the dependency court abused its discretion in granting the section 388 petition. (See <em>Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\n<em>Case Law Does Not Require Treating Jorge As a Presumed Father Entitling Him to Reunification Services Without Consideration of Vincent\u2019s Best Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The dependency court in this case felt compelled by case law authority\u2014apparently <em>Kelsey S. </em>and <em>Baby Boy </em>V\u2014to deem Jorge a presumed father entitled to reunification services, <em>without consideration of Vincent\u2019s best interest </em>under section 388, because Jorge came forward shortly after learning he was the biological father. As we discuss below, <em>Kelsey S. </em>and <em>Baby Boy V. </em>did not compel the dependency court to reach this result. <em>Zacharia D. </em>held that biological fathers who appear after the end of any reunification period must file a section 388 petition to revive the issue of reunification services. <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 453.) No case has declared section 388 unconstitutional in the context of a biological father whose failure to timely appear was because the mother prevented his timely appearance. Thus, the dependency court was bound by <em>Zacharia D. </em>to comply with section 388 to revive the reunification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">1. <em>Kelsey S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><em>Kelsey S. </em>was not a dependency case. It was a private adoption case in which the unwed father was prevented from taking the child into his home and becoming a presumed father under Civil Code former section 7004, subdivision (a)(4). <em>(Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 822.) Under the statutory scheme for private adoptions, mothers and presumed fathers had greater rights to prevent termination of parental rights for purposes of adoption than unwed biological fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Kelsey S. </em>did not hold that the unwed father, who promptly came forward early in the proceeding to demonstrate a full commitment to his parental responsibilities but who was prevented from receiving the child into his home by the mother\u2019s action, was a presumed father under Family Code section 7611 under the doctrine of constructive receipt. (See <em>Kelsey S., </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 825-830, 842.) Nor did the Supreme Court hold under any theory that such a father had presumed father status.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The Supreme Court held that Civil Code former \u201c \u2018section 7004, subdivision (a) and the related statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers <em>to the extent that </em>the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child\u2019s best interest.\u2019 <em>([Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th] at p. 849.) Under such circumstances, \u2018[i]f an unwed [biological] father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial, and otherwise\u2014his federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 450.) \u201cIn determining whether a biological father has demonstrated such a commitment, \u2018[t]he father\u2019s conduct both <em>before and after </em>the child\u2019s birth must be considered. Once the father knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy, he must promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit. . . .\u2019 <em>(Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849.)[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 450, fn. 19.) \u201cIn \u2018emphasizing] the narrowness of our decision,\u2019 we stated that the \u2018statutory distinction between natural fathers and presumed fathers is constitutionally invalid <em>only to the extent </em>it is applied to an unwed father who has sufficiently and timely demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities. Our statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 7004 &amp; 7017, subd. (d)(2) [petition to terminate parental rights for private adoption]) are constitutionally sufficient when applied to a father who has failed to make such a showing.\u2019 <em>(Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 849-850, italics in original.)\u201d <em>(Zacharia D., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In <em>Zacharia D., </em>the Supreme Court limited <em>Kelsey S. </em>by noting that it involved the standard under which parental rights were terminated in the private adoption context, not the standard for determining a biological parent\u2019s right to reunification services in the dependency context. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number><em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 450-451.) The Supreme Court stated that the issue addressed in <em>Kelsey S. </em>would arise in the dependency context as follows: \u201cThe issue would arise therefore, under facts not presented here, whether the statutory distinctions between biological and presumed fathers are unconstitutional as applied to a biological father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party, but who <em>comes forward early in the dependency process, </em>and who displays a commitment consistent with the standard set forth in <em>Kelsey S. </em>Extending <em>Kelsey S. </em>to apply in the dependency context would allow such a father to participate as a \u2018parent\u2019 in, or end the need for, the dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(Zacharia D, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 451, italics added.) Nothing in <em>Zacharia D. </em>suggests that a constitutional issue would arise when an unwed father does not come forward until late in the process, as when the dependency case is already in permanency planning. When a dependency case is in permanency planning, the focus has shifted to the child\u2019s needs for permanence and stability; the reunification issue may only be revived if it is in the child\u2019s best interest. (See <em>Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 447, 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Zacharia D. </em>did not decide this constitutional issue in the dependency context. We are not called upon to decide it in this case either. However, we note that dependent children, unlike children in a private adoption, have been seriously abused or neglected. When a dependent child is involved, the state\u2019s interest and child\u2019s interest are unique and require higher protection for the child. \u201cThe [dependency] court deals with children who have been seriously abused, abandoned, or neglected. The juvenile court has a special responsibility to the child as <em>parens patriae </em>and must look to the totality of a child\u2019s circumstances when making decisions regarding the child.\u201d <em>(In re Chantal S. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 196, 201 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 866, 913 P.2d 1075] [discussion of different purposes and policies of the Family Code and juvenile court law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">2. <em>Baby Boy V.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In <em>Baby Boy V., </em>a man claiming he might be the baby\u2019s father came forward seven months after the baby was taken into custody by the Department at birth. <em>(Baby Boy V., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1111-1112.) The case was in permanency planning; the baby was in a preadoptive home. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1112.) The man, Jesus, stated he had had a sexual relationship with the mother but did not stay in touch with her, and she just told him about the baby. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1111-1115.) He appeared at the next court hearing, which was a section 366.26 hearing, and requested paternity testing. (140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1112.) The request was denied, and at a continued section 366.26 hearing, parental rights were terminated. (140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1112-1113.) At no time did Jesus file a section 388 petition requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>presumed father status and reunification services. (140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1116 &amp; fn. 8.) Our colleagues in Division One reversed the orders denying paternity testing and terminating parental rights. The court held that under <em>Kelsey S., </em>Jesus was a presumed father and entitled to reunification services if, on remand, the dependency court found he came forward promptly, paternity testing revealed he was the biological father, and he was not unfit. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1117-1119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We agree with the decision in <em>Baby Boy V. </em>to the extent the court reversed the order denying paternity testing. Jesus was an alleged father who was entitled to an opportunity to establish he is the biological father. <em>(In re Paul H. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 753, 760-762 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 1].) The dependency court has a duty to determine the parentage of a child when a man appears at a hearing requesting a paternity finding. (E.g., Cal. Rules of Court, former rule 1413(a), (h) [renumbered as rule 5.635(h)].) As the case before us does not involve a deprivation of the right to a determination of biological paternity, <em>Baby Boy V. </em>is not authority for granting Jorge\u2019s section 388 petition.  \u201c \u2018A decision, of course, does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.\u2019 <em>(Nolan v. City of Anaheim </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 343 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 857, 92 P.3d 350].)\u201d <em>(Flatley v. Mauro </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 320 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The conclusion in <em>Baby Boy V. </em>that Jesus was entitled to presumed father status and reunification services is arguably dicta and thus not entitled to binding effect on the dependency court. To the extent the <em>Baby Boy V. </em>court recognized presumed father status and a right to reunification services, we respectfully disagree on the basis of the holding in <em>Zacharia D. </em>that a biological father who appears after the end of the reunification period must proceed under section 388 in order to be awarded reunification services. In sum, like <em>Kelsey S., Baby Boy V. </em>does not support the decision below.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\u201cWhile under normal circumstances a father may wait months or years before inquiring into the existence of any children that may have resulted from his sexual encounters with a woman, a child in the dependency system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>requires a more time-critical response. Once a child is placed in that system, the father\u2019s failure to ascertain the child\u2019s existence and develop a parental relationship with that child must necessarily occur at the risk of ultimately losing any \u2018opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">\n<em>Any New Section 388 Hearing Will Include Current Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">As we reverse the findings and orders, Jorge may decide to file a new section 388 petition to modify the dispositional orders. One year has passed since the order appealed from was made. Reversal of the order will not \u201creturn the . . . hearing to the same arena in which it was first held. This is because the focus of the hearing always must be upon the best interests of the child. The new hearing would entail not only the facts and evidence brought forth at the original hearing, but of necessity would require evidence as to the current status of the child.\u201d <em>(In re Arturo A. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 229, 244 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 131], fn. omitted.) Jorge will have to plead and prove the elements for relief under section 388 \u201cbased on current facts.\u201d <em>(Arturo, </em>at p. 244, italics omitted.) The child\u2019s best interest analysis must look at the \u201ctotality of a child\u2019s circumstances.\u201d <em>(In re Chantal S., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">While the issue of whether Jorge knew or should reasonably have known he was a father was originally cast as relevant to whether he was a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father, the issue would now, on remand, be relevant to whether there are changed circumstances such that granting reunification services is in Vincent\u2019s best interest. The changed circumstance he alleged in his October 20, 2006 section 388 petition was that he did not know and was not told mother was pregnant and gave birth. On this score, we find untenable the dependency court\u2019s conclusion that the record was insufficient to determine whether or not he knew or should have known he was a father without mother telling him. It is uncontradicted in the record that Jorge and mother engaged almost daily in what he knew was unprotected sex, which had resulted in pregnancy only a year earlier, lived with her during the pregnancy until six weeks before the birth, watched her get heavier with the knowledge she was on a leave of absence from work, and observed five or six months after he moved away that she had lost weight. The dependency court stated it was not necessary to make the finding that had Jorge reasonably suspected mother was pregnant and asked her, mother would have denied she was pregnant; had he known she was pregnant, she would have shown him Daniel\u2019s prenatal paternity test. While the dependency court\u2019s thinking is within the range of possibilities, the fact remains it is entirely speculative. It is undisputed there is no evidence Jorge ever asked mother if she was pregnant or had given birth. What she may have answered to a question he did not ask, and what he may have done in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>to an answer she did not give, is all guesswork. Because Vincent was a child placed in the dependency system and Jorge waited eight months without \u201cinquiring into the existence of any children that may have resulted from his sexual encounters with\u201d mother, his delay placed him \u201cat the risk of ultimately losing any \u2018opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The findings and orders granting Jorge\u2019s section 388 petition are reversed.

The Supreme Court in <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 435 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 862 P.2d 751] noted that <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] <em>(Kelsey S.) </em>did not apply to the facts of that case, because Zacharia\u2019s father did not claim that he was prevented from becoming a statutory presumed father on account of the actions of the mother or any third party. The court suggested, however, that the same constitutional considerations at play in <em>Kelsey S. </em>\u201cwould arise . . . under facts not presented here, whether file statutory distinctions between biological and presumed fathers are unconstitutional as applied to a biological father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party, but who comes forward early in the dependency process, and who displays a commitment consistent with the standard set forth in <em>Kelsey S. </em>Extending <em>Kelsey S. </em>to apply in the dependency context would allow such a father to participate as a \u2018parent\u2019 in, or end the need for, the dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(Zacharia D., supra, </em>at p. 451.) Unlike <em>Zacharia D., </em>this is just such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">As appellants Dan B. and Tina B. acknowledge, \u201cThe facts in this appeal are not disputed.\u201d The juvenile court found that, due to his girlfriend\u2019s extravagant duplicity, Jorge C. first learned of the existence of his child Vincent M. when Vincent was seven months old. While mother abandoned Vincent at the hospital and concocted an outrageous lie to prevent Daniel L., whom she believed to be Vincent\u2019s father, from having a relationship with his son, Jorge was in New York preparing to make a home for mother and himself. The evidence in the record leaves no doubt but that Jorge would have taken Vincent into his home and held him out as his child, thereby becoming a statutory presumed father, but for mother\u2019s actions. As soon as he learned of Vincent\u2019s existence, Jorge made arrangements to take time off from work and flew 3,000 miles to seek custody of Vincent or, barring that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>reunification services. The majority\u2019s conclusion that Jorge arrived too late is contrary to a substantial line of Court of Appeal cases recognizing <em>Kelsey S. </em>fathers in the dependency court setting, and affording them the reunification rights which they are due under Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 361.5. Accordingly, I would affirm the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Initially, I note my disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Dan and Tina have standing to appeal the trial court\u2019s grant of <em>\u201cKelsey S.\u201d </em>status to Jorge, and the reunification services which flow from that status. As both Jorge and Vincent argue, Dan and Tina are not legally aggrieved by the order, and thus have no standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">An \u201caggrieved party\u201d for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 902 is one whose \u201cinterest is injuriously affected by the judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1195-1196 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].) Dan and Tina claim to be aggrieved because \u201c[t]he court\u2019s findings and orders thwarted [their] plan to adopt Vincent.\u201d However, they have no legal right to adopt Vincent. Thus, I fail to see how their legal interests are aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The majority does not satisfactorily define Dan and Tina\u2019s legal interests or explain how those interests are affected by the juvenile court\u2019s finding, pursuant to <em>Kelsey S., </em>that Vincent\u2019s biological father is a presumed father entitled to reunification services. That is to say, they do not explain why Dan and Tina are entitled to thwart Vincent\u2019s efforts at reunification with his father by appealing an order which Vincent, through his counsel, supports. Rather, Dan and Tina simply anticipate that, if reunification services are successful, Vincent will be placed with his father. That, however, is the best case scenario envisioned by the Legislature when it fashioned the entire dependency court process. If the process succeeds, foster parents will always relinquish custody of their charges. It is an odd conclusion indeed to deem the hoped-for result\u2014a family\u2019s reunification\u2014a legal injury to the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The cases relied on by the majority to support Dan and Tina\u2019s standing to appeal cannot be read to apply to the facts here. The Supreme Court first stated in <em>In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244] that \u201cde facto parents, such as . . . foster parents . . . , should be permitted to appear as parties in juvenile court proceedings ... to assert and protect their own interest in the companionship, care, custody, and management of the child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 693.) However, as the court later explained in <em>In re Kieshia E. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 68 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 775, 859 P.2d 1290], that standing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>limited by the rationale underlying the de facto parent doctrine itself: \u201cThe de facto parenthood doctrine simply recognizes that persons who have provided a child with daily parental concern, affection, and care over substantial time may develop legitimate interests and perspectives, and may also present a custodial alternative, which should not be ignored in a juvenile dependency proceeding. The standing accorded de facto parents has no basis independent of these concerns.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 77-78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The only cases cited by the majority which concern the de facto parents\u2019 right to appeal a dependency court order are <em>In re Joel H., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1185 and <em>In re P.L. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1357 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 6]. In each of these cases, the order appealed from removed the child from the home of the de facto parents, an order in no way analogous to that at issue here, finding Jorge entitled to presumed father status and reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In <em>In re P.L., </em>a newborn was placed in the home of the appellant foster mother. A selection and implementation hearing was set when the minor was just over a year old. Although the foster mother had initially expressed an interest in adopting the child, she voiced some concerns regarding her health, which caused her to reconsider. Accordingly, the San Bernardino Department of Children\u2019s Services located prospective adoptive parents. The foster mother very quickly changed her mind, and sought to adopt the minor whom she had cared for since birth. At a subsequent placement review hearing, the department recommended a change in placement, which the juvenile court ordered. The foster mother, since accorded de facto parent status, appealed. <em>(In re P.L., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1359-1361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The appellate court in <em>In re P.L. </em>reiterated the rights of de facto parents in the dependency court arena: \u201cDe facto parents have limited rights that include: (1) the right to an attorney; (2) the right to be present at hearings; and (3) the right to present evidence and be heard. Specifically, they do not have the right to reunification services, <em>custody, </em>or visitation. <em>(In re Kieshia E., </em>at p. 82; <em>Clifford S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[(1995)] 38 Cal.App.4th [747,] 752 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 333]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1412(e).) While de facto parents are given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings, that status does not give them the rights accorded to a parent or legal guardian. <em>(In re Cynthia C. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1479, 1490-1491 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; <em>In re Crystal J. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 186, 191 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 646].) Consequently, appellant has no legal standing to complain of the decision to place the child with the new prospective couple since she has no right to custody or continued placement as a mere de facto parent.\u201d <em>(In re P.L., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361.) The court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>In <em>In re Joel H., supra </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1185, de facto parents, who like appellants here were both the minor\u2019s foster parents and prospective adoptive parents, appealed a juvenile court\u2019s order permanently removing the minor from their home upon a finding that they had physically and emotionally abused the child. During the pendency of the appeal, the minor was returned to his mother\u2019s care. The Fresno County Department of Social Services challenged the de facto parents\u2019 right to appeal, based both on mootness and lack of standing. In ruling against the department, the Court of Appeal noted: \u201cRegrettably, it is entirely possible given the family history here that Joel H. may once again become the subject of dependency proceedings. Should this occur, the finding of physical and emotional abuse and order permanently removing Joel from [the de facto parent\u2019s] custody would have res judicata effect and would prevent a court from considering her home if Joel had to be removed from his mother\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1193.) Under those facts, the court found that the de facto parents were aggrieved by the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings, unsupported by the record, which could be used in the future to prevent the minor\u2019s placement in their home. It is worth noting that the de facto parents were permitted to challenge the factual findings that they were abusive, not the removal order itself. Thus, even though the appellate court reversed the factual findings for lack of evidence, the de facto parents were not thereby entitled to return of the child. <em>Joel H. </em>provides no basis for a finding that Dan and Tina are aggrieved by the juvenile court\u2019s orders granting Jorge\u2019s presumed father status and ordering reunification services, because those orders do not adversely affect them as Vincent\u2019s de facto parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In sum, because Dan and Tina have no legal right to adopt Vincent, their legal interests are not aggrieved by the juvenile court\u2019s orders, despite the emotional pain they quite understandably feel at the possibility that they may not be able to adopt this child.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Standing to appeal aside, I believe that the dictates of our Supreme Court as set forth in <em>Kelsey S., </em>supra, 1 Cal.4th 816, and as consistently followed by the Courts of Appeal over the last 16 years require affirmance of the juvenile court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\"><em>Kelsey S. </em>was concerned with the distinction between \u201cbiological\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d fathers, who are accorded lesser rights than are \u201cpresumed\u201d fathers. The biological father in <em>Kelsey S. </em>challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme which permitted the adoption of his child by a third party without his consent. That is to say, California law permitted the termination of a nonoffending biological father\u2019s parental rights over his objection notwithstanding that he would have been a statutory presumed father but for the unilateral actions of the child\u2019s mother. In rejecting this outcome, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Supreme Court ruled that the presumed father statute, Civil Code former \u201csection 7004, subdivision (a) and the related statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers <em>to the extent that </em>the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child\u2019s best interest. If an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial, and otherwise\u2014his federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.\u201d <em>(Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849.) While decided on equal protection grounds, the underlying premise of the ruling is the bedrock principle that a parent has a constitutional right to the care, custody, companionship, and management of his or her child. <em>(Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745, 758 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 102 S.Ct. 1388]; <em>In re Gladys L. </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 845, 848 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 434].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Here, as in <em>Kelsey S., </em>we are faced with the prospect of the termination of a nonoffending biological father\u2019s parental rights over his objection, notwithstanding that he would have been a statutory presumed father but for the unilateral actions of the child\u2019s mother. I find no basis to distinguish <em>Kelsey S., </em>and therefore would conclude that <em>Kelsey S. </em>is applicable to dependency court proceedings, a conclusion reached by every other court which has considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In <em>In re Jerry P. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 793 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 123] (review granted May 1, 2002, S104863, opn. ordered published June 6, 2002, review dism. as improvidantly granted Aug. 28, 2002), our colleagues in Division Seven of this District Court of Appeal held that <em>\u201cAdoption of Kelsey S. </em>applies to dependency proceedings and therefore Family Code section 7611 and the related dependency scheme violate the constitutional rights of a man seeking presumed father status to the extent they permit a mother or third person to unilaterally deny him that status by preventing him from receiving the child into his home.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 797, fn. omitted.) The Supreme Court quoted the foregoing language with approval in <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 56, 67 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 146, 46 P.3d 932]. Indeed, a long line of appellate opinions have implicitly or explicitly recognized that the constitutional concerns which the Supreme Court expressed in <em>Kelsey S. </em>apply with equal force in the dependency court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>In re J.L. </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1023 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 27] [1st Dist., Div. 1] [\u201cAlthough [Family Code] section 7611 makes no provision for a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>list of presumptions, a father asserting valid <em>Kelsey S. </em>rights may effectively qualify for presumed father status as the result of his constitutional right to parent, which overrides any contrary statutory direction.\u201d]; <em>In re Baby Boy V. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 198] [2d Dist., Div. 1] [\u201cprovided that [father] establishes on remand, that . . . he . . . satisfied the requirements of <em>Adoption of Kelsey </em>S.,\u201d he is entitled to reunification services absent a showing of unfitness]; <em>In re Elijah V. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 576, 583 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 774] [4th Dist., Div. 1] [\u201cA biological father may be accorded parental rights and become a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father when his attempt to achieve presumed parent status under [Family Code] section 7611, subdivision (d) is thwarted by a third party and he made \u2018a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial, and otherwise.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>In re Andrew L. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 178 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 591] [2d Dist., Div. 8]; <em>In re Paul H. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 753 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] [3d Dist.]; <em>In re O.

In my view, <em>Zacharia D. </em>has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In <em>In re Zacharia D., </em>supra, 6 Cal.4th 435, Javan, the minor\u2019s biological father, first appeared in the dependency proceedings at the 18-month hearing (when Zacharia was 19 months old), and requested paternity testing. The juvenile court subsequently denied Javan reunification services and terminated his parental rights. Three weeks before the latter order was entered, Javan married Zacharia\u2019s mother, a step preparatory to becoming a presumed father under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the Court of Appeal \u201cassumed that Javan, as the biological father, was entitled to receive reunification services before his parental rights could be terminated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>(6 Cal.4th at p. 444.) The appellate court also concluded that, as a nonoffending, noncustodial parent, \u201c \u2018Zacharia must be placed . . . with Javan under section 361.2.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Zacharia D. </em>was faced with two discrete issues of statutory interpretation, neither of which is present in this case: (1) Whether the term \u201cparent\u201d as used in section 361.5 includes a biological (as opposed to a presumed) father, and (2) whether the mandate of section 361.2, subdivision (a) that, absent detriment to the child, a minor removed from a parent\u2019s custody must be placed with the \u201cnoncustodial parent,\u201d applies only at the time the child is first removed or may be invoked by a biological father who did not assert his paternity until the 18-month hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also considered whether a biological but not a presumed father may request reunification services \u201cfor the first time after the 18-month review hearing.\u201d <em>(In re Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 445.) <em>Zacharia D.\u2019s </em>conclusion that a presumed father, but not a biological father, is entitled to reunification services is now enshrined in statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jorge makes no claim that he is entitled to reunification services based upon his status as a \u201cmere\u201d biological father. Nor did Jorge first request reunification services at the 18-month review hearing, or demand that the trial court award him immediate custody of Vincent under section 361.2, subdivision (a). Consequently, the issues addressed in <em>Zacharia D. </em>are simply not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As noted above, the <em>Zacharia D. </em>court pointed out (it does not appear that Javan argued the point) that <em>Kelsey S. </em>did not apply to the facts of that case, because Javan did not claim that he was prevented from becoming a statutory presumed father on account of the actions of the mother or any third party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>After holding that \u201cparents\u201d entitled to reunification services under section 361.2 include presumed fathers but not biological fathers, the court concluded: \u201cHere, Javan failed to achieve presumed father status. The Court of Appeal therefore erred in concluding that he was a \u2018parent\u2019 entitled to receive reunification services.\u201d <em>(In re Zacharia D., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 452.) Rather, he was left to seek reunification services based upon the standard of the best interests of the child, by way of a section 388 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">From this conclusion, the majority holds that the juvenile court in this case abused its discretion by failing to consider Vincent\u2019s best interests before ordering reunification services. If Jorge stood in the same position as Javan in <em>Zacharia D., </em>I would agree that he can only obtain reunification services by filing a section 388 petition and convincing the court that those services are in Vincent\u2019s best interests. However, Jorge occupies a completely different position than did the biological father in <em>Zacharia D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Javan had a brief sexual relationship with Wendy, Zacharia\u2019s mother, after which he disappeared from her life. He did not learn of Wendy\u2019s pregnancy because he chose not to maintain contact with her. Upon first learning of Zacharia\u2019s existence, when the child was 16 months old, he did not immediately come forward to care for his child but waited another three months, until the court was about to terminate Wendy\u2019s reunification services at the 18-month review hearing, to request paternity testing. By contrast, Jorge was in a committed relationship with Lena, maintaining a household together and planning their upcoming move to New York. As the juvenile court found, Jorge did not abandon this mother. Rather, Lena engaged in a web of lies to deceive Jorge about the pregnancy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (because she believed he was not the child\u2019s father) and Daniel L. about Vincent\u2019s live birth (for reasons known only to her). After returning to New York in December 2005, Jorge maintained contact with Lena, speaking with her by telephone and computer approximately twice a week. When in September Lena belatedly told Jorge of the existence of the baby, then seven months old, he contacted the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to determine how to go about obtaining custody. He was told that the next dependency court hearing was scheduled for October 19, 2006. Jorge took time off from work and flew to Los Angeles to attend the hearing. He was appointed counsel and the very next day filed papers, denominated a section 388 petition, to get custody of his son so he could care for him. In short, Jorge did everything one would hope a man in his position would do. Yet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>majority says he was too late, because the reunification period had ended and the case was in permanency planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In fact, the \u201creunification period\u201d in this case ended in March 2006, when Vincent was a month old, since the DCFS sought no reunification services for the family pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(9), and recommended that the case proceed directly to permanency planning. Applying the logic of the majority opinion, it would seem that no man can ever establish presumed father status if reunification services are not ordered for the mother. Thus, the mother\u2019s unilateral action in refusing to seek reunification services results in the nonoffending father\u2019s loss of rights, precisely the outcome the Supreme Court deemed constitutionally suspect in <em>Kelsey S. </em>This simply cannot be the law of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Indeed, it is not. At least three Court of Appeal opinions have sanctioned the provision of reunification services to a presumed or <em>Kelsey S. </em>father who first appeared in the dependency court <em>after the reunification period had ended, </em>without a showing of the child\u2019s best interest. <em>(In re Baby Boy V., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th 1108 [father first appeared and requested services when child was nine months old, after the court had already set a permanent plan hearing]; <em>In re Jerry P., supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 793 [father first appeared and requested services at the \u00a7 366.26 selection and implementation hearing]; <em>In re Julia U., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 532 [all reunification services were terminated when the child was 12 months old, before appellant\u2019s status as biological father was established and before he requested reunification services].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In sum, in my view a section 388 petition was not necessary in order for Jorge to obtain reunification services. The juvenile court is required to attempt to determine paternity. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.635.) Father sought to be found, and was determined to be, a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father. He was therefore <em>entitled </em>to reunification services, absent showing of unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">\u201cAppellant also has the fundamental right to parent his child. <em>(In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482, 489 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514].) The right to parenting should only be disturbed in extreme cases of persons acting in an incompatible fashion with parenthood. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The relationship of a natural parent and a child is a vital human relationship which has far-reaching implications for the growth and development of the child. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The involuntary termination of that relationship by state action must be viewed as a drastic remedy which should be resorted to only in extreme cases of neglect or abandonment. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (In re Julia U., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Jorge, a nonoffending <em>Kelsey S. </em>father, is ready, willing and able to parent Vincent. On this record, the State of California has absolutely no interest in keeping this parent and child apart. I would therefore affirm the juvenile court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The petitions of respondent Jorge C. and minor Vincent M. for review by the Supreme Court were denied July 16, 2008, S163570.
