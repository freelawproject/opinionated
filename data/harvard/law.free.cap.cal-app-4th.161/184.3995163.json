Underwriters, which had issued an excess director and officer insurance policy to Qualcomm, refused to pay under that policy after Qualcomm settled a coverage dispute with its primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>insurer for an amount less than the primary insurer\u2019s policy limit and released its primary insurer. In its complaint, Qualcomm sought a judicial declaration that Underwriters was obligated to indemnify Qualcomm for unreimbursed litigation defense expenses and settlement costs incurred by Qualcomm in excess of the primary policy limit. In sustaining Underwriters\u2019s demurrer, the trial court ruled excess coverage had not been triggered as a matter of law and Qualcomm\u2019s causes of action failed in part under a provision requiring Qualcomm to maintain the primary policy, in view of the complaint\u2019s allegations that Qualcomm had settled with the primary insurer in exchange for a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">On appeal, Qualcomm asks us to hold that when an insured settles with its primary insurer for an amount below the primary policy limits but absorbs the resulting gap between the settlement amount and the primary policy limit, primary coverage should be deemed exhausted and excess coverage triggered, obligating the excess insurer to provide coverage under its policy. It maintains this result does not require the excess carrier to pay any more than it would pay had the primary insurer paid its full policy limits, and furthers public policy of encouraging civil settlements. We decline to reach a broad holding based on public policy considerations, and instead conclude that the literal policy language in this case governs. Our interpretation of the excess policy compels us to conclude that Underwriters\u2019s coverage obligation did not arise because Qualcomm\u2019s pleadings establish the primary insurer neither paid the \u201cfull amount\u201d of its liability limit nor had it become legally obligated to pay the full amount of the primary liability limit in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In May 1999, certain Qualcomm employees filed a class action lawsuit related to their asserted right to unvested company stock options. Other Qualcomm employees and former employees followed with separate lawsuits (some of which were consolidated) in part seeking accelerated vesting of stock options. With one apparent exception in which it prevailed on summary judgment, Qualcomm settled these lawsuits, incurring approximately $3.6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>million in unreimbursed defense expenses for the class action and unreimbursed expenses in connection with settlement of the other litigation in an estimated amount of over $9 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Qualcomm tendered the above referenced litigation matters to its director and officer (D&amp;O) liability insurers, including National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, P.A. (National), and Underwriters. National had issued Qualcomm a primary D&amp;O insurance policy for the period of March 15, 1999, to March 15, 2000, with a liability limit of $20 million (the National policy or primary policy). The National policy insured Qualcomm and its directors and officers for a \u201c \u2018Loss\u2019 \u201d including \u201c \u2018damages, judgments, settlements and Defense Costs,\u2019 arising from a \u2018Claim\u2019 \u201d including a civil lawsuit. Underwriters had issued Qualcomm a first layer excess \u201cfollowing form\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> D&amp;O reimbursement policy for the same time period (the excess policy), providing $20 million in coverage for losses in excess of the underlying $20 million primary policy limit. The excess policy contains a \u201cMaintenance of Underlying Policies\u201d clause (the maintenance clause). Incorporating its definitions, that clause provides: \u201cThis Policy provides excess coverage only. It is a condition precedent to the coverage afforded under this Policy that [Qualcomm] maintain [the National policy] with retentions/deductibles, and limits of liability (subject to reduction or exhaustion as a result of loss payments), as set forth in Items F. and G. of the Declarations. This Policy does not provide coverage for any loss not covered by the [National policy] except and to the extent that such loss is not paid under the [National policy] solely by reason of the reduction or exhaustion of the Underlying Limit of Liability through payments of loss thereunder. In the event [National] fails to pay loss in connection with any claim as a result of the insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation of said insurer, then those insured hereunder shall be deemed self-insured for the amount of the Limit of Liability of said insurer which is not paid as a result of such insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation.\u201d In a \u201cLimit of Liability\u201d section, the excess policy also contains a clause (referred to by the parties as the exhaustion clause) providing that \u201cUnderwriters shall be liable only after the insurers under each of the Underlying Policies [the National policy] have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of the Underlying Limit of Liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In April 2004, Qualcomm, National and Underwriters participated in a mediation concerning coverage for the litigation. Qualcomm thereafter settled with National under an agreement providing it would release National from all future obligations under the National policy in exchange for National\u2019s commitment to reimburse Qualcomm for additional settlement payments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>defense expenses for the nonclass action litigation, bringing National\u2019s total payment under its policy to $16 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In October 2006, Qualcomm sued Underwriters for breach of contract and declaratory relief. It sought compensatory damages as well as a judicial declaration that Underwriters were obligated to indemnify Qualcomm under the excess policy for more than $9 million in unreimbursed expenses Qualcomm had incurred in connection with the defense and settlement of the non-class-action litigation, \u201cprovided that Qualcomm, [National], or other third parties paid at least $20 million in defense and indemnity of Qualcomm for [the litigation matters].\u201d Qualcomm also alleged it had \u201cpaid the required premiums in full and has satisfied all other conditions to coverage, or is otherwise excused from doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Underwriters demurred on grounds Qualcomm\u2019s complaint failed to state sufficient facts constituting a cause of action. They argued coverage under the excess policy had not been triggered because Qualcomm did not, and could not, meet two conditions precedent to coverage: first, under the maintenance clause, that Qualcomm refrain from compromising the underlying National policy, and second, under the exhaustion clause, that underlying policy limits be exhausted by virtue of National having \u201cpaid\u201d its $20 million policy limit or having been \u201cheld liable\u201d to pay that amount. In opposition, Qualcomm argued the coverage question raised by Underwriters was squarely decided in its favor in <em>Home Indem. Co. v. Mission Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 942, 966 [60 Cal.Rptr. 544] as well as out-of-state authorities adopting the reasoning of <em>Zeig </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1928) 23 F.2d 665 <em>(Zeig), </em>in which the court held primary insurance was exhausted and an excess carrier was liable for losses exceeding the actual limits of underlying primary insurance, even where the primary insurer settled for less than the actual policy limits. Qualcomm also argued Underwriters had misconstrued the maintenance clause; that the clause was ambiguous and should be construed in Qualcomm\u2019s favor to increase insurance coverage. Qualcomm maintained that while its position was supported by the excess policy\u2019s language, denying excess coverage in the circumstances presented would be contrary to public policy because such denial would work a forfeiture, provide a windfall to the excess carrier, and encourage litigation by discouraging settlements between insureds and their primary carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The trial court sustained Underwriters\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on grounds the excess policy had not been triggered. Based on the complaint\u2019s allegation that Qualcomm had settled with its primary insurer for $16 million in exchange for a release, the court ruled Qualcomm could not meet a condition precedent of the policy to maintain the primary policy with $20 million limits of liability. The court further ruled that in the absence of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>showing the primary insurer did not pay due to insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation, Qualcomm could not plead circumstances permitting it to be deemed self-insured. It entered judgment in Underwriters\u2019s favor. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cIn determining whether plaintiffs properly stated a claim for relief, our standard of review is clear: \u2018 \u201cWe treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u201d [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zelig v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 45 P.3d 1171].) \u201cWhere written documents are the foundation of an action and are attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference, they become a part of the complaint and may be considered on demurrer.\u201d <em>(City of Pomona v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 793, 800 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">II. <em>Principles of Insurance Policy Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">This court summarized settled contract interpretation principles applicable to insurance policies in <em>Palacin v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 855, 861 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 731] <em>(Palacin): </em>\u201cThe fundamental rule [of contract interpretation] is that a court must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties when they formed the contract. [Citation.] This intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. [Citation.] \u2018The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u201d . . . , controls judicial interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 861, quoting <em>E.M.M.I., Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 465, 470 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 701, 84 P.3d 385] <em>(E.M.M.I.); </em>see also <em>Powerine Oil Co., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 377, 390 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 562, 118 P.3d 589] <em>(Powerine II).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201c \u2018A policy provision is ambiguous when it is susceptible of two or more reasonable constructions. . . . Language in an insurance policy is \u201cinterpreted as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] When the relevant provisions of an insurance policy are ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to determine the proper interpretation. [Citations.] If there is no relevant extrinsic evidence or the extrinsic evidence does not resolve the ambiguity, the court must interpret \u2018 \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe ambiguous provisions in the sense the [insurer] believed the [insured] understood them at the time of formation. [Citation.] If application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity, ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. [Citation.]\u201d \u201cThis rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, \u2018the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Palacin, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 862; see also <em>Powerine II, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 390-391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Like here, <em>Palacin </em>involved a case resolved in the insurer\u2019s favor at the pleading stage. Thus, <em>Palacin </em>explained how the above principles operate on an appeal from a judgment after an insurer\u2019s demurrer was sustained without leave to amend: \u201c[A]n insurer [demurring] based on insurance policy language must establish conclusively that this language unambiguously negates beyond reasonable controversy the construction alleged in the body of the complaint. [Citation.] To meet this burden, an insurer is required to demonstrate that the policy language supporting its position is so clear that parol evidence would be inadmissible to refute it. [Citation.] Absent this showing, the court must overrule the demurrer and permit the parties to litigate the issue in a context that permits the development and presentation of a factual record, e.g., summary judgment or trial.\u201d <em>(Palacin, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 862.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Neither party in this case challenges the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issues raised by Underwriters\u2019s demurrer as a matter of law. Absent an argument that extrinsic evidence is needed to interpret the policy language, interpretation of the excess policy is a pure question of law for our independent review. <em>(E.M.M.I., supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 470; <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 426, 439 [204 Cal.Rptr. 435, 682 P.2d 1100]; see <em>Herzberg </em>v. <em>County of Plumas </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 24 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Urging us to interpret ambiguity in Underwriters\u2019s excess policy in its favor, and pointing to <em>Zeig, supra, </em>23 F.2d 665 and cases following it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Qualcomm contends we must interpret the excess policy\u2019s language in this case so as not to forfeit excess insurance in the event of its below-limits settlement with the primary insurer. Qualcomm reasons Underwriters is \u201cchargable\u201d with knowing that its policy language\u2014specifically the \u201chave paid or have been held liable to pay\u201d portion of the exhaustion clause\u2014has been widely interpreted to permit an insured to exhaust primary policy limits by entering into a below-limits settlement with the primary insurer, and such judicial construction should be read into the excess policy. Qualcomm maintains the parties\u2019 economic bargain and reasonable expectations were shaped by <em>Zeig </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Qualcomm further asks us to reject Underwriters\u2019s arguments that the excess policy\u2019s maintenance clause imposed a duty upon it not to \u201ccompromise\u201d the primary policy limits by settling with the primary insurer for an amount below policy limits. Pointing to secondary authorities stating that the purpose of a maintenance clause is to preclude any \u201cdrop down\u201d obligation by the excess insurer to provide primary coverage, Qualcomm contends the maintenance clause does no more than require it to pay the premiums as they came due to maintain the underlying policy, which it did. Finally, relying on the proposition that insurance policy exclusions must be plain, conspicuous and clear, Qualcomm asserts that the last sentence of the maintenance clause cannot be interpreted by negative implication to prohibit Qualcomm from self-insuring in the event of a below-limits settlement with the primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">A. <em>The Exhaustion Clause Unambiguously Precludes Underwriters \u2019s Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Qualcomm provides little analysis for a major premise of the above arguments: that the excess policy language is ambiguous in that it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions in view of the policy as a whole. Indeed, Qualcomm appears to argue ambiguity arises <em>because of </em>cases such as <em>Zeig </em>and others, and that its reasonable expectation for excess coverage was premised on the existence of these cases. But \u201c[a]n expectation of coverage . . . cannot <em>create </em>an ambiguity; it is merely an interpretive tool used to resolve an ambiguity once it is found to exist.\u201d <em>(Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 456-457 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 617]; see, e.g., <em>Pardee Construction Co. v. Insurance Co. of the West </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1352 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 443].) An insured\u2019s subjective expectations do not dictate our analysis of the presence or absence of ambiguity in the excess policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">As to the exhaustion clause, we cannot detect ambiguity. Our assessment of the policy language must be made in the context of the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Underwriters\u2019s policy as an excess insurance policy. (Accord, <em>MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 635, 654 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 73 P.3d 1205] [interpreting scope of pollution exclusion in light of historical purposes of pollution exclusion and comprehensive general liability policies generally]; <em>County of San Diego v. Ace Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 406, 415 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 583, 118 P.3d 607] <em>(Ace Property).) </em>Under these circumstances, Qualcomm\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations as the insured were that primary insurance would have to be exhausted before excess coverage would attach.  \u201c ' \u201cExcess\u201d or secondary coverage is coverage whereby, under the terms of the policy, liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.\u2019 [Citation.] [][] The \u2018excess\u2019 insurance referred to in this definition is that secondary insurance which provides coverage after other identified insurance is no longer on the risk. The identification of the underlying primary insurance may be as to (1) a particular policy or policies that are specifically described or (2) underlying coverage provided by a particular and specifically described insurer. In short, excess insurance is insurance that is expressly understood by both the insurer and insured to be secondary to specific underlying coverage which will not begin until after that underlying coverage is exhausted and which does not broaden that underlying coverage.\u201d <em>(Century Surety Co. v. United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1255 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 879], italics omitted; see also <em>Ace Property, </em>at p. 416, fn. 4; Croskey et al., Cal.

Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 329, 338, 339 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 755].) \u201cCalifornia case law has consistently protected the limited and shielded position of the excess carrier when the obligations of the excess carrier are set in clear phrases.\u201d <em>(Ticor Title Ins.

There is no dispute that the \u201cUnderlying Limit of Liability\u201d is $20 million under National\u2019s primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Our threshold inquiry is whether, interpreting these words in their ordinary and popular sense and not as an attorney or insurance expert, their meaning is clear and explicit. <em>(MacKinnon </em>v. <em>Truck Ins.

Qualcomm criticizes reliance upon so-called drop down cases in which courts decided whether an excess carrier had assumed the risk of the primary insurer\u2019s insolvency. However the courts in those cases analyzed similar excess policy language and we see no reason (and Qualcomm does not explain) why their interpretation of the words used is unpersuasive in the present context.

We need not decide whether the phrase \u201cheld liable to pay\u201d is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning, because even assuming arguendo the phrase is ambiguous and we interpret it in Qualcomm\u2019s favor to include responsibility for payment under a settlement agreement, Qualcomm\u2019s complaint does not indicate (nor does Qualcomm argue) that the settlement between it and National required National to accept responsibility or liability for the <em>full amount </em>of the $20 million limit on the underlying policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor does the complaint plead that National was obligated to pay $20 million pursuant to a court order or judgment, which would plainly fall within such policy language.

Co., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1793-1794), Underwriters is under no obligation to provide excess coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Qualcomm does not point to any dictionary meaning or other reasonable alternative construction of the term \u201cpaid\u201d (or the related words \u201cpay\u201d or \u201cpayment\u201d) or the phrases \u201cfull amount\u201d or \u201cheld liable\u201d that convinces us otherwise. Rather, it argues we should adopt the interpretation advanced by <em>Zeig, supra, </em>23 F.2d 665, in which the court declined to interpret the word \u201cpayment\u201d in an excess policy as only relating to payment in cash. Citing no authority, the court said, \u201c[The word payment] often is used as meaning the satisfaction of a claim by compromise, or in other ways.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In <em>Zeig, </em>the insured held primary burglary insurance policies with a $15,000 liability limit but settled claims under the primary policies for $6,000. <em>(Zeig, </em>23 F.2d at p. 665.) The language of the excess policy in <em>Zeig </em>provided that the excess policy \u201c \u2018shall apply and cover only after all other insurance herein referred to shall have been exhausted in the payment of claims to the full amount of the expressed limits of such other insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 666.) The excess insurer argued the insured was required actually to collect the full amount of underlying insurance as a prerequisite to coverage under the excess policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Zeig </em>court rejected the argument as \u201cunnecessarily stringent,\u201d stating, \u201cIt is doubtless true that the parties could impose such a condition precedent to liability upon the policy, if they chose to do so. But the defendant [excess insurer] had no rational interest in whether the insured collected the full amount of the primary policies, so long as it was only called upon to pay such portion of the loss as was in excess of the limits of those policies. To require an absolute collection of the primary insurance to its full limit would in many, if not most, cases involve delay, promote litigation, and prevent an adjustment of disputes which is both convenient and commendable. A result harmful to the insured, and of no rational advantage to the insurer, ought only to be reached when the terms of the contract demand it.\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Stargatt v. Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York </em>(D.Del. 1975) 67 F.R.D. 689, 690-691 [adopting and quoting <em>Zeig </em>in case where excess policy language limited coverage to when the primary insurance was \u201cexhausted\u201d].) <em>Zeig </em>reasoned that the excess policy language did not include the word \u201c \u2018collection,\u2019 \u201d and absent such a term it would not construe the policy in a \u201cburdensome\u201d way to the insured. <em>(Zeig, supra, </em>23 F.2d at p. 666.) The court asserted that \u201cclaims are paid to the full amount of the policies, if they are settled and discharged, and the primary insurance is thereby exhausted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We are not persuaded that <em>Zeig </em>compels excess coverage in this case for several reasons. First, the court appeared to place policy considerations (i.e., the promotion of convenient settlement or adjustment of disputes) above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the plain meaning of the terms of the excess policy, and for that reason (as we explain more fully below in pt. III.C., <em>post), </em>we reject its reasoning. Second, we disagree with its strained interpretation of the word \u201cpayment.\u201d <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. v. Pisciotta, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 807.) Third, the <em>Zeig </em>court acknowledged that parties in these circumstances may include excess policy language explicitly requiring actual payment as a condition precedent to coverage and that a court may reach a contrary result \u201cwhen the terms of the contract demand it.\u201d <em>(Zeig, supra, </em>23 F.2d at p. 666.) The exhaustion clause here compels us to conclude that the parties expressly agreed that National was required to pay (or be legally obligated to pay) no less than $20 million as a condition of Underwriters\u2019s liability. Because National did not so pay, Underwriters\u2019s obligations did not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Our conclusion is supported by non-California authorities applying a plain language meaning of the word \u201cpayment,\u201d such as the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <em>Danbeck </em>v. <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 2001 WI 91 [245 Wis.2d 186, 629 N.W.2d 150]. There, an underinsured motorist (UIM) policy \u201cspecifie[d] that only one manner of exhaustion would trigger the obligation to pay UIM benefits: exhaustion \u2018by payment of judgements <em>[sic] </em>or settlements.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>629 N.W.2d at p. 155.) Declining to allow a generalized public policy to supercede unambiguous policy language <em>(id. </em>at p. 156), the court rejected the argument that a reasonable insured would understand that phrase to mean a below-limits settlement giving a credit for full payment of liability limits would \u201ceffectively \u2018exhaust\u2019 \u201d those limits: \u201c[A] \u2018settlement plus credit\u2019 does not constitute \u2018payment\u2019 of liability limits as that term is commonly and ordinarily understood. It is true that a settlement of this nature bars further claim against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer and protects the UIM carrier against liability for the difference between the settlement amount and the tortfeasor\u2019s full policy limits. But it plainly does not exhaust the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits <em>by payment </em>of those limits, as required by the UIM policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 154, 155.) The court utilized a dictionary definition for word \u201cpayment\u201d as \u201c \u2018something that is paid; an amount paid; compensation; recompense . . . [or] the act of paying . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing Random House Unabridged Dictionary 1424 (2d ed. 1993).) It agreed with the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cin the context of this UIM exhaustion clause, the term \u2018payment\u2019 is susceptible of only one reasonable meaning: \u2018compensation paid by the liability insurer and received by the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Danbeck, </em>629 N.W.2d at p. 155; see also <em>Comerica Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co. </em>(E.D.Mich. 2007) 498 F.Supp.2d 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In <em>Comerica Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., supra, </em>498 F.Supp.2d 1019, the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan followed <em>Danbeck </em>in underlying factual circumstances almost identical to those present in this case. There, the insured corporation, Comerica, settled securities fraud class actions lawsuits for $21 million. Its primary insurer, whose policy carried a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>$20 million liability limit and who had disputed coverage of some of the claims, agreed to pay $14 million toward the settlement and it and Comerica agreed the primary policy would be deemed fully exhausted. <em>(Comerica, </em>498 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1020, 1025-1026.) Comerica had a following form excess insurance policy providing (in an \u201cInsuring Agreement\u201d section) that \u201c \u2018[c] overage hereunder shall attach only after all such \u201cUnderlying Insurance\u201d has been reduced or exhausted by payments for losses . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1022.) Comerica sued to compel the excess insurer to pay $2.6 million ($1 million plus costs of defense) in connection with the settlement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1020, 1026.) On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held the excess policy language unambiguously required primary insurance be exhausted or depleted by the <em>actual payment </em>of losses by the underlying insurer, and Comerica\u2019s payment to make up the difference was not sufficient to trigger excess coverage: \u201cPayments by the insured to fill the gap, settlements that extinguish liability up to the primary insurer\u2019s limits, and agreements to give the excess insurer \u2018credit\u2019 against a judgment or settlement up to the primary insurer\u2019s liability limit are not the same as actual payment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1032.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Qualcomm\u2019s reliance upon numerous other non-California authorities following <em>Zeig </em>does not persuade us to change our analysis of the policy language at issue here. Qualcomm itself observes that most of these decisions have as a \u201ccommon thread\u201d the policy rationale favoring the efficient settlement of disputes between insurers and insureds (e.g., <em>Drake v. Ryan </em>(Minn. 1994) 514 N.W.2d 785, 789; <em>Rummel v. Lexington Ins. Co., supra, </em>945 P.2d at p. 981; <em>Elliot Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2006) 434 F.Supp.2d 483, 500; <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2001) 826 So.2d 998, 999-1000), a rationale that in our view cannot supersede plain and unambiguous policy language. Even the <em>Rummel </em>court conceded that parties could agree that an excess insurer\u2019s liability would not arise absent full payment by primary insurer under policy terms if they are clear and explicit. <em>(Rummel, </em>at p. 979.) As we do here, <em>Rummel </em>emphasized that resolution of the issues there turned on the language of the excess insurer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>policy, and \u201cmust be resolved on the facts of this particular case and on the language of the individual insurance contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 977.) Because we are bound by the policy language before us, Qualcomm\u2019s citation to the numerous authorities for their results as opposed to their analysis is unpersuasive. As Qualcomm admits, these cases were decided under differing circumstances and clauses \u201cphrased in a multiplicity of ways.\u201d (E.g., Rummel, at pp. 978-979 [court reached its holding in part given definition of \u201closs\u201d as \u201c <em>\u2018sums paid or payable </em>in settlement of claims for which the Insured is liable after making deductions for all other recoveries, salvages or other insurance (other than recoveries under underlying insurance, <em>whether recoverable or not) </em>and shall exclude all expenses and costs\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>826 So.2d at pp. 999-1000 [excess policy provided coverage \u201c \u2018only after all primary insurance is exhausted\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Pereira v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA. </em>(S.D.N.Y., July 12, 2006, No. 04 Civ. 1134) 2006 U.S.Dist. Lexis 49263, *26 [plaintiff sought recovery from an excess insurer due to an intermediate insurer\u2019s insolvency; court found ambiguity not based upon policy language, but on <em>Zeig\u2019s </em>reasoning and notion that \u201c[interpreting the policy to excuse the excess insurers from providing coverage ... on account of the unrelated insolvency of an intermediary insurer would work a . . . hardship on the insureds . . . and provide a windfall to the excess insurers\u201d].) The National policy here is unlike the policy in <em>Rummel </em>as it provides: \u201c \u2018Loss\u2019 means damages, judgments, settlements and Defense Costs . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We cannot agree with Qualcomm\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage argument, which is premised on the notion Underwriters should be deemed to have knowledge of <em>Zeig </em>and numerous authorities following <em>Zeig. </em>But there was authority contrary to <em>Zeig </em>before the parties entered into their insurance contract in 1999. (See, e.g., <em>Wright v. Newman </em>(1984) 598 F.Supp. 1178, 1197 [expressly rejecting <em>Zeig\u2019s </em>rationale as contrary to the Colorado rule that an insurance policy \u201cmust generally be enforced as written\u201d]; <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Lay </em>(7th Cir. 1978) 577 F.2d 421, 423 [excess insurer\u2019s liability was extinguished by a settlement agreement between tort claimant and primary insurer for less than the amount of the primary insurer\u2019s policy limits; court held excess carrier was not obligated to indemnify the primary insurer because the settlement agreement \u201ceffectively released\u201d the primary insurer from all liability in excess of $70,000, and thus the excess carrier\u2019s obligation to indemnify the primary carrier \u201cnever arose\u201d]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Milgo Indus., Inc. </em>(D.C. Minn. 1978) 458 F.Supp. 297, 301-302 &amp; fn. 3 [observing <em>Zeig </em>interpreted the term \u201cexhausted\u201d in an ambiguous context and that recent courts had rejected its reasoning; court distinguished the situation before it as involving unambiguous policy language and it declined to disregard the plain meaning of the language before it].) We perceive no compelling reason why, for purposes of our interpretation of the excess insurance policy here, Underwriters should be imputed with knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>only <em>Zeig\u2019s </em>line of cases and not the contrary authority. Qualcomm relies on the principle that \u201cif \u2018a term in an insurance policy has been judicially construed, it is not ambiguous and the judicial construction of the term should be read into the policy unless the parties express a contrary intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(CDM Investors v. Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1257 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 669].) However, courts must apply that rule \u201cwith caution, first determining whether the context in which the construed term appears is analogous to the context of the term before [it].\u201d <em>(Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 187, 197 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 799].) For several reasons Qualcomm is not assisted by this rule. First, as we have noted, the authorities are mixed on <em>Zeig </em>and its rationale. Second, we are not persuaded that the circumstances in those cases following <em>Zeig </em>are analogous. Regardless, we decide this case based on the particular excess policy language involved here, the analysis adopted by the California Supreme Court in coverage disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Nor are we convinced to reach a different result by the California authorities cited by Qualcomm: <em>Home Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Mission Ins. Co., supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 942 <em>(Home Indemnity) </em>and <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. v. United States Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1511 [235 Cal.Rptr. 185] <em>(Phoenix), </em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 307, 315 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 845]. <em>Home Indemnity </em>was a declaratory relief action filed by insurer Home Indemnity Company (Home) and its insured, a leasing company, to determine their rights as against Mission Insurance Company (Mission), which was found to have provided excess insurance for a lessee of Home\u2019s insured. <em>(Home Indemnity, supra, </em>at pp. 944-945, 949.) The lessee had been sued as a result of an automobile accident. Before trial, the plaintiffs negotiated a settlement in which Home paid $31,000, and Tower Indemnity Company (Tower) paid $9,000 under its policy, which had a $10,000 limit. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 945.) Misson\u2019s excess policy provided that it \u201c \u2018agrees to indemnify the Insured . . . , in accordance with the applicable insuring agreements of the Primary Insurance [Tower], against <em>excess loss </em>subject to the limits stated . . . and as fully and to all intents and purposes as though the Primary Insurance had been issued for the limits set forth .... This policy shall apply . . . only in excess of the . . . amount as set forth . . . , provided always that it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to the Company [Mission] only after the Primary insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective underlying limits as stated [$10,000/$20,000], the Company shall then be liable to pay only such additional amount as will provide the Insured with the total limits as stated [$100,000/$300,000]. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In Home\u2019s ensuing declaratory relief action, the trial court found (among other findings) that Mission had incurred no obligation under the terms of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>excess policy because Tower\u2019s $10,000 primary insurance policy was not exhausted by its $9,000 payment. <em>(Home Indemnity, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d at p. 965.) The Court of Appeal held the trial court correctly concluded that Mission would incur no obligation under its policy \u201c \u2018unless and until the primary policy of Tower had paid or had been held to pay the sum of $10,000.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the appellate court rejected the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to exhaustion, finding it \u201cfails to consider that the respective rights and obligations of the parties and the insurers became fixed at the time of the accident. The present action was commenced to determine those rights. The court in this action has the power to determine whether Tower should be \u2018held liable\u2019 to pay the full amount of its liability. The fact that Tower elected to compromise that issue with Home does not change the fact that it either was or was not so liable at the time of the accident. Nor does it preclude plaintiffs from adjudicating that issue with Mission, unless Mission has been prejudiced because of the subsequent settlement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 965-966.) The Court of Appeal held Mission did not demonstrate prejudice; its counsel had been advised of the settlement and on Mission\u2019s behalf he agreed the settlement was reasonable and that it would be without prejudice to the respective theories of Home and Mission in Home\u2019s declaratory relief action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 966.) It further noted that plaintiffs\u2019 rights were not derivative but arose directly against Mission, and that the compromise did not preclude a determination of the rights and obligations of the dismissed parties to the extent those rights were material. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court reversed the judgment as to Mission and directed the trial court to enter judgment declaring the respective rights and obligations of plaintiffs and Mission. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>Home Indemnity </em>is consistent with our reasoning because the Court of Appeal there acknowledged that by reason of the clause attaching excess liability \u201c \u2018only after the Primary insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective underlying limits\u2019 \u201d the excess insurer would not incur any obligation until the primary insurer had been adjudged liable to pay the full amount of its liability limit. <em>(Home Indemnity, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d at pp. 962, 965-966.) However, <em>Home Indemnity\u2019s </em>result is based on disparate facts and circumstances rendering it inapposite here, including the fact that National is not a party to this action and the trial court cannot determine its liability, particularly where it has received a release from Qualcomm. Underwriters further points out it did not agree to the reasonableness of Qualcomm\u2019s settlement, and thus <em>Home Indemnity\u2019s </em>outcome cannot apply under these circumstances, where it would be prejudiced in having to litigate coverage under the primary policy. Because these assertions are matters outside the pleadings, we do not address them on our review of the trial court\u2019s demurrer ruling. We do not find <em>Home Indemnity </em>persuasive in any event in view of the differing procedural contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Finally, we are not persuaded by <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 1511, a case with complex and distinguishable facts, and whose cursory holding is not based on insurance policy interpretation. There, multiple malpractice insurers, including excess insurer United States Fire Insurance Company (USFIC) and primary carriers Olympic and Central, faced with a malpractice action and Phoenix Insurance Company\u2019s declaratory relief action, had agreed to let a referee apportion their respective contributions to a $1.8 million settlement reached with their attorney insureds in connection with the malpractice action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1518-1520.) The referee formulated a payment schedule requiring USFIC to pay $370,000, and Olympic and Central to pay $80,000 and $400,000 respectively. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1520.) Olympic and Central paid in exchange for a dismissal from Phoenix\u2019s declaratory relief action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Phoenix\u2019s declaratory relief action, and USFIC\u2019s cross-complaint for reimbursement from Phoenix, was tried in part to a jury and part to the court, after which the trial court found USFIC liable for excess coverage in the amount of $870,000. The court entered judgment ordering USFIC to pay $500,000 to Phoenix for money advanced by it to satisfy the malpractice settlement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1521-1522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On appeal, USFIC challenged the judgment on numerous grounds, including that it obligated it beyond its contractual agreement since under its policies it could become liable for indemnification only after the insureds had exhausted the $1.8 million of Olympic\u2019s and Central\u2019s combined primary coverage. <em>(Phoenix, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1529.) In a cursory statement, the Court of Appeal rejected the assertion: \u201cIn effect, the primary coverage was \u2018exhausted\u2019 when Central and Olympic paid their share of the settlement and were dismissed from the declaratory relief action. Had USFIC wanted to raise this issue, it could simply have named Olympic and Central as defendants in its cross-complaint thereby assuring that all the parties were before the court when the reapportionment was determined.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1529-1530.) We agree with Underwriters\u2019s observation that ultimately, the <em>Phoenix </em>court focused on USFIC\u2019s failure to seek relief in its cross-complaint from the underlying primary carriers in the face of the referee\u2019s ordered allocation, which permitted them to be released from their obligation without paying their full limits. Absent meaningful excess policy interpretation or analysis, we decline to rely upon <em>Phoenix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">B. <em>Maintenance Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Because our review is de novo and we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s reasoning, we need not decide whether the excess policy\u2019s maintenance clause independently compels a conclusion that excess coverage is precluded because Qualcomm did not comply with it as an express condition precedent to coverage. In reviewing the judgment on Qualcomm\u2019s demurrer, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>required to accept the trial court\u2019s legal reasons or conclusions of law; we review its ruling, not its reasoning. <em>(ASP Properties Group, L.P. v.

As one court recently explained: \u201c \u2018The obligation to indemnify must be distinguished from the duty to defend. \u2018The obligation to indemnify . . . arises when the insured\u2019s underlying liability is established. . . . Although an insurer may have a duty to defend, it ultimately may have no obligation to indemnify, either because no damages were awarded in the underlying action against the insured, or because the actual judgment was for damages not covered under the policy.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Whether coverage is ultimately established in any given case may [also] depend on ... the existence of express conditions or exclusions in the particular contract of insurance under scrutiny, the availability of certain defenses that might defeat coverage, and a determination of whether the facts of the case will support a finding of coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Safeco Ins.

By definition, it entails the payment of money in order to resolve liability.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Both the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are in fact dependent on coverage\u2014the former on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>actual coverage, the latter on at least potential coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Safeco Ins.
