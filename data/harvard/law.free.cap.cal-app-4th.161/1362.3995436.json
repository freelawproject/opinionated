Solely as to Perez, we will remand the matter with directions to the trial court to award him 844 actual custody days plus 422 conduct credit days for a total of 1,266 presentence credit days, but otherwise we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">On March 27, 2003, Correctional Sergeant Mathew Juarez let cellmates Mendez and Perez out of their cell to make phone calls and, minutes later, let inmate Reuben Herrera out of his cell to attend a Board of Prison Terms hearing. Mendez and Perez ran toward Herrera, Perez punched Herrera in the face, and Herrera\u2019s knees buckled. Juarez activated his alarm, gave all inmates orders to get down, and positioned himself to utilize force. Mendez and Perez both repeatedly punched Herrera in the face with closed fists. Juarez twice ordered Mendez and Perez to stop fighting. Neither obeyed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">Juarez fired a 40-millimeter \u201cless lethal\u201d projectile at Perez\u2019s lower extremities. Mendez and Perez each took about 10 steps backward, lay down on their stomachs with their arms out, and made barking noises. Herrera slid down the wall, lay motionless on his back, and died. He suffered blunt force trauma behind the left ear causing a skull fracture and a brain injury and blunt force trauma to the left eye likewise causing a skull fracture and a brain injury. Each injury was capable of causing death. The more severe injury, the fracture behind the left ear, could have been caused by the projectile from Juarez\u2019s weapon, but the less severe injury, the trauma to the left eye, could not. Herrera suffered multiple non-life-threatening head injuries consistent with the infliction of multiple blows to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">1. <em>Mendez: Failure to Hold </em>Marsden <em>Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Mendez argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on the grievance in his new trial motion about the competence of his trial attorney requires a remand for a <em>Marsden </em>hearing. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">At the probation and sentencing hearing, Mendez\u2019s trial attorney informed the trial court that her client was making a new trial motion \u201cbased on competency of counsel.\u201d In open court, the trial court asked her, \u201cWhat does he say that was incompetent?\u201d Mendez interjected, \u201cWell, your Honor, there was a lot. I mean, there was eight witnesses here but none of them were called on my defense, [f] There was exculpatory evidence. There was phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>call recordings that stipulates time lines to what actually took place were never brought forth, [ft] The whole incident only occurred 11 seconds, which made it seemed like we were fighting with this individual for minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">At that juncture, the trial court asked, \u201cWhat is it that your lawyer did or did not do that you think deprived you of a fair trial?\u201d Mendez replied, \u201cShe didn\u2019t bring none of these into trial.\u201d The trial court replied, \u201cOkay. [ft] Give me one witness that should have been called and tell me what that witness could have testified to that would\u2014.\u201d Mendez answered, \u201cWell, Mr. Herpe was the individual who was on the phone, and his transcript, he even stated to the D.A.\u2019s office that it was a one-on-one; that their individual was never\u2014 which was me\u2014was never involved, [ft] That is crucial to my case, your Honor. This is on paper, and there was another individual named Delgado who stated it was a one-on-one which he was never subpoenaed or questioned. And he it\u2019s on record to state it was a one-on-one, your Honor, [ft] This is\u2014this is crucial to my defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">The trial court asked no more questions about Mendez\u2019s reasons for challenging his trial attorney\u2019s competence but instead, obliquely referring to an earlier continuation of the probation and sentencing hearing for a different reason, asked, \u201cAnd, Mr. Mendez, why didn\u2019t you mention this the last time that you were here for a sentencing?\u201d He replied, \u201cBecause there was some conflict about the time about whether we can get this amount of time, and she asked me, she said that they were going to postpone it so figured, well, I\u2019ll just wait until it\u2019s time to\u2014.\u201d The trial court asked, \u201cYou figured you\u2019d have the [witnesses] come back a second time to be frustrated?\u201d Mendez answered, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t ask to postpone the sentencing. It was\u2014it was done by\u2014.\u201d The trial court replied, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll appoint [new counsel] to represent Mr. Mendez for the sole purpose of investigating as to whether or not there appears to be a basis for a motion for new trial based on incompetency of counsel. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Tasked by the trial court \u201cto examine issues involving a possible ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\u201d Mendez\u2019s new counsel later reported his opinion after a \u201creview of the file\u201d that \u201cthose issues\u201d were not \u201cappropriate at this time for a motion ... on that basis.\u201d He told the trial court that he had informed Mendez \u201cthere may be possible issues on appeal that could be raised\u201d but that he was \u201cnot in a position to make that judgment.\u201d Those issues, he opined, \u201cwould be more properly addressed if and when an appeal is filed in this matter,\u201d to which the trial court replied, \u201cAll right, and of course most ineffective assistance of counsel matters are raised by habeas.\u201d The trial court terminated new counsel\u2019s appointment and again assigned the case to Mendez\u2019s original trial attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">The Attorney General acknowledges that Mendez made a new trial motion \u201cbased on competency of counsel\u201d but emphasizes that he never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>indicated \u201che wanted another attorney\u201d and on that basis argues that the trial court had no duty \u201cto conduct a <em>Marsden </em>hearing to investigate [his] complaints regarding his attorney\u2019s performance.\u201d He is mistaken. In <em>People v. Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 388 [217 Cal.Rptr. 306] <em>(Stewart), </em>disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 684, 696 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 863 P.2d 192], as stated in <em>People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 346, footnote 16 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374], the defendant \u201cpersonally instructed his appointed trial counsel to file a motion for new trial on the basis of incompetence of counsel.\u201d <em>(Stewart, supra, </em>at p. 393.) That was adequate to put the trial court on notice of the defendant\u2019s request for a <em>Marsden </em>hearing. <em>(Stewart, supra, </em>at pp. 396-397.) Here, Mendez informed his trial attorney that he was making a new trial motion \u201cbased on competency of counsel.\u201d That, too, was adequate to put the trial court on notice of his request for a <em>Marsden </em>hearing. As our Supreme Court emphasizes, the \u201csemantics employed by a lay person in asserting a constitutional right should not be given undue weight in determining the protection to be accorded that right.\u201d <em>(Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\"><em>Marsden </em>imposes four requirements that the trial court here ignored. First, if \u201cdefendant complains about the adequacy of appointed counsel,\u201d the trial court has the duty to \u201cpermit [him or her] to articulate his [or her] causes of dissatisfaction and, if any of them <em>suggest </em>ineffective assistance, to <em>conduct an inquiry </em>sufficient to ascertain whether counsel is in fact rendering effective assistance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eastman </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 688, 695 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 922] <em>(Eastman), </em>italics added; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mejia </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 76] <em>(Mejia).) </em>In open court, Mendez identified by name two prospective witnesses who stated there was only one assailant, not two. He informed the trial court that one prospective witness told the district attorney he (Mendez) was not involved in the attack, but his trial attorney failed to call that person as a witness, and that the other prospective witness likewise characterized the assault as a \u201cone-on-one,\u201d but his trial attorney \u201cnever subpoenaed or questioned\u201d that person, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Although Mendez\u2019s grievance \u201cabout the adequacy of appointed counsel\u201d suggested ineffective assistance within the scope of <em>Marsden, </em>the trial court failed to conduct an inquiry but instead appointed new counsel to determine whether there was \u201ca basis for a motion for new trial based on incompetency of counsel.\u201d (See <em>Eastman, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 695.) However, the trial court \u201ccannot abandon its own constitutional and statutory obligations to make the ultimate determination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 697, citing, e.g., Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 1 [judicial power of state is vested in courts]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170 [judge has duty to decide proceeding]; <em>People v. Superior Court (Laff) </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 703, 721 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 323, 23 P.3d 563] [findings and recommendations of constitutionally limited nonjudicial officers must be independently reviewed by the court]; <em>Hosford v. Henry </em>(1951) 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Cal.App.2d 765, 772 [238 P.2d 91] [court cannot delegate own factfinding powers].) Here, the trial court simply listened to new counsel\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d that there were no \u201cissues involving a possible ineffective assistance of counsel claim\u201d and, with no inquiry at all, assigned Mendez\u2019s defense \u201cback to his trial counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Second, if a \u201cdefendant states facts sufficient to raise a question about counsel\u2019s effectiveness . . . ,\u201d the trial court has a duty to <em>\u201cquestion counsel as necessary </em>to ascertain their veracity.\u201d <em>(Eastman, </em>supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at p. 695, italics added.) Here, the trial court failed to question Mendez\u2019s trial attorney at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Third, the trial court has the duty to <em>\u201cmake a record </em>sufficient to show the nature of [a defendant\u2019s grievances and the court\u2019s response to them.\u201d <em>(Eastman, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 696.) Here, immediately after Mendez identified the two prospective witnesses who characterized the assault as a \u201cone-on-one,\u201d the trial court asked him why he had not brought that up at the original probation and sentencing hearing, intimated that Mendez wanted \u201cthe [witnesses] [to] come back a second time to be frustrated,\u201d and appointed new counsel. The trial court made no record at all about Mendez\u2019s additional grievances, if any, or about the trial court\u2019s response, if any, to his grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Fourth, the trial court must \u201c \u2018allow the defendant to express any specific complaints about the attorney and <em>the attorney to respond </em>accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Eastman, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 696, italics added.) The trial court made no record at all about Mendez\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s response, if any, to his grievances. \u201cNo part of this procedure satisfied the requirements of <em>Marsden.\u201d (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">The final question is whether the trial court\u2019s error was prejudicial to Mendez. \u201cThere can be no doubt it was.\u201d <em>(Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 126.) Here, we cannot determine whether he had a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance, but that is not the test. Had the trial court complied with Marsden's requirements, Mendez \u201cmight have catalogued acts and events beyond the observations of the trial judge to establish the incompetence of his counsel.\u201d (Ibid.; cf. <em>Mejia, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1087.) \u201cWe cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this denial of the effective assistance of counsel did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>(Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 126, citing <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">2.-4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Solely as to Mendez, the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to hold a <em>Marsden </em>hearing and, on that foundation, either to appoint new counsel on his new trial motion or to reinstate the judgment or to proceed otherwise as authorized by law. (\u00a7 1262.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Solely as to Perez, the judgment is affirmed but the matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to award him 844 actual custody days plus 422 conduct credit days for a total of 1,266 presentence credit days and to send to every appropriate person a certified copy of an abstract of judgment so amended. Perez has no right to be present at those proceedings. (See <em>People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 407-408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Vartabedian, Acting P. J., and Cornell, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">The petition of appellant Anthony Perez for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 9, 2008, S162739.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-11\"> Later statutory references are to the Penal Code except where otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1120-12\"> <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44] <em>(Marsden).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1120-13\"> In deference to the common law doctrine of ripeness, we will not address Mendez\u2019s other issue (whether the trial court committed an abuse of discretion by not striking four of his five serious felony priors at his probation and sentencing hearing). <em>(Alameda County Land Use Assn. v. City of Hayward </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1716, 1722 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 752]; <em>California Water &amp; Telephone Co. v.
