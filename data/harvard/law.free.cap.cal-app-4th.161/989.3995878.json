We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>Factual &amp; Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">St. Vincent\u2019s owns 835 acres of unincorporated land in the County of Marin. The property lies to the north of the City of San Rafael, abutting the southern boundary of the City of Novato, and is set to the east of Highway 101, between it and the San Pablo Bay. The property is separated from the northern boundary of the City of San Rafael by the Silveira property, another tract of unincorporated lands which also sits between Highway 101 and the San Pablo Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">For many years the City and the County of Marin (County) cooperated in planning for the future use and development of the St. Vincent\u2019s and Silveira properties (jointly, the Properties). Although the Properties are physically located within the unincorporated area of the County, for planning purposes they were identified by the local agency formation commission (LAFCO) as within the City\u2019s sphere of influence and urban service area. Policies in earlier versions of the City\u2019s general plan and the Marin County wide Plan anticipated that the Properties would be annexed to the City prior to or concurrent with the issuance of development permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The City\u2019s \u201cgeneral plan 2000,\u201d adopted in 1988, set forth detailed policies for the Properties describing environmental concerns and identifying development potential of up to 2,100 units. In 1998, the City and the County decided to enter a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to work cooperatively on a process to prepare recommended amendments to the City\u2019s general plan and the Marin Countywide Plan regarding the Properties. The City and County appointed a 16-member advisory task force, which included representatives from interest groups throughout the County, in order to prepare recommended general plan amendments for the City and County. Over a period of 20 months, the task force held meetings and study sessions with various community groups before presenting recommendations to the City in May 2000. The task force report stated that the appropriate level of development for the properties would be determined through subsequent environmental impact analysis of impacts on environmental characteristics as well as on traffic on Highway 101 and local streets. However, the report recommended the range of possible development for the Properties at between 800 and 1,500 units, reduced to 500 units with the purchase of development rights. The City accepted the task force recommendations by resolution dated May 3, 2000, and forwarded them to the general plan steering committee for incorporation into the general plan update.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">On March 18, 2002, Shapell Industries and St. Vincent\u2019s submitted applications to the City for development of the St. Vincent\u2019s property alone, including a specific request for annexation of the St. Vincent\u2019s property. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>proposed development included 766 residential units, 120,000 feet of office space and additional retail space. The City sent a notice of preparation of a draft EIR on the proposed project to nearby property owners, as well as other local groups and agencies. In response, the City received about 50 letters from agencies and individuals, including the City of Novato and the County of Marin, identifying concerns with the proposal, including impacts on traffic and transit and the fact that the proposal did not proceed in conjunction with a plan for the Silveira property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">On April 7, 2003, the city council passed resolution No. 11288, denying the application by Shapell Industries/St. Vincent\u2019s for annexation and prezoning. Resolution No. 11288 acknowledged that \u201cfor many years, the City, County and the Marin County [LAFCO] have identified the [Properties] . . . as located within the City\u2019s Sphere of Influence,\u201d and that the city\u2019s \u201cGeneral Plan 2000, adopted in 1988, set forth policies for [the Properties] . . . identifying [their] development potential.\u201d The resolution found, however, that circumstances that may have favored prezoning and developing the St. Vincent\u2019s property had changed since adoption of general plan 2000 and acceptance of the task force recommendations. The resolution stated that any such future development had always been contingent upon the completion of infrastructure improvements to address roadway and sewer capacity constraints. These included road improvements such as extension of the Mclnnis Parkway and completion of the Lucas Valley Road/Smith Ranch Road interchange, as well as construction of a parallel arterial to Highway 101 to provide additional north/south capacity to Novato, as well as for police and fire emergency access.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such improvements had not been made, the resolution noted, while at the same time traffic problems on Highway 101 had worsened, problems which the proposed development would compound. Additionally, the resolution noted that in the two years since the task force recommendations were adopted \u201cpublic opposition to developing the area has grown\u201d and a majority of the Marin County Board of Supervisors had expressed opposition to the proposed level of development for the St. Vincent\u2019s property. The resolution also noted that the St. Vincent\u2019s property \u201cis not contiguous to the City, a necessity for any annexation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Resolution No. 11288 also found that disapproving prezoning and annexation for the St. Vincent\u2019s proposal is consistent with general plan 2000 because nothing in the plan \u201caffirmatively requires the City to actively pursue or to approve development of the [Properties].\u201d Rejection of the proposal maintains the status quo, the resolution found, because the Properties are not currently zoned by the City but are currently zoned A-2 under the County\u2019s zoning ordinance. The resolution noted that the \u201cCounty\u2019s zoning designation will remain in place . . . [and the City\u2019s rejection of the proposal] will in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>way preclude future development of the property in a manner that is consistent with the County\u2019s General Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The City had earlier signaled a possible change of tack on the annexation of the Properties, reflected in resolution No. 11237, which the city council unanimously passed on January 13, 2003. Resolution No. 11237 noted that whereas the City accepted the task force proposals for the Properties in May 2000, recent public comments and position statements by county supervisors have advocated more limited development and a greater planning role for the County in any such development. The resolution also noted that \u201cthe County has substantial involvement in the annexation process and considerable influence in connection with any ultimate decision respecting annexation of [the Properties] to the City as well as being a principal participant in the necessary negotiation of a tax sharing agreement with the City and through its participation on LAFCO possesses the ability to make annexation infeasible following a lengthy land use entitlement process in the City that may likely require the City\u2019s defense of lawsuits and public referenda.\u201d Therefore, under the resolution, the city council directed staff \u201cto prepare proposed amendments to the City\u2019s General Plan relating to the [Properties], indicating the City\u2019s determination not to annex or to serve these lands and directing that LAFCO remove them from the City\u2019s Sphere of Influence and Urban Service area as appropriate and to bring such proposed amendments to the Planning Commission and City Council for public hearing and consideration for adoption. In doing so staff is directed to include policies continuing the City\u2019s long advocacy that any future development of [the Properties] in the County should provide for maximum creation of workforce housing while protecting unique environmental features and habitat values and providing a fair economic use of these lands for their owners. The City Council further directs the General Plan 2020 Steering Committee also consider such policies in their preparation of a draft General Plan 2020 consistent with such Council direction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Subsequently, \u201cgeneral plan 2020\u201d was developed and adopted by the city council in a resolution passed on November 15, 2004. General plan 2020 did not provide for the future annexation of the Properties. Accordingly, in the adopting resolution the city council instructed staff \u201cto formally request that the Marin [LAFCO] initiate proceedings to remove the [Properties] from the City\u2019s Sphere of Influence.\u201d The city council found that the 2020 plan is consistent with the intent of the Marin Countywide Plan to concentrate development in three environmental corridors, and which designates San Rafael within the \u201cCity-Centered Corridor.\u201d The council also found that plan 2020 is consistent with smart growth principles focusing on the development of community centers, including the downtown area and north San Rafael town center, appropriate design, mixed uses, and balanced transportation planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>St. Vincent\u2019s filed its complaint and petition for writ of mandate on December 13, 2004. After demurrers by the City, St. Vincent\u2019s filed the operative, second amended complaint on May 25, 2005. The complaint alleges: \u201cThe City abandoned the opportunity to have a substantial amount of affordable housing actually built [on the St. Vincent\u2019s property] within its expanded borders because it assumed that the political winds had shifted. Instead of allowing the development at St. Vincent\u2019s that the multiple City general plans and the Advisory Task Force anticipated, the City proposed and later adopted amendments to its General Plan that reverse land use policies that have been in place for decades.\u201d The complaint asserted various causes of action, including violations of CEQA and violations of state planning and zoning law, and sought a writ of mandate declaring the City\u2019s general plan 2020 invalid and void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><em>A </em>hearing on the petition for writ of mandate was held on September 19, 2006. On November 14, 2006, the trial court issued an order concluding that the City \u201cdid not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in deciding ... to approve its General Plan 2020 and in its earlier decision not to pursue annexation of [the St. Vincent\u2019s property].\u201d In addition, the court found that the City did not violate CEQA or state planning laws in approving plan 2020. Consequently, the court denied St. Vincent\u2019s petition for writ of mandate. Judgment in favor of the City, including costs of suit, was entered on November 29, 2006. St. Vincent\u2019s filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment on January 12, 2007. Subsequently, the trial court issued an order awarding the City costs in the amounts of $4,030.12 (for filing fees and court copy of administrative record) and $26,362.50 (information technology division fees for costs of retrieving e-mails).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">A. <em>General Plan Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that the City decided to exclude the Properties from its general plan in January 2003, <em>before </em>conducting any CEQA analysis or preparing an EIR, and without considering relevant evidence relating to planning and land use criteria or the regional welfare. In a similar vein, St. Vincent\u2019s contends that the City\u2019s removal of its lands from general plan 2020 was an unlawful reaction to St. Vincent\u2019s development application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On these grounds St. Vincent\u2019s contends the amendments to the general plan are unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">As St. Vincent\u2019s points out, agencies are required by law to carry out an environmental assessment of a project before approving it. <em>(Laurel- Heights </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number><em>Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394 [253 Cal. Rtpr. 426, 764 P.2d 278] [\u201c \u2018CEQA requires that an agency determine whether a project may have a significant environmental impact, and thus whether an EIR is required, <em>before </em>it approves that project.\u2019 \u201d].) We also acknowledge that an ordinance is an invalid exercise of a city\u2019s police power where it constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory rezoning. (See, e.g., <em>Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa Mesa </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 330, 337 [175 Cal.Rptr. 723] <em>(Arnel Development Co.) </em>[rezoning ordinance arbitrary and discriminatory where \u201cwithout any significant change in circumstances and without considering appropriate planning criteria,\u201d property is rezoned \u201cfor the sole purpose of defeating the development\u201d].) However, these legal precepts and authorities have no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">First, we reject the claim that the City amended its general plan without appropriate environmental review because there is no factual basis in the record to support it. Indeed, St. Vincent\u2019s contentions are founded on its characterization of resolution No. 11237 (passed on Jan. 13, 2003) as a final action requiring CEQA review. It was not. \u201c[Ajgencies must not \u2018take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures\u2019 \u201d without first carrying out CEQA review. <em>(Friends of the Sierra Railroad v. Tuolumne Park &amp; Recreation Dist. </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 643, 654 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 500].) Although \u201cagency action approving or opening the way for a future development can be part of a project and can trigger CEQA even if the action takes place prior to planning or approval of all the specific features of the planned development^] ... [&lt;][].. . CEQA review is premature if the agency action in question occurs too early in the planning process to allow meaningful analysis of potential impacts. Although environmental review must take place as early as is feasible, it also must be \u2018late enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment.\u2019 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15004, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 654-655.) Resolution No. 11237 was not a final decision on, or approval of, a project, which would have triggered CEQA review. Resolution No. 11237 did not by its terms <em>approve </em>changes to the general plan; rather, it directed staff to prepare amendments in line with certain guidelines, and bring those back for further consideration. In sum, we conclude the city council\u2019s passage of resolution No. 11237 did not trigger CEQA review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, St. Vincent\u2019s contentions on this point fail, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>record shows that the City <em>did </em>conduct an EIR as required under CEQA before adopting general plan 2020 in November 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We also reject St. Vincent\u2019s related contention that the amendments which removed its property from the City\u2019s general plan were an arbitrary and discriminatory action that exceeded the City\u2019s police powers. St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that \u201c[o]nce an application has been submitted for a development project, applicable land use regulations . . . cannot be changed simply to defeat the project.\u201d St. Vincent\u2019s cites <em>Arnel Development Co., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 330, as \u201can archetypical case applying this rule.\u201d The facts here, however, do not warrant application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In <em>Arnel Development Co., </em>the City of Costa Mesa approved a final development plan as well as a tentative tract map for 68 acres of land within the city boundaries owned by the Arnel Development Company (Arnel). <em>(Arnel Development Co., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d at pp. 333-334.) Following approval of the project, the city rezoned the property residential low and medium density \u201cconsistent with the general and specific plans for the express purpose of permitting the development.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 337.) Shortly after the city\u2019s approval of the Arnel development, a citizens group mounted an initiative petition to rezone the Arnel property single-family residential, which the voters subsequently adopted. Thereafter the city refused to approve a final tract map or issue building permits to Arnel. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 334.) The Court of Appeal stated that after enacting an ordinance rezoning the Arnel property consistent with its general plan, it would be arbitrary and discriminatory to later rezone the property \u201cfor the sole purpose of defeating the development\u201d absent no \u201csignificant change in circumstances and without considering appropriate planning criteria.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 337.) \u201cThe city\u2019s authority under the police power is no greater than otherwise it would be simply because the subsequent rezoning was accomplished by initiative,\u201d the Court of Appeal added. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, by contrast, the St. Vincent\u2019s property was never subject to the City\u2019s police power, was never annexed by the City, and the City never approved any development proposals for the property. Rather, the City <em>rejected </em>St. Vincent\u2019s application for annexation and prezoning, a decision which St. Vincent\u2019s did not appeal. Moreover, the City\u2019s actions in removing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>St. Vincent\u2019s lands from its sphere of influence were to preserve the zoning status quo, not alter it to St. Vincent\u2019s detriment as in <em>Arnel Development Co.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><em>Merritt v. City of Pleasanton </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1032 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 675] <em>(Merritt), </em>a case decided by Division One of this court, is much more instructive. <em>Merritt </em>involved an appeal from denial of writ of mandate after property owners sought to compel the City of Pleasanton to set aside Measure P, a referendum on the owners\u2019 development proposal for their property. <em>(Merritt, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) The property was unincorporated but was adjacent to the city and lay within its sphere of influence. The city had previously annexed land on both sides of the property. Owners submitted a proposal for a planned unit development (PUD) to construct 89 single-family homes. The city \u201cadopted Ordinance No. 1769, approving a prezoning of the site to PUD, low-density residential.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the approved prezoning never occurred. Before ordinance No. 1769 took effect, residents raised enough petition signatures to submit the PUD to a referendum process known as \u201cMeasure P.\u201d (89 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1034-1035.) After Measure P was defeated at the polls the owners filed a petition for writ of mandate \u201carguing that the defeat of Measure P created an inconsistency with the City\u2019s general plan by \u2018promulgating an \u201cunincorporated\u201d zoning designation for the Property inconsistent with general plan objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs.\u2019 \u201d (89 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">On appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the writ, the owners contended that Measure P was arbitrary and capricious, and unfairly discriminated against the property, citing <em>Arnel Development Co. (Merritt, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 1038.) The Court of Appeal rejected the owners\u2019 contention, stating: \u201cIn the present case, unlike the situation in <em>Arnel Development Co., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 330, the electorate did not change the Property\u2019s land use designation to preclude a particular type of needed housing. The defeat of Measure P simply maintained the status quo. In addition, unlike the situation in <em>Arnel, </em>the City\u2019s general plan was not amended to call for the immediate development of the Property, and there is no specific plan that calls for the development proposed by appellants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1038.) This is exactly the situation here. General plan 2020 maintained the status quo and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>change the St. Vincent\u2019s property\u2019s prevailing land use designation to preclude a particular type of development, or indeed, to preclude any type of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In sum, we conclude that in adopting general plan 2020, including amendments which removed the St. Vincent\u2019s property from its sphere of influence for planning purposes, the City did not exceed its police powers by acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner and without conducting an environmental review. St. Vincent\u2019s may have preferred to remain within the City\u2019s sphere of influence and ultimately to have been annexed to the City, but such preferences do not translate into a legal right to such annexation. <em>(Rancho La Costa </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 54, 63 [168 Cal.Rptr. 491] [\u201cWe know of no authority which gives a property owner a vested right to have his property included within the boundaries of any particular city, district or authority. The prospect one\u2019s property might become more valuable if it is annexed to the city where certain special services are available at a more reasonable cost is a pleasant contemplation for a landowner, but it is certainly not a vested right.\u201d]; <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 381, 389 [142 Cal.Rpt. 873] [\u201cAnd no one has any <em>right, </em>constitutional or otherwise, to be included, or excluded, from a proposed annexation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">B. <em>CEQA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">St. Vincent\u2019s also challenges the sufficiency of the City\u2019s CEQA review of general plan 2020 on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">\u201cIn a case challenging an agency\u2019s compliance with CEQA, we review the agency\u2019s action, not the trial court\u2019s decision. [Citation.] In doing so, our \u2018inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [Citations.] Substantial evidence in this context means \u2018enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1446-1447 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Moreover, \u201c[w]e do not review the correctness of the EIR\u2019s environmental conclusions, but only its sufficiency as an informative document. [Citation.] \u2018We may not set aside an agency\u2019s approval of an EIR on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable. \u201cOur limited function is consistent with the principle that \u2018The purpose of CEQA is not to generate paper, but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind. CEQA does not, indeed cannot, guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor environmental considerations.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] We may not, in sum, substitute our judgment for that of the people and their local representatives. We can and must, however, scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Save Round Valley Alliance v.

As one court put it: \u201c \u2018CEQA nowhere calls for evaluation of the impacts of a proposed project on an existing general plan; it concerns itself with the impacts of the project on the environment, defined as the existing physical conditions in the affected area. The legislation evinces no interest in the effects of proposed general plan amendments on an existing general plan, but instead has clearly expressed concern with the effects of projects on the actual environment upon which the proposal will operate.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 709 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 102] <em>(Woodward Park).) </em>Noting that \u201c[a] number of other cases reach similar conclusions [citations],\u201d the <em>Woodward Park </em>court summarized the rule of those cases as follows: \u201c \u2018[I]n assessing the impacts of a project proposed for an undeveloped piece of property, agencies should compare project impacts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>against the existing environment, rather than some hypothetical, impacted future environment that might occur without the project under existing general plan and/or zoning designations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Woodward Park, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at pp. 709-710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The EIR adequately addressed the impacts of the proposed amendments against existing conditions on the ground. Regarding proposed land use changes, the EIR clearly describes a \u201closs of 943 acres from the Planning Area, . . . [which] represents the removal of [the Properties] . . . including] 581 acres of Commercial-Mixed Use land (St. Vincent\u2019s/Silveira designation) and 363 acres of Parks and Open Space land.\u201d The EIR analyzed the environmental impacts and mitigation measures of such land use changes. The EIR concluded that such land use changes would not conflict with other adopted plans, such as the Marin County Zoning Ordinance and Marin Countywide Plan; that development consistent with general plan 2020 (Plan 2020) would not induce substantial growth and concentration of the City\u2019s population, especially when placed in a regional context; and that such development would result in a jobs-to-housing ratio of 1.52, representing \u201copportunities for more local workers to reside in the community, which has the potential to reduce future traffic generation.\u201d The EIR analyzed the growth-inducing impacts of the general plan amendments. It stated that \u201cdevelopment in line with General Plan 2020 would result in up to . . . 5,104 additional households and 12,078 more residents within the Planning Area over existing conditions. While [Plan 2020] would accommodate this growth, in some instances it would have the effect of restricting development due to changes in land use designations. . . . Moreover, the proposed changes would be expected to concentrate urban development in areas that already have urban services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Moreover, the City specifically addressed the issue of \u201cdisplacement\u201d or \u201cleapfrog development\u201d in its response to St. Vincent\u2019s comment on the EIR. The response notes Plan 2020 identified a list of housing sites, some of which will be rezoned to permit housing in districts where it is not currently allowed. With such proposed rezoning, the response notes Plan 2020 anticipates that \u201call of the housing sites listed for the 1999-2007 planning period will be available for housing development with reasonable access to public services and without unusually high development costs.\u201d In sum, the EIR presents a \u201cfair argument\u201d that the Plan 2020 amendments to remove the Properties from the City\u2019s sphere of influence will not result in overspill or leapfrog development into surrounding areas. <em>(Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1446-1447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">St. Vincent\u2019s also contends that the City violated CEQA by failing to compare project impacts to the impacts of the no-project alternative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that the EIR failed to \u201ccompare the growth inducing implications of [the] two plans [Plan 2000 and Plan 2020] and their relative growth displacement effects.\u201d However, this claim is belied by the record because the EIR included an analysis of three alternatives to Plan 2020: \u201cAlternative 1. No Project / No Development\u2014existing conditions, no further development; Alternative 2. No Project / No Action / <em>General Plan </em>2000\u2014 continued development under <em>General Plan </em>2000; Alternative 3. Reduced Development\u2014a lower intensity development alternative.\u201d The EIR assessed the impacts of these alternatives and compared them to Plan 2020 across a whole range of factors, including land use, transportation, air quality, noise, and public services. Moreover, the EIR notes that \u201c[ijmpacts of development at the [Properties] are therefore discussed in Alternative 2, the No Project / No Action / <em>General Plan 2000 </em>Alternative since <em>General Plan 2000 </em>included development policies for the properties.\u201d In sum, the EIR adequately addressed alternatives to the Plan 2020.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">C. <em>The City\u2019s Housing Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">1. <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">A city\u2019s broad police power is the constitutional source for its authority \u201cto regulate land through planning, zoning, and building ordinances, thereby protecting public health, safety and welfare.

[Citation.] . . . [T]he court\u2019s role in determining a mandamus challenge to a locality\u2019s housing element is simply to determine whether the locality has satisfied statutory requirements. It is not to reach the merits of the element or to interfere with the exercise of the locality\u2019s discretion in making substantive determinations and conclusions about local housing issues, needs, and concerns.\u201d <em>(Fonseca, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.4th at p. 1185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we independently ascertain as a question of law whether the housing element at issue substantially complies with the req\u00fairements of the Housing Element Law, substantial compliance meaning \u2018 \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cactual </em>compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cmere technical imperfections of form.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] In our independent review of the housing element\u2019s legal adequacy, we afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusions.

[Citation.] Our review thus comes down to independently determining whether the housing element at issue is in substantial compliance with applicable statutory requirements, i.e., does it contain the elements mandated by the statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1191-1192, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">St. Vincent\u2019s contends that the City\u2019s housing element fails to comply with the statutory requirements of section 65583. Specifically, St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that the City\u2019s housing element does not identify adequate sites for residential development, in violation of section'65583, subdivision (c)(1). According to St. Vincent\u2019s, \u201cin a poorly conceived effort to make up for the loss of residential land caused by its abandonment of the St. Vincent\u2019s and Silveira sites, the City suddenly discovered new \u2018infill\u2019 and \u2018redevelopment\u2019 sites for housing\u201d but failed \u201cto show that development of residential uses on these sites during the five year planning cycle is feasible.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The City\u2019s housing element included the inventory of land suitable for residential development required under section 65583, subdivision (a)(3). The inventory included an analysis of the residential potential in the various land use districts, identifying a total of 395 acres of vacant/underdeveloped land with a potential yield of 5,091 additional units. The inventory also included analysis of how many of those potential additional units could be developed within the 1999-2007 timeframe of the housing element by looking at single-family sites and second units, multifamily sites, mixed use sites, and sites currently zoned nonresidential where housing will be allowed pending land use and zoning changes in Plan 2020; by identifying specific downtown development sites, including potential sites with planning application pending and other potential sites for downtown housing development; and by identifying the potential for housing development in other specific areas, such as the Loch Lomond Marina, Marin Square, the area around Davidson Middle School and the commercial and office areas around Northgate Town Center. On that basis, it states that 1,468 units are available to be developed (more than the City\u2019s remaining regional housing need of 928 units), and that the residential potential \u201cexceeds [the City\u2019s] remaining regional housing need for 800 units for very low [418], low [130], and moderate income households (252).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Regarding section 65583, subdivision (c)\u2019s requirement for a five-year schedule of actions, the housing element includes an analysis of plans and programs to promote and develop identified housing needs over this time-frame. These include policies for the funding of affordable housing; for the protection of existing housing stock and use; for innovative housing initiatives (e.g., limited equity cooperatives and \u201csweat equity\u201d housing); to maintain an adequate supply of land designated for all types of residential development; to promote mixed use development allowing residential uses in commercial areas; and to allow higher densities on sites adjacent to transit hubs. Additionally, the housing element satisfied the requirements of section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A) by identifying adequate sites and analyzing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>required infrastructure needs of the sites. For example, the housing element described specific multifamily sites that are currently available and outlined the factors that would make those sites favorable to housing development, such as the ready availability of public facilities, services and infrastructure, incentives such as density bonuses, and the predominance of similar uses in the vicinity of the site. It also describes five downtown redevelopment sites for which development applications were pending for over 200 units. And it contains an analysis of potential mixed use sites in downtown San Rafael, discussing incentives for development, such as lower parking requirements, higher allowable densities, and height bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">St. Vincent\u2019s, however, demands more. Relying on <em>Hoffmaster </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1112-1113 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 684] (Hoffmaster), St. Vincent\u2019s argues that the City failed in its \u201caffirmative duty to demonstrate how its newly-conceived housing strategy could actually produce the units it claimed.\u201d <em>Hoffmaster </em>imposed no such affirmative duty, nor did the applicable planning statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Hoffmaster, </em>representatives of homeless persons in the City of San Diego claimed the city\u2019s housing element failed \u201cto comply with section 65583, subdivision (c)(1) by neither properly designating adequate real property sites which [the city] would make available for homeless emergency shelters and transitional housing, nor providing a five-year action plan to implement the goals and policies of the housing element by various means, including facilitating the development of emergency shelters and transitional housing on designated sites.\u201d <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The appellate court stated that in order \u201c[t]o substantially comply with the identification of adequate sites requirement of subdivision (c)(1) here, [the city] must provide an inventory of sites which will be made available through features of its program to meet its quantified housing objectives as to the homeless.\u201d <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1112.) However, the court further stated that \u201cfor identification to be meaningful, it must necessarily be specific. It must set forth sites which will be available to be developed, without restrictive zoning burdens which combined with the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) factor (discussed at length in separate council hearings) become insurmountable or produce protracted delays and deterrent cost increases. Available sites should be officially designated and publicized, preferably in the housing element, for this use. Finally, through its action program, [the city] bears the responsibility to ensure the regulatory process actually encourages the development of emergency shelters and transitional housing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1114.) After examining the city\u2019s action program, the court concluded that \u201cthrough its blanket CUP [conditional use permit] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>requirement and the quarter-mile geographical restriction, the residential care facility ordinance as presently constituted substantially constrains siting homeless facilities for emergency shelter and meaningful transitional housing in any location within [the city].\u201d <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1115). Moreover, the court further concluded that the remaining features of the city\u2019s program did not sufficiently offset the effect of this restrictive ordinance, resulting in a housing element which failed to meaningfully identify adequate sites available for development of both emergency shelter and transitional housing to meet the city\u2019s quantified objectives as to the homeless. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1115-1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The thrust of the appellate court\u2019s analysis in <em>Hoffmaster </em>is not that a city\u2019s housing element must demonstrate how its housing strategy will \u201cactually produce\u201d a specific number of housing units. Rather, it is that a city is not in substantial compliance with section 65583, subdivision (c)(1) simply because it identifies suitable sites to meet an identified housing need, if it then places planning and zoning restrictions in the way of any actual development of those sites to meet the identified housing need. <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1117 [\u201cWithin a zoning and land-use context, . . . [a]dequate funding and ownership of land does not equate to available usable sites, <em>absent a program of zoning development controls, meaningful regulatory concessions and incentives which will permit and encourage such development\u2019 </em>(italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">There is no such flaw, however, in the City\u2019s housing element here. As noted above, the City has tailored its regulatory activities and zoning controls to <em>maximize </em>the potential for housing development at identified sites, not to frustrate development as in <em>Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 1098. The City has developed policies to change zoning in order to allow housing in sites not currently zoned residential; reduce parking standards and increase height bonuses for downtown developments; revise its second unit ordinance to reduce the time and cost of adding second units to existing single-family homes; establish fee waivers, including traffic impact, planning, and building fees for affordable housing projects; to utilize the City\u2019s priority project selection program (PSP), which allocates traffic capacity to proposed development projects, to encourage affordable housing projects; and to permit density bonuses above and beyond those mandated by state law pursuant to the City\u2019s inclusionary housing ordinance. In sum, while St. Vincent\u2019s may disagree with the City\u2019s policy decision to base its housing element on fostering development within existing city limits instead of annexation, it has failed in its burden to overcome the presumption that the housing element is valid and show it is not in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements. <em>(Fonseca, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1191-1192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>D. <em>Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The trial court awarded the City costs \u201clisted as Information Technology Division fees in the amount of $26,362.50.\u201d The trial court stated: \u201cThese costs are described as time spent in the email search and production efforts of City programmers or analysts, calculated at a \u2018fully burdened\u2019 rate. After argument [on St. Vincent\u2019s motion to tax costs], the court again reviewed the record in this case and can recall petitioner\u2019s insistence that the record be augmented with the parties\u2019 email exchanges. The court will allow the staff time spent in this cumbersome retrieval process, but will not award the attorneys\u2019 fees claimed as attributable to these efforts.\u201d St. Vincent\u2019s does not dispute that the City incurred these costs, or that they were reasonable and necessary for the litigation, nor does it challenge the rates at which the costs were assessed. Rather, St. Vincent\u2019s contends that the award of costs is barred as a matter of law both by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 and by the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">1. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Public Resources Code section 21167.6 (hereafter section 21167.6) provides that at the time a CEQA action is filed, \u201cthe plaintiff or petitioner shall file a request that the respondent public agency prepare the record of proceedings relating to the subject of the action or proceeding. The request, together with the complaint or petition, shall be served personally upon the public agency not later than 10 business days from the date that the action or proceeding was filed.\u201d (\u00a7 21167.6, subd.

Thereafter, \u201c[t]he public agency shall prepare and certify the record of proceedings not later than 60 days from the date that the request specified in subdivision (a) was served upon the public agency. Upon certification, the public agency shall lodge a copy of the record of proceedings with the court and shall serve on the parties notice that the record of proceedings has been certified and lodged with the court. <em>The parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the record of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 21167.6, subd.

[][] First, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the party who prevails in any action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>or proceeding \u2018is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs.\u2019 (Code Civ.

St. Vincent\u2019s, however, asserts that the rule of <em>Wagner Farms </em>does not apply here because, pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), it elected to prepare the record, and CEQA authorizes recovery of costs for record preparation only by a prevailing party who has actually prepared the record. St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that \u201c[i]n no reported case has a court awarded costs of record preparation to a party where the other party elected to prepare the record of proceedings.\u201d St. Vincent\u2019s further asserts that the very purpose of the rule allowing a petitioner to prepare the record of proceedings is to \u201callow[] the petitioner to control the costs of record preparation\u201d and this purpose is frustrated by an award of costs to the City for purposes of record preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We are not persuaded. In the first place, the City is not seeking to recover the <em>entire cost </em>for preparation of the record of proceedings (ROP) because it did not prepare the ROP, St. Vincent\u2019s did. Rather, the question here is whether the City is precluded by St. Vincent\u2019s election under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2) from recovering <em>any costs whatsoever </em>in connection with preparation of the record, even when the City is the prevailing party, and even when the City incurred certain extraordinary costs at St. Vincent\u2019s behest. As explained below, we do not think such a blanket preclusion on costs to the prevailing party sits well with the cost-containment policy embodied in section 21167.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">\n<em>(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The cost-containment policy embodied in section 21167.6 was explained in <em>Hayward Area Planning Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 176 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 783] <em>(City of Hayward), </em>a decision issued by Division Five of this court. There, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate against the city, alleging noncompliance with CEQA. <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 179.) The developer of the affected project was identified as the real party in interest. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the city advised the plaintiffs regarding the anticipated volume of the record and costs associated with its preparation, the plaintiffs elected to have the city prepare the ROP, pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (a). (128 Cal.App.4th at p. 179.) However, the city, apparently in order to ensure timely completion of the record, asked the developer\u2019s attorneys to prepare the ROP. The plaintiffs were never advised of this arrangement, and the final record was much longer than the city\u2019s original projection. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Subsequently, the trial court denied the writ petition, entered judgment in favor of the city, and awarded both the city and the developer costs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The developer sought over $50,000 in costs, mostly associated with preparation of the ROP. <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 180.) The plaintiffs moved to tax costs on various grounds, including that costs of record production were not properly awarded to the developer because preparation of the record was the responsibility of the city under section 21167.6, subdivision (a). (128 Cal.App.4th at p. 180.) The trial court agreed, but rather than denying the developer\u2019s costs entirely, it taxed the costs to reflect what costs would have been incurred had the city prepared the record itself, and awarded costs in the reduced amount of $20,359.65. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s decision to award the developer costs. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">On appeal, the issue was one \u201cof statutory construction: does section 21167.6 authorize the court to award the costs of preparing a CEQA administrative record to a real party in interest absent Plaintiffs\u2019 consent?\u201d <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.) The appellate court noted that the statute did not expressly bar a real party in interest from recovering costs of preparing the record. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 183.) However, language in section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1) that \u201c \u2018[t]he parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the record of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court\u2019 \u201d was ambiguous, the court added. (128 Cal.App.4th at p. 183.) On the one hand, \u201c[bjecause the provision appears in subdivision (b)(1), which authorizes the public agency to prepare the record, it can be construed to permit only the public agency to claim those costs. On the other hand, as [the developer] argues, it can be construed to allow costs to any party because the only express restriction is that costs be awarded in conformance with applicable law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Construing the ambiguity \u201cin a manner consistent with the statutory scheme and purpose,\u201d the court observed that \u201cthe three-part scheme for preparing the record advances the legislative purpose of enabling the petitioner to minimize the cost of record preparation. When the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>prepared under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), either the petitioner directly controls the costs by its personal assumption of the task or it indirectly controls the costs by consenting to an alternative arrangement. When the agency prepares the record under section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(1), costs are controlled in three ways. First, as occurred in this case, the petitioner may request an initial cost estimate to inform its decision whether to prepare the record itself. That cost estimate serves as a restraint on the agency\u2019s ultimate recovery of costs. Second, the agency has a duty to act in the public interest and it is accountable to its constituents for the use of public funds. Had the City here, for example, contracted with [the developer] and assumed responsibility for the costs in the first instance, it would have been required to file a cost bill in its own name. Third, the agency is bound by the statutory mandate to minimize costs, which the trial court enforces by taxing unreasonable costs. (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (f).)\u201d <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 183-184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\u201cIn the circumstances of this case,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthe cost restraints inherent\u201d in \u201cthe statutory scheme for controlling the costs of record preparation\u201d had been undermined in various ways by the city\u2019s delegation to the developer of the task of record production. <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 184.) For example, \u201c[u]nlike a public agency, a developer real party in interest has a strong financial interest in the outcome and is free to act purely in its private interest. Because the City did not directly incur any liability for the costs, it had no incentive to control those costs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 185.) The court further concluded that \u201c[t]he City\u2019s delegation of the task to [the developer] also undermined the statutory purpose of expediting CEQA litigation. (See \u00a7 21167.1, subd. (a).) As a result of the skewed incentives caused by the delegation, the mounting costs of record preparation did not come under scrutiny until the end of the trial court proceedings. Under the Legislature\u2019s scheme, either the plaintiff or the defendant public agency or both would have had reason to control those costs as the record was being prepared, promoting efficiency and limiting the need for time consuming litigation and judicial intervention.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 185.) Accordingly, the court held that \u201cin order to preserve the statutory scheme and purpose of section 21167.6, subdivision (b), the public agency must itself incur and seek recovery of the costs of record preparation when the record is prepared under subdivision (b)(1). Because that did not occur in this case, costs must be denied.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\n<em>(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\"><em>City of Hayward </em>is highly instructive in resolving the issue of statutory interpretation presented here, which is: does section 21167.6 preclude an award of costs in favor of the prevailing party in any amount in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>with record preparation if the plaintiff elects to prepare the record pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2)? As in <em>City of Hayward, </em>the statutory language is ambiguous on this issue, and for much the same reasons. The statute does not expressly prohibit costs under these circumstances. On the one hand, the reference to \u201creasonable costs\u201d is in subdivision (b)(1), which governs the public agency\u2019s preparation of the record, so it could be construed to permit only the public agency to claim those costs when it prepares the record. On the other hand, it may not preclude the public agency from claiming costs associated with record preparation even when it did not prepare the record if such an award is \u201cin conformance with\u201d applicable law (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (b)(1)), such as Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), which provides that a party who prevails in any action or proceeding \u201cis entitled as a matter of right to recover costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">As in <em>City of Hayward, </em>therefore, we must decide this issue in light of the statutory scheme to expedite and contain costs in CEQA litigation. (See <em>City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 184-185.) We conclude that under the circumstances presented here, the statutory purpose of section 21167.6 is best served by upholding the award of costs against St. Vincent\u2019s in connection with record preparation. St. Vincent\u2019s elected to prepare the record pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). By doing so, it undertook the solemn statutory obligation to \u201cstrive [to prepare the record] at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the record.\u201d (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\n<em>(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">In connection with this litigation, the City assembled 2,208 documents amounting to over 58,000 pages over a period between December 2004 and April 2005. Given the massive amount of documentation involved, the City required, and St. Vincent\u2019s stipulated to, three extensions of time to certify the record. The City finally turned over 20 boxes of documents to St. Vincent\u2019s in April 2005. St. Vincent\u2019s noted that the 20 boxes contained only a few e-mails, so in June 2005 it submitted a Public Records Act request to the City asking for \u201call writings evidencing or reflecting communications, stored on computer hard drive or server of any City employee, relating to or in connection with St. Vincent\u2019s property or the Silveira property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">This request resulted in further delay. In July 2005, the City advised that over nine boxes\u2019 worth of e-mails would have to be vetted for responsiveness. The parties stipulated to an extension of time through August 2005, so that the City could complete this review. In October 2005, however, the city attorney\u2019s office was still working on reviewing and sorting the e-mails retrieved as a result of St. Vincent\u2019s request. The City\u2019s search for e-mails did not conclude until December 2005, and the responsive, nonprivileged e-mails were then forwarded to counsel for St. Vincent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>St. Vincent\u2019s was not satisfied with the City\u2019s production of e-mails. In a January 9, 2006, case management statement, St. Vincent\u2019s stated that \u201cproduction is incomplete and the City states that it is complete. The parties are attempting to resolve the issue so that the record can be completed.\u201d However, on January 11, 2006, St. Vincent\u2019s served a demand for inspection on the City, listing 15 further demands for documents. In a June 26, 2006, case management statement, St. Vincent\u2019s recited the history of its request for e-mails, stating that because the City did not routinely discard e-mails from its computer system, its search had resulted in \u201cnine boxes of potentially responsive emails.\u201d However, St. Vincent\u2019s continued, the City only \u201cproduced two stacks totaling less than two inches of paper. These emails were almost entirely non-substantive . . . and largely duplicated each other.\u201d St. Vincent\u2019s recited that it had demanded an explanation as to why the City \u201cwithheld[] so many emails\u201d and had served a demand for inspection. In response, St. Vincent\u2019s related, the City had identified five classes of privileged documents and, after a meet-and-confer process, the City had produced a privilege log covering 181 documents. St. Vincent\u2019s complained that to date it \u201chas received no explanation for the apparently vast number of emails that have been withheld.\u201d St. Vincent\u2019s added that on April 26, 2006, it had filed its opening brief on the mandate claims \u201calthough the record of proceedings had not yet been certified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\n<em>(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">This record reflects a total disregard for cost containment on St. Vincent\u2019s part, and a complete abandonment of its statutory duty to \u201cstrive to [prepare the record] at reasonable cost.\u201d (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (f).) After three extensions of time, the City gave St. Vincent\u2019s 20 boxes of documents in April 2005. St. Vincent\u2019s then subjected the City to a costly and lengthy process of trawling through its entire computer system in response to an extremely broad and unbounded search for \u201call writings evidencing or reflecting communications . . . relating to or in connection with the St. Vincent\u2019s property or the Silveira property.\u201d And St. Vincent\u2019s rationale for this?\u2014not because it had identified any \u201cgaps\u201d in the voluminous planning documents contained in the 20 boxes, but because it was not satisfied with the number of e-mails contained in the 20 boxes. In abandoning its statutory duty to contain costs, St. Vincent\u2019s may be likened to the developer real party in interest in <em>City of Hayward </em>who, \u201c[ujnlike a public agency, . . . has a strong financial interest in the outcome and is free to act purely in its private interest.\u201d <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 185.) Moreover, because St. Vincent\u2019s, like the City of Hayward, \u201cdid not directly incur any liability for the [additional] costs [of the computer search], it had no incentive to control those costs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 185.) Furthermore, as in <em>City of Hayward, </em>St. Vincent\u2019s discovery actions also \u201cundermined the statutory purpose of expediting CEQA litigation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>The statute provides that the record should be prepared and certified within 60 days (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (b)(1)), but this record was not certified until July 18, 2006, 15 months after the City delivered 20 boxes of documents to St. Vincent\u2019s. <em>It is telling that after all this, St. Vincent\u2019s does not mention one single e-mail, obtained in response to its request, which provided information that bolstered any of its claims in this case. Indeed, we wonder what the point of it all was, because, as noted, St. Vincent\u2019s filed its brief before the issue of the e-mails was ever resolved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In conclusion, as in <em>City of Hayward, </em>the circumstances here demonstrate that \u201cthe cost restraints inherent\u201d in \u201cthe statutory scheme for controlling the costs of record preparation\u201d have been undermined by St. Vincent\u2019s additional, broad, unrestricted, and, apparently nonessential, discovery demands. <em>(City of Hayward, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 184.) St. Vincent\u2019s actions, which caused the City to expend considerable time and resources in responding to its discovery demands, reflect a complete abandonment of its statutory responsibility to \u201cstrive to [prepare the record] at reasonable cost.\u201d (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (f).) The ensuing delay to the CEQA litigation process caused by St. Vincent\u2019s demands also \u201cundermined the statutory purpose of expediting CEQA litigation.\u201d <em>(City of Hayward, </em>supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 185.)  Accordingly, we hold that where necessary to preserve the statutory purposes of cost containment and expediting CEQA litigation, the prevailing party in a CEQA action may recover \u201creasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation\u201d (\u00a7 21167.6, subd. (b)(1)) of the record, even if the nonprevailing party elected to prepare the record pursuant to section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would only reward litigants who, like St. Vincent\u2019s, elect to prepare the record but then ignore the concomitant statutory duty to restrain costs in doing so. In light of our holding that section 21167.6 does not preclude an award of costs in favor of the City, we will not disturb on appeal the trial court\u2019s exercise of its sound discretion in awarding information technology fees in the amount of $26,362.50. <em>(River Valley Preservation Project v.

City of Albany </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1199 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 102], cited by St. Vincent\u2019s, is easily distinguishable. There, the Court of Appeal noted that CEQA \u201cdefines the term \u2018project\u2019 to include an activity involving the issuance of an \u2018entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.\u2019 [Citation.] Since the development agreement gave Ladbroke a vested right to complete a gaming facility within certain clear and narrowly defined parameters, it constituted an \u2018entitlement for use\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d (56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1215.) Accordingly, the court concluded the project was subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>to CEQA review, and that such review should have been conducted before a voter ballot on the project because \u201cthe city council submitted a fully negotiated development agreement to the voters, together with other measures required for its immediate implementation. The negotiation of the 95-page development agreement\u2014from the time of Ladbroke\u2019s initial application for a development agreement through the processes of staff review and three public hearings\u2014 unquestionably involved the exercise of judgment and deliberation, culminating in a decision to adopt an agreement with specific negotiated terms.\u201d (56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1219.) Here, St. Vincent\u2019s had no vested development rights and no negotiated agreement with the City, and the city council\u2019s resolution No. 11237 to consider proposed amendments to the general plan bears none of the hallmarks of finality noted in <em>Citizens for Responsible Government.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> St. Vincent\u2019s also relies on <em>Ross v.

In <em>Ross, </em>the city applied a one-acre restriction to prevent a homeowner from building a second home on his 1.117-acre lot, which was surrounded by parcels of lesser size zoned at 1.8 houses per acre. The Court of Appeal held that this was an example of discriminatory land use legislation known as spot zoning, \u201c \u2018[w]here a small parcel is restricted and given less rights than the surrounding property.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ross, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 960.) <em>Ross </em>is not instructive because spot zoning is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> For example, St. Vincent\u2019s asserts that \u201cat issue here is a change in policy, from one encouraging feasible and reasonable development of housing on [the Properties], to one precluding development there.\u201d That is simply not the case.
