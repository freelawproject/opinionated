Gates, Jr.\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on C-WIN\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate. C-WIN\u2019s petition requested that the trial court set aside the water supply assessment (WSA) prepared by the Water District at the request of the City as a part of the City\u2019s environmental impact report (EIR) and review process required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) for a large-scale industrial/business park development proposed by GateKing Properties. The Water District and the City filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, asserting among various arguments, that C-WIN\u2019s action was premature, and that a WSA is not subject to direct judicial review in mandamus proceedings. The trial court agreed, noting that WSA\u2019s are properly challenged as part of CEQA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">On appeal, C-WIN asserts that it is entitled to directly challenge a WSA by way of either administrative or traditional mandamus because the WSA is a final determination by the water supplier concerning the sufficiency of the water supply for a proposed project, that it is not required to exhaust its administrative remedies with the City because the City lacks the authority to grant C-WIN the relief it seeks, and that without an opportunity to assert a direct challenge the water suppliers will be able to evade direct review of the WSA. We do not agree. As we shall explain the WSA is a technical informational document and not a \u201cfinal\u201d act or determination subject to direct mandamus review; C-WIN failed to exhaust its administrative remedies; the City had the authority to address C-WIN\u2019s claims concerning the WSA; and until the City certified the EIR and approved the project, the adequacy of the WSA was not subject to judicial challenge. In our view, the adequacy of WSA is properly challenged as a part of a challenge to an EIR after project approval. Consequently, the trial court here properly granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings and accordingly we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">GateKing Properties proposed building a 584-acre industrial/business park (the Project) located near the intersection of the Golden State Freeway (1-5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>and the Antelope Valley Freeway (1-14) in the City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As required by CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the City was required to prepare and certify an EIR before it could approve the Project. Because the industrial park met the definition of \u201cproject\u201d under the Water Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the City was required to include a WSA in the EIR to assess the sufficiency of water supplies for the Project before the City could approve it. At the request of the City, the respondent Water District prepared the WSA for the Project. Thereafter, the City included the WSA in its EIR. On June 24, 2003, after a formal review and comment period the City certified the EIR (the 2003 EIR) and approved the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">The California Oak Foundation, the Santa Clarita Oak Conservancy and the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (collectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>know as SCOPE) petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SCOPE requested the trial court order the City to set aside its certification of the final EIR and related resolutions approving the Project. SCOPE claimed that the approval of the Project, and the EIR supporting it, violated CEQA because the EIR overstated and misstated the extent of reliable sources of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The trial court found the EIR to be adequate and denied the petition for a writ of mandate in March 2004. SCOPE appealed arguing among other contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the EIR\u2019s conclusion that sufficient water supplies existed for the project.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>California Oak Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1223-1224.) Division Eight of this district concluded the trial court erred in approving the EIR because the section of the EIR discussing water supplies was inadequate, but found no other defects in the EIR, or other reversible errors. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1244.) Specifically Division Eight found that the EIR did not adequately discuss or examine the legal uncertainties surrounding the availability of 41,000-acre feet per year (afy) of imported water and failed to fully explain the conclusion that water supplies were sufficient notwithstanding the uncertainties. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1236-1243.) Division Eight ordered the trial court to decertify the 2003 EIR for the Project and to retain jurisdiction until the lower court determined that the City\u2019s revised EDR. complied with CEQA. (133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1245.) In February 2006, the trial court issued a writ of mandate ordering the City to decertify the 2003 EIR and to stay the City\u2019s Project approvals until it prepared and certified a revised EIR that was consistent with the opinion expressed in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>and which complied with CEQA. The lower court further directed the City to file a return to the writ to demonstrate compliance by mid-September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Thereafter, the City requested the Water District to prepare and adopt a new WSA for the Project. The Water District prepared a new WSA. Prior to the adoption of the new WSA by the Water District, C-WIN objected and urged the Water District not to approve the new WSA as proposed. On March 9, 2006, the Water District\u2019s board considered and adopted the new WSA at its regular meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>On May 16, 2006, before the City had an opportunity to review and evaluate the new WSA and incorporate it into the revised EIR,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> C-WIN filed a petition in the superior court for a preemptory writ of mandate (under Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1094.5 &amp; 1085 as well as Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910 et seq.) and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Water District<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alleging the new WSA was legally deficient and misleading in a number of respects.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">In October of 2006 the Water District, the City and GateKing filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the petition, arguing among other things that (1) the WSA was a technical informational document and not a final act or determination subject to review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5; (2) a WSA was neither a ministerial or legislative action subject to review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085; (3) C-WIN had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that C-WIN must object to the lead agency (i.e., the City) first and that until the City had recertified the EIR and approved the Project the adequacy of the WSA was not subject to judicial challenge; (4) C-WIN lacks standing to challenge the WSA and that C-WIN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>had failed to name the proper respondent in the action; and (5) the Water Code does not provide for private third party claims challenging a WSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">On January 11, 2007, the trial court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds articulated by the Water District, the City and GateKing, noting that \u201cWSA\u2019s are not immune from judicial review, but must be challenged and reviewed as part of CEQA review.\u201d The court dismissed C-WIN\u2019s petition with prejudice and entered judgment against C-WIN.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">C-WIN timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">On appeal, C-WIN asserts the court erred in granting the judgment on the pleadings because it is entitled to assert a direct challenge to the adequacy of the WSA in a mandamus proceeding under either Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 or section 1085. As we explain below, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">Before turning to the underlying contentions, however, we address one preliminary matter. Specifically we examine the effect of the trial court\u2019s Statement of Decision in the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>case on the matter before us. Indeed, C-WIN\u2019s underlying complaints concerning the WSA in this matter are nearly identical to those SCOPE asserted concerning the revised EIR, which the trial court rejected in discharging the writ in the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">I. <em>Effect of the Trial Court\u2019s Statement of Decision in </em>California Oak Foundation</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">In January 2008, this court requested that the parties submit additional briefing in this appeal on the legal effect, if any, of the trial court\u2019s conclusions in the Statement of Decision in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>on the sufficiency of the revised WSA. Respondents asserted C-WIN\u2019s claims are the same as those asserted by the plaintiffs in <em>California Oak Foundation, </em>contending the trial court\u2019s Statement of Decision in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>resolved the underlying contentions in C-WIN\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate filed in this case. Acknowledging the Statement of Decision is now pending on appeal, respondents further maintain that when the Statement of Decision becomes final the appeal in this matter will be moot and thus, they requested that this court stay this appeal until the appeal of the Statement of Decision in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>is resolved. C-WIN conceded this appeal might become moot based on the outcome of the appeal in <em>California Oak Foundation, </em>and joined in the request that we stay this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>We deny the request to stay this appeal. Even if the final decision in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>effectively moots C-WIN\u2019s underlying challenge to the revised WSA, the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>decision will not resolve the significant matters of first impression at issue in this appeal. The courts have developed various doctrines to permit the appellate review of a case in which it is no longer possible to remedy the injury giving rise to the request for review. One exception to the mootness doctrine applies to those controversies that are capable of repetition and yet evade review. (See <em>Conservatorship of Wendland </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 519, 524, fn. 1 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 28 P.3d 151]; <em>District Election etc. Committee v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 261, 265-266 [144 Cal.Rptr. 442].) This is such a case. In our view, this appeal poses an issue of important public interest concerning whether WSA\u2019s are subject to direct judicial challenge by non-lead-agency third parties prior to the certification of the EIR and project approval. In addition, because this appeal does not itself concern the adequacy of the WSA the issues before us are necessarily distinct from those pending in the <em>California Oak Foundation. </em>Given the increasing public focus on and interest in water supply issues as they relate to land use and development we have no doubt that a challenge of this nature will arise again, and yet given the statutory timeframes imposed upon lead agencies under CEQA, the issues presented by this appeal may evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Consequently, this court exercises its discretion to resolve questions presented in this appeal even though the resolution of the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>might moot the underlying relief sought by C-WIN in its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Review of an order granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is governed by the same standard applicable to reviewing an order sustaining a general demurrer. This court will examine only the face of the pleadings, together with matters subject to judicial notice, to determine whether such facts are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. A defendant is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings when it appears from the face of the complaint (or on those matters judicially noticed) that the complaint is barred as a matter of law. <em>(Saltarelli &amp; Steponovich v. Douglas </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 683].) We review the pleadings de novo to determine whether the trial court erred in granting the motion. <em>(Angelucci </em>v. <em>Century Supper Club </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 160, 166 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 142, 158 P.3d 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>III. <em>The Trial Court Properly Granted Judgment in This Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">On appeal C-WIN argues the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for a writ of mandate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> C-WIN asserts that it was entitled to relief under the Code of Civil Procedure, either section 1085 or section 1094.5, arguing that the new WSA was subject to direct judicial challenge and the Water District is a proper respondent in the proceedings. C-WIN maintains the WSA constitutes a \u201cfinal\u201d determination that \u201ccommits\u201d the Water District to a \u201ccourse of action with serious implications,\u201d including a commitment that the Water District would supply water to the Project if it was approved. C-WIN also asserts that it is not required to \u201cexhaust\u201d its remedies with the City because the City could not grant it the relief C-WIN sought and thus absent a direct judicial challenge the WSA will evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">To assess C-WIN\u2019s contentions first requires an understanding of the law governing CEQA and the preparation of WSA\u2019s and their use in the process of preparing and certifying EIR\u2019s. It is to the consideration of these laws which we now turn our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">A. <em>CEQA and EIR\u2019s in General</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">As Division Eight noted in <em>California Oak Foundation </em>an \u201cEIR is an informational document. Its purpose is to provide public agencies, and the public, with detailed information about the effect a proposed project is likely to have on the environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of a project might be minimized; and to indicate alternatives to a project. ([Pub. Resources Code,] \u00a7 21061.) Before approving a project, the lead agency\u2014 here, the City\u2014must find either that the project\u2019s significant environmental effects identified in the EIR have been avoided or mitigated, or that unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project\u2019s benefits.\u201d <em>(California Oak Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1225, citing <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390-393 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278], citing \u00a7\u00a7 21002, 21002.1, 21081.) \u201cIf CEQA is scrupulously followed, the public will know the basis on which its responsible officials either approve or reject environmentally significant action, and the public, being duly informed, can respond accordingly to action with which it disagrees.\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>B. <em>Historical Background of the WSA law, the </em>WSA <em>Framework and Requirements and the WSA\u2019s Role in the EIR and CEQA Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">In 1995 the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 901 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 901) (which later was codified at Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10910-10915) (collectively referred to as the WSA law) as an effort to ensure that water needs and supplies were analyzed by cities and counties before major developments were built.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">Under the version of Water Code section 10910 enacted in 1995, any city or county (i.e., the lead agency) preparing an EIR for a qualifying project was required to request each potential water supplier for a WSA. The assessment was based on the supplier\u2019s most recent urban water management plan and would indicate whether the supplier could meet the water supply needs of the project. Senate Bill 901, however, applied only to certain types of projects that exceeded a defined size.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The WSA had to indicate whether in the view of the water supplier there would be sufficient water to meet the project\u2019s needs over a projected 20-year period that included single dry water years and multiple dry water years. If the supplies were inadequate, the lead agency conducting the environmental review had to be notified and the lead agency was required to include information received as a result of the assessment in the EIR. After reviewing the assessments, the lead agency was required to make the final determination on whether sufficient water supply existed to meet the anticipated demand of the project.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As originally enacted in 1995 the WSA law framework did not contain any provisions to ensure that water suppliers provided water assessments and no mechanisms for ensuring that the assessments would be prepared or considered in the event that the water suppliers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>fail to provide them. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910 et seq. (1995); Tepper, <em>New Water Requirements for Large-Scale Developments </em>(Jan. 2005) 27 L.A. Law. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Notwithstanding the framework provided in Senate Bill 901, it soon became apparent to the courts that the water supply issues were not being adequately considered by lead agencies prior to the approval of a number of large-scale projects. (See, e.g., <em>Stanislaus Heritage Project v. County of Stanislaus </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 182, 200 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 625] [court invalidated an EIR for a large-scale residential development where the WSA addressed only the first five years of a 25-year phased project]; <em>Napa Citizens for Honest Government </em>v. <em>Napa County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 370-371 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 579] [Court of Appeal invalidated an EIR based on findings including that the water supply analysis had not adequately addressed secondary water sources].)</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">The Legislature also observed the noncompliance with Senate Bill 901, and in 2001 enacted Senate Bill No. 221 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 221) and Senate Bill No. 610 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 610), designed to correct perceived deficiencies in Senate Bill 901.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Senate Bill 221 and Senate Bill 610 were intended to ensure that local land use authorities would thoroughly consider the availability of water supplies before approving major new developments. Senate Bill 610 was intended to amend the then existing Water Code section 10910 et seq. and applied to a wide range of residential, commercial, and industrial projects, while Senate Bill 221, which later was codified as Government Code section 66473.7 applied only to residential housing projects.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>Senate Bill 610 focused on improving the Senate Bill 901 process by strengthening urban water management plans as well as the connection between water supply assessment and the plans (or the equivalent level of analysis if there is no plan).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">As amended in 2001, Water Code section 10910 requires that, before approving any projects as defined in Water Code section 10912, the lead agency must request a WSA from the water supplier most likely to serve the project. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The WSA must evaluate whether the total water supplies during a 20-year period will meet the projected water demand of the proposed project. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (c)(4).) Section 10910, subdivision (c)(2) allows the public water supplier to incorporate into the WSA information from the water system\u2019s most recent urban water management plan, if the plan has taken the project demand into account. But if the plan has not taken the proposed project into account, or the public water system has no urban water management plan, the WSA for the project shall include a \u201cdiscussion\u201d with regard to whether the public water system\u2019s total projected water supplies available during normal, single-dry, and multiple-dry water years during a 20-year projection will meet the projected water demand associated with the proposed project. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (c)(3).)  Section 10910 further states that the WSA shall include an identification of any existing water supply entitlements, water rights, or water service contracts relevant to the identified water supply for the proposed project, and a description of the quantities of water received in prior years by the public water system under the existing water supply entitlements, water rights, or water service contracts. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (d)(1).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, section 10910 indicates that if the water supply for the proposed project relies on ground water supplies, additional specific information must be provided in the WSA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>subd. (f).) Water Code section 10911 provides that \u201c[i]f, as a result of its assessment, the public water system concludes that its water supplies are, or will be, insufficient, the public water system shall provide to the city or county its plans for acquiring additional water supplies, setting forth the measures that are being undertaken to acquire and develop those water supplies.\u201d (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911, subd. (a).)  Notwithstanding the assessments and projections that WSA law requires the water supplier to prepare and submit to the lead agency, Water Code section 10914 provides that the WSA provisions were <em>not </em>\u201cintended to create a right or entitlement to water service or any specific level of water service\u201d or to \u201cimpose, expand, or limit any duty concerning the obligation of a public water system to provide certain service to its existing customers or to any future potential customers.\u201d (\u00a7 10914, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Section 10910, subdivision (g) of the Water Code specifies the timeframe for preparing and submitting a WSA. Specifically, the \u201cgoverning body\u201d of each public water system is required to \u201capprove\u201d the WSA at a regular or special meeting and must submit the WSA to the lead agency not later than 90 days from the date on which the request was received. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (g)(1).) In addition, subdivision (g)(3) further states that if the water supplier fails to submit the WSA the lead agency may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the water supplier to comply. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10910, subd. (g)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">After the water supplier provides the WSA to the lead agency, the law further dictates that the lead agency shall include the WSA in any CEQA environmental documents, namely the EIR the lead agency prepares for the project. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911, subd. (b).) Section 10911 further provides the lead agency \u201cmay include in any environmental document an evaluation of any information included in\u201d the WSA. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911, subd. (c).) Further the lead agency \u201cshall determine, based on the entire record, whether projected water supplies will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the project, in addition to existing and planned future uses. If the city or county determines that water supplies will not be sufficient, the city or county shall include that determination in its findings for the project.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>With this legal framework in mind, we turn to C-WIN\u2019s specific claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">C. <em>C-WIN\u2019s Claims for Mandamus Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">On appeal C-WIN argues it may assert a direct challenge against the Water District assailing the adequacy of the Water District\u2019s WSA for the Project pursuant to either Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 or section 1085.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">A party may seek to set aside an administrative decision for failure to comply with CEQA by petitioning for either administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) or traditional mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085). <em>(Western States Petroleum Assn. v.

In general, \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d or \u201cadjudicative acts,\u201d that is, acts that involve the actual application of a rule to a specific set of existing facts are reviewed by administrative mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. <em>(Ohton v.

Resources Code, \u00a7 21168; see <em>Langsam v. City of Sausalito </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 871, 879 [235 Cal.Rptr. 672] [\u201cIt is well established that the intent of the Legislature in enacting [Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>of Civil Procedure section] 1094.5 was to authorize \u2018. . . judicial review only of the exercise by an administrative agency of an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial function.\u2019 \u201d]; see also Cal.

In an action to set aside an agency\u2019s decision under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, the trial court\u2019s inquiry extends only to whether a prejudicial abuse of discretion has occurred. Abuse of discretion occurs if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or if its decision is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Laurel Heights, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">In contrast, the actual formulation of the rule itself constitutes a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d act and is reviewed by ordinary mandate. <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 168-169 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306] [adoption of guidelines interpreting coastal access provisions constituted quasi-legislative agency action because guidelines governed future permit decisions rather than the application of the rules to a particular case and thus were reviewed under Code Civ.

The trial court reviews an administrative action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to determine whether the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, contrary to established public policy, unlawful, procedurally unfair, or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires. <em>(Lewin v.

Even though mandate will not lie to control a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>public agency\u2019s discretion, that is to say, force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner, it does lie to command the exercise of discretion\u2014to compel some action upon the subject involved. <em>(Sunset Drive Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Redlands </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 215, 222 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 209] [traditional mandamus appropriate vehicle to compel city to complete an EIR because preparation of the document was a duty compelled by law]; <em>State Bd. of Education v.

C-WIN asserts that the \u201cmeeting\u201d constituted an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. In the alternative, C-WIN argues that traditional mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 would also be appropriate because it is available to \u201cchallenge agency abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">For its part, the Water District asserts neither form of mandamus is appropriate in this case. The Water District maintains the \u201cmeeting\u201d at which it approved the WSA does not qualify as an evidentiary hearing for the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The Water District asserts that although the meetings of the Water District\u2019s governing board are open and afford the public an opportunity to comment on agenda items, there is no requirement that \u201cevidence\u201d be offered at the meetings. Consequently, the Water District maintains that administrative mandamus is not available. In addition the Water District argues that C-WIN may not avail itself of traditional mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 because the determination at issue\u2014the contents of the WSA and its adequacy\u2014are not quasi-legislative or ministerial acts. The Water District argues that the contents of the WSA are factual determinations and assessments based on the discretion and expert opinions of its professional staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">This court need not decide which form of mandate would apply here, because the petition fails to satisfy prerequisites common to both administrative and traditional mandamus review. C-WIN has failed to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>(1) that the WSA constitutes a final detemfination, finding, or decision of a public agency as that term is used in the context of administrative and traditional mandamus; or (2) that C-WIN exhausted its administrative remedies. (See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 307, 314-315 [283 Cal.Rptr. 447] [the same principles, requirements and limitations, including finality and the exhaustion doctrine apply to writ proceedings under Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1094.5 &amp; 1085]; <em>Eight Unnamed Physicians v. Medical Executive Committee </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 503, 511 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 100] [exhaustion requirement applies whether relief is sought by traditional or administrative mandamus].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">1. <em>Finality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">\u201cA decision attains the requisite administrative finality when the agency has exhausted its jurisdiction and possesses \u2018no further power to reconsider or rehear the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Long Beach Unified Sch. Dist. v. State of California </em>(1991) 225 Cal.App.3d 155, 169 [275 Cal.Rptr. 449].) Finality may be defined either expressly in the statutes governing the administrative process or it may be determined from the framework in the statutory scheme. (See <em>Du Four v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 863, 867-868 [122 Cal.Rptr. 859] <em>(Du Four) </em>[court rejected aggrieved employee\u2019s effort to \u201cshort-circuit\u201d three-tiered system of determination and review provided in statutory scheme by seeking direct judicial review of an unemployment insurance referee\u2019s decision on benefits where statute provided for direct review by an appeals board].) Until a public agency makes a final decision, the matter is not ripe for judicial review. <em>(San Bernardino Public Employees Assn. v. City of Fontana </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1215 1226-1227 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 634] [where city had not yet agreed in a memorandum of understanding to reduce employee retiree benefits, Court of Appeal concluded that trial court prematurely granted a petition for a writ of mandate compelling the city to refrain from reducing or eliminating retiree benefits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The WSA law does not expressly state when a WSA becomes \u201cfinal\u201d for the purpose of mandamus relief or for the purpose of requesting other judicial intervention. Nonetheless, finality can be determined from a review of the WSA law framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Where, as here, a lead agency requests a water supplier prepare and adopt a WSA for a particular project, the water supplier\u2019s duty in so doing is defined and set forth in detail in Water Code sections 10910 and 10911. As described elsewhere, the water system provider most likely to supply the project must evaluate and prepare an assessment of whether the water supplies will meet the projected needs of the project, and if the water supplier determines that water supplies are not sufficient, the water supplier must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>describe its plans for acquiring additional water supplies. This notwithstanding, the code is also clear that nothing in the WSA itself or the statutes governing its preparation actually imposes any duty upon the water supplier to provide water services to the project. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 10914.) Thus, in our view the WSA is, as the respondents and the amicus curiae posit, a technical, informational advisory opinion of the water provider. Though the WSA is required by statute to include an assessment of certain statutorily identified water supply issues and is required to be included in the EIR, the WSA\u2019s role in the EIR process is akin to that of other informational opinions provided by other entities concerning potential environmental impacts\u2014such as traffic, population density or air quality. The fact that the duties of the water provider in preparing the WSA and responsibility of the lead agency in requesting the WSA are committed to statute does not change the fundamental nature of the WSA itself as an advisory and informational document. This is true especially in view of the Legislative history of Senate Bill 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Senate Bill 610 was motivated by a concern that certain counties and cities were either ignoring or inadequately considering water supply issues prior to approving new developments. While the Legislature wanted to ensure that lead agencies thoroughly considered water supply issues and wanted to add transparency to the entire process, the Legislature committed the final determination on water supply issues to the lead agency, not the water providers. Indeed an earlier iteration of the WSA law that gave the water providers ultimate determination of whether insufficient water supplies constituted \u201csignificant environmental effects under CEQA\u201d was rejected because opponents viewed it as shifting land use decisionmaking authority from the cities and counties to water suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Furthermore, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to create an additional layer of judicial review or to provide an additional avenue for judicial intervention in the middle of the EIR process at the behest of any party other than the lead agency. Most telling in this respect is that on the same day the Legislature enacted Senate Bill 610, it also enacted Senate Bill 221 which provides nonagency third parties with an opportunity to seek judicial intervention under Government Code section 66473.7 to compel a water system to comply with the water verification law. That the Legislature omitted the right to third party judicial intervention from Senate Bill 610 is instructive as to how the WSA should be viewed in the larger context of the EIR process. The WSA is but an interlocutory and preliminary step in the EIR process, and in general, interim determinations are not subject to mandamus review. <em>(Jones v. Oxnard School Dist. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 587, 590-592 [75 Cal.Rptr. 836] <em>(Jones) </em>[court rejected defendant\u2019s attempt to seek mandamus review of action of school board in filing a \u201cstatement of need for noncertificated teacher\u201d with the state board of education because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>school board\u2019s action was a preliminary step by one government agency (the school district) enabling another (the State Board of Education) to act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">In the same way that the referee\u2019s decision was the final assessment as to the availability of unemployment benefits in <em>Du Four, </em>and that the filing of the statement of need was final as to the school board in <em>Jones, </em>the WSA approved by a water provider may in fact constitute the \u201cfinal\u201d opinion of the provider as to the sufficiency of the current water supply and/or final determination as to the provider\u2019s plans for acquiring or developing additional water supplies. Such finality, however, does not mean the WSA is \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of judicial intervention by way of mandamus review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Once the WSA is approved by the water provider\u2019s governing board the WSA is submitted to the lead agency. The lead agency may then evaluate the information included in the WSA. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911, subd. (c).) The power to \u201cevaluate\u201d the WSA necessarily invests the lead agency with the authority to consider, assess and examine the quality of the information in the WSA and endows the lead agency with the right to pass judgment upon the WSA. While the lead agency must include the WSA in the EIR, the lead agency is not required to accept the WSA\u2019s conclusions. The lead agency may in evaluating the WSA accept or disagree with the water provider\u2019s analysis or may request additional information from the water provider.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, the lead agency is required by statute to make the ultimate determination, based on the entire record, whether water supplies are sufficient. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911, subd. (c).) The lead agency may make a finding that adequate water supplies exist (or do not exist) to meet the project\u2019s anticipated demand, even if that finding is inconsistent with the conclusions in the public water system\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">In short, because the adoption of a WSA does not create a right or entitlement to water service or impose, expand, or limit any duty concerning the obligation of a public water system to provide certain service and because the lead agency has a separate (from the water provider\u2019s WSA) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>independent obligation to assess the sufficiency of water supplies for the proposed project, we conclude the WSA is not a final agency decision, determination or action as that term is used in the context of mandamus relief. Under the WSA law framework, the \u201cfinal\u201d decision for the purposes of writ review occurs only after the lead agency acts\u2014completes its obligations under the WSA and CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Our conclusion that the WSA is not final for the purposes of mandamus review until the lead agency makes the final determination on the sufficiency of water supplies, the CEQA review is complete and the project is approved by the City is fully consistent with the manner in which judicial challenges are asserted to assail the adequacy of environmental impact determinations in general. A judicial proceeding challenging compliance with CEQA and/or specifically attacking the adequacy of the EIR, including the conclusions and analysis contained in an environmental assessment prepared for the EIR is properly commenced <em>after </em>the lead agency certifies the EIR and approves the project. (See, e.g., <em>Santa Clarita Organization of Planning the Environment v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 149, 154, 158-159 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 449] [after the lead agency approved the recertified EIR, an environmental group filed a petition for an administrative writ of mandate challenging the adequacy of the WSA contained in the EIR]; <em>Mission Oaks Ranch, Ltd. v.

Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1123, fn. 10 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564]; <em>County of Amador </em>v. <em>El Dorado County Water Agency </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 965 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] [CEQA challenges to project were not untimely where they were filed within statute of limitations period which commenced when the agency approved the project, agreeing to be legally bound to take a course of action]; <em>County of San Diego v.

The policy reasons behind the two doctrines are similar. The exhaustion doctrine precludes review of an intermediate or interlocutory action of an administrative agency. <em>(Alta Loma School Dist. v. San Bernardino County Com. on School Dist. Reorganization </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 542, 554 [177 Cal.Rptr. 506] <em>(Alta Loma).) </em>A party must proceed through the full administrative process \u201cto a final decision on the merits.\u201d <em>(La Costa Beach Homeowners Assn. v. Wayne </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 327, 330 [152 Cal.Rptr. 355].) Each step in the administrative proceeding cannot be reviewed separately, any more than each ruling in the trial of a civil action may be separately reviewed by a separate appeal. Administrative proceedings should be completed before the issuance of a judicial writ. The rule is not a matter of discretion; compliance is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review. <em>(Alta Loma, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 554.) \u201c \u2018Exhaustion\u2019 applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R. Co. </em>(1956) 352 U.S. 59, 63-64 [1 L.Ed.2d 126, 77 S.Ct. 161, 135 Ct.Cl. 997], superseded by regulation on other grounds in <em>Jones Truck Lines v. Aladdin Synergetics, Inc. </em>(M.D.Tenn.1994) 174 B.R. 76.) Moreover, the exhaustion doctrine applies even where the administrative remedy is couched in permissive language. <em>(County of Los Angeles v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 77, 85-87 [182 Cal.Rptr. 879] [although the Insurance Code did not expressly direct claimants to seek administrative remedies from the Insurance Commissioner prior to seeking judicial intervention, the broad statutory power afforded the Insurance Commissioner provided the authority to grant adequate remedies and thus claimants were not permitted to bypass the entire administrative process].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">The principal purposes of exhaustion requirements include avoidance of premature interruption of administrative processes, allowing an agency to develop the necessary factual background of the case, letting the agency apply its expertise and exercise its statutory discretion, and administrative efficiency and judicial economy. <em>(McKart v. United States </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 185, 193-194 [23 L.Ed.2d 194, 89 S.Ct. 1657].) The exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number><em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">This notwithstanding, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required where it appears the administrative board is without jurisdiction and thus the remedy is unavailable or where the remedy is inadequate. <em>(Eight Unnamed Physicians v. Medical Executive Committee, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at p. 511.) In addition, exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine also exist where the administrative agency has made it clear it would be futile to pursue the administrative process to conclusion or where irreparable harm will result if judicial intervention is withheld until a final administrative decision is rendered. <em>(Alta Loma, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">In this case the issue is whether C-WIN was required to submit its complaints about the WSA to the lead agency and wait until the lead agency acted prior to seeking judicial intervention. C-WIN maintains that it is not required to seek redress from the lead agency because the \u201cCity had no authority to disapprove, modify or set-aside the WSA\u201d and thus C-WIN had no administrative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">We disagree. As explained elsewhere herein, we interpret the City\u2019s statutory authority (derived from Wat. Code, \u00a7 10911) to evaluate the WSA and the concomitant duty to make the final determination on the sufficiency of water supplies as empowering the City to approve or disapprove the WSA or to request the Water District to revise, modify, amend or supplement the WSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">The matter before this court is similar to that presented in <em>Alta Loma </em>where certain school districts brought a mandamus proceeding challenging a county\u2019s reorganization plan that would have caused the school districts to go out of existence. The school districts sought to prohibit the transmittal of the plan to the State Board of Education. The school districts claimed, among other arguments, that they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before the State Board of Education because the board did not have jurisdiction to assess some of the claims and therefore there was no available administrative remedy. <em>(Alta Loma, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 555.) The Court of Appeal disagreed, concluding the county was entitled to a demurrer because the school districts had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies. Specifically the school districts had failed to seek review from the State Board of Education of sufficiency of the proceedings before the county and of the reorganization plan: \u201cWhether the alleged procedural defects in the county committee\u2019s proceedings occurred and, if so, whether the proposed reorganization plan should be disapproved are matters which come within the jurisdiction of the State Board and are decisions which should be made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>first instance by the State Board.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 556.) As the <em>Alta Loma </em>court observed \u201c[i]t lies within the power of the administrative agency to determine in the first instance and before judicial relief may be obtained whether a given controversy falls within its granted jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Like the State Board of Education, so too, the City in this case has the power to assess C-WIN\u2019s claims and provide the requested relief. As in <em>Alta Loma, </em>application of the exhaustion doctrine also affords the parties and the courts the benefit of the expertise and experience of the administrative agency. The court would have the benefit of the views of those having expertise in matters of local land use and water supply issues, including the analysis and recommendations of the City\u2019s decision makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">Furthermore, C-WIN has not shown that this case comes within any of the other exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. C-WIN has not shown that they will suffer irreparable injury if they are required to await final administrative action by the City or that pursuit of their grievances through the City would be an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">We also reject C-WIN\u2019s argument that absent direct and immediate judicial intervention, the adequacy of the WSA will evade all judicial review. As the circumstances in the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>case clearly demonstrate, water supply issues will not escape judicial scrutiny where judicial review occurs after the City\u2019s certification of the EIR and approval of the project. Division Eight\u2019s opinion discloses a critical review of the City and the Water District\u2019s WSA, which ultimately resulted in a court order requiring the City to reexamine water supply issues and a City request to the Water District to prepare a new WSA. C-WIN has not convinced us that proceeding in the same manner as <em>California Oak Foundation, </em>that is, asserting a challenge to the WSA as part of a challenge to the EIR <em>after </em>the City has certified the EIR and approved the project case, would result in unworkable or inadequate judicial review of the WSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">Finally requiring C-WIN to (1) complete the administrative process prior to seeking judicial intervention and (2) assail the WSA as part of a challenge to the EIR conserves the parties\u2019 and the court\u2019s resources and avoids the possibility of multiple and simultaneous litigation as well as inconsistent rulings concerning the same project. In addition, as respondents point out, a direct challenge to a WSA in the middle of the EIR review proceedings could delay the review process and could preclude the lead agency from completing and certifying the EIR within the timeframes required under CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">In view of all of the foregoing, we conclude the trial court did not err in granting the judgment on the pleadings and properly entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

J., and Zelon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1212-5\"> The original proposed project involved the subdivision of developed and undeveloped land in the City accommodating about 4.45 million square feet of industrial/commercial development of 170.1 acres, with an additional 64.3 acres consisting of rights-of-way (including public streets) and water wells. The remaining 349.6 acres were to include a combination of slopes, trails and areas within the industrial/commercial lots that would remain undeveloped, as well as 220.6 acres of dedicated open space.

After a public comment period and public hearing on the matter the City recertified on July 11, 2006. In August 2006, the City filed a return to the writ (in the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>case) contending that the revised WSA and EIR complied with the opinions expressed by Division Eight in the <em>California Oak Foundation </em>opinion. In October of 2006, SCOPE (but not C-WIN) objected to the discharge of the writ, arguing that the recertified EIR WSA was inadequate. In mid-August 2007, the trial court discharged the writ and issued a \u201cStatement of Decision\u201d in which it found, among other things, that the recertified EIR adequately examined the legal uncertainties surrounding the availability of 41,000 afy.

C-Win further argued the WSA misleadingly and falsely claimed (1) the 41,000 afy was \u201cavailable for use\u201d despite uncertainty of that conclusion pending the final outcome of DWR\u2019s ongoing programmatic review of the other water supply agreements such as the Monterey Amendments; and (2) that the pending judicial challenges to Castaic Lake Water Agency\u2019s stand-alone EIR for the 41,000 afy did not affect the reliability of the transfer. C-WIN maintained the WSA contained other legal flaws including improper reliance on Castaic Lake Water Agency\u2019s 2005 Urban Water Management Plan, a failure to consider the potential impact of <em>State Water Rescources Control Bd.

Opponents argued the provision would remove local land use decisionmaking authority from cities and counties and shift it to local water suppliers. (See Sen.

While section 10910, subdivision (g)(3) allows a lead agency to seek judicial intervention to obtain a water supplier\u2019s compliance with the WSA law, nothing in the statutory framework affords a private actor the same rights of enforcement.

Indeed the purpose behind the WSA law is to ensure that relevant information concerning water supplies is assessed and considered prior to the approval of statutorily defined projects. The water provider is one of the key sources of that information and the WSA is the effective method that information is transmitted to land use decision makers. Thus, to fulfill its usefulness and statutory aims, the lead agency would be well advised to evaluate the WSA and if the WSA is found to be incomplete or to contain inaccurate information or faulty analysis, the lead agency should request the water supplier to modify, correct or supplement the WSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
