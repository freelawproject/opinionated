Concluding the trial court did not abuse its discretion under the relevant standards, we will affirm the order in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">State law regulates the conduct of \u201cjunk dealers.\u201d Business and Professions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sections 21600 through 21609 require recordkeeping (\u00a7 21606), record preservation (\u00a7 21607), and cooperation with local law enforcement agencies in permitting inspection of the records (\u00a7 21606.5). Other related sections provide definitions and exclusions to coverage. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21601, 21604, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>21605.) The Business and Professions Code provides that violation of these requirements is a misdemeanor (\u00a7 21608); the code permits a peace officer who has probable cause to believe scrap metal is stolen to place a temporary hold on such property (\u00a7 21609).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The portions of the Business and Professions Code relevant to the present case, which we will discuss in more detail below, were enacted in 1989. (See Stats. 1989, ch. 1288, p. 5079.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Fresno County has long required a business license for junk dealers, including scrap metal dealers. (See Fresno County Ord. Code, \u00a7 6.24.020 et seq.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The licensing scheme primarily requires the sheriff to determine whether the applicant is likely to deal in stolen property and zoning officials to determine whether the proposed business location is appropriate. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 6.24.040.) It also requires certain recordkeeping by such dealers <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 6.24.110) and requires dealers to hold property for up to five days if directed by the sheriff to do so <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 6.24.130).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In 2007, Fresno County enacted certain ordinances to further regulate junk dealers. Although there is no statement of legislative intent in the ordinances, declarations submitted in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction state that thefts of metal wiring and irrigation parts from local farms were causing far more damage than the metal was worth. The deputy district attorney who drafted the ordinances stated they were based on \u201ca pending bill in Arizona.\u201d (See Ariz. Rev. Stats., \u00a7 44-1644.) The ordinances in question, insofar as involved in the present case, may be summarized as follows: Ordinance section 6.24.120 requires junk dealers to provide to the sheriff on a weekly basis invoices describing in detail all transactions they made, both purchases and sales. Ordinance section 6.24.125 requires junk dealers to hold for five days after a transaction is reported to the sheriff \u201call nonferrous metal and stainless steel (with the exclusion of used beverage containers) in the same size, shape and condition in which it was received.\u201d Ordinance section 6.24.135 provides that junk dealers must pay for scrap metal, excluding used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>beverage containers, \u201cby check sent by U.S. mail to a physical address provided on the seller\u2019s driver\u2019s license or other identification recorded in the transaction record, no sooner than three days after the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Soon after the ordinances were adopted, respondents filed their action for declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants County of Fresno, Fresno County District Attorney Elizabeth Egan, and Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims were named as defendants. Over appellants\u2019 opposition, the court granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the new ordinances, sections 6.24.120, subdivision 4, 6.24.125, and 6.24.135. On August 13, 2007, the court granted respondents\u2019 application for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal and requested calendar preference as provided by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 527, subd. (e); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">This is an appeal from a preliminary injunction. Appellants\u2019 opening and reply briefs neither discuss nor even mention the standard of review applicable to appeals from the grant of a preliminary injunction. Normally, issuance of a preliminary injunction is entrusted to the discretion of the trial court and we review only for abuse of discretion. <em>(Butt v. State of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240].) The trial court is required to weigh both \u201chow likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits\u201d and \u201cthe relative harm the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.\u201d <em>(Dodge, Warren &amp; Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Appellants do not contend that the trial court abused its discretion or that it erred in finding that the balance of hardship to each of the parties required issuance of the preliminary injunction. Therefore we will assume appellants mean to assert that, pursuant to cases such as <em>14859 Moorpark Homeowner\u2019s Assn. v. VRT Corp. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 712], the trial court abused its discretion because respondents cannot prevail on the ultimate merits of the case as a matter of law. In that limited circumstance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>the balance of hardships is irrelevant and the grant of a preliminary injunction would merely delay the inevitable enforcement of the ordinances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1408.) We proceed on this understanding of appellants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\u201cOur state Constitution allows cities and counties to enact and enforce local ordinances so long as they are \u2018not in conflict\u2019 with the state\u2019s \u2018general laws.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) Any conflicting ordinance is preempted by state law and thus void.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1061, 1065 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 67, 162 P.3d 583] <em>(O\u2019Connell).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">An ordinance can conflict with state law in any of several ways: A conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates or contradicts general law or if the local legislation attempts to enter an area fully occupied by general law. <em>(O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1067.) An area can be \u201cfully occupied by general law\u201d either because the Legislature has expressly prohibited further local legislation or because the state legislative scheme implies such a prohibition. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Nevertheless, \u201cwhen local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control, such as the location of particular land uses, California courts will presume, absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the Legislature, that such regulation is <em>not </em>preempted by state statute.\u201d <em>(Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of Santa Cruz </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1139, 1149 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 21, 136 P.3d 821].) In addition to land use regulation, licensing of local businesses is an area over which local government traditionally has exercised control. (See \u00a7 16100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The ordinance provisions at issue here do not involve licensing or location of recycling businesses. Instead, they impermissibly attempt to govern the purchase and sale of scrap metal, a subject comprehensively regulated by state law. As the trial court concluded, the ordinances duplicate and contradict state law and concern an area fully occupied by state law; the ordinances are therefore preempted. We reach this conclusion by comparison of two Supreme Court cases discussing preemption, <em>Sherwin-Williams Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 893 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 844 P.2d 534] <em>(Sherwin-Williams) </em>and <em>O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 1061.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>In <em>Sherwin-Williams, </em>state law had restricted sales of spray paint to minors. <em>(Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 898-899.) The City of Los Angeles adopted an ordinance requiring retailers to display spray paint in an area not accessible to the public without employee assistance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 901.) The local ordinance sought neither to restrict nor to permit sale of spray paint. The court held that the ordinance did not conflict with the statute because the laws covered entirely different subjects, the secured storage of spray paint, on the one hand, and the lawfulness of the sale of such paint to minors, on the other. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 905.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>state law provided for forfeiture of vehicles used in certain serious drug transactions <em>(O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1071) and for court orders declaring a nuisance vehicles used in prostitution <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1074-1075). The city adopted an ordinance permitting forfeiture of any vehicle used to acquire any controlled substance or to solicit any act of prostitution. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1069.) In essence, the city made a legislative judgment that state law did not go far enough in combating these vices in the city. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 1077-1078 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).) In <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>the court held the local laws conflicted with state law, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In the case of drug offenses, state law (see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11470, subd. (e)) permits forfeiture only when it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle was \u201c \u2018used as an instrument to facilitate the manufacture of, or possession for sale or sale\u2019 \u201d of certain larger amounts of designated controlled substances. <em>(O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1070.) Because the state forfeiture provisions were both narrowly tailored and part of a comprehensive scheme of penalties for drug offenses, state law preempted the city\u2019s attempt to broadly permit forfeiture upon a showing by preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used to attempt to acquire any amount of any controlled substance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1071.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In the case of prostitution, state law (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22659.5) permitted local adoption of five-year \u201cpilot programs\u201d for declaring any motor vehicle a public nuisance when used in the commission of certain specified crimes, including prostitution. <em>(O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1073.) That law did not, however, contain any language that permitted forfeiture of vehicles as part of a local pilot program. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1074.) Accordingly, the city\u2019s ordinance impermissibly attempted to impose penalties \u201cin excess of those prescribed by the Legislature\u201d for the same conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1075.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Thus, in summary, the local law in <em>Sherwin-Williams </em>did not conflict with state law\u2014and was not preempted\u2014because the ordinance did \u201cnot prohibit what the statute commands or command what it prohibits.\u201d <em>(Sherwin-Williams, </em>supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 902.) The local laws in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>did conflict with state law\u2014and were preempted\u2014because they imposed the penalty of forfeiture in circumstances in which state law comprehensively regulated the conduct but did not impose that penalty. <em>(O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 1071, 1075.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In a letter to Governor George Deukmejian requesting that he sign Senate Bill No. 1475 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) into law, the bill\u2019s author, Senator Don Rogers, described a statewide \u201cepidemic\u201d of theft of recyclable scrap metal, particularly in rural and agricultural areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Senator Rogers aptly summarized the legislation as follows: \u201cSB 1475 would require recyclers as well as junk dealers to keep specific records on their purchases thus giving law enforcement a paper trail to the thief. To avoid unnecessary paperwork, excluded from this recordkeeping are (1) aluminum beverage containers, (2) household generated junk, (3) materials for which payment is made by check written to the company represented as being the owner, and (4) materials purchased from another junk dealer or recycler who has already recorded, reported, and held the material as required.\u201d The legislation thus presents a comprehensive scheme that has sought to balance the burden on legitimate businesses with the benefits to be conferred on law enforcement and, by extension, potential victims of metal theft. (See <em>O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1071.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In the present case, the County of Fresno apparently determined that the state legislation did not go far enough in regulating the conduct of scrap metal dealers. Because the ordinances regulate in a more restrictive manner the very conduct regulated in state law, the ordinances impermissibly conflict with state law. (See <em>O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1075.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">First, state law requires recyclers to create sales records and make them available for inspection by certain law enforcement officers. (\u00a7 21606.5.) Fresno County\u2019s ordinance not only requires that recyclers create records, but requires that the record be on a form approved by the sheriff; not only requires retention of a copy of the record, but also requires the recycler to submit those records to the sheriff on a weekly basis; and not only requires the recycler to collect the identifying information required by section 21606, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>but also to obtain a thumbprint of each seller of junk. (Ord., \u00a7 6.24.120.) Any violation of these local requirements can result in suspension or revocation of the recycler\u2019s license, even if the acts are not required by state law. (Ord., \u00a7 6.24.150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Second, a recycler\u2019s sale and disposition of scrap metal can be delayed for up to 90 days upon the direction of a peace officer who has probable cause to believe that the material is stolen. (\u00a7 21609.) Fresno County\u2019s ordinance not only omits the requirement of probable cause, but also requires recyclers to retain all materials for five days even in the absence of a request from a peace officer. (Ord., \u00a7 6.24.125, subd. A.) Thus, the ordinance prohibits a recycler from disposing of property in circumstances where such disposal is permitted by state law and permits suspension or revocation of the recycler\u2019s license even if the acts are not prohibited by state law. (Ord., \u00a7 6.24.150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Finally, state law excludes from the requirements for detailed record-keeping any purchase of scrap metal in which the buyer pays the seller by check payable to the \u201ccompany represented as being the owner of the scrap.\u201d (\u00a7 21604, subd. (b).) Fresno County\u2019s ordinance not only attempts to override this exclusion by requiring detailed recordkeeping for all purchases of scrap metal, but it also requires all purchases to be made by check, mailed to the seller, at least three days after the transaction. (Ord., \u00a7 6.24.135.) Thus, the ordinance requires conduct (more detailed recordkeeping and check transactions) where the statute does not and forbids conduct (cash transactions) permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">We conclude that the commercial activities\u2014the purchase of scrap metal by recyclers\u2014that are the focus of Fresno County\u2019s ordinances \u201care matters of statewide concern that our Legislature has comprehensively addressed through various provisions of this state\u2019s Penal and [Business and Professions] Codes, leaving no room for further regulation at the local level.\u201d (O\u2019Connell, <em>supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1076.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of the subject ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The judgment (order) is affirmed.

Those issues were not dispositive of the portions of the cases discussed in the text and, because the present state laws are silent on the issue of preemption, we will not include the court\u2019s discussion of those issues. For similar reasons, cases such as <em>Malish </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 725, 729 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 18] (\u201cBusiness and Professions Code sections 21637 and 21638 expressly recognize and authorize local regulation of pawnbrokers . . . .\u201d) do not aid resolution of the present issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> After notification to the parties, we take judicial notice of the letter of Senator Rogers to the Governor dated September 15, 1989.
