In it, they found the words and phrases \u201cbrothers' and sisters of the whole blood,\u201d \u201cbrothers and sisters of the half blood,\u201d and \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>out further qualification, which had been judicially interpreted to mean all brothers and sisters whether of the whole or half blood. They selected, from these three different phrases, the one which they thought best expressed the intention of the supplementary act. If they intended to exclude brothers and sisters of the half blood from the operation of this supplementary act, it is incredible that they should not have used the words \u201cbrothers and sisters of the whole blood,\u201d or that they should use the phrase \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d which had been construed to include brothers and sisters of the half blood. The omission to use the one phrase, as well as the actual use of the other, we submit, demonstrates most plainly an intention to include brothers and sisters of the half blood. Hardcastle on Construction, (Ed. of 1879), 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">The commissioners to revise and consolidate the statutes were, as is well known, very painstaking in correcting any phraseology in them, which appeared to be obscure or equivocal. In the revision adopted in 1879, the provisions of the first, second and third sections of the act regulating descents, and the provisions of said act of April 11,1877, were re-enacted without substantial change, and were incorporated into the chapter relating to descents and distribution in consecutive sections from 4158 to 4162, both inclusive. In the notes appended by these commissioners to these sections of the Revised Statutes, the cases of <em>Cliver </em>v. Sanders, and of <em>White </em>v. White, are referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-6\">Speculations about the probable reasons, which induced the legislation, are of small consequence.

Heator, 42 Ohio St., 100; <em>Anderson </em>v. Gilchrist, 44 Ohio St., 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">Who are the brothers of John G. Deshler? Certainly, in the sense in which they are used in the supplementary act, they are those of the whole blood. Webster\u2019s Dictionary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">A careful analysis of the act of 1877, will show that the purpose of the statute -was that brothers of the whole blood should take the one-half upon the death of the wife intestate and without issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">Now if John G. Deshler had survived his wife and then died, his brothers of the whole blood, William and Charles, would have inherited the entire estate under section 2, subdivision 3, of the descent laws of Ohio (S. &amp; S. 305).</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">But if the property had come by descent to John G. Deshler from his father, then at his death intestate, in the absence of wife or children, the estate would go to his brothers and sisters of the whole ,and half blood, provided they are of the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate came. Whole bloods and half bloods only come in upon an equality under the first section of the descent act, and where the property was acquired by descent, devise or deed of gift from an ancestor. <em>Brower </em>v. Hunt, settles the law that a husband is not ancestor to the wife, and that the wife takes from her husband by descent under the second section (4159), and not under the first section (4158) of the descent act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">In the third subdivision of the first section of the descent act (S. &amp; S. 304), half bloods are recognized, but only because the property is ancestral and because the half bloods are of the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate came.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-10\">As to personal estate it was alwajrs non-ancestral, and hence section 4 (S. &amp; S., 307), says that it shall pass as non-ancestral property under section 2. And this broad distinction between ancestral propert}*- and that which is not ancestral, has always been maintained in our statutes of descent, and the same distinction still exists.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>There is then no reason in the case before the court for straining the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d beyond their ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-4\">It is conceded that but for the statute of 1877, the entire estate which M. Rouise Deshler acquired from her husband, real and personal, would have passed to her two brothers, Cyrus Falconer and John Hall Falconer, and their legal representatives, and that no part of 'it would have gone to the Deshler side of the house. Sec. 2, subdivision 3, S. &amp; S., 305, 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">This is so held'in <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Ohio St., and in <em>Briney </em>v. Wilson, 11 Ohio St., 425, and for the reason that the estate coming by descent from her husband- to her it \u201cdid not come to such intestate from any ancestor;\u201d that the husband not being ancestor to the wife, that the wife as to such an estate became and was a new stock of descent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">After this came the supplementary act of 1877, 74 Ohio R., 81. *</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">' The title recites that it is supplementary to the descent act. It is not an independent statute of descent by itself, nor an amendment. A supplemental law is one that supplies what is wanted; additional. Burrill Raw Dictionary, and Webster\u2019s Dictionary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">There was a defect in the second section of the descent act in this, that it deprived the husband\u2019s brothers of the whole blood of any interest in the estate, in a case like the one before the court, and thereupon the supplementary act was passed for the purpose of bringing in another class, to-wit: The brothers of the whole blood, to share with the</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-9\">brothers of the deceased wife, under the third subdivision of the second section of the descent act. This act-being supplementary must be read in connection with section 2, subdivisions 3 and 4, and also section 4, just as if it was incorporated in the statute with them. <em>McKibben </em>v. Lester, 9 Ohio St., 627; <em>Butcher v. Smith, </em>29 Ohio <em>St, </em>607.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-10\">It is supplementary only to the second section of the descent act, for it expressly limits its operation to real and personal property which came to such intestate from a former deceased husband or wife, under the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the second section of the act, to which this act is supplementary. There is no reason for extending it to the first section of the descent act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-5\">It will be observed also that the supplementary act of 1877 limits its operation to a very limited class of heirs. On the side of the intestate it makes no change, but leaves the law as it stood before the supplementary act was passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">No provision is made in this supplementary act for the father or mother, or cousin, or any other relation, to inherit any portion of this estate. The law then limiting its operation to non-ancestral property, that came under section 2, and from a former husband, and limiting its descent to brothers and sisters, or their personal representatives,. make it very clear that it was not intended to repeal any portion of section 2, but simply to qualify its operation by bringing in a new class to share in the inheritance under subdivision 3, of the said second section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\">The act of 1877 does not intend to repeti.1, amend or supplement, or in any way interfere with section one (now section 4158) of the descent act, which the Supreme Court, in <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>say \u201cis inapplicable to an estate which descended to the intestate not in right of blood.\u201d <em>Birney </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>11 Ohio St., 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-8\">It is but a mere supplement to the second section of the descent act, and does not repeal or alter its operation in any respect, except where, as in this case, the estate came to the wife from her deceased husband. It supplements the old law by providing that his brothers and sisters shall take one-half in the contingency stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">The act of 1877 being then a mere supplement, must be read in connection with section 2, of the descent act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-10\">Here comes in the act of 1877 and supplements the third subdivision by saying, that as to real estate which came to the wife under the second section of this act from a former deceased husband, the same shall pass, one-half of it to the brothers and sisters of the husband from whom it came, and only the other half to the brothers and sisters of the deceased wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>There is no reason for giving to the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d any other than their porper meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-4\">Under section 4 (now 4163) personal property of Mrs. Deshler would pass to the brothers of the whole blood, but this also is modified by the act of 1877, which says that if this personal estate came from the husband, one-half of it would be withdrawn from the operation of said sections 2, and would pass to the brothers and sisters of the husband from whom the estate came. S. &amp; S., 307, section 2 and section 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">An unanswerable argument in favor of the right of the brothers of the whole blood to inherit the entire half of the estate, is found in the fact, that precisely the same words are used in giving the estate to them as are used in giving the other half of the estate to the brothers and sisters of the intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">Precisely the same words, \u201c brothers and sisters, \u2019\u2019are used in the act of 1877 in reference to each half. There is no reason, then, to say as to the wife\u2019s side it embraces only whole blood, and as to the other, whole and half blood equally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">There are cases, we admit, where the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d have been construed to embrace half as well as whole blood, but they are exceptions. One of such cases that is so much relied upon by counsel for plaintiffs in error, is <em>Cliver </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>8 Ohio St., 503. But that case arose under the first section, subdivison 4, of the descent act of 1835, and not under the second section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-8\">Under section two of the descent act the legislature has recognized brothers and sisters both of whole blood and half blood, but it has expressely said that half bloods shall only inherit where there are no whole blood, and it is only fair to conclude that the act of 1877 was not intended to interfere with this distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-9\">If it had intended to say that whole bloods and half bloods should both be included, it would have used the words as are used in the third subdivision, of the first section, \u201cwhether such brothers or sisters be of the whole or half blood.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>We make the further claim that if we are wrong in limiting the meaning of the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d exclusively to those of the whole blood, and that as claimed by the counsel for plaintiffs in error, the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d are broad enough to include both whole and half blood, yet it by no .means follows that they are jointly and equally to take.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">Giving to the words \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d in the act of 1877, the meaning claimed by counsel for plaintiffs in error, and as embracing both whole and half bloods, still the order of priority is not to be disturbed, and half bloods can take only where there are no whole bloods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">In <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>3 C. C. Rep. 186, it was held, in interpreting the act of 1877, that \u201c in case there were no brothers or sisters of the former deceased husband or wife, section 4162 had no application, and that the entire estate of the intestate passed under section 4159 (old section 2) to his or her brothers and sisters.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\">The decision recognized the fact that old section 2 (4159) is in full force as to non-ancestral property, and is only qualified by the supplemental act of 1877, when there are brothers and sisters of the former deceased husband or wife. The act of 1877 introduced a new elem\u00e9nt in the descent act. \u2022It qualifies the second section by making the deceased husband\u2019s brothers and sisters as to one-half the property the heirs of the deceased wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-8\">It was apparently the purpose of the act to place the one-half of the estate back as a part of the purchased estate of John G. Deshler, and from him to descend to his brothers of the whole blood The great error that runs all through the elaborate brief of plaintiffs in error is, that it ignores the difference -between ancestral and non-ancestral property; between real estate that passes under section 1 (now 4158) and section 2 (now 4159); between an estate that relates to the blood of the ancestor and an estate that relates to the blood of the intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">The Ohio cases referred to by plaintiffs in error, to-wit; <em>Cliver </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>8 Ohio St., 501; <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>17 Ohio St., 367; <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>19 Ohio St., 531; <em>Lathrop </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Young, </em>25 Ohio St., 451, and other cases, were decisions arising under the first section of the descent act, and only involve questions relating to the descent of ancestral property, and they throw no light upon the question now before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-4\">The question before the court is a direct one between the whole and half blood as to the non-ancestral property. It is not like the case in 51 Vermont, 527, or the gift to brothers and sisters, cited in 2 Jarman on Wills, and other cases cited by plaintiffs counsel from other states, some of which hold that the words \u201c brothers and sisters \u201d \u2022 include both whole and half blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">In the supplemental act of 1877 it is not necessary to use the words11 whole \u201d or 11 half\u201d blood. They were already used in the second section, subdivisions 3 and 4, to which it is a mere supplement. It must not be read by itself, but as such supplement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-6\">The effect of a decision as claimed by. plaintiffs in error would be to change the whole order of descent, as to non-ancestral property, to break the harmony of the statutes of descent, and to include a class which has been excluded by express terms, in every statute which has ever been enacted on the subject in Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-7\">We repeat that the error running all through the elaborate argument of plaintiffs in error, is in insisting that the act of 1877 should be read by -itself, and that the words \u201cbrothers and sisters-\u201d must be read without reference to section 2, subdivisions 3 and 4 of the descent act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-8\">Our claim is, that it must be read as supplemental to section second, and in connection with it, and not as an independent act; and hence reading the twt&gt; together, the true meaning of the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d is clearly ascertained, in fact is expressly stated. Endlich Int. St., Section 40; <em>Van Ripper </em>v. <em>Essex, R. R. Bd, </em>3 N. J.

Besides it is an exceedingly important fact to be considered that the commissioners in this revision omitted the title of the supplementary act of 1877, reciting that it was merely a supplementary act to the old section 2 (now 4159). This omission is of vital importance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-5\"><em>Alex. F. </em>Hume, for cross-petitioner in. error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\">It is claimed that the personal estate passed to the widow, under section 2 of the descent and distribution act as amended, which was passed and took effect March 4, 1865 (S. &amp; S., 304); or if it did not pass under that section, it did pass under that section aided by section 4 of the same act; or if it did not pass under said section 2, aided by said section 4, it did pass under both of' said sections aided by the supplementary act thereto, passed April 11, 1877 (74 O. E. 81).</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-7\">There is not a word in this section relating to personal property. It in no way even alludes to personal property. It does not purport to provide a mode for the distribution of personal property. The mode for the distribution of personal property is described in section 4 of the same act. If the legislature had deemed section 2 to be sufficient to distribute personal property, it would not have enacted section 4 at all. It was useless to enact, section 4, if section 2 prescribed the mode of distributing'personal property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\">If th\u2019e legislature had intended personal property to be distributed under section 2, it would have said so in so many words. It would not have enacted section 4 at all. From the fact that it enacted section 4, at the same time it enacted section 2, the plain inference is that it intended just what it said, viz.: That section 2 should prescribe the course of descent of non-ancestral real estate, and section 4 should prescribe the mode for the distribution of personal property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-9\">Can section 2 be so aided by section 4 that it will provide for the descent of personal property? Section 4 is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>a distinct and independent section. It relates solely to personal property. Section 2 relates solely to non-ancestral real estate. The subject matter of section 4 is entirely different from that of section 2. If section 2 is sufficient to prescribe the mode of distribution of personal property, then it was useless to enact section 4. The language of section 2 (as it relates to real estate) is \u201cdescend and pass.\u201d The language of section 4 (as it relates to personal property) is \u201cshallbe distributed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-4\">Section 4 only provides that personal property\u2014its subject matter\u2014shall be distributed in the \u201ccourse, \u201d or according to the mode or manner, pointed out in section 2 for the descent of non-ancestral real estate, and not that section 2 shall govern the distribution of personal property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">It will be observed that sections 2 and 4 of the descent act, which were in force at the death of John G. Deshler, were enacted and took effect on April 16, 1862, while section 180 of the administration act took effect November 1, 1840, and was in force when sections 2 and 4 were enacted, and the legislature well knew, when it enacted sections 2 and 4, the terms of said section 180; and if it intended at that time, that all the personal property that would pass under section 180 of the administration act, to a widow of an intestate dying without issue, should no longer pass Under said sections 2 and 4, it would have so said; and because it did not so say, the presumption is that it did not so intend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">If all the real estate or personal property that has come to such relict is not affected by said supplementary act, it is not the fault of the act; it is because such property did not come to such relict in the way pointed out in such supplementary act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-7\">I claim that M.

Why this? No rational solution, we submit, of this strange freak of legislation, can be suggested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-11\">If Margaretta Stone had died the day before this supplementary enactment took effect, the estate would have passed to her brothers and sisters of the whole blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-12\">If Margaretta Stone had acquired, after her husband\u2019s death, real or personal property, it would unquestionably have passed, upon her death, to her whole blood brothers and sisters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-13\">The only expressed change in the course of succession of her property, which came from her husband, is found in the limitation upon the quantity of it to one half instead of the whole.

Here, we submit, is the fundamental infirmity of their reasoning. It is right here, also, that the circuit court of Cuyahoga county, in <em>Doster </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>fell upon a fatal misinterpretation of the adjudication in that case. The most that is or can be claimed for it is that it supports the proposition, that where the words brothers and sisters are used without limitation, they embrace the whole and half-blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-10\">In sharp contrast with the statute construed in <em>Cliver </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>the statute before us deals with non-ancestral property, in the descent of which preference has been accorded to brothers and sisters of the whole-blood for eighty-eight years. If the same logic and rule of reasoning and deduction which were employed in that case are applied to the statute at bar, we submit that the result will lead conclusively to the preference of the whole blood in the descent of this non-ancestral property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Treat the act in question as a supplement and the way is clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-4\">Our contention is confirmed by the fact that personal and real estate go together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">That this is a true solution, is emphasized by the fact that real and personal property are cast by the provision in question into a common line of descent or distribution and, as we have already shown, never before had it been claimed that a legislative attempt was made to impart to personal property the attributes and inheritable qualities of ancestral property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">If the half blood take, \u201c former deceased husband or wife\u201d must inevitably be read \u201c ancestor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-7\">In conclusion, we submit that a comprehensive and conclusive answer to the briefs and opinion on the other side is, that they rest upon the unwarranted premises:</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\">(1) That the legislature with deliberation undertook, by enacting the supplement of 1877, to take the property in qu\u00e9stion out of the operation of the provision supplemented, and cast it into the line appointed by 4158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-9\">(2) That \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d had already been adjudged by this court to embrace the half blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-10\">(3) That the act of 1877 was a substantive and independent act instead of a supplementary provision.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-11\">Boynton, <em>Hale &amp; Horr, </em>for Ithiel Stone et al., defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-12\">We claim that the expression, \u201cone-half to the brothers and sisters of such intestate, or their legal representatives, and one-half to the brothers and sisters of such deceased husband or wife from which such personal or real estate came, or their personal representatives,\u201d as used in section 4162, represent a class and means all the brothers and sisters of the intestate or of the deceased relict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-13\">It is a primary rule of construction that the legislature is intended to have used the words of the statute in the sense in which they are commonly understood.

Touise Deshler, in which they ask the direction of the court, in making distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>bution of moneys in their hands, the proceeds of personal property which descended to her from her former husband John G. Deshler. It appears, that on the 8th day of January, 1878, John G. Deshler died in Franklin county, seized of certain real property situated in this state, which he had acquired by purchase, and possessed of a personal estate largely beyond what was necessary for the payment of his \u25a0debts and the expenses of administration. He died without issue, and intestate, leaving a widow, M. Eouise Deshler, who died intestate' and without issue, February 12, 1878; \u25a0and the personal property which came to her from her husband, was converted into money by her administrators, who hold it ready for distribution as the court may direct. John G. Deshler had two brothers of the whole blood, both of whom survived him and his widow. One of them has since \u25a0died leaving children. Surviving John- G. Deshler, were also sisters of the half blood, and representatives of a deceased brother and of deceased sisters of the half blood. The controversy, presenting the question now under consideration, is between the brother and representatives of the deceased brother of the whole blood of John G. Deshler, and the sisters and representatives of the deceased sisters and brothers of the half blood. The latter claim they are entitled to share equally with the former in the distribution of one-half of the fund in the hands of the administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In the other case, the question is made in an action for the partition of real est\u00e1te of which Margaretta Stone died seized. Silas S. Stone, it appears, died intestate, and without issue, February the 18th, 1884. He had acquired the land, the partition of which was sought in the action, by purchase, and died seized of the same. Margaretta, his widow, died without issue and intestate, January the 21st, 1892, possessed of the land. The plaintiffs in the partition suit, are the children of the only brother of the whole blood of Silas S. Stone, the brother being dead, and there being no sisters of the whole blood or their representatives. The plaintiffs claim they became the owners of one-half of the land upon the death of Margaretta, and her brothers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>sisters, and their representatives, the owners of the other half. The brothers and sisters of the half blood of Silas S. Stone, and the representatives of two deceased brothers of the half blood, were, on their motion, made parties defendant.. They claim to be tenants in common with the plaintiffs, and demand partition accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The question thus presented by each of these cases, must find its solution in the statutes regulating the descent and distribution of the estates of deceased persons, in force when the estates vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">When Deshler and his widow died, the act of March 14, 1853, as amended April 17, 1857, and the supplemental act of April 11, 1877 ( 74 Ohio Laws, 81), were in force. After-wards, and before the death of Stone and his widow, the statutes were amended in some particulars, but not so as to' affect the question in hand. The provisions of the statutes, so far as they are deemed material to the decision of the question, are: Sections 1 and 2 of the act of March 14, 1853, as amended by the act of April 17, 1857 (S. &amp; C., 501): Section 4 of the act of March 14,1853, and the supplemental act of April 11, 1877. The provisions of sections 1 and 2, which affect the question, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201c Section 1.

This act shall take effect from and after its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">These several statutory provisions are now embraced in sections 4158, 4159, 4162, and 4163, of the Revised Statutes. The act of 1857 was construed in <em>Brower </em>v. Hunt, 18 Ohio St., 311. It was there claimed, that property which had come from a deceased husband to his widow, under section two of that act, descended,- upon her decease without issue and intestate, as ancestral property, under section one, to the brothers and sisters of the deceased husband. It was held, however, that her brothers and sisters inherited, under the provisions of section two, the whole of the property she had so received from the estate of her husband. The apparent or supposed hardship and injustice resulting from the statutes, according to that interpretation, gave rise, no doubt, as counsel on both sides maintain, to the supplemental act of 1877. And three distinct views are advanced with respect to that act. One is, that its purpose was to place one-half of such property in the category of ancestral estates, and send it through the same channel of descent. Another, that it prescribes a new and independent rule of succession to the property, complete in itself, under which brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood take as one class. And the other, that the act should be construed in connection with the statutes to which it is supplementary, leaving operative all their provisions, except as changed or abrogated by it; and when so construed, each moiety of the property, it is claimed, descends to the brothers and sisters of the deceased husband or wife, and those of the relict, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of section tw^o of the act of 1857\u2014now, section 4159, of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The argument in support of the first of these propositions, is based chiefly on the decision in <em>Brower </em>v. Hunt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>supra; it being, in substance, that, as that decision denied the claim to the property, asserted by the brothers and sisters of the deceased husband, on the ground that the latter was not the ancestor of his widow, within the meaning of section one of the act of 1857, it was the legislative intent, in the enactment of the supplemental statute, to change the rule announced by the court, by making, in legal contemplation at least, the deceased husband or wife, the ancestor of his or her relict. We cannot adopt that view. The legislature appears rather to have accepted the rule established by the decision referred to, and, treating such property as non-ancestral, designed by the act in question, to secure in the future, one-half of the property to the relatives of the deceased husband or wife, and the other half to those of the relict. Such a division appeared to the legislative body to be just and equitable, and that, we think, was the practical end sought, and not the creation of a new class of ancestral estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The act undoubtedly establishes a new line of succession, in that, it divides into two equal parts, the property which before its enactment went entirely to the brothers \u00e1nd sisters of the intestate relict, and transmits one to the brothers and sisters of the former deceased husband or wife; but it prescribes no express rule as to how the brothers and sisters shall take. All real property, under our statutes of descent, is embraced within the two classes, ancestral, and non-ancestral, and the distribution of personal estates is according to the course prescribed for the descent of non-ancestral real property. -Section 1, of the act of 1857, expressly provides, that when brothers and sisters succeed, under its provisions, to ancestral property, they shall so take it, whether they \u201c be of the whole or half blood of the intestate.\u201d And by the express provisions of section 2, non-ancestral property passes first to brothers and sisters of the whole blood, and only when there are none of that class, to those of the half blood. The supplemental act, has not, in express terms, provided in which of these two ways broth\u25a0ers and sisters shall take the property descending under its provisions. It is contended that, as the terms it has em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ployed, in their ordinary and legal import, are sufficient to include in those who may take under' it, brothers and sisters of the half, as well as of the whole blood, the act should receive that construction which will allow the former to take in parcenary with the latter. Whether that would be its proper construction, if the statute provided a complete scheme of descents in itself, it is not necessary to decide. In this, as in many other instances, to arrive at the proper interpretation of the statute, it must be considered in connection with other statutes on the same subject. The act in question became a part of the statutes of descent, and was enacted to supply some defect in then existing legislation, or correct some evil growing out of it. It contains no repealing clause, and did not operate to repeal by implication, any of the statutory provisions then in force, except in so far as it is wholly irreconcilable with them; and must, therefore, be construed in its proper connection with those statutes, and so as to leave effective all of their provisions, not clearly changed or abrogated by it, keeping in view the mischief which it was intended to remed3c The substantial hardship and injustice'growing out of the act of 1857, as construed in <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>was, that the whole of the non-ancestral property which came to the relict from the former deceased husband or wife, descended upon the death of the relict, to his or her kindred; none of it to the kindred of the deceased husband or wife from whom the estate came. The remedy provided by the supplementary act consisted in dividing the property into two moieties, and giving one to the kindred of each. The general policy pervading our statutes of descent, is, that the nearer of kin shall inherit, in preference to those more remote; and, when the subject of the inheritance is non-ancestral property, brothers and sisters of the whole blood of the intestate, are regarded as nearer of kin to the intestate than those of half blood. The former, therefore, inherit in preference to the latter. That rule prevailed when the supplemental act was passed, and remained unaffected by it. It is not readiE^ perceived why a different course of descent should obtain for the particular non-ancestral propert3'- mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>in the act, than that which governs all other property of that character; nor, is it apparent the act was designed to accomplish such a result. The order in which the brothers and sisters of the intestate relict inherited before the adoption of that statute, was not within the mischief to be remedied, else that order would not have been retained undisturbed as to non-ancestral property generally. The whole of the mischief complained of was cured, by taking one half of the property from that line of descent, and giving it to the brothers and sisters of the former deceased husband or wife, leaving the other half to descend as the whole of such property had theretofore descended under the provisions of the second section of the act of 1857; the object and scope of the supplemental statute being, we think, to limit the quantity of the property that should thereafter so descend, and not to change its course of descent. We are also of the opinion that the half of the property which goes to the brothers and sisters of the former deceased husband or wife, descends in the same way; that is, first to the brothers and sisters of the whole blood, or their representatives, and if there are none, then to those of the half blood and their representatives. The statute employs the same language in disposing of each half, and it must be presumed that it was used with respect to both in the same sense. There is nothing to indicate a different intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In <em>Brcnver </em>v. <em>Hunt supra, </em>the court, in reaching the conclusion that the second section of the act of 1857 provided for all cases of descent not included in the first section, supplied certain words in the second section, which it was thought -were necessary to give complete expression to the legislative intention, as derived from a consideration of both sections. In the opinion, White, J., says: \u201cThe second section was intended to provide for all cases not included in the first. The descriptive words of the section are, \u2018 if the estate came not by descent, devise or deed of gift;\u2019 yet they have alwaj'S been regarded as embracing a devise or deed of gift from a stranger. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>14 Ohio, 385; <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>16 Ohio, 31; <em>Birney </em>v. <em>Wilson et al., </em>11 Ohio St., 427. The meaning is, \u2018if the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tate came not by descent, devise or deed of gift,\u2019 as provided in the first section.\u201d The words, \u201cas provided in the first section,\u201d were plainty implied, though not expressed in the second section; and that section was construed as if the words above quoted were contained in it. ' Those words were not, we think, more plainly implied, than are the words, \u201cas provided in said second section,\u201d after the word \u201cdescend\u201d in the supplemental act of-1877. And the proper interpretation of a statute requires that effect be given to what is clearly implied from its language, for that is as much a part of the statute as the language itself. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>50 Ohio St., 330.</p>\n<p id=\"A5c\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Mrs Deshler left surviving her, a brother of the whole blood, and the representatives of a deceased brother of the whole blood, but no brother or sister of the half blood. The brother and representatives of the deceased brother, who are the cross-petitioners in error in the Stembel case, claim the whole of the fund subject to distribution by the administrators; and whether they are entitled to it, or not, is the question peculiar to that case. That they are entitled to the one-half is not disputed. It is claimed they are entitled to the other half, because the personal property out of which the fund arose, did not come to Mrs. Deshler from her husband under section two of the act of 1857 (now section 4159 of the Revised Statutes), but under section 180, of the administration act of March' 23, 1840, which was in force at the death of her husband. That section is as follows: \u201cWhen the intestate shall not have left any legitimate child of his body, the widow shall be entitled to all the personal estate, as next of kin, which shall be subject to distribution upon settlement of the estate; and if the intestate shall have left such child, the widow shall be entitled, upon distribution, to one-half of any sum not exceeding four hundred dollars, and to one-third of the residue of the personal estate subject to distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">It is first insisted that section two of the act of 1857, has no application to personal property, but merely regulates the descent of non-ancestral real estate; and, though section four of the act of 1853, prescribes the same course for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the distribution of the personalty, that kind of property does not pass or descend under section two, but under and by virtue of section four, and is not, therefore, within the provisions of the supplemental act of 1877. It is further contended that the right of the widow to the personal property of her deceased husband, is expressly saved by the fourth section from the operation of the second; and, for that reason, it does not come to her under the latter section.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Considering these statutory provisions together, there is little difficulty in giving them a construction which makes them consistent, and effectuates the manifest intention of the legislature. The act of 1877 is, itself, a legislative interpretation of the statutes in force at the time of its enactment, to the effect, that the personal estate of the deceased husband or wife, who died intestate and without issue, came to the relict under section two of the act of 1857. And unless it is so held, the purpose of the supplemental act is, partially at least, defeated. It may be that, in a technical sense, personalty does not pass under section two. But it passes by virtue of the provisions of section four, in accordance with the rules of descent established by section two; and, in that sense, it comes to the relict from his or her former husband or wife \u201c under the provisions \u201d of the latter section. And it seems clear, that such was the sense in which the supplemental act uses the words, \u201c under the second section of the act to which this act is supplementary.\u201d This construction is not inconsistent with section 180, of the administration act. That section regulates the distribution of the personal estate by the administrator. It provides that the widow shall be entitled to all the personal estate which shall be subject to distribution upon settlement of the estate, if the deceased left no child who could inherit, and if there be such child, then to a part only, upon the distribution. It does not appear inconsistent to hold, that the widow may come to the personal property of her deceased husband under section two, that is, according to the rules of descent prescribed by that section, and be entitled to receive it from the administrator upon distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tion, on the settlement of the estate, under section 180. If she may take the personal estate under each of the sections, it by n-o means follows that it does not come to her under section two, as well as under the other. Nor, do we think the saving clause contained in section four, prevents the application of the supplementary act to the personal estate received by a widow from her deceased husband. Other statutes secure to her certain articles of personal property, and certain provisions out of the husband\u2019s estate; and, under section 180, though there be a child to inherit, she is nevertheless entitled to a share of the personalty upon distribution. To remove any repugnancy between these provisions, and the rules of succession to the personal estate under sections two and four, the saving clause, no doubt, was inserted in the latter section ; and that confirms the conclusion that where there is no child of the deceased husband to inherit, the whole of his personal estate goes to the widow under section two; for if she could take nothing under that section, as is claimed, there was no need of any saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><bracketnum>3</bracketnum> The cross petitioners in error in the <em>Stone Case, </em>are the brothers and sisters of Margaretta Stone, and the representatives of those who are deceased. They claim that one tract of land included in the action for partition, known as the Kellogg farm, did not come to Margaretta from her husband, but was a new acquisition b3r her after his death. It appears, that in 1873, Alfred Kellogg, who was then the owner of the farm, entered into a contract for the sale of the same to John Huntington, for the sum of ninety thousand dollars. Huntington paid ten thousand dollars on the purchase, and entered into the possession of the land. After-wards, in 1878, Kellogg, by deed duly executed, conveyed the land to Silas S. Stone, and assigned the Huntington contract to him ; Stone agreeing to convey upon payment of the purchase price. This was the condition of the title when Stone died. After his death, and under an arrangement with his administrators, Huntington, and those who had become interested in the land under him, released and transferred to Margaretta, as widow and sole heir at law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Silas Stone, their interest in the land, and paid the administrators twenty-five thousand dollars, in consideration of which, Huntington, and the others, were discharged from further liability on the contract. Stone was seized of the legal title to the land at the time of his death. The right of Huntington under his contract was, to compel the conveyance of the land upon payment of the purchase price. The legal title descended to Margaretta, subject to that right of Huntington. He had an equitable interest in the land to the extent he had made payment of the purchase money, which, upon payment of the residue, would ripen into a. complete equitable title. He chose to surrender his equitable interest, rather than complete his purchase, and take the title. The equitable interest was surrendered to the holder of the legal title, Margaretta; and that was the condition of the estate when she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It is well settled that the course of descent of real estate, is controlled by the legal title; and when the legal and \u2022equitable title unite in the same person, the latter becomes merged in the former, and does not descend separately. The legal title draws to it the whole estate, and carries it in the same channel of descent as if the equitable estate had never existed. It follows, that the Kellogg farm descended from Margaretta, as real estate which had come to her from her husband, under section 4159, of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>There is no error in the judgmeril of the circuit court on that questioji, and the j^ldgme)lt in that respect is affirmed. But that co2irt erred, we think, in holding that the brothers and sisters of the half blood of Silas S. Stone, or their representatives, were entitled to share in the partition; and that part of its jtidgment is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to sustain the demurrer to their answer and cross-petitiofi, and for partition as prayedfor by the plaintiffs helow. The judgment in the Stembel case is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-6\">MinsharrJ.</author>\n<p id=\"A_q\">(dissenting). I cannot concur in this opinion. It gives to the plain language of section 4162, Revised Statutes, a construction, that is, in my opinion, without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>warrant in the rules of interpretation. The section provides how real or personal property shall descend, which came to an intestate relict from a former deceased husband or wife, under the provisions of section 4159: It is, that when such relict dies without children or their legal representatives, the property shall pass and descend, one-half to the brothers and sisters of such intestate, or their legal representatives, and one-half to the brothers and sisters of the deceased husband or wife from whom the estate came.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">This section does not refer to section 4159 for the <em>mode of descent, </em>but for the mode in which the property <em>had been acquired, </em>and, for property so acquired, fixes, the descent by language of its own, that is plain and unambiguous; for the words, <em>\u201c </em>brothers and sisters,\u201d have in law a definite meaning; they include brothers and sisters of the <em>half, </em>as well as of the <em>whole, </em>blood. On a mere conjecture that the legislature meant that the property should go according to-the rules fixed by the section under which it had been acquired by the deceased relict, the court has rejected the plain meaning of the words adopted in the section fixing its descent, and substituted the language of the former section; that is to say, the section fixing the descent of non-ancestral property, although, as a matter of fact, the legislature treats it as <em>quasi </em>ancestral property, in sending one-half of it back to the brothers and sisters of the deceased consort from whom the estate* came. We fail to appreciate the suggestion of counsel that this interpretation is more in accordance with the sentiments of natural affection. That the rules of descent are, as a general rule, adopted in analogy to the natural affections, is true. But what ground is-there for saying that this must have been the principle upon which the provisions of section 4162 were adopted in providing for a descent of property from an intestate relict to the brothers and sisters of the deceased consort from whom the estate came. In such case there is supposed to be no blood relationship whatever; so that there is no ground for assuming that such deceased relict, the person who died possessed of the property, would perfer brothers and sisters of the whole, to brothers and sisters of the half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>blood. -Being strangers to his or her blood, it -would be a matter of mere accident whether either were perferred, and that accident might as readily have determined the relict to prefer the half to the whole blood. So that the analogy of the natural affections wholly fails, so far as this statute provides for the descent of property from a deceased husband or wife to the brothers and sisters of the deceased consort, from whom the'estate came; and, this being the case, the court should have given effect to the plain meaning of the language in which such descent is provided for.</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-5\">Dickman, J., concurs in this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
