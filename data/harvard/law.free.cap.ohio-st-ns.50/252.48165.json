I shall consider first, the sufficiency of the second \u2022defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-13\">The judgment in the suit brought in 1886, to recover a penalty, is no bar to this action, because neither the parties, the cause of action, the facts, nor the law, was the same as in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-14\">In the former suit, the state was the plaintiff, and the insurance company alone, the defendant; in this suit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>state on the relation of the superintendent of insurance is plaintiff, and the insurance company and its president and secretary, defendants. In that suit, the cause of action was the failure of the company to file a statement of its condition on the 31st of December, 1885; in this suit, the refusal to file a statement of its condition December 31, 1892. That suit was to recover a penalty, this is to enforce a duty. When the suit was decided section 3234 only exempted from its provisions a fire insurance company complying with the requirements of section 3655; on March 8, 1892, (see 89 O. U., 73), it was amended so as to exempt a fire insurance company complying with the requirements of section 3654, and 3655, or any police regulation contained in chapter eleven of that title, or in chapter eight, title three, part first. That is, a fire insurance companjq created before the adoption of the present constitution, complying with these requirements, shall not be deemed to have consented or be held to be a corporation under the present constitution and the laws passed in pursuance thereof. The materiality of this amendment, in a consideration of the question involved in this case, will be more fully discussed later.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">II. The question raised b3^ the first defense is the real question in the case, namely, whether to require this old charter company to file a statement of its condition in the office of the superintendent of insurance, in compliance with section 3654, which applies in terms to all fire insurance companies, will impair the obligation of the contract made by its charter between the state and itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">No obligation of the contract created by the charter is. impaired, because the act of March 22, 1850, neither expressly, nor by implication, exempts the company from the duty of filing a statement of its condition with the proper state officer, should the state so require; but, on the contrary, by implication, subjects it to such requirement, which is calculated to further the ends of the incorporation, and secure the observance of the conditions on which the grant was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>1. Rule of construction of a charter or grant. The reservation of control need not be expressed; but exemption from control must be expressed; for what is not granted in terms or by necessary implication is reserved to the state. <em>Providence Bank </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>4 Peters, 515; <em>Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>Warren Bridge, </em>11 Peters, 544; <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Railway Company, </em>27 Vt., 140; <em>Fertilizing Company </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>97 U.

S., 174, 185; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>The Columbus Gas Light and Coke Co., </em>34 Ohio St., 572; <em>Zanesville </em>v. <em>Gas Light Company, </em>47 Ohio St., 1, 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">2. The charter imposes on this insurance company certain 'duties, which gives the public an interest in the conduct of its affairs, and subjects it to reasonable regulations, calculated to secure the ends for which the company was created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">This company is an insurance company. That the matter of insurance is of public interest, is apparent from the amount and character of the legislation on the subject, not \u25a0only in this state, but in all states, and in all countries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">Section 6761, of the chapter regulating proceedings in <em>qzio warranto,, </em>provides that an action may be brought against a corporation -when it has offended against a provision of an act for its creation, or when it has misused its franchises, etc., etc. The superintendent of insurance is sworn and charged to enforce all laws relating to insurance. How can he tell whether an old charter company is or is not misusing its franchises and violating its charter, if no statement is required .to be made, and no examination by him permitted? <em>Chicago Life Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Needles, </em>113, U. S., 574.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">3. A charter being a contract, privileges being granted by the state in consideration of benefits to accrue to the public from a proper use of the franchises given, the public has the right to know whether the company is discharging its duties and in good faith observing the corporate contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-9\">The insurance company, insists the charter created a contract. I admit that. But it was not a one-sided contract. The corporation did not get all, and give or agree to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>nothing. The company was granted certain privileges; but these were granted in consideration of benefits expected to' accrue to the public from the exercise of the privileges, granted. If certain rights were conferred, certain duties were imposed on the company. By accepting the charter the' company agreed to discharge these duties, agreed tO' observe the obligations, and be responsible to the state for the misuse of its franchise.. The state having the right to-call the company to account for an abuse of the privileges granted, has a right to be informed how these privileges are being exercised. Without such information, without the power to compel its production, the public is powerless to enforce the obligations of the corporate contract and protect itself against the abuse of its privileges and the violation of its laws. The legislature, which is the agent of the public, charged with the duty of protecting it against fraud or mismanagement on the part of corporations, did no more than was absolutely necessary, in requiring all insurance companies to file the statement in quest on. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics' </em>Bank, 21 Pick., 542; <em>Sinking Fund Cases, </em>99 U. S. 722.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">III. To prevent fraud or mismanagement in the operation of insurance companies, and to protect the public against deception and loss thereby, the state has authority, under the police power, to require all companies doing an insurance business within its limits, whether incorporated in this, state prior to or since the adoption of the present constitution, to make, annualfy, public disclosure of the condition of their affairs, by filing the statements mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">All rights held and enjoyed by individuals and by corporations, even the fundamental rights of liberty and property, are \u2019not absolute in character, but must be held and enjoyed subject to the proper demands of society and subservient to the common welfare. - Included in the general grant of legislative power, is what is termed the police power of the state. <em>Beer Company </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>97 U. S., 25, 33; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 Ohio St., 238; Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, (bot. p. 716); Tiedeman, Rimitations of Police Power, pages 576, 580; <em>Stone </em>v. Mississippi, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>101 U. S., 814; <em>Butchers\u2019 Union Company </em>v. <em>Crescent City </em>Company, 111 U.

S., 650, 672; <em>Railway Company </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>67 Ill., 37, 40; <em>Railway </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>30, Ohio St., 604, 616; <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>32 Ohio St., 152, 158; <em>State </em>v. <em>Addington, </em>77 Mo., 116; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>114 Penn., 265, 280; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>127 U. S., 678, 684.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">The amendment of March 8, 1892, to section 3234, recognizes the requirements of sections 3654 and 3655 as police regulations, and expressly provides that a compliance therewith shall not divest a fire insurance company, created before the adoption of the present constitution, of any vested rights under its charter. Since this amendment, there is no valid excuse for any fire insurance company refusing to file this statement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-6\"><em>Follett &amp; Kelley, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">I. The Eagle Insurance Company was incorporated under a special act of the legislature of the state of Ohio, passed March 22, 1850. Said special act reserved no power or right to alter, amend or repeal. Said act of incorporation did not provide for or require any annual report to be made by said company to any official of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">This special act was not repealed or abrogated by the second section of article XII. of the constitution of 1851, nor by subsequent legislation relating to insurance. companies. <em>Cass </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>2 Ohio St., 607; <em>Citizens' Bank </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 Ohio St., 318; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roosa, </em>11 Ohio St., 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">The burden imposed by sections 3654 and 3655, of the Revised Statutes, are entirely new and additional to any requirements of the charter of The Eagle Insurance Company. The object aimed at in section 3654 is evidently to enable the superintendent of insurance to ascertain from such report whether companies, organized in pursuance of the provisions of the act of which that section is a part, have complied with the provisions of said act in the disposition and investment of its capital stock and surplus funds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The language of this section, as to the companies embraced within its provisions, is not more comprehensive than that of section 3637, and we hardly think it possible that any one would claim that the provisions of section 3637 applied to or are obligatory upon The Eagle Insurance Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">Section 3637, of the Revised Statutes, directs the investment of the capital stock of all the insurance companies, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">Section 3638 restrains and limits the power of investment of the surplus money, over and above the capital stock of the company, and section 3639 limits the investment of capital stock in national banks, and each of said sections, if applicabl\u00e9 to the defendant compan)?, would deprive the board of directors of the defendant of the discretion vested in them by the charter of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">Section 3661a, Revised Statutes, prohibits any fire insurance company, organized under the laws of this state, or admitted to do business in this state, from including in any statement of assets in any public advertisement, card or circular, any item of value of a class or character not admitted by the superintendent of insurance of this state in the annual reports of said companies. The superintendent of insurance would, of course, feel himself bound to admit nothing as assets which was not embraced with the classification of assets or securities in which insurance companies were authorized to invest their capital stock and surplus funds, and an annual statement, showing other and different classes of investments, if rejected by him, however good such classes of securities might be, would prevent such company from including such securities as part of its assets, under the penalty of one thousand dollars, as prescribed by section 3661\u00bf?. Indeed, all the sections of this chapter are intended to dovetail together and form one system for the government of insurance companies, and we submit that if the superintendent of insurance may single out one of these sections and, by a mandamus, compel a company organized under a special charter, in which the legislature reserved to itself no right to alter, amend or repeal, to comply with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>provisions, he may, by mandamus, compel such companies to comply with each and every section of said chapter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">All these sections apply to all insurance companies equally with section 8654, and if section 3654 can be held to apply to this company, and the other sections alluded to also apply to this company, the effect would be not simply to \u2022 alter and amend the charter of this company, but practically to take from it its most essential and vital part. But that the legislature did not intend that any provision of title II. of the Revised Statutes, should apply to corporations organized prior to the adoption of the constitution of 1851, is evident from the language of sections 3232 and 3234, of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The amendment to section 3234 is the proviso. Prior to said amendment, we had the anomalus condition of the superintendent of insurance insisting that companies organized under special charters, as the defendant company was organized, were required to make a report under the provisions of section 3654, while the statute declared that the making of such report should of itself evidence assent on the part of the company making such report, to be a\" corporation under the present constitution, and to have and to exercise all and singular its franchises under the present constitution and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, and not otherwise. Certainly a singular position in which to attempt to place insurance companies, and a remarkable ah tentative presented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">II. The powers conferred and the duties enjoined by section 3654, Revised Statutes, are not police powers which the state can not surrender, nor is the duty therein imposed upon the defendant company a police regulation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">We are aware that it has become a convenient method of asserting and attempting to enforce rules and regulations which would clearly be otherwise prohibited, under the claim that they are police regulations, and in the broadest sense to attempt to invoke this power for the accomplishment of that which could not in any other way be accomplished. ' But we think there can be but little doubt in any specific case as to the limits of this so-called police power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and that it can never be exercised in such a way as to destroy constitutional rights, or to deprive any one of the protection furnished by constitutional guarantees, unless the public safety, the public health and -the public morals are directly involved. That this power whatever it may be, is vested in the state we do not deny; and that the state can not, even by contract,' deprive itself of the right to exercise such power, we do not deny; but we do emphatically deny that the provisions of said section 3654, as they are attempted to be applied to the defendant company, is the exercise, or the attempted exercise, of what may legitimately be called the police power. Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 4 Ed., p. 720; <em>Philadelphia etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>4 Houst.

Indeed, no exercise of police power would be permissible as affecting the defendant company which would not equally apply to any private citizen. <em>The New Orleans Gas Co. </em>v. <em>The Louisiana Light Co., </em>115 U.

The second defense of the answer of defendants is the plea of <em>res judicata, </em>setting out the institution of an action by the Attorney General in the name of the state of Ohio against The Eagle Insurance Company, to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>penalty prescribed by section 3655, for failure to make the report required by section 3654, said action having been brought in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, Ohio, being the court designated in which said action might be brought by the Attorney General by the provisions of said section 3655; the filing of an answer in that case by The Eagle Insurance Company, setting forth its charter, and claiming that it was not required to make such report; that a demurrer was filed to said .answer, .which demurrer was overruled, and said plaintiff not desiring to plead further, final judgment was rendered in said action, which judgment is still in full force, unreversed, and is plead by the defendant as a bar to this action. The questions adjudicated in that case are identically the same as those presented in this case, although the form of action in this case differs. But to determine whether the questions are the same, the court does not look to the form of action but solely to the issues presented. In both cases the sole issue is whether or. not the defendant company can legally be required to make the annual report required by section 3654. There can be no question of the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas of Franklin county, Ohio, to hear and determine that question, for that jurisdiction was conferred specifically for that purpose by section 3655. We shall not cite authorities to the proposition that no person or corporation can be twice called to answer to the same matter, or that-no matter once litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction can be re-litigated between the same parties. These propositions are elementary, and a citation of authorities to sustain them can not be necessary. The doctrine has been settled in this state, in the case of <em>Bell </em>v. <em>McColloch, </em>31 Ohio St., 397; 1 Herman on Estoppel and Res Judicata, p. 219, section 197.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-5\">Dickman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">This proceeding is prosecuted on the relation of W. H. Kinder, superintendent of insurance of the state of Ohio, against The Eagle Insurance Company of Cincinnati, and John K. Green and Samuel P. Post, president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and secretary of the company. It is alleged in the petition, that the company is a fire insurance company incorporated under an act passed March 22,11850 (48 Ohio Taws, 498), and that it was and is the duty of the company and its president and secretary, to deposit in the office of the superintendent of insurance a statement of the condition of such company on the thirty-first day of December, 1892, as required by sections 3654 and 3655 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio; that proper blanks were furnished and due demand made, but that the company and its officers have refused and do refuse to file the required statement; and that the company still continues to carry on the business of insurance. The prayer of the petition is, that writs of mandamus may be issued, compelling the company, .its president and secretary, to comply with the provisions of the above mentioned sections of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The defendants answer, and set up two defenses. First, they aver that under the provisions of the act of March 22, 1850, which constitutes the charter of the insurance company, no power was reserved to alter, amend or repeal the charter; and that if sections 3654 and 3655 impose any duty upon the defendants or either of them, they would impair the obligation of the contract embraced in the charter of the company, and would be in violation, of section 28, of article 2, of the constitution of Ohio, and of section 10, of article 1, of the constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The second defense contained in the answer is that of <em>res judicata. </em>It is averred by the defendants, that on or about July 27, 1886, the attorney general filed a petition in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, Ohio, in which the state of Ohio was plaintiff and The Eagle Insurance Company of Cincinnati was defendant, setting forth that the company and its officers, after due notice and request, had failed, neglected and refused to deposit, either on the first day of January, 1886, or within thirty days thereafter, the statement required by section- 3654, of the Revised Statutes, showing the condition of the company on the thirty-first day December, 1885, and praying judgment against the company for the five hundred dollars penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and the \u201cadditional\u201d thereto, as imposed by section 3655, of the Revised Statutes; that the insurance company in August, 1886, filed its answer, setting up that it was organized and existed as a corporation solely under and by virtue of the act of March 22, 1850, and was not subject to the provisions of sections 3654 and 3655, of the Revised Statutes; that in December, 1886, the state demurred to the company\u2019s answer, and on February 1, 1887, the demurrer being overruled, and the state not desiring to plead further, the action was dismissed by the court, and judgment rendered in favor of the company; that the state took the case by petition in error to the circuit court, and by that court the judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed, and remains in full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">To the answer in this proceeding, and to each of the defenses therein contained, the plaintiff demurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Eagle Insurance Company is a corporation, created before the adoption of the present constitution, claiming to exercise certain rights, privileges and franchises, under a special act of the legislature which constitutes its charter. Obviously, such charter or act of the legislature, in connection with its acceptance, may be regarded as a contract, and one which, so long as the body corporate faithfully observes it, the legislature is constitutionally restrained from impairing, by annexing without the consent of the corporation new terms and conditions, onerous in their operation, or inconsistent with a reasonable construction of the contract. And any act of the legislature which violates any corporate right, secured by such charter of the corporation, without its consent, is void as against the constitution of the state and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">But, in determining the corporate rights secured by the charter, the true rule of construction is, that corporations take nothing by intendment but what is necessary to the enjoyment of that which is expressly granted. When a company is incorporated it is to be inferred, that the legislature intended it should exercise only those corporate powers that might be necessary to carry on the business for which the company was organized. And it may be stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>as a rule of construction, that where there is a grant of special privileges in derogation of common right, or an exemption from the operation of general laws governing other persons or corporate bodies, it must always be presumed that the legislature does not design to confer franchises of this character, unless a contrary intention be expressed in unambiguous terms. Mor. Corp., \u00a7323.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Though there may be no reservation in the charter of incorporation that the state shall have the right to repeal, alter, or amend it at pleasure, the grant of corporate powers, or of exemptions from the operation of general laws, will carry only those that are expressly or unambiguously granted. \u201cThe rights of the public are never presumed to be surrendered to a corporation, unless the intention to surrender clearly appears in the law.\u201d <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Chesapeake mid Delaware Canal Co., </em>9 How. (U. S.) 192. \u201cA franchise must be created by express terms and cannot be inferred from the mere silence of the charter.\u201d <em>Zanesville </em>v. <em>Gas Light Co., </em>47 Ohio St. 31. As expressed by Chief Justice Marsharr in the <em>Dartmouth College case, </em>\u201cA corporation possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly, or \u2018as <em>incidental to its very </em>existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">When it is sought, therefore, to subject a company, claiming rights under a special charter, to the provisions of a general law, the question at once arises, are the requirements of the law plainly inconsistent with the enjoyment of the charter rights and franchises granted to the company. If the provisions of the general law are consistent with the rights of the corporation as secured by its charter, the corporation will be subject to the law-making power to the same extent as unincorporated individuals. It need hardly be stated, that when the legislature, by a special act or charter, clothes individuals with corporate power, they are not to be presumed as forever thereafter emancipated from all legislative control as to their corporate acts and franchises. A contract of exemption from such further legislation can never be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>An association deriving its corporate existence from the state, and engaged in a business of such a character that the public are directly interested in its proper management, should be subject to such reasonable regulations as will secure the ends of its creation. Not only the state may, but it is an obligation binding upon it, for the protection of its citizens, to see that such laws are passed and enforced, as will enable the state to know whether corporations are properly exercising their corporate privileges. It has accordingly been enacted by the general assembty (Revised Statutes of Ohio, sec. 272), that when the superintendent of insurance has reason to suspect, that the affairs of an insurance company doing business in the state are in an unsound condition, he shall make, or cause to be made, by some person b3r him for that purpose appointed, an examination into the affairs of such company; and such company, its officers and agents, shall submit their books and business to such examination, and in every way facilitate the same. From this salutary provision of the statute, no insurance company should be exempted, whether created before or since the adoption of the present constitution. Nor should it, in our judgment, be deemed an unwarranted exercise of the legislative power, if, instead of authorizing the superintendent of insurance to make an examination into the affairs of such company, the law should require the officers of such company to deposit with the superintendent a statement of the condition of the company at any designated time.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Section 3654 of the Revised Statutes, provides that, the president or vice-president and secretary of each insurance company organized under any law of this state shall annually, on the first day of January, or within thirty da3rs thereafter, prepare, under oath, and deposit in the office of the 'superintendent of insurance, a statement of the condition of such company on the thirty-first day of December then next preceding, exhibiting in form, and with specifications in \u2022detail, as prescribed by the statute: (1). The amount of the capital stock of the compa^r; (2) The property or assets ield by the company; (3) The liabilities of the company; (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The income of the company during the preceding year; and (5) The expenditure during the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The main proposition of counsel for The Eagle Iusurance Company is, that the obligation of the contract which the company had with the state, in its charter, will be impaired if that company be held subject to the operation of sections 3654 and 3655. Upon- an examination of the company\u2019s charter, we discover no repugnance between the requirements of those sections of the statute and the provisions of the charter. The charter does not, either in express terms or by implication, absolve the company from the duty of preparing and depositing the required statement of its condition; and it contains no language which, even by a strained construction or remote inference, would exempt the company from a compliance with the provisions of those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Those provisions we regard as no more than reasonable regulations for the safety of the capital, interest of the stockholders, and security of the public, entirely consistent with the corporate rights granted to the insurance company in its charter, and especially proper as a safe-guard for policy holders, entitled to know whether the affairs of the company are in a sound or unsound condition. The fact that The Eagle Insurance Company may be a corporation conducting its business upon a sound basis, does not release it from the operation of those reasonable regulations that may be prescribed by the legislature to promote the purposes of its. creation, and which are not repugnant to its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The regulation that the defendant and other insurance companies shall file the statement of their condition as required by statute, being such as we deem the public good requires, the reasonableness of such regulation'may be illustrated by a reference to what the defendant company may be capable of under its charter, relative to the object of its incorporation. It cannot be said, that the legislature has been shorn of all power by general law, to see that the defendant keeps within the line of its charter, and performs, its corporate duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The charter fixes the capital stock of the association at one hundred thousand dollars, which may be increased to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>two huudred thousand dollars at the pleasure of a majority \u25a0of the stockholders, to be divided into shares of one hundred dollars each. At the time of subscription, twenty - five dollars must be paid oh each share, and tiie balance on \u25a0each share is made subject to the call \u00f3f the directors, and is to be secured by endorsed notes payable on demand, or \u25a0other property. When four hundred shares are subscribed for and paid, or secured to be paid, the company becomes \u25a0competent to transact all kinds of business for which it is \u25a0established. Here are duties and limitations imposed. In such a case, it is not unreasonable that the company should be required to deposit a statement, as provided by section \u25a03654, of the amount of its capital stock, specifying the \u25a0amount paid and unpaid, and the amount of unpaid assessments on stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Again, the charter, in section 1, authorizes the company to hold such real estate only as shall be necessary for the transaction of its business, or may be taken as security for \u25a0or in payment of a debt. Section 3654 properly provides, that in the statement of an insurance company\u2019s condition, there shall be specified the value of the real estate owned by such company, where it is situate, and the value of the \"buildings thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Again, under the charter, it is not lawful for the corporation to use or employ any part of its capital stock, money of other funds, in buying or selling goods, wares or merchandise, nor in the purchase of real estate, except as provided in the first section of the charter; nor shall the company trade in the business of exchange brokerage, or in any manner engage in the business or operation of banking. An essential aid, in the enforcement of these prohibitions, is afforded by requiring in the company\u2019s statement a specification of its assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Furthermore, by the charter it is provided, that the president and directors shall declare such dividends of the profits of the business of the company as shall not impair, nor in anywise lessen the capital stock of the same. Whether this rule is disregarded or complied with, the superintendent of insurance may be enabled to discover through a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of the company\u2019s condition, which, in addition to the company\u2019s assets and liabilities, shall specify, in accordance with section 3654, the amount of dividends declared and due, and remaining unpaid\u2014the amount of dividends, either cash or scrip, declared but not due\u2014and the amount of dividends paid during the j^ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In <em>Chicago Life Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Needles, </em>113 U. S-574, we find facts and conclusions bearing directly upon the decision we have reached in the case at bar. The Chicago Rife Insurance Company was incorporated by special act of the General Assembly of Illinois, and vested with power to carry on the business of life insurance. Two years after the charter was granted the company, a general law of the state was approved and took effect, which required, among-other things, that every life insurance company incorporated in Illinois, should transmit to the auditor of state, on or before the first day of March, in each year, a sworn statement 'of its business, standing, and affairs, in the form prescribed or authorized by law, and adapted to its business,- and empowered that officer to address' inquiries to any company in relation to its doings or condition, or any other matter connected with its transactions, to which it was required to make prompt reply; and made it the auditor\u2019s, duty to make, or cause to be made, an examination of its condition and affairs, whenever he deemed it expedient to-do so, or whenever he had good reason to suspect the correctness of any annual statement, or that its affairs were in an unsound condition. The auditor of state acting under this and a subsequent statute, made an examination into-the affairs of The Chicago Rife Insurance Company, found it to be insolvent, instituted proceedings to wind up its affairs, and a final judgment was rendered enjoining the company from further prosecution of 'its business. From that judgment a writ of error was prosecuted to the Supreme \u25a0 Court of the state, and to reverse the judgment of that court error was prosecuted in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It was contended by counsel, that the obligation of the contract which the company had with the state, in its orig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>inal and amended charter, would be impaired, if the company were held subject to the operation of subsequent statutes regulating the business of life insurance, and authorizing the courts, in certain contingencies, to suspend, restrain, or prohibit insurance companies incorporated in Illinois from further continuance in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u201cThis position,\u201d said Justice Harran, delivering the opinion of the court, \u201ccannot be sustained, consistently with the power which the state has, and, upon every ground of public policy, must always have, over corporations of her own creation. Nor is it justified by any reasonable interpretation of the language of the company\u2019s charter-The right of the plaintiff in error to exist as a corporation,, and its authority, in that capacity, to conduct the particular business for which it was created, were granted, subject to the condition that the privileges and franchises conferred upon it should not be abused, or so employed as to defeat the ends for which it was established. Although no such condition is expressed in the company\u2019s charter, it is necessarily implied in every grant of corporate existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u201cEqually implied, in our judgment, is the condition that the corporation shall be subject to such reasonable regulations, in respect to the general concfuct of its affairs, as the legislature may, from time to time, prescribe, which do not materially interfere with or obstruct the substantial enjoyment of the privileges the state has granted, and serve only to secure the ends for which the corporation is created. If this condition be not necessarily implied, then the creation of corporations, with rights and franchises which do not belong to individual citizens, may become dangerous to the public welfare through the ignorance, or misconduct, or fraud of those to whose management their affairs are intrusted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The same doctrine is recognized in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farmers and Mechanics' Bank, </em>21 Pick. 542, as applied to the visitatorial power of the state over banks. And the law is clearly stated, to the sanie effect, in the. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>9 Cush. 604, in answer to the question submitted to them by the senate: \u201cIs the corporation known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>as the \u2018 Provident Institution for Savings in the Town of Boston/ chartered in the year 1816, subject to the general laws of the Commonwealth relating to savings banks and institutions for savings, passed since the granting of the charter aforesaid?\u201d The judges in their answer express the opinion, that the legislature, by giving to the institution in Boston the privilege of being a corporation, and of managing its proper business, did not relinquish any power of legislating on all proper subjects of legislation; that the legislature could not be deprived of the power it holds for the public good, by any doubtful construction of the charter; that the position that the legislature had granted away any of its appropriate powers of legislation, could be supported only by clearly showing such grant; and that there appeared to be nothing in the charter of the Provident Institution for Savings in Boston, to exempt it from the provisions of the general laws, passed since the date of the charter, relating to savings banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We come now to consider the question, whether the judgment in the suit brought against the defendant, in July, 1886, in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, to recover a penalty, is a bar to this action; whether by reason of the determination in that suit, the right to require the company to prepare and deposit in the office of the superintendent of insurance a statement of its condition, is <em>res judicata. </em>We do not think that the cause of action in the two cases can be held to be identical. In the one case, it was a failure of the company to file the statutory statement of its condition on the 31st day of December, 1885, and the suit was to recover the penalty prescribed by statute for such failure. In the present case, it is a refusal of the. company to file such statement of its condition on the 31st day of December, 1892, and the proceeding is in mandamus to enforce a specific duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">It is urged however, in behalf of the defendant, that the subject matter now in controversy was drawn in question, and within the issue in the former judicial proceeding which terminated in a regular judgment on the merits. But the rule is well settled, that an adjudication affects no claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>which the parties had no opportunity to litigate. There are many cases in which the judgment of a court will be <em>res judicata </em>as long as the circumstances continue the same, but will cease to be so whenever any change takes place in those circumstances. <em>People </em>v. Mercein, 3 Hill 416; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Petaluma, </em>36 Cal. 230. Thus, even where title has been tried in a writ of entry, intervening events affecting the issue may be shown, to prevent a former judgment from being conclusive; and the demandant may introduce evidence of a newly acquired title by deed duly delivered sih.ee the commencement of the former suit. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>10 Allen 22. In <em>Hall v. Levy, </em>10. <em>L. </em>R. C. P. 154,, it was held, that a record works an estoppel only as to those matters capable of being controverted between the parties at the time of the proceedings in the action; and therefore although a deed may have been proved to be valid in one action, yet it may be shown in a subsequent suit to have become invalid, if the circumstances avoiding it have happened after the determination of the earlier action..</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">These cases, and others like them, rest upon the principle that after acquired rights and change of circumstances may prevent the former judgment from operating as an estoppel in subsequent judicial proceedings. And to apply the principle to the case under consideration, where a judgment is rendered, by a court of competent jurisdiction, in favor of a party to the suit, for the reason that otherwise, under an existing law, a chartered right of such party might be placed in peril, the decision should not be conclusive in a subsequent action between the same parties, when the law has been so amended that such right is thereby assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The originals of sections 3654 and 3655 of the Revised Statutes, are found in sections 19 and 21 respectively of \u201cAn act to regulate insurance companies,\u201d passed April 15, 1867 (64 Ohio Laws 157). Subsequently, it was provided by section 3234 of the Revised Statutes of 1880, as follows: \u201cCorporations created before the adoption of the present constitution, which take any action under or in pursuance of this title (Title II, Part Second, Corporations), shall thereby and thereafter be deemed to have consented, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>shall be held, to be a corporation, and to have and exercise all and singular its franchises, under the present constitution, and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, and not otherwise.\u201d To be a corporation under such conditions, is to be placed on the same footing with corporations formed under general laws, which may, from time to time, be altered or repealed. How reasonable soever might be the regulation that a statement of the condition of an insurance company, created before the adoption of the present constitution, should be filed with the superintendent of insurance, the question would at once be suggested, whether a compliance with such regulation might not be deemed a consent to be a corporation under the present constitution, and a waiver of the companj'-\u2019s chartered <em>rights.\u00bb </em>Section 3234 was accordingly amended, May 18,1886, (83 Ohio Raws 201), b3r adding the proviso: \u201cThat ai^ fire insurance company so created, complying with the requirements of section 3655, shall not be deemed to have consented, and shall not be affected by the provisions of this section by reason of such compliance.\u201d While the law thus stood, the action was instituted,- in July, 1886. b3r the attorney general, in the name of the state, .in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, to recover the penalty from The Eagle Insurance Company for its failure, neglect and refusal to file the statement required by section 3654. As it was a compliance with section 3655, which, under the amendatory proviso was not to be deemed a consent to be a corporation under the present constitution, the court of common pleas overruled the demurrer of the state, and rendered judgment for the compare The court thereby declined, virtualfy, to visit a penalty upon the company for non-compliance with the requirements of section 3654, when a voluntary compliance, at that time, might have involved in doubt, and perhaps in peril, the chartered privileges of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">But by act of March 8, 1892, (89 Ohio Raws, 73), the proviso to section 3234 was enlarged, so that any fire insurance. company created before the adoption of the present constitution, complying with the requirements of sections 3654 and 3655, would not be deemed to have consented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>be a corporation, and to exercise all its franchises under the present constitution, and the laws passed in pursuance thereof. Had the proviso to section 3234 contained what it now does, and when this action was begun, the judgment in the former suit to recover the statutory penalty would doubtless have been different from what it was. Under the statute, as it now is, the filing of a statement under section 3654, with the superintendent of insurance, can cast no doubt or shade upon the inviolability of the defendant\u2019s charter, and the prosecution of a proceeding like the present, to enforce a compliance with the provisions of that section, shonld not, we think, be barred by the adjudication in the former suit. The obligation of the contract between i the state and the defendant not having been impaired, and the state not being estopped to maintain this action by the judgment in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, we are of opinion, that a peremptory writ should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
