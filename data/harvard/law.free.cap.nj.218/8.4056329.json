(Bridge-way) was terminated in January 2008 after he complained to the facility\u2019s management about the rate of infectious diseases among patients, reported his concerns to governmental agencies and the press, and disclosed partially-redacted records of patient care to a television reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">In this action, plaintiff alleged a claim under CEPA\u2019s provision barring employer retaliatory action against a licensed or certified health care employee who reports on, or objects to, an employer activity, policy, or practice that the employee reasonably believes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to constitute \u201cimproper quality of patient care.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(1); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(l). He also asserted a claim under another CEPA provision barring retaliatory action against an employee who objects to an employer activity, policy or practice that the employee reasonably believes to be \u201cincompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3). Plaintiff cited the American Nursing Association (ANA) Code of Ethics and two Bridgeway documents \u2014 a portion of its Employee Handbook and its Statement of Resident Rights \u2014 in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The trial court denied Bridgeway\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of plaintiffs case and the jury returned a verdict of liability under CEPA, but awarded no damages. The parties cross-appealed, and an Appellate Division panel reversed plaintiffs liability verdict, holding that plaintiffs CEPA claim failed as a matter of law because he did not demonstrate an objectively reasonable belief that Bridgeway\u2019s conduct gave rise to an improper quality of patient care or was incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We affirm. We hold that claims asserted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(1) and (c)(l)\u2019s \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d provision must be premised upon a reasonable belief that the employer has violated a law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling adopted pursuant to law, or a professional code of ethics that governs the employer and differentiates between acceptable and unacceptable conduct in the employer\u2019s delivery of patient care. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l); <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-3(c)(l). We further hold that a plaintiff asserting that his or her employer\u2019s conduct is incompatible with a \u201cclear mandate of public policy concerning the public health\u201d must, at a minimum, identify authority that applies to the \u201cactivity, policy or practice\u201d of the employer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Applied here, that standard warrants dismissal of plaintiffs CEPA claims. Although a professional code of ethics governing an employer\u2019s activities may constitute authority for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l), (c)(1) and (c)(3) in an appropriate setting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the ANA Code of Ethics (ANA Code) invoked by plaintiff provided no standard for his employer\u2019s control of infectious disease, and accordingly does not support plaintiffs CEPA allegations. The Bridgeway Employee Handbook and Statement of Resident Rights neither defined acceptable patient care nor stated a clear mandate of public policy for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l), (c)(1), or (c)(3). Accordingly, we concur with the Appellate Division panel that the trial court should have granted Bridgeway\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">We derive the facts of this case from the evidence presented by the parties at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Bridgeway operates the Bridgeway Care Center, a nursing home in Bridgewater. In January 2008, Bridgeway employed 177 people and served approximately 145 patients, most of them elderly. Bridgeway\u2019s management team included Chief Executive Officer Donald Pelligrino, also a part owner of Bridgeway, as well as Medical Director Anthony Frisoli, M.D., Director of Nursing Frances Gerber, R.N., and Administrator Wayne Blum.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">In December 2003, Bridgeway hired plaintiff to work as a staff nurse in the subacute unit of the nursing home. At the time of his hiring, plaintiff executed a confidentiality agreement in which he agreed not to disclose confidential patient information and acknowledged that if he did so, he would be subject to termination. After a brief period in the subacute unit, plaintiff was assigned to work as a staff nurse in Bridgeway\u2019s long-term care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">In 2006, Bridgeway promoted plaintiff to the position of shift supervisor, with responsibility to oversee nursing staff in all three wings of the facility during the three p.m. to eleven p.m. evening shift. In that capacity, plaintiff created records that he termed \u201cadministrative logs\u201d or \u201cshift logs,\u201d in which he would record the entry of new admittees into the nursing home, patient hospitalizations, employee absences for illness or other reasons, extra monitoring provided for particular patients, and facility maintenance issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In January 2008, plaintiff recorded in his administrative log that five Bridgeway staff members had missed work due to respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and noted a prevalence of similar symptoms among patients. Plaintiff testified that he attempted to contact Dr. Frisoli about these symptoms during the evening of January 10, 2008. According to plaintiff, he learned of fifty cases of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms at Bridgeway. Nursing Director Gerber testified, in contrast, that Bridgeway staff noticed no commonality among the patient illnesses reported at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">At about midnight on January 11, 2008, plaintiff sent Bridgeway management an e-mail expressing concerns about the \u201cseasonal prevalence of respiratory and GI symptoms\u201d in the facility. Later that day, Gerber responded with an e-mail in which she stated that illnesses could be spread by contact, and noted the importance of hand-washing for staff and residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">According to plaintiff, at some point on January 11, 2008, he presented to Gerber an article from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website entitled \u201cClinical Signs and Symptoms of Influenza.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That night, in an e-mail to Gerber, plaintiff demanded an explanation as to how Dr. Frisoli had determined that the illnesses were spread by contact, and inquired as to whether tests or lab work had been performed. Plaintiff testified that he instructed Bridgeway staff about hand-washing and the use of gloves, goggles, masks, and hospital gowns to avoid transmission of infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">On January 14, 2008, using the pseudonym \u201cBill Yates,\u201d plaintiff reported to the Bridgewater Township Board of Health that there was an increase in respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms at Bridgeway. According to plaintiff, the Board stated that it had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>responsibility to oversee health issues, other than kitchen sanitation, at Bridgeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The following day, using the same pseudonym, plaintiff contacted the Somerset County Department of Health. The Somerset County Department of Health promptly contacted Gerber, told her that it had a report of major illnesses in the facility, and requested information pertaining to any hospitalizations of residents. Gerber immediately gathered information about patient symptoms and hospitalizations and provided it to the Somerset County Department of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">On January 16, 2008, again using the pseudonym \u201cBill Yates,\u201d plaintiff contacted the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (HSS). Plaintiff testified that this third contact with government officials was prompted by his belief that the situation at Bridgeway had not improved and that he had not made progress with municipal or county officials. According to plaintiff, the state health official with whom he spoke advised him that HSS would not get involved with Bridgeway unless asked to do so by Somerset County.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Nonetheless, the day after plaintiffs call, an investigator from HSS contacted Blum, Bridgeway\u2019s administrator. According to Blum, the investigator stated that HSS was following up on an anonymous call reporting an \u201cepidemic\u201d at Bridgeway, and asked Blum what his facility was doing to combat the epidemic. Blum testified that he advised the HSS investigator that there was no epidemic, just \u201cour usual things that are going on.\u201d The investigator requested that Bridgeway report any issue of concern and advise HSS of its remedial steps and their outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Shortly after the HSS investigator\u2019s call to Bridgeway, Gerber and Blum convened a meeting with plaintiff in Blum\u2019s office. According to plaintiff, Gerber and Blum asked him whether he had contacted county and state health officials, and plaintiff denied having made the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">According to his testimony, plaintiff then learned from another nurse that a patient complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>been admitted to a hospital during the weekend of January 19-20, 2008, and had died there of septicemia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When no investigator from Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, or the State of New Jersey appeared at Bridgeway over the weekend, plaintiff concluded that his calls to governmental officials had not elicited a satisfactory response, and decided to approach the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Plaintiff contacted a local television station on January 22, 2008. He gave the television station copies of Bridgeway administrative logs that he partly, but incompletely, redacted. The documents included some residents\u2019 room numbers, which could enable an outsider to identify certain Bridgeway patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On the morning of January 23, 2008, Bridgeway Chief Executive Officer Pelligrino was approached by a television news reporter in the facility\u2019s parking lot. According to Pelligrino, the news reporter asked him whether he was aware that \u201cpeople are dying in your building.\u201d When Pelligrino expressed confusion about this allegation, the reporter showed Pelligrino the administrative logs and said that he had received them from \u201csomeone at Bridgeway.\u201d Pelligrino subsequently verified that Bridgeway management had not authorized the documents\u2019 release and contacted Bridgeway counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">That afternoon, Blum, Gerber and Bridgeway\u2019s head of human resources met with plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff admitted that he had contacted municipal, county, and state officials and the news station, citing his obligation as a registered nurse and explaining that he had seen \u201csomething that needed to be fixed and it wasn\u2019t being fixed.\u201d Plaintiff was suspended with pay pending Bridge-way\u2019s investigation of his disclosures to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>On January 25, 2008, Bridgeway terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment. Bridgeway management advised plaintiff that he was terminated because of his contact with the media and his disclosure of Bridgeway administrative logs, in violation of Bridgeway\u2019s confidentiality policy and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1320d-l to - 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Plaintiff filed this action in the Law Division, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and other relief. He pled a CEPA claim quoting <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:19-3(c)(l), alleging a reasonable belief that Bridgeway practices \u201cconstituted improper quality of patient care and violations of [plaintiff\u2019s] professional code of ethics (for example, acting on questionable practice under Section 3.5 of the American Nursing Association\u2019s Code of Ethics).\u201d Although plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not cite the \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(e)(3), he relied on that provision of CEPA, as well as <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (c)(1), before and during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On June 1, 2010, prior to trial, the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to the first element of his CEPA claim \u2014 that plaintiff had a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that Bridge-way provided \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:19-3(c)(l). The trial court granted Bridgeway\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Thereafter, the trial court held that plaintiff properly relied upon the ANA Code and Bridgeway Employee Handbook and Statement of Resident Rights in support of his CEPA claim. In support of its decision, the trial court cited additional sources of law and public policy, including CDC guidelines and federal and state regulations addressing infection control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that plaintiff had met his burden to establish a substantial nexus between Bridgeway\u2019s conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>a law or public policy. It determined, however, that the jury should assess the objective reasonableness of plaintiffs belief that Bridgeway violated the law or public policy cited by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Prior to trial, plaintiff presented a stipulation agreed upon by Bridgeway\u2019s prior counsel that the value of plaintiffs lost income claim was $59,000. The trial court determined that plaintiff could rely upon the stipulation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The case was tried before a jury in February and March of 2011. The parties disputed the cause of plaintiffs dismissal. Plaintiff contended that Bridgeway terminated his employment in retaliation for his communications to municipal, county, and state regulatory authorities about the spread of infections among staff and patients at the nursing home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bridgeway asserted that the termination was prompted by plaintiffs disclosure of partially redacted administrative logs to the media, in violation of his confidentiality agreement and HIPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">In his proposed jury instruction submitted prior to trial, plaintiff identified a single authority supporting his CEPA claim: section 3.5 of the ANA Code. Plaintiff testified at trial regarding the ANA Code, stating that it required him to try to improve patient care. He contended that Bridgeway violated the ANA Code because it did not ensure proper quality of care. On cross-examination, plaintiff conceded that although the ANA Code applied to him by virtue of his status as a registered nurse, it did not apply to Bridgeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Plaintiff further testified that the Bridgeway Employee Handbook required him to comply with the ANA Code and to perform his duties as a registered nurse, and that the Bridgeway State<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ment of Resident Rights supported his claim because it set forth patients\u2019 right to freedom of choice and right to be protected from social isolation. On cross-examination, plaintiff contended that Bridgeway failed to follow all the \u201cstandard precautions\u201d recommended by the CDC and New Jersey health authorities to control infection, such as hand-washing and the use of masks and gloves. Plaintiff conceded that he did not know what diagnostic tests Bridgeway conducted, whether the patients\u2019 illnesses shared a commonality of causes, or whether there was an \u201cepidemic\u201d at the nursing home. He also admitted that his dispute with the facility\u2019s Medical Director amounted to a difference of opinion about how best to approach infection control.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Following plaintiffs testimony, Bridgeway moved for an involuntary dismissal under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). It argued that plaintiff had failed to establish an objectively reasonable basis for his belief that Bridgeway violated the ANA Code. Plaintiff countered that Bridgeway had violated the ANA Code, its Employee Handbook, and its Statement of Resident Rights. The trial court reasoned that the ANA Code could serve as an authority for the purposes of the jury\u2019s determination of whether plaintiff had an objectively reasonable belief that Bridgeway provided improper health care or violated public policy. It held that plaintiff had presented a prima facie showing supporting his CEPA claim, and denied Bridgeway\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">At the jury charge conference, the trial judge noted, and plaintiff confirmed, that plaintiff relied on three sources of law or public policy: the ANA Code, Bridgeway\u2019s Employee Handbook, containing its Code of Conduct, and Bridgeway\u2019s Statement of Resident Rights. The trial court instructed the jury that \u201cthe American Nursing Association\u2019s Code of Ethics, Section 3.5, Bridgeway\u2019s own Code of Conduct, Bridgeway\u2019s Employee Handbook and Bridgeway\u2019s Statement of Resident Rights are sources of law or public policy that closely relate to the conduct about which [plaintiff] blew the whistle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The jury returned a verdict, responding to three questions on the verdict sheet. First, the jury determined that plaintiff had proven \u201cthat his belief that Bridgeway provided improper quality of health care or violated the law [or] public policy was objectively reasonable.\u201d Second, the jury decided that plaintiffs \u201creporting to the government was a determinative motivating factor in Bridgeway\u2019s decision to terminate his employment.\u201d Despite concluding that Bridgeway was liable, the jury found, pursuant to the third question on the verdict sheet, that plaintiff was not \u201centitled to compensation for past lost pay.\u201d The trial court polled the jurors on questions two and three on the verdict sheet, but declined plaintiffs request for further inquiry with respect to the jury\u2019s intent when it found liability but no damages. The trial court then dismissed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Following the trial, Bridgeway moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-2(b). Bridgeway asserted that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that plaintiff had not presented a cognizable CEPA claim. Separately, plaintiff moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule.4:49-1 (a) arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent and was the product of jury confusion. The trial court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Both parties appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Plaintiff argued that the jury had been confused and had consequently rendered an inconsistent verdict in which it found liability but ignored the parties\u2019 stipulated lost income damages. Bridgeway contended that plaintiff had failed to establish the elements of a CEPA claim and that the jury\u2019s liability verdict was against the weight of the evidence. It maintained, however, that the jury\u2019s liability and damages verdicts were not inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>An Appellate Division panel reversed the liability verdict in plaintiffs favor. <em>Hitesman v. Bridgeway, Inc., </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 219, 63 A.3d 230 (App.Div.2013). The panel concluded that plaintiff had failed to prove his CEPA claim. <em>Ibid. </em>It found that the authorities upon which plaintiff relied \u2014 the ANA Code, the Bridgeway Employee Handbook and the Bridgeway Statement of Resident Rights \u2014 neither measured the adequacy of patient care for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (c)(1), nor expressed a clear mandate of public policy as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 215-19, 63 A.3d 230. The panel held that the liability verdict was accordingly against the weight of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 63 A.3d 230. It characterized the parties\u2019 dispute as nothing more than a \u201cdifference of opinion,\u201d which did not give rise to a cause of action under CEPA. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 63 A.3d 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This Court granted certification. 214 <em>N.J. </em>235, 69 A.3d 117 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Plaintiff argues that the Appellate Division\u2019s holding eviscerates CEPA\u2019s 1997 amendments, enacted to protect health care professionals who complain about improper patient care, and that it weakens CEPA\u2019s protections for New Jersey employees who notify authorities about employer actions that contravene public policy. He challenges the Appellate Division\u2019s rejection of the ANA Code as an authority supporting his CEPA claim, arguing that the panel effectively wrote the \u201cprofessional code[ ] of ethics\u201d text out of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-2(f). Plaintiff cites case law authorizing courts to use industry guidelines and employer manuals as sources of public policy for purposes of CEPA, Plaintiff also cites on appeal statutory and regulatory provisions, not introduced at trial, that prescribe standards for nursing homes as sources of law and public policy supporting a CEPA claim. He argues that the jury\u2019s liability verdict should be reinstated, and th\u00e1t he is entitled to a new trial on damages or an additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Bridgeway counters that the Appellate Division properly found that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he reasonably believed that Bridgeway delivered an \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(l), or that it acted incompatibly with a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3). It contends that plaintiff failed to identify any law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling, or professional code of ethics that he reasonably believed Bridgeway violated. Bridgeway argues that the authorities cited by plaintiff \u2014 the ANA Code, the Bridgeway Employee Handbook, and the Bridgeway Statement of Resident Rights \u2014 establish no standard governing the quality of Bridge-way\u2019s patient care. Bridgeway further contends that plaintiff failed to demonstrate clearly and convincingly a miscarriage of justice that would justify a new trial on damages or an additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Amicus curiae New Jersey Chapter of the National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA-NJ) argues that the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in this case forces nursing home employees to choose between their jobs and their ethical obligations. NELANJ relies upon the legislative history of CEPA, asserting that it demonstrates clear legislative intent to protect health care professionals who complain about substandard patient care. NELA-NJ defends the trial court\u2019s reliance on the ANA Code as a standard that plaintiff reasonably believed that Bridgeway violated. It argues that CEPA incorporates professional codes of ethics in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(f)\u2019s definition of improper quality of patient care, and that this term is not limited to codes that govern the conduct of employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In this case, we review the trial court\u2019s denial of Bridge-way\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal, filed pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) at the close of plaintiffs case. A motion for an involuntary dismissal is premised on \u201cthe ground that upon the facts and ... the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). The motion \u201cshall be denied if the evidence, together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:37 \u2014 2(b). \u201c \u2018[I]f, accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according him the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Roach v. TRW, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>598, 612, 754 A.2d 544 (2000) (quoting <em>Sons of Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 415, 690 A.2d 575 (1997)). An appellate court applies this standard when reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) motion for involuntary dismissal. <em>Fox v. Millman, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>401, 428, 45 A.3d 332 (2012).

N.J. Highway Auth., </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>74, 86, 918 A.2d 603 (2007). \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v.

The amended version of N.J.S.A. 34:19-3(a) bars employer retaliation against an employee who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">(a) Discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy or practice of the employer ... that the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">(1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law ... or, in the case of an employee who is a licensed or certified health care professional, reasonably believes constitutes improper quality of patient care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(a)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">In a parallel amendment, the Legislature added language to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(l), which specifically applies to employees in the health care field and bars retaliation against an employee who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">(c) Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(1) is in violation of a law, or a rale or regulation promulgated pursuant to law ... or, if the employee is a licensed or certified health care professional, constitutes improper quality of patient care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(c)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">As amended, CEPA defines \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d as \u201cany practice, procedure, action or failure to act of an employer that is a health care provider which violates any law or any rule, regulation or declaratory ruling adopted pursuant to law, or any professional code of ethics.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Plaintiffs CEPA claims \u2014 his \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(a)(1) and (c)(1) and his \u201cclear mandate of public policy concerning the public health\u201d claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(c)(3)\u2014require proof of four elements. First, plaintiff was required to demonstrate that he reasonably believed that Bridgeway either provided an improper quality of patient care as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(f), or acted in a manner incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy. <em>See Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 828 A.2d 893; <em>Klein v.

Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 476, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999). Second, plaintiff had the burden to prove that he engaged in protected \u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d activity as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u2014 3(a) or 3(c). <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 828 A.2d 893; <em>Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 871 A.2d 681. Third, plaintiff had the burden of proving that an \u201cadverse employment action was taken against him.\u201d <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 828 A.2d 893; <em>see Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 871 A.2d 681. Fourth, plaintiff had the burden to demonstrate a causal connection between his whistle-blowing activity and his termination. <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 828 A.2d 893; <em>Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 871 A.2d 681. Because the parties stipulated that the second element was satisfied by plaintiffs contact with governmental authorities, and that the third element was satisfied because his employment at Bridgeway was terminated, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>first and fourth elements of plaintiffs CEPA claim were contested at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In <em>Dzwonar, swpra, </em>this Court defined the framework to guide a trial court\u2019s determination of a defense challenge to a plaintiffs proof of the first element of a CEPA claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">[W]hen a'defendant requests that the trial court determine as a matter of law that a plaintiffs belief was not objectively reasonable, the trial court must make a threshold determination that there is a substantial nexus between the complained-of conduct and a law or public policy identified by the court or the plaintiff. If the trial court so finds, the jury then must determine whether the plaintiff actually held such a belief and, if so, whether the belief was objectively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">[177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The Court noted that CEPA\u2019s goal \u201cis \u2018not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees but rather to prevent retaliation against those employees who object to employer conduct that they reasonably believe to be unlawful or indisputably dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 193-94, 707 A.2d 1000). Accordingly, it is not the plaintiffs burden to show that the defendant actually violated the law, rule, regulation, or other authority cited, but only to demonstrate that he or she held a reasonable belief that such a violation occurred. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Thus, <em>Dzwonar </em>identifies the framework to be used by a trial court in determining a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss CEPA claims under the two provisions at issue here. In order for a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (c)(1), alleging improper quality of patient care, to be submitted to the jury, the trial court must find a substantial nexus, as explained by <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893, between the defendant employer\u2019s \u201cpractice, procedure, action or failure to act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20142(f), and the \u201cimproper quality of patient care.\u201d <em>See Maimone v. City of Atlantic City, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>221, 233, 903 A.2d 1055 (2006); <em>Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 40, 871 A.2d 681; <em>Turner v. Associated Humane Soc\u2019ys. Inc., </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 593, 935 A.2d 825 (App.Div.2007). The trial court\u2019s task is to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>such a substantial nexus exists, reviewing the evidence in accordance with the deferential standard of <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). If the plaintiffs proofs establish the substantial nexus, the trial court should deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. It should then charge the jury to consider whether plaintiff believed that the authority cited was violated, and if so, whether that belief was reasonable. If the jury decides in the affirmative, plaintiff has proven the first element of the CEPA claim. <em>See Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893; <em>Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39-40, 871 A.2d 681. If the trial court determines that the plaintiffs proofs failed to establish the substantial nexus, it should grant the defendant\u2019s motion, and dismiss the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) or (c)(1) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The same factors guide a trial court\u2019s analysis in deciding a motion to dismiss a plaintiffs \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3). <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893. The trial court must determine whether there is a substantial nexus between the complained-of conduct and a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d identified by the court or the plaintiff. <em>Ibid. </em>If the trial court, reviewing the evidence under the standard of <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), determines that the plaintiff has demonstrated such a substantial nexus, the motion should be denied. <em>Ibid. </em>The court should then instruct the jury to determine whether the plaintiff believed that the defendant\u2019s conduct was incompatible with a \u201cclear mandate of public policy,\u201d and if so, whether such a belief was reasonable. <em>Ibid. </em>If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a substantial nexus between the employer\u2019s conduct and the identified clear mandate of public policy, the trial court should grant the motion and dismiss the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The statutory elements and the analytical framework set forth in <em>Dzwonar </em>distinguish an employee\u2019s objection to, or reporting of, an employer\u2019s illegal or unethical conduct from a routine dispute in the workplace regarding the relative merits of internal policies and procedures. <em>See Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 467-69, 828 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>A.2d 893 (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs CEPA claim based upon general administration of union meetings and union\u2019s allegedly inadequate explanation of its actions to membership); <em>Maw, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 443, 445, 846 A.2d 604 (rejecting employee\u2019s CEPA claim where employee \u201cwas terminated for refusing to execute an employment agreement containing a do-not-compete provision\u201d and stating that \u201cthe dispute between the employer and employee must be more than a private disagreement\u201d); <em>Schechter v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, Div. of Gaming Enforcement, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 432, 743 A.2d 872 (App.Div.2000) (rejecting CEPA claim premised upon \u201cnothing more than a policy dispute between the Division\u2019s middle and upper level management concerning the priority to be assigned to exclusion cases\u201d). As this Court observed in <em>Estate of Roach, supra, </em>when noting the importance of the plaintiffs reasonable belief that the defendant\u2019s conduct contravened an authority recognized in CEPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">[I]f an employee were to complain about a co-employee who takes an extended lunch break or makes a personal telephone call to a spouse or friend, we would be hard pressed to conclude that the complaining employee could have \u201creasonably believed\u201d that such minor infractions represented unlawful conduct as contemplated by CEPA. CEPA is intended to protect those employees whose disclosures fall sensibly within the statute; it is not intended to spawn litigation concerning the most trivial or benign employee complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[164 <em>N.J. </em>at 613-14, 754 A.2d 544.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Accordingly, a pivotal component of a CEPA claim is the plaintiffs identification of authority in one or more of the categories enumerated in the statute that bears a substantial nexus to his or her claim. As the Court noted in <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>in which it rejected the plaintiffs contention that union bylaws constituted a law, rule, regulation, or clear mandate of public policy for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c), \u201c[t]he trial court can and should enter judgment for a defendant when no such law or policy is forthcoming.\u201d- 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 828 A.2d 893. Whether a CEPA plaintiff invokes a law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling, or professional code of ethics as a benchmark for \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) or (e)(1), or alleges employer conduct \u201cincompatible with a clear mandate of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>policy concerning the public health\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(c)(3), the plaintiff must identify the authority that provides a standard against which the conduct of the defendant may be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">By their express terms, and as construed by our courts, the relevant provisions of CEPA recognize a range of standards that may support a claim. For purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19 \u2014 3(a)(1) and (c)(1), the Legislature specifically enumerated the categories of authority that may establish the \u201cimproper quality of patient care.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-2(f) defines \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d to be a violation of \u201cany law, or any rule, regulation or declaratory ruling adopted pursuant to law or professional code of ethics.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(0.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">As an Appellate Division panel has noted, CEPA is not intended to protect an employee \u201cwho simply disagrees with the manner in which the hospital is operating one of its medical departments, provided the operation is in accordance with lawful and ethical mandates.\u201d <em>Klein, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 42, 871 A.2d 681. Thus, a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(1) or (c)(1) cannot proceed unless the plaintiff demonstrates a reasonable belief that the defendant\u2019s patient care is \u201cimproper,\u201d measured against an authority recognized by CEPA. Therefore, to assert a CEPA claim based on the \u201cimproper quality of patient care,\u201d the plaintiff must identify a law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling adopted pursuant to law or professional code of ethics that applies to and governs the employer in its delivery of patient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Plaintiffs second claim, based on a \u201cclear mandate of public policy concerning the public health\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3), similarly requires a plaintiff employee to identify a source of law or other authority, constituting an expression of public policy, that sets a governing standard for the defendant employer\u2019s conduct. As the Court has observed, a \u201cclear mandate\u201d of public policy need not be enacted in a constitution, statute or rule, but must nonetheless provide a definite standard by which the employer\u2019s conduct may be gauged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Like <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20143(c)(1) ], the reference in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20143(c)(3) ] to \u201ca clear mandate of public policy\u201d conveys a legislative preference for a readily discernible course of action that is recognized to be in the public interest. A \u201cclear mandate\u201d of public policy suggests an analog to a constitutional provision, statute, and rale or regulation <em>promulgated pursuant to law </em>such that, under <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20143(c)(3)], there should be a high degree of public certitude in respect of acceptable vers[u]s unacceptable conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\"><em>[Maw, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 444, 846 A.2d 604.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As the Court noted in <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>the mandate of public policy must be \u201c \u2018clearly identified and firmly grounded\u2019 \u201d and cannot be \u201c\u2018vague, controversial, unsettled [or] otherwise problematic.\u2019 \u201d 153 <em>N.J. </em>at 181, 707 A.2d 1000 (quoting <em>MacDougall v. Weichert, </em>144 <em>N.J </em>380, 391-92, 677 A.2d 162 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Consistent with this principle, our courts have recognized various sources of authority bearing the required substantial nexus to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. In each ease, the law, regulation, or other authority held to support a CEPA claim, not only expressed a \u201cclear mandate of public policy,\u201d but identified acceptable and unacceptable practices in the defendant employer\u2019s business. In <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>the Court found, based on several sources of law and regulation that were admitted into evidence at trial, a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d governing the concentration of benzene in the defendant employer\u2019s gasoline. 153 <em>N.J. </em>at 190-92, 707 A.2d 1000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>the plaintiff, a teacher of industrial arts, identified administrative regulations prescribing school metal shop safety requirements as the source of his complaints to management. <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 424, 650 A.2d 958. The plaintiff in <em>Maimone, supra, </em>a police officer, premised his \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3) upon laws against prostitution and against sexually-oriented businesses near churches and schools, which he alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>were ignored by his employer. 188 <em>N.J. </em>at 229, 232, 903 A.2d 1055. In each of these settings, the authority expressed a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d and generated a standard governing the employer\u2019s conduct. In the absence of such a relevant standard, this Court has not recognized a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d bearing the required \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d to the plaintiffs CEPA claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Thus, to present a cognizable retaliation claim based on \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (c)(1), or based on practices \u201cincompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u2014 3(c)(3), a plaintiff must present authority meeting the statutory criteria that serves as a standard for the employer\u2019s conduct. In the absence of such authority, the CEPA claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In light of the statutory text and the framework of our case law, we consider the three sources upon which plaintiff relied in support of his CEPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Section 8.5 of the ANA Code, entitled \u201cActing on questionable practice,\u201d addresses the obligation of a nurse to report inadequate medical care. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">The nurse\u2019s primary commitment is to the health, well-being, and safety of the patient across the life span and in all settings in which health care needs are addressed. As an advocate for the patient, the nurse must be alert to and take appropriate action regarding any instances of incompetent, unethical, illegal, or impaired practice by any member of the health care team or the health care system or any action on the part of others that places the rights or best interests of the patient in jeopardy. To function effectively in this role, nurses must be knowledgeable about the Code of Ethics, standards of practice of the profession, relevant federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the employing organization\u2019s policies and procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">When the nurse is aware of inappropriate or questionable practice in the provision or denial of health care, concern should be expressed to the person carrying out the questionable practice. Attention should be called to the possible detrimental [ejffect upon the patient\u2019s well-being or best interests as well as the integrity of nursing practice. When factors in the health care delivery system or health care organization threaten the welfare of the patient, similar action should be directed to the responsible administrator. If indicated, the problem should be reported to an appropriate higher authority within the institution or agency, or to an appropriate external authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The ANA Code provision also addresses the importance of \u201cestablished processes for reporting and handling incompetent, unethical, illegal, or impaired practice\u201d in the employment setting to reduce the risk of reprisal. It provides that a nurse reporting such improper practice should be assisted by nursing colleagues, state nursing associations, and \u201cappropriate authorities\u201d such as practice committees of professional organizations, licensing authorities, and regulatory agencies concerned with evaluating standards of practice. The section concludes by noting that \u201c[a]ccurate reporting and factual documentation, and not merely opinion, undergird all such responsible actions,\u201d and that professional risks resulting from reporting \u201cdo not eliminate the obligation to address serious threats to patient safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">We concur with the Appellate Division panel that the ANA Code does not constitute a source of law or other authority bearing a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d to Bridgeway\u2019s conduct, as <em>Dzwonar </em>mandates. <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893. The ANA Code expresses the nursing profession\u2019s commitment to sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>patient care, and like CEPA it encourages reporting of deficient practice to appropriate authorities. As plaintiff necessarily conceded at trial, however, the ANA Code does not govern Bridge-way\u2019s patient care. The ANA Code includes no general standard for infection control in a nursing home, much less specific direction on how Bridgeway should have treated its patients\u2019 illnesses in January 2008. It provides no standard under which a factfinder could determine whether plaintiff held an objectively reasonable belief that Bridgeway delivered an \u201cimproper quality of patient care.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(l). Nor does the ANA Code prescribe for Bridgeway a \u201creadily discernible course of action that is recognized to be in the public interest,\u201d from which we ean discern a \u201cclear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20143(c)(3); <em>Maw, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 444, 846 A.2d 604; <em>see also Warthen v. Toms River Cmty. Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 20-21, 28, 488 A.2d 229 (App.Div.) (finding that \u201ceven if [the court] were to make the dubious assumption that the [ANA Code] represents a clear expression of public policy,\u201d plaintiffs personal morals, not mandate of public policy, were source of her objection to conducting kidney dialysis on terminally ill patient), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. 255, </em>501 A.2d 926 (1985). The Code directs a nurse\u2019s action in response to deficient patient care in a nursing home, but provides no standard by which such a deficiency can be ascertained. Accordingly, it does not support either of plaintiffs CEPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As the Appellate Division panel found, the second authority cited by plaintiff, the Bridgeway Employee Handbook\u2019s Code of Conduct, similarly falls short of the mark. The Code of Conduct states that Bridgeway has \u201cadopted a Compliance Program to ensure that [it] operates in full compliance with applicable State and Federal statutes and regulations, including health care programs and private insurance program requirements,\u201d and states that \u201c[i]t establishes the basic legal and fundamental principles ... that Bridgeway will operate under.\u201d The Code of Conduct sets forth ethical standards for Bridgeway staff, prescribes em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ployee compliance with laws and regulations, sets forth reporting procedures and states that patients will be afforded \u201cservice[s] that are identified as needed.\u201d The Code of Conduct does not, however, provide a governing standard for Bridgeway\u2019s response to infectious diseases in patients, or otherwise define an adequate response to any condition or disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Moreover, the Code of Conduct articulates no public policy with respect to the control of infectious disease. In contrast to the guide at issue in <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 424, 650 A.2d 958, which specifically incorporated administrative regulations addressing safety, the Bridgeway Employee Handbook sets forth no authority which could be construed as an expression of public policy regarding infection control. The Code of Conduct does not constitute authority on which a plaintiff could premise a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u20143(a)(1) and (c)(1) for the \u201cimproper quality of patient care,\u201d or a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3) asserting retaliation for objecting to conduct incompatible with a \u201cclear mandate of public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Finally, plaintiff relies on the Bridgeway Statement of Resident Rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As plaintiff described it at trial, the Statement of Resident Rights ensures that a Bridgeway patient has rights, including the freedom to choose his or her physician, to choose and participate in his or her care, and to be shielded from social isolation. Again, the source of authority cited by plaintiff has no relationship to the subject of his complaints \u2014 allegedly deficient control of infection in staff and residents in January 2008. It provides no standard for \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (c)(1). Further, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Employee Handbook, the Statement of Resident Rights articulates no \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3). In sum, plaintiff identified no law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling adopted pursuant to law, professional code of ethics, or other authority recognized by CEPA, that presented a standard for Bridgeway\u2019s delivery of patient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Our dissenting colleague contends that Bridgeway\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) should have been denied. <em>Post </em>at 50, 93 A.3d at 331. He reasons that because the trial court cited CDC guidelines when it denied a pretrial motion for summary judgment, and by virtue of references in plaintiffs testimony to \u201cstandard precautions\u201d recommended by the CDC, the trial court properly denied Bridgeway\u2019s motion. <em>Post </em>at 47-50, 93 A.3d at 329-31. Neither the trial court\u2019s prior references to CDC standards in its summary judgment decision, nor plaintiffs vague references to CDC-recommended precautions in his testimony, provide what CEPA demands: evidence of a law, rule, regulation, declaratory ruling, professional code of ethics, or clear mandate of public policy that bears a substantial nexus to plaintiffs claim. <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Contrary to the suggestion of our dissenting colleague, the trial court\u2019s citation to CDC guidelines to buttress its decision, in a pretrial summary judgment motion, is no substitute for evidence of a governing standard admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration at trial. By its very terms, <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) limits the trial court to the evidence in, and inferences that may be drawn from, the trial record. <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b); <em>see also Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) (explaining that, unlike summary judgment motions, motions to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) \u201care based on evidence presented during ... trial\u201d). The inquiry is not whether factual assertions and legal arguments could have been made by the trial court or counsel to support the plaintiffs claim, but whether the plaintiff has presented at trial evidence that \u201ctogether with the legitimate inferences therefrom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>could sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b); <em>see </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>4:37-2; <em>Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>178, 197, 952 A.2d 1034 (2008); <em>Polyard v. Terry, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>497, 505, 390 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>547, 401 A.2d 532 (1979). Nothing in that rule \u2014 or in our practice \u2014 authorizes a trial court to incorporate by reference part of its summary judgment opinion, or any other source extraneous to the trial record, as a basis to deny a motion for involuntary dismissal at the close of the plaintiffs proofs. The trial court\u2019s reference to CDC guidelines in its summary judgment decision simply cannot serve, after the fact, as a proxy for trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The proofs that can be found in the record fell far short of the mark set by CEPA, as construed in <em>Dzwonar. </em>None of the three sources of authority that plaintiff elected to rely upon in his presentation of evidence and his proposed instructions to the jury \u2014 the ANA Code and the two Bridgeway documents \u2014 consisted of a CDC guideline or state law standard. During his cross-examination, plaintiff briefly alluded to, but did not identify, \u201cstandard precautions\u201d involving hand-washing, the use of gloves, and \u201cother barriers,\u201d emanating from the CDC and \u201cState policies[ ] from the health department.\u201d As the dissent notes, among the numerous recommendations published by the CDC, there is an infection control guideline entitled Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, <em>2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings, available at </em>http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdfliso Iation/Isolation2007.pdf. HSS also has enacted regulations governing infection control in hospitals and nursing homes, including <em>N.J.AC. </em>8:39-19.4. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-93 (finding that \u201c[i]t is in the public interest of [New Jersey] for its nursing home industry to continue to provide high-quality services to those frail and vulnerable citizens who critically need nursing home care\u201d). The record does not indicate whether these were the sources to which plaintiff generally referred; at trial, he revealed neither the name nor the contents of the CDC guidelines and state policies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and offered no document constituting or relating to such guidelines and policies into evidence. Moreover, in omitting any CDC guideline or state regulation from his pretrial proposed instructions to the jury \u2014 a position from which he never diverged at trial \u2014 plaintiff affirmatively elected not to rely on these sources as the authority required to support his CEPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Contrary to our dissenting colleague\u2019s contentions, the trial record is devoid of proof that would put the defendant on notice of any CDC or state regulatory standard against which its conduct was to be assessed, or enable the trial judge, the jury, or an appellate court to evaluate plaintiffs claims against the statutory benchmark.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, plaintiff did not identify, offer into evidence, or cite in his proposed jury instructions any federal or state regulatory \u201cstandard precautions\u201d for infection control.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">As a matter of law, plaintiff failed to present evidence to support a substantial nexus between the complained-of conduct and an authority cognizable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l), (c)(1) or (e)(3). Viewing the record in plaintiffs favor as required by <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), the trial court should have granted Bridgeway\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal at the close of plaintiffs case. Accordingly, the Appellate Division panel properly reversed the liability verdict in plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In light of our holding, we do not reach the plaintiffs argument that the jury returned an inconsistent verdict requiring a new trial on the issue of damages, or that he is entitled to an additur in light of that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> Plaintiff did not contend in his reports to government officials or the media that there was an outbreak of influenza at Bridgeway, and there is no indication in the record that any Bridgeway patients contracted influenza during the relevant period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Septicemia is defined as a \"[sjystemic disease caused by the spread of microorganisms and their toxins through circulating blood; formerly called \u2018blood poisoning.' \" <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1750 (28th ed. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> Plaintiff recorded the meeting.

The plaintiff in <em>Kalman </em>cited several forms of authority in support of his common-law whistle-blower claim: state statutes and state regulations governing the operation of pharmacies, and the American Pharmaceutical Association's Code of Ethics. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 443 A.2d 728.

The Appellate Division concluded that the pharmacists' Code of Ethics supported state statutory and regulatory mandates and, in conjunction with those mandates, constituted an expression of public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 443 A.2d 728. <em>Kalman </em>does not support plaintiff's contention that a code of ethics that compels the employee to report illegal activity, but imposes no requirements on the employer, can independently constitute a \"clear mandate of public policy\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> The Bridgeway Statement of Resident Rights is not part of the record.

In the first selection from plaintiffs testimony cited by the dissent, <em>post </em>at 44-45, 93 A.3d at 327, plaintiff did nothing more than to note the existence of unidentified \u201cCDC policies on infection control\" in which the use of masks was recommended. In the second excerpt cited by our dissenting colleague, <em>post </em>at 44-45, 93 A.3d at 327-28, plaintiff simply recounted his instructions to staff, with no mention of any CDC guideline or any other standard. The third excerpt cited in the dissent, <em>post </em>at 45, 93 A.3d at 328, involved plaintiffs discussion of a supervisor\u2019s job duties, and similarly failed to identify any CDC or other infection control standard. While our dissenting colleague has identified specific \u201cstandard precautions\" promulgated by the CDC, <em>post </em>at 45-47, 93 A.3d at 328-29, and has explained them in detail, no such effort was undertaken by plaintiff at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b62-8\">Justice ALBIN,</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Plaintiff James Hitesman, a registered nurse, claimed defendant Bridgeway Care Center terminated his employment because he complained to his supervisors and governmental authorities about the nursing home\u2019s failure to take standard precautions to address an incipient, life-threatening outbreak of infection among the facility\u2019s elderly patients and staff. Hitesman contended that Bridgeway\u2019s retaliatory firing for his whistleblowing activities violated the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In denying Bridgeway\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal at the end of Hitesman\u2019s case, the trial court did exactly what is asked of all courts deciding such motions \u2014 it looked at the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Hitesman. Based on that standard, the court concluded that Hitesman established the elements of a cause of action under CEPA. The court found evidence to support the conclusion that Hitesman reasonably believed that Bridgeway was violating laws and regulations governing the proper quality of patient care, that he reported Bridgeway\u2019s violations to the appropriate authorities, and that he was fired for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The majority has simply ignored the record in overturning the trial court\u2019s decision. The record clearly reveals that Hitesman testified about violations of \u201cstandard precautions\u201d concerning infection control reflected in federal and state healthcare law and that the trial court relied on his testimony and those sources of law in denying Bridgeway\u2019s motion to dismiss. The majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>assertion that Hitesman was merely expressing his personal views on the proper quality of patient care is not borne out by the record \u2014 and certainly not by a reading of the record that gives Hitesman the benefit of all favorable inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent. In doing so, I will turn to those portions of the record either omitted or barely mentioned in the majority\u2019s opinion. I will let the record speak for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">To support a CEPA claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a), (c)(1), or (c)(3), plaintiff must establish that he <em>reasonably believed </em>an activity, policy, or practice of his employer constituted improper quality of patient care, contrary to law or a clear mandate of public policy, and that his employer fired him for his whistleblowing. The plaintiff does not have to show that his employer \u201cactually violated the law or a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Dzwonar v. McDevitt, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 828 A.2d 893 (2003). So long as a plaintiff has an objectively reasonable belief that his employer has done so, the plaintiff is protected even if he is mistaken. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893. CEPA\u2019s intent \u201cis not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees\u201d who report conduct \u201cthat they reasonably believe to be unlawful.\u201d <em>Mehlman v.

The record says otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Hitesman testified that, as a nurse, he was obliged \u201cto protect the patients\u201d in the Bridgeway facility and to ensure that \u201cquality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of care\u201d standards were followed, particularly those standards related to \u201cinfection control.\u201d He was alarmed about an outbreak of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections within the facility and about Bridgeway\u2019s failure to implement \u201cstandard precautions\u201d to control the spread of those infections. For example, Bridgeway officials did not take basic steps to isolate infected residents, such as closing the communal dining hall. As Hitesman explained, \u201c[pjutting all these people together to possibly contaminate each other ... posed a risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In his testimony, Hitesman unmistakably <em>identified </em>the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state law as sources for his reference to \u201cstandard precautions.\u201d Here is what Hitesman said in response to questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">Q. And these standard precautions come from where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">A. They come from the CDC. And State policies, from the health department. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">Q. What CDC policies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">A. CDC policies on infection control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">Q. For what in? They have different\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">A. Well, they have ... the general policies for infection control which are called standard precautions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-14\">And tell me in what instance are you suppose to use masks under the infection control from the CDC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-15\">A. When you have evidence of some type of \u2014 some type of illness that is being spread through other vectors. In the case of a mask you are looking at airborne mode of transportation, droplets, aerosol, that kind of thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">Hitesman repeatedly explained the nature of the \u201cstandard precautions\u201d for infection control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-17\">Q. [Y]ou said before that you ... closed the main dining room and you gave masks for the staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-18\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-19\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-20\">Q. Did you do anything else with the staff to act on your concerns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-21\">A. I reminded them of basic standard precautions, washing hands, infection controls, whatever barriers you might need depending upon what the symptoms were that were presented____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-22\">Q. Wfhat infection control procedure did you go over with the staff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A. Well. Pardon me. The basic \u2014 basic standards are standard precautions. You always assume a patient is infected even when there is no infection. It tells you when to wash your hands, use gloves. You wash your hands before and after dealing with the residents. After toileting a resident, cleaning a resident up. When to use gloves. When not to use gloves. That kind of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">And then we went over more advanced techniques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">If patients were showing symptoms of lots of vomiting and diarrhea, GI symptoms, then they might require gowns. If they were dealing with a patient that was sneezing and coughing a lot, it might require gloves, maybe even goggles, depending on what was going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">In discussing the responsibilities of the Bridgeway infection control coordinator, Hitesman again referenced the CDC \u201cstandard precautions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">Q. What [were] the duties of the infection control coordinator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">A. Her duties would have been to educate the staff on <em>basic infection control standard precautions as laid out by the CDC, </em>as well as advanced techniques for infection control for patients that required isolation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Additionally, Hitesman testified that during the course of the outbreak at the Bridgeway facility, he gave Director of Nursing Frances Gerber, a registered nurse, an article from the CDC on influenza. The article \u201caddressed droplets and airborne viruses and procedures on how to prevent airborne infections.\u201d Although Hitesman was not specifically concerned about a flu outbreak, he believed that the CDC article \u201cwas just an example of how to control infection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Despite Hitesman\u2019s testimony, the majority insists that \u201che revealed neither the name nor the contents of the CDC guidelines and state policies, and offered no document constituting or relating to such guidelines and policies into evidence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 40-41, 93 A.3d at 325. Hitesman\u2019s testimony, however, sufficiently identified the relevant CDC guidelines applicable to Bridgeway as a healthcare facility. CEPA does not require that a plaintiff in his testimony give the precise statutory citation of the law that he reasonably believes his employer is violating. Indeed, the law or public policy that plaintiff reasonably believes his employer is violating may be \u201cidentified by the court or the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The majority cites no legal authority for the new demands it places on CEPA plaintiffs. Until today, \u201c[t]he object of CEPA [was] not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees.\u201d <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 193, 707 A.2d 1000. Until today, no case required a plaintiff to make a hard copy of a federal or state statute or regulation, such as the CDC guidelines, and place or read it into evidence. Here, the court referred to and quoted the applicable law in its summary-judgment opinion, which was incorporated in the court\u2019s involuntary-dismissal decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The CDC \u201cstandard precautions\u201d identified and described by Hitesman are a set of instructions for infection control in healthcare facilities. <em>See </em>Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, <em>2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings </em>66 (2007) [hereinafter <em>Guideline for Isolation Precautions], available at </em>http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdi/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf. The standard precautions are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered____ These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">The standard precautions are regarded by the CDC as \u201cthe primary strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated transmission of infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis omitted). How the standard precautions apply in any given case is determined by the nature of the healthcare interactions \u201cand the extent of anticipated blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposure. For some interactions ... only gloves may be needed; during other interactions ... use of gloves, gown, and face shield or mask and goggles is necessary.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">In his testimony, Hitesman expressed an understanding of these \u201cstandard precautions\u201d promulgated by the CDC. Hitesman spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cifically pointed out that the infection control policies governing New Jersey nursing-home facilities are also derived from state law. Significantly, the CDC <em>Guideline for Isolation Precautions </em>is explicitly incorporated into state law. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-19.4(a) mandates that a long-term healthcare \u201cfacility shall develop, implement, comply with, and review ... written policies and procedures regarding infection prevention and control which are consistent with the most up-to-date Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publications, incorporated herein by reference, including, but not limited to ... <em>Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Similarly, the CDC standard precautions are contained in guidelines developed by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, specifically the <em>Guidelines for the Control of Respiratory Outbreaks in Long-Term Care and Other Institutional Settings </em>6-10 (Nov. 2011),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the <em>Guidelines for the Control of Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Long-Term Care and Other Institutional Settings </em>5-8 (Nov. 2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of these sources also reference the CDC <em>Guideline for Isolation Precautions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The testimony quoted above belies the majority\u2019s assertion that Hitesman failed to identify, or \u201cbriefly alluded to,\u201d the CDC \u201cstandard precautions\u201d as a source of law. Moreover, the majority\u2019s constrained and ungenerous reading of the record is completely at odds with the standard to be applied at a motion to dismiss, a standard that gives Hitesman the benefit of the most favorable inferences from his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Without any support, the majority states that \u201cthe trial record is devoid of proof that would put the defendant on notice of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>CDC or state regulatory standard against which its conduct was to be assessed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 41, 98 A.3d at 325. A nursing home facility, like Bridgeway, is presumed to know the law governing the control of infectious diseases, and once an applicable statute or regulation is brought to its attention, it should have no problem accessing the law online or in a library.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">At the summary-judgment stage, the trial court identified and quoted the above federal and state sources of law on infection control. It thus \u201cidentif[ied] a statute, regulation, rule, or public policy that closely relates to the complained-of conduct.\u201d <em>See Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 828 A.2d 893. And, it made \u201ca threshold determination that there [was] a substantial nexus between the complained-of conduct and a law or public policy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893. The trial court made the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d decision in favor of Hitesman and memorialized this decision in a thorough and detailed written summary-judgment opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In that opinion, the court identified the sources of law and public policy concerning Hitesman\u2019s \u201cimproper quality of patient care\u201d allegations under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a)(l) and (e)(1), and his \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d allegations under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19\u2014 3(e)(3). It cited Section 3.5 of the American Nursing Association (ANA) Code of Ethics, <em>as well </em>as \u201cmyriad statutes and regulations applicable to [Bridgeway]\u2019s standard of care.\u201d These regulations included all of the sources identified above, particularly the CDC <em>Guideline for Isolation Precautions, N.J.A.C. </em>8:39-19.4 (mandating \u201cgeneral policies and procedures for infection control,\u201d including compliance with CDC guidelines in long-term care facilities), and the Department of Health and Senior Services guidelines on infection control.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court specifically noted that Hitesman brought to its attention the Health and Senior Services guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>After Hitesman presented his case, Bridgeway challenged both the trial court\u2019s \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d determination and the sufficiency of the trial evidence in a motion for involuntary dismissal. Addressing the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d issue, the court explained that it would not revisit its earlier summary-judgment opinion in which it identified the applicable sources of law. The court observed that the parties \u201chad extensive argument on the summary judgment motions as to the law that applies to this case\u201d and that \u201cit was [the court\u2019s] responsibility to identify what law may apply.\u201d Indeed, the court specifically expressed that it had \u201cestablished what the laws/policies/regulations are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Then, the trial court gave its reasons for denying the involuntary-dismissal motion. The court acknowledged that defendant believed that the evidence was \u201cweighted substantially in [their] favor.\u201d However, the court maintained that in deciding the motion it was not to assess whether \u201cthe weight\u201d of the evidence favored defendant but rather whether there was \u201cany evidence that could go to the jury.\u201d The court noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve heard the testimony of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The trial court clearly understood its obligations under CEPA and <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) at the involuntary-dismissal stage. <em>See Dzwonar, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893 (\u201cIf the trial court ... finds [a substantial nexus], the jury then must determine whether the plaintiff actually held such a belief and, if so, whether that belief was objectively reasonable.\u201d). The court did nothing more remarkable than apply the standard governing a dismissal motion, assessing the evidence and the legitimate inferences drawn from the record in allowing the case to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Nevertheless, with blinders on, the majority refuses to accept the permissive standard that applies in a motion for involuntary dismissal. The majority pretends that Hitesman did not testify about the CDC standard precautions and that the only cited authorities present at the time of the involuntary-dismissal motion were the ANA Code of Ethics, Bridgeway\u2019s Employee Handbook, and Bridgeway\u2019s Statement of Resident Rights. Again, the record says otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In addressing the merits of whether the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s involuntary-dismissal motion, the majority posits that Hitesman\u2019s proposed jury instructions were inadequate because they failed to cite the CDC guidelines on \u201cstandard precautions\u201d for infection control. <em>See ante </em>at 40-42, 93 A.3d at 325-26. However, whether jury instructions are adequate is a completely separate issue from whether a motion to dismiss should be granted. The trial court understood this distinction, and said so. In denying the dismissal motion, the court referenced the applicable law that it detailed in its summary-judgment opinion \u2014 the CDC guidelines and state law incorporating those guidelines. Any inadequacy in the jury charge is a matter that should have been separately addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In summary, the trial court followed the framework articulated in <em>Dzwonar, swpra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 464, 828 A.2d 893, and correctly applied <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) to the trial record. I fail to see how the majority can conclude that Hitesman\u2019s CEPA claims should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Additionally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s supposition that the ANA Code of Ethics has no applicability to Bridgeway as a healthcare facility. <em>See ante </em>at 37, 93 A.3d at 323. Inasmuch as Bridgeway acts through its employees, some of whom are nurses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the ANA Code of Ethics has applicability to Bridgeway under CEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The majority makes much of the point that Hitesman on cross-examination made a concession that the ANA Code of Ethics did not apply to Bridgeway. <em>Ante </em>at 21, 37, 93 A.3d at 313, 323. That a skilled defense attorney elicited from Hitesman an incorrect opinion on the law \u2014 that the ANA Code of Ethics did not apply to Bridgeway \u2014 does not alter the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">An \u201cemployer\u201d is defined broadly in CEPA to include \u201cany individual, partnership, association, corporation or any person or group of persons acting directly or indirectly on behalf of or in the interest of an employer with the employer\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2(a). Thus, \u201cemployer\u201d encompasses any individuals working on behalf of Bridgeway, including nurses. The ANA Code of Ethics clearly applies to nurses, including Hitesman, who worked in the Bridgeway facility on Bridgeway\u2019s behalf. Surely, an employee who claims that other employees are violating their professional ethical mandates is engaged in activity protected by CEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Therefore, the ANA Code of Ethics could reasonably form part of the basis for Hitesman\u2019s whistleblowing activity. If Hitesman reasonably believed that not reporting improper quality of patient care in the Bridgeway facility would be a violation of the ANA Code of Ethics, then Hitesman was engaged in protected activity. In the context of this case, however, the ANA Code of Ethics is only meaningful in light of the CDC \u201cstandard precautions\u201d for infection control.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">In conclusion, looking at the record in the light most favorable to Hitesman, sufficient evidence was presented to overcome Bridgeway\u2019s motion to dismiss. For that reason, there is no basis to reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to let this case go to the jury. Because the majority has failed to adhere to the deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>standard of review applicable to involuntary-dismissal motions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LaVECCHIA, PATTERSON, and Judges RODR\u00cdGUEZ (temporarily assigned) and CUFF (temporarily assigned) \u2014 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 Justice ALBIN \u2014 1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\"> <em>Available at </em>http://www.state.nj.us/health/ilu/documents/outbreak_prevention. pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-11\"> <em>Available at </em>http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/nianual/gi_ltc.pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> The trial court also referenced <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-93 (declaring that \"[i]t is in the public interest of this State for its nursing home industry to continue to provide high-quality services to those frail and vulnerable citizens who critically need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>nursing home care\u201d), and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25 (\u201cEach resident must receive and the facility must provide the necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
