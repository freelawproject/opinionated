The Third Circuit\u2019s inquiry is whether, under New Jersey law, a tax sale certificate purchaser holds a tax lien. Construing the plain language of several provisions of the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Sale Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-1 to -137, in accordance with the statute\u2019s purpose to promote the sale of tax sale certificates as a source of municipal revenue, we hold that the purchaser of a tax sale certificate possesses a tax lien on the encumbered property. Accordingly, we respond to the Third Circuit\u2019s inquiry in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The Third Circuit\u2019s certified question is posed in the setting of a record in which the facts are undisputed. In 1998, plaintiff Princeton Office Park, L.P. (Princeton Office Park) purchased a 220,000 square foot commercial building on thirty-seven acres of land in the Township of Lawrence. Princeton Office Park did not satisfy its real estate tax obligation to the Township of Lawrence. By 2005, Princeton Office Park owed the Township of Lawrence $204,296.79, consisting of $192,643.92 in back taxes and $11,652.87 in unpaid penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">On December 19, 2005, exercising the authority granted to it by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-19, the Township of Lawrence conducted a public auction of municipal tax liens. Defendant Plymouth Park Tax Services, LLC (Plymouth Park) bid on a tax sale certificate for Princeton Office Park\u2019s property. Plymouth Park agreed to accept a zero percent interest rate on the certificate, and to pay $204,296.79 for the taxes and penalties due on the property \u2014 the entire amount of Princeton Park\u2019s outstanding real estate taxes\u2014 plus a $600,100.00 premium and $100.00 to cover the cost of the sale. Consistent with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32, which designates as the winning bidder the party that commits to accept the lowest interest rate on the tax certificate not to exceed eighteen percent, the Township of Lawrence issued a tax sale certificate to Plymouth Park. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32. Under the terms set forth in the tax sale certificate, and pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5\u2014 58, Princeton Office Park was required to pay $204,396.79 to redeem the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>As the owner of the tax sale certificate following the public auction, Plymouth Park paid municipal real estate taxes and charges for Princeton Office Park\u2019s property through the second quarter of 2008. By operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6, Plymouth Park\u2019s additional payments were added to the sum required for Princeton Office Park to redeem the tax sale certificate owned by Plymouth Park. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6, the redemption amount accrued interest at a rate of eighteen percent following the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On December 18, 2007, Plymouth Park filed a tax lien foreclosure action against Princeton Office Park in the Chancery Division, seeking to enjoin Princeton Office Park from exercising any right of redemption of the certificate, and requesting a declaration that Plymouth Park was the owner in fee simple of the disputed property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 6, 2008, the Chancery Division entered an order establishing a deadline by which Princeton Office Park could redeem the certificate. The court determined that the total amount that Princeton Office Park was required to pay to redeem the certificate was $1,012,188.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On September 9, 2008, while Plymouth Park\u2019s foreclosure action was pending in the Chancery Division, Princeton Office Park filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, pursuant to 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101 to 1174, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. On October 29, 2008, Plymouth Park filed an initial proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court, citing \u201ctaxes\u201d as the basis for its claim. Following an amendment, Plymouth Park\u2019s proof of claim sought $1,155,487.81. According to Plymouth Park\u2019s amended proof of claim, this figure represented the amount that Plymouth Park had paid for the tax sale certificate, the post-sale tax payments made to the Township of Lawrence, other penalties, and the accrued post-petition interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>calculated at the rate of eighteen percent as authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On June 10, 2009, Princeton Office Park filed its Plan of Reorganization in the Bankruptcy Court. Among other provisions, the Plan of Reorganization envisioned Princeton Office Park\u2019s execution of a note and mortgage, securing its obligation .to Plymouth Park with interest accrued at a rate of six percent beginning on the Plan\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On July 13, 2009, Plymouth Park objected to Princeton Office Park\u2019s Plan of Reorganization. It asserted that it had obtained a tax lien under New Jersey law, and that because the rate of interest governing \u201ctax claims\u201d is \u201cdetermined under applicable nonbankruptcy law,\u201d 11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 511(a), the Bankruptcy Court was not authorized to reduce the statutory rate of eighteen percent to the six percent interest rate requested by Princeton Office Park. The parties thus framed the question that is now before this Court: whether by virtue of its purchase of the tax sale certificate, Plymouth Park acquired a tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The United States Bankruptcy Court ruled in favor of Princeton Office Park. <em>In re Princeton Office Park, L.P., </em>423 <em>B.R. </em>795, 797 (Bankr.D.N.J.2010). Noting that a tax lien is described in 11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 724(b) of the Bankruptcy Code as a lien that \u201csecures an allowed claim for a tax,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court concluded that Plymouth did \u201cnot possess an allowed claim for taxes\u201d because the underlying taxes owed by Princeton Office Park to the Township of Lawrence had been paid, and Plymouth Park had no authority to assess or collect taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 801. Reasoning that the municipality had not assigned or subrogated its rights to Plymouth Park, the court determined that Plymouth Park\u2019s lien did not constitute a tax lien. <em>Id. </em>at 805-06. The court held, accordingly, that the tax sale certificate did not transfer a tax claim. <em>Id. </em>at 808. The Bankruptcy Court granted Princeton Office Park\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey affirmed, substantially adopting the reasoning of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Bankruptcy Court. The District Court construed the Tax Sale Law to confer on the purchaser of a tax sale certificate a lien, but not a lien that would permit the holder of the certificate to collect unpaid taxes owed to the municipality. It determined that a 1997 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, which provides that a tax delinquency persists after a tax certificate sale, did not bolster Plymouth Park\u2019s contention that it held a tax lien, because that amendment was held unconstitutional by the Tax Court in <em>Ramos v. Passaic City, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>97, 104 (Tax 2000). The District Court characterized the tax sale certificate holder\u2019s lien to be one that secures the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay the redemption amount, and not as an interest rooted in the obligation to pay taxes to the municipality. It acknowledged that its ruling could reduce demand for tax sale certificates and thus constrain municipalities from raising revenue, but concluded that that was a matter for the Legislature to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Plymouth Park appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Following oral argument, the Third Circuit invoked <em>Rule </em>2:12A to raise a question that it considered to be \u201can important and unresolved question concerning the type of lien acquired by a purchaser of a tax certificate under New Jersey law.\u201d The Third Circuit observed that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 provides that a property owner\u2019s tax delinquency is not extinguished by the issuance of a tax sale certificate. It noted that the Bankruptcy Court and District Court had relied upon non-precedential opinions of New Jersey state courts in determining that \u201cthe purchase of a tax sale certificate extinguishes the underlying tax claim.\u201d The Third Circuit posed the following question to this Court: \u201cWhether, under New Jersey law, a tax sale certificate purchaser holds a tax lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On May 1, 2012, this Court entered an order accepting the question as certified, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:12A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Plymouth Park argues that the holder of a tax sale certificate acquires a tax hen under New Jersey law. It disputes the conclusion of the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court that real property taxes should be deemed satisfied when a municipality is paid by the holder of a tax sale certificate, contending that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-42 and -46 effect a conveyance of a lien that is indivisible from the underlying tax debt. Citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, Plymouth Park asserts that taxes owed to a municipality constitute an in rem obligation that persists after the tax sale certificate is sold, rather than an in personam obligation of the taxpayer. It argues that case law has not abrogated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67\u2019s provision that a municipal tax delinquency survives the conveyance of a tax sale certificate and the certificate holder\u2019s payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Princeton Office Park counters that the lien held by the purchaser of a tax sale certificate secures the purchaser\u2019s investment in the certificate, the interest that accrues in accordance with the purchaser\u2019s bid, and other sums authorized by statute, but not the payment of taxes. It differentiates municipal liens from tax sale certificates on the basis that, after the sale is conducted, and the outstanding real estate taxes are paid, the private purchaser of the certificate has a more limited interest than the municipality. Princeton Office Park characterizes the conveyance of the tax sale certificate as a loan, noting that when the certificate is redeemed, the purchaser is repaid the amount that it paid on outstanding real estate taxes. Princeton Office Park disputes Plymouth Park\u2019s reliance on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67. It argues that the \u201cdelinquency\u201d preserved after a tax sale certificate is conveyed refers only to the interest and discount authority granted by statute to the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Amici curiae New Jersey State League of Municipalities, Tax Collectors and Treasurers Association of New Jersey, the Township of Lawrence, and Northeast Regional Tax Collectors and Treasurers Association argue that the Tax Sale Law clearly establishes that the holder of a tax sale certificate holds a tax lien. They characterize the lien held by the owner of a tax sale certificate to be closely analogous to a lien held by a municipality or a third party. Amici assert that the purpose of the Tax Sale Law is to make tax sale certificates an attractive investment in order to permit municipalities to raise revenue, and that the statute should be construed accordingly to confer on the holder of a certificate a tax lien that is exempt from the interest rate reduction that would otherwise be authorized by the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Amicus curiae National Tax Lien Association, Inc. (NTLA) contends that the Bankruptcy Court and District Court decisions would, if affirmed, effectively eliminate the New Jersey market for tax sale certificates. It asserts that investors typically borrow money to purchase tax sale certificates, and that limiting the interest rates available to them would chill the demand for the certificates. NTLA relies upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, arguing that the tax delinquency survives the certificate holder\u2019s payment of the real estate taxes, and contends that municipal liens and liens acquired by virtue of the purchase of tax sale certificates differ only in minor respects. NTLA urges the Court to hold that the owner of a tax sale certificate acquires a tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We begin by reviewing the statutory scheme for the purchase and sale of tax sale certificates. The Tax Sale Law serves \u201cas a framework to facilitate the collection of property taxes.\u201d <em>Varsolona v. Breen Capital Servs. Corp., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>605, 620, 853 A.2d 865 (2004) (citing <em>Dvorkin v. Twp. of Dover, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>303, 309, 148 A.2d 793 (1959)). It confers on a municipality that is owed real estate taxes \u201c \u2018a continuous lien on the land\u2019 for the delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>amount as well as for \u2018all subsequent taxes, interest, penalties and costs of collection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simon v. Cronecker, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>304, 318, 915 A.2d 489 (2007) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6). \u201cThe Tax Sale Law converts that lien into a stream of revenue by encouraging the purchase of tax certificates on tax-dormant properties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>By authorizing the sale of liens in a commercial market, the Tax Sale Law gives rise to \u201ca municipal financing option that provides a mechanism to transform a non-performing asset into cash without raising taxes.\u201d <em>Varsolana, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 610, 853 A.2d 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Tax Sale Law sets forth the procedure by which tax sale certificates are generated, purchased, and sold.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The certificate, drafted by an official designated by the municipality, verifies \u201cthe taxes, assessments or other municipal liens or charges, levied or assessed against the property described in the application\u201d as of the certificate\u2019s effective date. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-11, -12. After providing notice to the public and the property owner as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-26 and -27, the municipality may sell the certificate at a public auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32, an investor includes in its bid the rate of interest that it is willing to accept upon redemption of the certificate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32. The winning bidder is the investor who \u201cwill purchase the property, subject to redemption at the lowest rate of interest, but in no case in excess of 18% per annum.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32. The statute authorizes bidders who are willing to accept redemption \u201cat a rate of interest less than 1%, or at no interest,\u201d to offer to pay \u201ca premium over and above the amount of taxes, assessments or other charges ... due the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>municipality.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he property [is] struck off and sold to the bidder who offers to pay the amount of such taxes, assessments or charges, plus the highest amount of premium.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The successful bidder\u2019s purchase of a tax sale certificate \u201cdoes not divest the delinquent owner of his title to the land.\u201d <em>Twp. of Jefferson v. Block 447A, Lot 10, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 548 A.2d 521 (App.Div.1988). Instead, the sale operates as \u201ca conditional conveyance of the property to the purchaser, subject to a person with an interest in the property having the right to redeem the certificate, as prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Simon,, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 915 A.2d 489 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-31 to -32, -46). The purchaser acquires an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">inchoate interest [that] consists of three rights: the right to receive the sum paid for the certificate with interest at the redemption rate for which the property was sold; the right to redeem from the holder a subsequently issued tax sale certificate; and the right to acquire title by foreclosing the equity of redemption of all outstanding interests, including that of the property owner,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajm\"><em>[Varsolona, supra, </em>180 <em>NJ. </em>at 618, 853 A.2d 865 (citing <em>Twp. of Jefferson, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 4-5, 548 A.2d 521).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The right to acquire title by foreclosure is asserted in the Superior Court, which may enter final judgment \u201cto foreclose all prior or subsequent alienations and descents of the lands and encumbrances thereon, except subsequent municipal liens, and to adjudge an absolute and indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple, to be vested in the purchaser.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-87; <em>Town of Phillipsburg v. Block 1508, Lot 12, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 163, 881 A.2d 749 (App.Div.2005). Thus, by virtue of foreclosure, the purchaser of the tax sale certificate may become \u201cthe owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>property in fee simple.\u201d <em>Simon, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 915 A.2d 489 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-87).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The issue raised by this case \u2014 whether the hen created by the conveyance of a tax sale certificate is a tax hen \u2014 arises from language that appears in 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 511 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a plan of reorganization, a bankruptcy court overseeing the confirmation of a Chapter 11 reorganization plan may in appropriate settings reduce, or \u201ccram down,\u201d the rate of interest to be paid by a debtor to a creditor. <em>See </em>11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1129(b); <em>Till v.

The Bankruptcy Code, however, specifically excludes a \u201ctax claim\u201d from the \u201ccram down\u201d procedure authorized by 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1129(b) and case law. 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 511(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">If any provision of this title requires the payment of interest on a tax claim or on an administrative expense tax, or the payment of interest to enable a creditor to receive the present value of the allowed amount of a tax claim, the rate of interest shall be the rate determined under applicable nonbankruptcy law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">[11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 511(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">In light of this limitation on the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s authority to \u201ccram down\u201d interest rates if the claim at issue is a tax claim, the Third Circuit has posed its certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">In our interpretation of the Tax Sale Law, we are guided by established principles of statutory construction. \u2018When inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>preting statutory language, the goal is to divine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>State v.

Weintraub, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>87, 91-92, 199 A.2d 625 (1964); <em>see also In re Curry, </em>493 <em>B.R. </em>447, 451 (Bankr.D.N.J.2013) (stating that certain \u201cprovisions of the Tax Sale Law make it evident that the process created by the statute has but one goal \u2014 the collection of taxes\u201d); <em>Lonsk v. Pennefather, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 182, 402 A.2d 259 (App.Div.1979) (noting that \u201cthe public policy in this State is to encourage tax sale foreclosure so as to assist municipalities in the collection of delinquent taxes\u201d). In short, \u201c[t]he purpose of the Tax Sale Law is to enhance the collection of taxes.\u201d <em>Simon v. Rando, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 152, 863 A.2d 1078 (App.Div.2005), <em>aff'd, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>339, 344-45, 915 A.2d 509 (2007); <em>see Varsolona, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 617-18, 853 A.2d 865; <em>In re Kopec, </em>473 <em>B.R. </em>597, 600-01 (Bankr.D.N.J.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The Third Circuit\u2019s certified question requires that we classify the lien held by a purchaser of a tax sale certificate. As a general principle, \u201c[a] lien is defined as a charge upon real or personal property for the satisfaction of some debt or duty.\u201d <em>Sargeant Bros. v. Brancati, </em>107 <em>N.J.L. </em>84, 87, 151 A. 843 (E. &amp; A.1930) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Chase Manhattan Mortg. Corp. v. Spina, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 48-19, 737 A.2d 704 (Ch.Div.1998) (\u201cThe word hen is a generic term that includes in its definition any claim, encumbrance, or charge on property for payment of some debt, obligation or duty whether acquired by contract or by operation of law.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), aff<em>'d sub nom., Chase Manhattan Mortg. Corp. v. Heritage Square Ass\u2019n, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 2, 737 A.2d 682 (App.Div.1999). The lien is thus premised upon an underlying debt. We look to the Legislature\u2019s language to define that lien, and the debt from which it derives.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In five statutory provisions, the Legislature has offered substantial guidance on this issue. First, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that \u201c[t]axes on lands shall be a continuous lien on the land on which they are assessed and all subsequent taxes, interest, penalties and costs of collection which thereafter fall due or accrue shall be added to and be a part of such initial lien.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6. Second, the continuous lien is conveyed to the holder of a tax sale certificate by operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-42, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a sale is made in the enforcement of a municipal lien, the lien shall pass, with the title, to the purchaser, and if the sale shall be set aside for defect in the proceedings to sell, the lien shall be thereby continued.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-42; <em>see also Varsolona, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 853 A.2d 865. As the Appellate Division held in <em>Savage v. Weissman, </em>a tax sale certificate does not give rise to an outright conveyance of the property, but rather creates \u201ca lien on the premises and conveys the lien interest of the taxing authority.\u201d 355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 436, 810 A.2d 1077 (App.Div.2002); <em>see also Twp. of Jefferson, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 4, 548 A.2d 521 (noting that \u201c[t]he certificate holder succeeds to the lien interest of the taxing district\u201d). The purchaser of a tax sale certificate thus acquires a lien formerly held by the municipality\u2019s taxing authority, derived from the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay real estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Third, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-54, the Legislature identified as one of the parties entitled to redeem a tax sale certificate the holder of a \u201cprior outstanding tax lien certificate.\u201d The Legislature used \u201ctax lien certificate\u201d as an alternative term for \u201ctax sale certificate.\u201d That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">Except as hereinafter provided, the owner, his heirs, holder of any prior outstanding <em>tax lien certificate, </em>mortgagee, or occupant of land sold for municipal taxes, assessment for benefits pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A </em>] 54:5-7 or other municipal charges, may redeem it at any time until the right to redeem has been cut off in the manner in this chapter set forth, by paying to the collector, or to the collector of delinquent taxes on lands of the municipality where the land is situate, for the use of the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, the amount required for redemption as hereinafter set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-54 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The Legislature\u2019s interchangeable use of the terms \u201ctax lien certificate\u201d and \u201ctax sale certificate\u201d is evidence of its intent. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>e.g., Perez v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>188, 212, 892 A.2d 1255 (2006) (noting, in context of Retad Installment Sales Act, that \u201cthe terms interest and time price differential are used interchangeably\u201d and have been given equivalent meaning). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-54 thus evinces a legislative intent to confer on the certificate owner a \u201ctax lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">A fourth provision further indicates that the tax sale certificate purchaser acquires a lien derived from the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay taxes to the municipality. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-43, which prescribes the procedure to be followed in the event that the sale of a certificate is set aside, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">If the sale shall be set aside, the municipality shall refund to the purchaser the price paid by him on the sale, with lawful interest, upon his assigning to the municipality the certificate of sale and <em>all his interest in the tax, assessment or other charges and in the municipal lien therefor, </em>and the municipality may readvertise and sell if the municipal lien remains in force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-43 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">That statutory language \u2014 acknowledging that the holder of a certificate has an \u201cinterest in the tax\u201d and \u201cthe municipal lien therefor\u201d \u2014 demonstrates that the certificate\u2019s owner holds a tax lien based on a tax debt, not another form of lien independent of the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay taxes. <em>See Kopec, supra, </em>473 <em>B.R. </em>at 601 (stating that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5 \u2014 43\u2019s \u201clanguage strongly suggests that the claim of the holder of a tax sale certificate is based on the underlying tax\u201d); <em>Curry, supra, </em>493 <em>B.R. </em>at 450 (\u201cAs the purpose of a lien is to secure payment of a debt, logically the debt owed to the taxing authority is conveyed as well.\u201d). We find that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5 \u2014 43 provides compelling evidence of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">A fifth provision, <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-67, rebuts property owner Princeton Office Park\u2019s argument that a tax sale certificate holder\u2019s lien is not a tax lien because a tax lien cannot survive the payment of real estate taxes owed to the municipality. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 governs the discounts that a municipality may give if real estate taxes are paid prior to delinquency, and determines the interest that may be charged on delinquent taxes. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>67. In accordance with a 1994 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, a property owner\u2019s tax \u201cdelinquency\u201d survives, despite the sale of a tax sale certificate. <em>L. </em>1994, c. 32, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under a 1997 amendment, a property owner\u2019s tax delinquency survives notwithstanding \u201cthe payment of delinquent tax by the purchaser of the total property tax levy ... and for the purposes of satisfying the requirements for filing any tax appeal with the county board of taxation or the State tax court.\u201d <em>L. </em>1997, c. 99, \u00a7 4. Thus, as amended, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67(c) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">The property shall remain delinquent, as defined herein, until such time as all unpaid taxes, including subsequent taxes and liens, together with interest thereon shall have been fully paid and satisfied. The delinquency shall remain notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate of sale pursuant to [N.J.S.A] 54:5-32 and [N.J.S.A.] 54:5-46, the payment of delinquent tax by the purchaser of the total property tax levy pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-113.5] and for the purposes of satisfying the requirements for filing any tax appeal with the county board of taxation or the State tax court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:4 \u2014 67(c).] <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">This statutory language thus reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent that a property owner\u2019s tax delinquency survive the sale of a tax certificate, and that the certificate holder will hold a lien that is based on that delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">That expression of legislative intent is unaltered by the Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ramos, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>97. In <em>Ramos, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Tax Court held that, as amended, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 was intended \u201cto define a tax delinquency as continuing after the sale of a tax sale certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. Although the Tax Court rejected substantive due process claims asserted by the taxpayer, <em>id. </em>at 109, it found a constitutional infirmity in the 1997 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, which would preclude the property owner from filing a tax appeal following the sale of a tax sale certificate, <em>id. </em>at 106, 113-14. The Tax Court held that <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:51A-l(b)\u2019s bar on the property owner\u2019s filing of a tax appeal, following the conveyance of a tax sale certificate and the purchaser\u2019s payment of outstanding taxes, violated procedural due process. <em>Id. </em>at 111-13 (citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>319, 334-35, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976)). The Tax Court held unconstitutional the tax appeal language in the 1997 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 \u201cbecause, when (as here) a tax sale certificate is acquired by a third-party purchaser, the Provisions offer only a postdeprivation remedy under circumstances which do not warrant or justify a denial of the predeprivation remedy generally required by due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The Tax Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ramos </em>does not undermine the expression of legislative intent found in the text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67. Regardless of whether a property owner may file a tax appeal after the issuance of a tax sale certificate \u2014 an issue not raised by this ease \u2014 the Legislature clearly intended that the \u201cdelinquency\u201d survive the payment of taxes following the issuance of a tax sale certificate, as the Tax Court in <em>Ramos, supra, </em>acknowledged. 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>N.J.Tax </em>at 104 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67 thus confirms that a certificate holder\u2019s lien is derived from the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay real estate taxes. As the Bankruptcy Court did in <em>Curry, supra, </em>493 <em>B.R. </em>at 451-52, and <em>Kopec, supra, </em>473 <em>B.R. </em>at 601-02, we construe <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-67 to indicate that the certificate holder\u2019s lien is indeed a tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In sum, we premise our construction of the Tax Sale Law on five provisions of the statute: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-6, which defines the municipality\u2019s continuous tax lien; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-42, which provides that the lien is conveyed to the purchaser of a tax sale certificate; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-54, which uses the term \u201ctax lien certificate\u201d to describe a tax sale certificate; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-43, which recognizes the purchaser\u2019s compensable \u201cinterest in the tax;\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-67, which provides that the tax delinquency survives the issuance of a certificate. The plain language of these provisions confirms that the debt underlying a certificate holder\u2019s lien is the property owner\u2019s obligation to pay taxes, and that the lien conferred with the certificate is a tax lien. This statutory interpretation furthers the Tax Sale Law\u2019s fundamental objective of making tax sale certificates an attractive investment for third parties, thereby assisting municipalities in raising revenue. <em>Varsolona, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 617-18, 853 A.2d 865; <em>Bron, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 91-92, 199 A.2d 625; <em>Lonsk, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 402 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Should the Legislature determine that a municipality\u2019s issuance of a tax sale certificate does not convey a tax lien on the purchaser, it can amend the statute accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> The named plaintiff in the Chancery Division action was \u201cWachovia CUST for Plym Pk Tax Srvs.\u201d The record does not reveal the relationship between that entity and Plymouth Park.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> At reargument on February 3, 2014, the parties informed the Court that on January 31, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court had held that Plymouth Park's tax sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>certificate is subject to forfeiture pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:5-63.1, and voided its lien on Princeton Office Park's property pursuant to 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 506(d).
