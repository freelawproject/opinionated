The statute of 3 &amp; 4 Anne, ch. IX., distinguishes between the <em>endorsement </em>and <em>assignment </em>of a negotiable note, and authorizes the holder by either mode of transfer to bring suit in his own name against the <em>maker </em>or <em>endorser. </em>No action is given by it against <em>the assignor.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-6\">2. An <em>assignment </em>of a promissory note transfers to the holder the rights of the assignor; the assignor being responsible for nothing more than the genuineness of the claim. ;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-8\">3.

Though the words \u201c <em>without recourse\u201d </em>in connection with such an assignment were stricken out, the holder being unwilling to take the note otherwise, the <em>assignor </em>saying \u201c he did not know it would make any <em>difference:\" Held, </em>that the erasure, under such circumstances, did not amount to a contract of guaranty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-10\">5. When the assignment of the overdue note was made, it was agreed that the assignee was to take <em>iron </em>from the drawer to the amount of the note, and to go after the iron the next day, and if it were not received, the note was to be returned to the assignor immediately: It was <em>Held, </em>that as the assignee did not conform to the terms of the agreement, he was not entitled to recover from the assignor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-11\">6.

Also, that the company, at the time of the assignment of the note, and for some months afterwards, delivered iron for all claims against them presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-12\">It was stated on the same paper-book, that, under such state of facts, it was contended that the plaintiff was bound to return the note if not paid; and that even in the absence of any such agreement, Lyons, the defendant in the suit, was entitled to notice that the company had failed to pay, upon reasonable demand having been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-13\">On part of <em>the plaintiff in the suit, </em>the deposition of M.

Divelbis said, in presence of Lyons, \u201c I made him fix it, for I would not have it without recourse back. Lyons said he did not know it would make any difference.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-15\"><em>On part of .defendants, </em>testimony was given that Divelbis, before he got the note, knew that the Ellicotts were not paying <em>money, </em>but were delivering iron for claims against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>J.

The opinion of Gilmore, J., afterwards delivered, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">\u201c The question reserved for the consideration of the Court was, whether it was necessary that the plaintiff should show <em>reasonable </em>demand, <em>and notice to the defendant.\u201d </em>********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A86\">\u201c It is now settled by a recent case, Patterson <em>v. </em>Todd &amp; Lemon, 6 <em>Harris </em>426, that the endorser of a negotiable note overdue is not liable, unless the note be presented to the drawer for payment within a reasonable time after its transfer, and if not paid, notice of non-payment given to the endorser. The undertaking of the endorser is, that ,if -the drawer does not pay on demand, made in proper time,\u201d and notice of this he given, he will pay. \u201c The nature of the undertaking in this respect is not altered, although the note is endorsed when overdue. It is not an independent original undertaking, as some suppose, hut subject to the above stated conditions. But this is an assignment, and if the assignor is liable at all, it must be on an undertaking in the nature of a guaranty; in which it is only necessary to show either that an attempt had been made to collect it, or that through the insolvency of the drawer it could not be realized. These were matters which were all taken into view, and passed upon at the trial. The Court therefore direct judgment to be entered on the verdict for <em>plaintiff </em>on payment of jury fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-10\">It was stated <em>on the record </em>as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-11\">\u201cMarch 14, 1853.\u2014Jury sworn.

But in the case of a guaranty, the rule is not equally strict, and when there has been no presentment or notice of dishonor, the liability of the guarantor will depend upon the question as to whether the want of notice occasioned him loss: <em>Story on Pro. Notes, </em>sec. 460; 1 <em>Jones </em>460. The liability of a guarantor depends upon the evidence in the case. Tlie Court charged that in order to recover, it was necessary to show only that an attempt had been made to collect the note, or that by reason of the insolvency of the maker, it could not be collected. But it was contended that in this case the testimony was, that the endorsee was <em>to take iron </em>for the note, and. that it was to have been presented on the next day, and, if not honored, the note was to be returned. Even though there had been no agreement to return the note, if there had not been due diligence to secure the claim, and give notice if it were not met, and by this means the claim was lost, the defendant was not liable <em>even if he were a guarantor. </em>It was said that in this case the defendant was not <em>a guarantor, </em>as he had not entered into a covenant to be surety for the payment of the claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-7\"><em>J. B. </em>and <em>A. Howell, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZJ\">It was contended that this was not a mere <em>endorsement, </em>nor simply an assignment of the note; but that the defendant, when he assigned, agreed to guaranty its payment, and that this appeared from the testimony in the case. The contract of <em>endorsement </em>may be converted by parol evidence into an absolute and unconditional engagement to pay; 6 <em>Harris </em>426, Patterson <em>v. </em>Todd &amp; Lemon; and the contract of <em>assignment </em>may, in the same way, be shown to be an agreement to guaranty the payment of the note. A guarantor is bound to inquire and see that the note is paid. It is not necessary for the holder to give him notice of its non-payment: 9 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>199; 4 <em>Watts </em>418; 1 <em>Barr </em>501. It was contended that the jury had determined from the testimony and from <em>all the facts of the case </em>the liability of the defendant, and their decision should not be reviewed in this Court. It was further said that the <em>charge to the jury </em>is not <em>here</em>\u2014that on the paper-book is what was said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>by the Court in entering judgment. It was added: \u201cAfter the jury were charged and had retired, the question was made, \u2018 whether it was necessary that plaintiff should show reasonable demand and notice to the defendant.\u2019 <em>That </em>question was reserved for the consideration of the Court.\u201d It was said that it was on the decision of the Court below upon- such reserved question that this Court have to pass, and upon no other.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b191-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anp\">Every endorsement of a promissory note includes in it an assignment, but an assignment is not necessarily an endorsement. The statute of 3 &amp; 4 Anne, chapter ix., distinguishes between the two methods of transfer, when it authorizes the holder, whether by <em>endorsement </em>or <em>assignment, </em>to bring an action in his own name against the <em>maker, </em>and <em>endorser. </em>No action is given by the statute against the <em>assignor. </em>An endorsement is an authority to the holder to write over the signature an order upon the maker, \"in the nature of a bill of exchange. It is a commercial transaction, and the law merchant fixes the measure of liability, as in bills of exchange. An assignment of a <em>chose in action </em>is in strictness unknown to the common law. It is, however, recognised in equity, and transfers to the holder the rights of .the assignor, at a price presumed to be no more than equal to the value of the claim against the maker, taking into consideration his character for punctuality, and his ability to pay. On such a transfer the assignor is responsible for nothing but the genuineness of the claim. The instrument on which this action was brought, is a transfer of the description last mentioned, written upon a note overdue at the time. On this there is no resort for indemnity against the insolvency of the maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">It appears, by the evidence, that the assignment was written, in the first place, with the words \u201c without recourse\u201d embodied in it; \"but these words were afterwards erased by consent of both parties, because the assignee was unwilling to take it in that form, and the assignor believed that it \u201cmade no difference\u201d whether the words were erased or not. The erasure, under such circumstances, is not a contract of guaranty.\" If that had been the intention of the parties, it was easy for them to express it. The omission to do so shows that each party relied either upon the legal effect of the assignment, or upon some collateral agreement, susceptible of proof independent of it. The evidence that the note was taken under a special agreement that Divelbis was to \u201c go the next day to get iron for it, and if he did not get the iron, that'he was to return the note immediately,\u201d explains the reason for erasing the words \u201cwithout recourse,\u201d and shows that in doing so, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>only intended to avoid introducing into the writing anything inconsistent with their parol contract. As there is no evidence of any other contract of guaranty than that stated in the testimony of Tedrick and Llewellyn, and as the plaintiff below did not conform to the terms of that agreement, he was not entitled to recover. The transfer of the note by Divelbis to. John Hagen three days after the former received it\u2014the commencement of a suit against the maker on the 11th December, 1847, nearly three months after-wards\u2014the recovery of a judgment nine months after the transfer, and an execution returned \u201c no property found,\u201d do not amount to a compliance- with the agreement to call on the maker for iron <em>the next day </em>after the note was received, and if the iron was not obtained, to return the note <em>immediately.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">It appears by the record that the verdict was entered \u201c for the plaintiff <em>pro </em>forma, with leave to the Court to enter judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.\u201d </em>In this state of the record the judge\u2019s statement, in his opinion afterwards filed, that certain matters were \u201ctaken into view and passed upon at the trial,\u201d cannot be received to contradict it. If the verdict was entered <em>pro forma, </em>we do not see what power the jury were permitted to exercise over the case. It is plain, from this entry, that they exercised none; and the imperfect statement, of the question reserved, taken from the judge\u2019s notes, is equally ineffectual in contradicting the record. The reservation of a point without a statement of the facts upon which the question arises, and without stating the judgment to be given upon its solution, is irregular and dangerous to the rights of the parties. In this case, judging from the entry on the record, the parties appear to have dispensed with the services of the jury, and to have submitted the whole case to the judgment of the Court upon the evidence. Upon that evidence, as stated in the paper-book, we are of opinion that the defendant below was entitled to the verdict and judgment. Under the reservation made at the trial, it is therefore ordered that the judgment of the Court below be reyersed, and that judgment be entered for the plaintiff in error, <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
