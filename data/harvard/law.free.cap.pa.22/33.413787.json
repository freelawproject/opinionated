A liability in either way is sufficient under the case stated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-8\">2.

The ease was tried upon the appeal in said Court, in No. 220, December Term, 1850, and the judgment of the aldermen affirmed. <em>Prout record. </em>And now this suit is brought upon the said obligation, to recover $292.13, the rent and costs as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-11\">The only question raised here, is whether the recognisance or obligation above stated, is sufficient to hold the defendant liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-12\">The Court to enter judgment in favor of the party entitled thereto, upon the facts hereinbefore stated, with leave to either party to take out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-13\">On the 2d day of July, 1853, the Court ordered judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff below, on the case stated, for $292.13, with costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-14\">Such judgment was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-15\"><em>Rogers </em>and Loomis, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJE\">It was contended that the undertaking of defendant imposed no legal liability on him; that it contained neither a penalty or condition, and that both were necessary: 1 <em>Jones </em>294, Caldwell <em>v. </em>Brindle.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-16\"><em>Stowe, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEX\">The statute does not require that any sum be specified. Where the entry by the justice substantially sets out the obligation required by law, it is sufficient: 5 <em>Watts </em>334; 1 <em>Pa. Rep. </em>149; 1 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser</em>. 101, Bank of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Reed; 9 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>142. The obligation, if not a recognisance, would be good at common law as <em>a promise: </em>8 <em>Watts </em>388. The plaintiff acquiesced in the appeal, and was put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to trouble and expense. No complaint was made as to fraud, mistake, or misunderstanding on part of Hardy, but the defence was on technical grounds.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, September 22, by</p>\n<author id=\"b37-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">This is a case stated in an action of debt upon what is alleged to be a recognisance of bail on appeal. It is stated, as part of the case, that \u201c the <em>only </em>question raised here is, whether the <em>recognisance </em>or <em>obligation </em>above stated is sufficient to hold the defendant liable.\u201d On this case, thus stated, no question can be raised in regard to the <em>form </em>of the action, or the variance between the proof and allegation. Questions of that kind have generally so little to do with the merits, that we have repeatedly decided, in several recent cases, that a variance between the allegations and the evidence cannot be taken notice of here under a general instruction that the plaintiff is, or is not, entitled to recover. To enable a party to raise the question of variance he must make the point specifically in the court below. So that, if the defendant is liable on the instrument set forth in the declaration, it is not material now whether it be called a \u201crecognisance\u201d or an \u201c obligation.\u201d A liability in either form, seems distinctly to be contemplated in the case stated, as sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">But we think, under the circumstances of the case, that the instrument is good as a recognisance. It is a debt acknowledged of record. It was taken by a magistrate of competent jurisdiction in the regular course of judicial proceedings before him. The defendant acknowledges himself to be <em>absolutely bound as bail, </em>and then states <em>the condition </em>in substantial compliance with the terms of the law. He has, by entering into this obligation, secured for the defendant in the original proceeding, the advantages of a trial on an appeal. He has succeeded in putting the plaintiff to the expense of a second trial to establish his right, and has delayed him in obtaining what is justly his due. After all this, it would be grossly unjust to permit him to avoid his own engagement upon record, by the technical objection that no <em>penal sum </em>was stated in the instrument. This defect is one of mere form, in a recognisance taken on an appeal. The condition specifies the measure of liability, and in this case it contains everything required by the statute. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
