The first was, that plaintiff is an \u201c owner,\u201d under the Act of Assembly relating to turnpike and plank roads, and as such has a right to recover compensation in this proceeding, for all damage done to his interest in the property. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-13\">On part of the company, points as follows were proposed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-14\">1. That if the evidence satisfy them, that plaintiff had no greater estate than that of a lessee for a term of years, he is not entitled to present any claim, under the act of incorporation of defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-15\">4. That if the .road of defendants, was located so that any alteration of the line did not increase the damages that would have been sustained, by reason of such alteration, at the time the lessor obtained his alleged interest in the term or lease, such lessor took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>his supposed interest subject to said road and its location, and cannot claim damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">7. That the plaintiff being the only owner appearing on behalf of this tract of land, on which he lives, or of any estate therein, they-are bound to set off the whole increased value of the land, as improved by the road, against the claim here presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">9. That the tenant\u2019s remedy for the eviction alleged, is against his landlord, who held subject to allowance for roads, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">The court <em>negatived </em>the first, point. To the fourth it was charged, there is no evidence that the lessee, the plaintiff, got a lease for less than he would have done, had no such road been in progress or contemplation. There is no evidence that the road, its advantages or disadvantages, was any element or item which entered into the bargain when the lease was made, and if it had been, the defendants were no party to it. There is evidence that the rent in the first lease from the owner, in fee, was $600, and the sub-lessee, the tenant, the plaintiff, after a lapse of time, leased the premises for the same rent. This point assumes by implication what is not proved. If the plaintiff had leased from <em>the </em>defendant, the Court would affirm the point, but as he did not, the Court refuses so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-9\">7. The Court refuses to affirm this point, as it is not warranted by the Act of Assembly. The benefits and advantages <em>to the owner of the </em>fee, cannot be set off against disadvantages done and suffered <em>by a lessee, </em>whose lease has only three years to run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-10\">The ninth point was answered negatively. In the opinion of the Court, refusing <em>a new trial, </em>it was observed that the covenant for quiet enjoyment in the lease was to indemnify against a lawful eviction by reason of defect of title; but there was no defect of title in this ease. That the landlord did not covenant against the sovereign power of the state. The lessee could not maintain an action against the landlord for the injury in question, and his only remedy was the one pursued. The case of Thomas <em>v. </em>The Plank Road Company was referred to. See a report of it in 8 <em>Harris </em>91, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-11\">Error was assigned to the answers to the said points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-12\"><em>Craft, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Y\">The General Road Act requires <em>advantages </em>to be considered; also the probability of the road reverting: 8 <em>Watts </em>177. It was said that,these considerations were not applicable <em>to tenants for years. </em>That a mortgagee is not an owner: 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>418. That the claim should be in the name of the owner of the land: 16 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>40; 1 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser. </em>346; 4 <em>Wharton </em>90, Frost <em>v. </em>Earnest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-14\"><em>Watson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWF\">It was contended that a tenant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>years, the owner of a leasehold, came within the meaning-of the term <em>owner </em>used -in the Act of Assembly on this subject. 4 <em>Wharton </em>90-91, Frost <em>v. </em>Earnest. The lease in this case commenced,in 1847. The Company were incorporated in 1849, and' the road was opened in the spring of 1850, and whilst the tenant was in possession under the lease. The construction of the road therefore was not a subject of consideration at the making of the lease: 4 <em>Wharton </em>90-91. The case, of Thomas <em>v. </em>Plank Road was cited (see report of it in 8 <em>Harris </em>91, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">The landlord is not responsible for such an injury as this.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, September 22, by</p>\n<author id=\"b34-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3A\">A tenant for years is the owner of an estate in the land, and is therefore entitled to compensation for an injury done to his estate by a turnpike road company in the construction of the road. Any advantages which his particular estate may derive from, the road maybe deducted from the amount of the injury done to him; but, the advantages which the owners of any other estate may derive from the road cannot be deducted from the claim of the tenant for years. The work may produce nothing but injury during the brief term of the tenant for years. While the workmen are excavating the ground, tearing down his fences, occupying his premises with teams and materials, and exposing his crops to injury, the road is generally in an unfinished state, and entirely unfit for use. This may continue during the whole of the term. The advantages of the road may commence only upon the expiration of the term, and thus the estate in reversion may receive the whole benefit from the work. In such a case, it would be gross injustice to the tenant to extinguish his rights by means of a cross demand against another. The proper place for the consideration of advantages to the reversion is, when the owner of that estate prefers his claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">It is certainly true that the purchaser of an estate cannot claim damages for an injury done to it before his purchase. Such claim is a chose in action, which remains in the hands of the vendor. The vendee is presumed- to pay less for the estate on account of the injury, and has therefore no claim to recover damages for it. Rut we do not perceive from the facts stated in the paper-book, that the plaintiff in error was entitled to instructions affirming the principle. On the contrary, the facts as stated in the counter-statement, and not denied, are \u201c that the lease commenced on the 1st of April, 1847, and terminated on the 1st of April, 1858 ; and that the plaintiff below proved that he was in possession by assignment under this lease <em>at the time the road was </em>surveyed,, <em>and during the time it was in process of making.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The errors assigned are unsustained, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
