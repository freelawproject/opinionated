Two questions are raised. <em>First. </em>Whether the 9th section of the intestate law confines the inheritance to the paternal line of kindred, as being of the only inheritable blood through which the estate came; or whether the 11th section extends it to all the next of kin, without distinction of blood. <em>Second. </em>If confined to the paternal line, can the issue of deceased uncles and aunts inherit along with the surviving aunts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">\u201c It is argued for the maternal relatives, that the 9th section applies only to \u2018 the cases before mentioned\u2019 in the preceding sections ; and therefore does not control the cases in those which follow, and consequently that the 11th section extends the descent to the next of kin without distinction of blood. This argument would be conclusive had there been no provision for the next of kin previous to the 9th section; but the 7th section which precedes the 9th, and is one of \u2018the cases before mentioned,\u2019 provides that in default of all persons before described, to wit, lineal issue and brothers and sisters and their lineal issue, the estate shall descend to <em>the next of kin. </em>If the construction of the 11th section asked by the maternal relatives be right, it follows that the 7th, as qualified by the 9th section and the 11th section, flatly contradict each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\">\u201c But it cannot be supposed, in a bill drawn by the revisers with so much accuracy and care, as will be observed by reading their accompanying report <em>(Hood on Executors </em>506, &amp;c.), and passed by the legislature without alteration, such a blunder could have been made. We must, therefore, look to see whether these sections are reconcilable and traceable to distinct classes of cases, intended to be provided for. We think they are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-9\">\u201c When the reviewers had finished the 7th section, they had provided for all cases where known kindred in either line existed, and the estate could not escheat. But when they followed the 7th by the 9th as a proviso, they undid the generality of the former, by the restriction of the latter. Consequently, as soon as the stock of kindred to whom the ancestral blood belonged, became extinct, the estate must escheat, notwithstanding there was another line of blood still living. Accordingly, to provide against this, the 10th section gave the estate in fee to the surviving husband or wife, to whom it might well be supposed the intestate would desire that it should descend, on the extinction of the line of ancestors from whom it came. Then follows the 11th section, which, in default of husband or wife, vests it in the next of kin, without respect of blood; and at the same time provides for any misconstruction of the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of computation of kindred, or the persons who are to inherit, by expressly excluding the common law heir. By this means the finality of the 7th section, which was opened by the proviso of the 9th to exclude a particular line, is again closed by the 11th, which readmits the excluded line, to save the escheat. This is made more manifest by being followed by the 12th section, providing for the escheat. Thus it will be seen'that the 9th operates on one class, to whom as having the\u2019 ancestral blood it may be supposed the intestate would have given it, and the 11th can operate on another to whom he would have given it rather than to the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">\u201cThe counsel of defendants, the maternal uncles, allege that Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>258, is decided on the ground that the mother is not of the blood; and- being excluded on that ground as one of \u201c the before-mentioned cases\u201d referred to in the 9th section, the case does not affect the construction they put on the 11th. This may be true of the immediate point decided. But there is an, aspect in which Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark bears on the question. The mother of the intestate being excluded by the 9th section from want of inheritable blood, is it likely the revisers intended that her brothers and sisters should take, though she' could not, and their kindred to the intestate could only be traced through her ? Yet this will be the construction demanded by defendants\u2019 counsel. James R. Parr and Isaac Parr, the maternal uncles, were brothers of the intestate\u2019s mother. Now suppose the mother had survived, would the inheritance have passed by her and vested in them, though they were obliged to trace kindred to the intestate through her ? The reason which in Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark caused it to pass her, must cause it to pass them also. It would be monstrous to suppose that, she being alive, her brothers and sisters should be preferred before her as to her own son\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">\u201cBaker <em>v. </em>Chalfant, 5 <em>Whart. </em>477, is cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel. The comprehensive reasoning of the Chief Justice, who seldom descended into particulars, seems to impugn the operation of the rule excluding for want of inheritable blood. But a close, examination of the case proves the reverse, and shows that the Court held to the rule of the proviso in the only part of the case to which it could be applied. That case was a conflict between the paternal uncles and the half-sisters of the intestate. Twenty-five acres the intestate purchased, and one hundred and ten acres he inherited from his brother of the whole blood who had purchased it, and ninety acres he acquired by inheritance of one-half from his father, apd by purchase of the other half from his brother. The judgment of the Court gave all to the half-sisters, except the one-half of the ninety acres descended to him from his father, which was given to the paternal uncles. The argument of counsel is not given, but it is clear that the controversy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>whether the one hundred and ten acres descending from the brother of the whole blood to the intestate, should go to the paternal uncles, or to the half-sisters of the brother from whom they came. The reasoning of the Chief Justice is intended to show, that there was no reason why the half-sisters should not inherit the estate descending from the brother of the intestate, rather than that acquired by purchase; because they were related in equal degree to both, and could as properly inherit from the first brother, who was a purchaser, after descent cast from him, as they could from the second. But, by awarding to the uncles the half of the tract which came to the intestate by inheritance from his father, the Court emphatically recognises the rule of inheritable blood, when the estate comes from an <em>ancestor, </em>who left relatives still surviving, nearer of kin to <em>Mm </em>than the half-sisters of the intestate, who are not of kin to him at all. In this way did Justice Huston understand Baker <em>v. </em>Chalfant, in Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>262.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">\u201cAs to the <em>second question, </em>it is sufficient.to-say, that the issue of deceased paternal aunts and uncles are excluded by the express words of the 8th section, that there shall be no representation admitted amongst collaterals after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children: see Good <em>v. </em>Herr, 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>256; also <em>Hood on Exectitors </em>509, Report of Commissioners. Besides, they are not the next of kin according to the 7th section, the surviving aunts being one degree of kin nearer to the intestate than the children of uncles and aunts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">\u201cThe Court therefore give judgment-in the case stated, in favor of Jesse Sill and Elizabeth his wife, and Abraham Gray and Ruth his wife, for the whole premises, to wit: one undivided half in right of said Elizabeth, the other undivided half in right of the said Ruth, and that the costs be paid according to the agreement, to wit, one-half by the plaintiffs and the other half by the defendant. Judgment as of September 3, 1853.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">It was assigned for error, that the Court erred in rendering judgment on the ease stated in favor of Jesse Sill and Elizabeth his wife, and Abraham Gray and Ruth his wife, for the <em>whole </em>premises ; that the judgment of the Court should have been for the said Sill and wife, and the said Gray and wife, for the one undivided half part thereof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-9\"><em>Laird </em>and <em>White, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APh\">It was contended in an elaborate argument, that the defendant, standing on the maternal side in the same degree of consanguinity with the plaintiffs on the paternal side to the intestate, was not excluded from a share in the inheritance by virtue of the proviso in the 9th section of the Intestate Act of 8th April, 1833; that the proviso in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>section did not apply to the case of the plaintiff in error, defendant below, but that he was entitled to the one fourth part, and his brother to another fourth part of the lands in question, under the provisions of the 7th and 11th sections of the Act of 1833, as being <em>of the next of kin.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">It was, <em>inter </em>alia, said that the rule giving ancestral estates, on the failure of <em>lineal </em>descendants, to the collateral relatives who were of the blood of the first purchaser, rested on feudal principles, and that the reason for it did not exist in this country, except so far as it was founded on natural justice; and, in this case, to adhere to it would be to contravene the sentiment of natural justice. That the estate in question was neither strictly <em>ex paterna </em>nor <em>ex materna; </em>that it was acquired by Ephraim A. Robinson, after his intermarriage with Elizabeth Parr, and was the accumulation of their joint labor, industry, and economy. The <em>legal </em>title was in E. A. Robinson, but, it was said, that when an equitable reason is invoked to justify a particular construction of a doubtful statute, it should be broadly equitable in view of all the circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">But apart from the construction of the Act of 1833, contended for, it was submitted, whether Ruth Gray and Elizabeth Sill were of the blood of Ephraim A. Robinson, the perquisitor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">To be <em>of the blood, </em>is said in <em>Blackstone, </em>p. 221, vol. 1, to be <em>lineally descended </em>from the first <em>feudatory or purchaser, </em>and if a vassal died seised of a feud of his own acquiring, \u201cit could not descend to any but his own offspring, not even to his brother, because he was not descended or derived his blood from the first acquirer.\u201d It is true that a fiction was afterwards invented to let in the collateral kinsmen upon the presumption that the <em>feud </em>had descended from some imaginary purchasing ancestor of indefinite antiquity. But when the proviso in the 9th section requires the person claiming to be of the blood of the ancestor or other relation from whom the estate descended, must he not be of his <em>blood, </em>in the common law sense, that is, lineally descended from the purchaser ; and is not the statutory <em>ancestor </em>or other <em>relation </em>identical with the <em>real perquisitor, </em>to wit, E. A. Robinson ? This would seem to be the position assumed by the Court in Hart\u2019s Appeal, 8 <em>Barr </em>37, and Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 <em>Barr </em>165. If the statutory <em>ancestor </em>is identical with the <em>real purchaser, </em>then it would follow that the plaintiffs are not of the inheritable blood of E. A. Robinson in the common law sense, and can only claim a share of this estate along with the maternal uncles as being of the next of kin.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-9\"><em>Foster, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auq\">He relied on the opinion of Judge Agnew, citing Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>258, Hart\u2019s Appeal, 8 <em>Barr 32, </em>and Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 <em>Barr </em>165.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b299-6\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXR\">We have carefully considered the objections urged against the opinion of Judge Agnew, and they have failed to convince us that he fell into any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The principle very successfully asserted in Bevan <em>v. </em>Taylor, 7 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>397, is fully incorporated into our Intestate Act of 1833, and rules the present question. The 7th section of the Act admits the next of kin to the inheritance in default of the classes and persons previously described, but its words are limited by the second proviso, to such next of kin as are of <em>the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate descended. </em>But if there should be no next of kin of <em>such </em>blood, then by the 11th section, the next of kin shall be admitted without regard to the blood of the ancestor. A general principle conformable to the common law and the dictates of nature, is laid down in the proviso to the 7th section; but where it cannot be applied, <em>the 11th </em>section brings in another beneficent principle, that kindred of the intestate, without common blood with the ancestor, shall take the estate rather than that it shall escheat. Thus understood, there is no conflict between these sections, and they are as reasonable as harmonious; but they exclude the defendant, not because he is not next of kin to the intestate, but because there are others next of kin who are of the blood of the ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">And there can be no question here that Ephraim A. Robinson was the perquisitor whose <em>blood </em>must determine the inheritance. It is true he acquired the estate after his marriage with Elizabeth Parr, and it may be true, as suggested, that her industry and economy contributed to its acquisition; but the marriage was a gift of these to her husband, and their fruits enure to his benefit. And he acquired it <em>by purchase, </em>in the ordinary sense of that word; so that he comes within the rule in Hartman\u2019s Estate, 4 <em>Rawle </em>39, and Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 <em>Barr </em>166. The plaintiffs have blood in common with him, no matter how little: Eames <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>Law Reg. </em>No. 10, p. 634, and the defendant has none. He cannot, therefore, take.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The second point ruled by the Court is in accordance with the letter of the Act, and the adjudged cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
