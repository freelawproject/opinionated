The case was heard on bill and answer and evidence presented. After findings of fact were filed a decree was entered ordering that the defendant recover from the plaintiff the sum of $14.70 for labor and materials furnished. The defendant is enjoined from discontinuing electric service to the plaintiff\u2019s premises. The case is here upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">From the findings the following material facts appear. The defendant is a public service corporation serving the city of S-t. Al-bans with electric light and power. The plaintiff lives on a farm within the territory served by the defendant. In August, 1942, the plaintiff purchased a used electric refrigerator and took it to the defendant\u2019s place of business to have it put in running order. It needed certain repair parts which were difficult to obtain because of conditions brought about by .the war. The refrigerator was put in good running order by the defendant, kept running three weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>on defendant\u2019s floor and was delivered in good condition to the plaintiff in April, 1943. After it had been delivered to the plaintiff it ran but about one day when it stopped and was repaired by the G. S. Blodgett Co. in August, 1943, and has worked all right since that time. The defendant rendered a bill for labor and parts furnished for the refrigerator in the sum of $14.70 which the plaintiff refused to pay. On June 15, 1944, the defendant sent plaintiff a statement for electric current and also a bill for labor and repair parts for the refrigerator and to that bill attached a notice that \u201cthe electric service will be discontinued unless the overdue account is paid before June 23\u201d. The plaintiff paid the bill for current but refused payment of the .bill for material and labor furnished in repairing the refrigerator. On June 23, 1944, the defendant caused the electric meter to be removed from the plaintiff\u2019s premises and on the next day, after service of a temporary injunction order on the defendant, the meter was again installed and the plaintiff has since had electric sex-vice. The materials and labor furnished for the repair of the refrigerator at the plairxtiff\u2019s request were necessax-y and it was ixi good ruxmirxg order whexx delivered to the plaintiff after it had been repaired by the defexidaxit. For such repairs the plaixxtiff is indebted to the defendant in the sum of $14.70. The decree states that the defendant is exrtitled to recover that sum from the plaintiff to pay for the aforementioned repairs. The decree also orders that the defendaxit is restrained and erxjoixied from discontinuixxg electric service at the premises of the plaixxtiff hi aid of collectixig the bill for repairs to the refrigerator so long as the plaintiff pays the bills xiow due or to become due for electric service furnished axid to be furnished to the plaintiff\u2019s premises in accordance with the statements and under the terms of the billings of the defendaxit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The case is here on exceptions by the defendant to the order in the decree granting the injunction restraining it from discontinuing electric sex-vice to the plaintiff\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">So far as here material, P. L. 6452 states: \u201cA person, association, company or cox-poratioxi exigaged ixi the business of generating in this state electric energy and distribxxting the same for general sale for heating, lighting or power purposes or for any other public use, if and when reqixested so to do', at all reasonable tixnes, shall sell and distribute the same to \u00e1xiy and all persons, . . . that desire to use the same withixi this state for either or any of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>purposes. . . . The charges made by a person, company or corporation for electric energy so sold and distributed shall be reasonable; . .</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">This statute makes it the duty of a public service company, as therein, designated, to sell electric power and light to any person within the territory served by it who wishes to purchase same. While the electric energy is to be sold to the customer, that is paid for by him, there is nothing in the statute directly or by implication that gives such public service corporation a right to refuse to furnish electric service to a customer in its territory because the customer is refusing to pay a bill for some collateral service such as repairing an electric refrigerator. Since the plaintiff was ready and willing to pay for the electric service demanded and had paid the defendant for all such service furnished at the time the defendant refused to furnish further service and removed the meter from the plaintiff\u2019s premises, such refusal and removal were without right or authority of law. That is, under the provisions of P. L. 6452 and other statutes relating to this matter, the defendant could not lawfully refuse to furnish electric service to the plaintiff because of the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to pay a bill for a collateral service. Such is the law in this state and also in other jurisdictions according to the great weight of authority. 20 CJ pp. 333, 334; Annotation in 55 ALR 771; 29 CJS pp. 540, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The defendant has cited several cases in support of its contention. However not one of them support the proposition for which it is here contending, viz., that a public service company may discontinue its service to a customer to force the collection of a bill for a collateral service and, as we have already seen from the wording of our statute P. L. 6452, such is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
