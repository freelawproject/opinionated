The stipulation provided for the entry of a possessory judgment in landlord\u2019s favor, with execution of the warrant of eviction stayed for a two-year probationary period. The stay was conditioned upon tenant\u2019s compliance with certain terms relating to the upkeep and cleanliness of his apartment. Paragraph 3 of the stipulation, upon which this appeal centers, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-21\">\u201cRespondent] shall not permit his dogs to defecate or urinate in the [apartment or common areas of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the building] and/or if same occurs shall promptly [and] properly clean so as to avoid issuance of any odor. If respondent] or any authorized individual is in [the apartment] said clean-up to be done immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The stipulation, which authorized landlord to execute on the warrant on five days\u2019 notice in the event that tenant breached its terms, further provided (at para 7) that a violation would not be \u201cdeemed de minimis,\u201d but would be treated with \u201czero tolerance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Following landlord\u2019s service of a notice of default in October 2006, a compliance hearing was held to determine whether tenant had breached the provisions of paragraph 3 of the stipulation. The testimonial and photographic evidence presented at the hearing demonstrated, and it is not now seriously disputed, that one of tenant\u2019s dogs, an Afghan hound, defecated on a hallway floor inside the apartment at some point on August 22, 2006 while tenant was present in the apartment preparing to embark on a Caribbean vacation, and that the dog feces remained on the hallway floor until at least September 13, 2006, the date tenant returned from vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Based upon these unrefuted facts, and giving proper effect to the \u201czero tolerance\u201d provisions agreed to by the parties upon advice of counsel, we find the conclusion inescapable that tenant substantially breached the stipulation\u2019s terms by failing to \u201cpromptly\u201d or \u201cproperly\u201d clean the dog feces, which, by all present accounts, remained on the floor of tenant\u2019s apartment for roughly three weeks. The stipulation, construed under settled contract principles <em>(see Hotel Cameron, Inc. v Purcell, </em>35 AD3d 153, 155 [2006]) according to the plain meaning of its terms <em>(see Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 569 [2002]), clearly required tenant to effectuate a proper clean-up \u201cimmediately\u201d upon the creation of the offending condition on August 22, 2006, at a time when tenant concededly was present in the apartment. In view of the acknowledged three-week delay, landlord was entitled to a possessory judgment, a remedy which represents not a forfeiture of the tenancy, but \u201cthe contracted-for consequence of . . . tenant[\u2019s] own failure to do that which [he] promised to do\u201d <em>(Hotel Cameron, Inc. v Purcell, </em>35 AD3d at 155-156, quoting <em>1029 Sixth v Riniv Corp., </em>9 AD3d 142, 150 [2004], <em>lv dismissed </em>4 NY3d 795 [2005]). The tenant\u2019s professed unawareness of the dog\u2019s mess \u2014 which, we note, was conspicuously deposited immediately outside tenant\u2019s bedroom \u2014 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>not provide a legal basis for tenant to avoid his clearly-stated obligations under the stipulation. In evaluating tenant\u2019s breach using the \u201czero tolerance\u201d standard formulated by the parties, it is not unreasonable to charge tenant with knowledge of what he ought to have discovered through the ordinary use of his senses.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">While the court, in limited circumstances, has discretion not to enforce a stipulation (see <em>Hotel Cameron, Inc. v Purcell, </em>35 AD3d at 156), this is not an appropriate case for the exercise of judicial forbearance. As our Appellate Division recently stated in parallel circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cThe stipulation was the product of negotiations between the attorneys for both parties, an agent of landlord, [and] tenant . . . , and permitted tenant to avoid adjudication of landlord\u2019s [undesirability] holdover petition and remain in possession of his apartment if tenant refrained from certain specified conduct for a two-year period. Given the circumstances under which the stipulation was executed and the provisions advantageous to tenant therein, equity would not be served by refusing to enforce the stipulation. Additionally, we would discourage landlords from resolving housing court matters through stipulations of settlement if we were not to enforce this stipulation.\u201d <em>{Purcell </em>at 156.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">McKeon, EJ., MgCooe and Davis, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
