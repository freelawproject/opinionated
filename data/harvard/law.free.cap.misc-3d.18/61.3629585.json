Here, the prosecution\u2019s evidence shows that defendant was operating the subject vehicle, was attempting to enter a public highway by backing the vehicle from a driveway, and was apparently delayed in doing so due to traffic conditions at the time. It took approximately one minute for defendant to undertake this maneuver, during which the sidewalk was obstructed and several vehicles swerved out of their lane of travel to avoid a collision. However, this evidence reflects that defendant was, at all times, operating or attempting to operate the vehicle. There is no evidence that defendant ever turned off the motor, left the driver\u2019s seat, or exited the vehicle. Accordingly, it cannot be said that defendant abandoned or left the subject vehicle within the meaning of section 13-63 (a). In view of the foregoing, defendant\u2019s guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt and the judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Rudolph, PJ., Tanenbaum and Scheinkman, JJ, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
