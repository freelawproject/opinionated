Tenant argues that, notwithstanding the expiration of the initial term of the lease, landlords were required to state in the notice, and to plead and prove, the existence of a good cause basis to terminate her Section 8 tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">The District Court properly ruled that when tenant remained in possession after the expiration of her lease on August 31, 2005 she did so as a month-to-month tenant <em>(see </em>Real Property Law \u00a7 232-c). While we agree with tenant that the terms of the Section 8 tenancy addendum carried over into the month-to-month tenancy, it is clear that the language in paragraph 8 (f) of the addendum, requiring that the owner give the tenant a notice that specifies the grounds for the termination, must be read in conjunction with that of paragraph 8 (b), which provides that good cause must be shown when a tenancy is terminated <em>\u201c[d]uring the term of the lease\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Indeed, following the 1998 amendment (Pub L 105-276, 112 US Stat 2461, 2607) to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>federal statute (42 USC \u00a7 1437f [d] [1] [B] [ii]), both the statute and the regulation which implements it (24 CFR 982.310 [a]) only require a showing of good cause to terminate when the termination occurs \u201c[djuring the term of the lease.\u201d As the federal regulations mandate that the tenancy addendum be included in the lease (see 24 CFR 982.305 [a] [3]), the addendum must be read to comport with these regulations and with the federal statute. Consequently, we hold that landlords could terminate the month-to-month tenancy merely by service of a notice pursuant to Real Property Law \u00a7 232-a and were not required to state in the notice, or allege and establish at trial, good cause for the termination. Accordingly, the final judgment awarding possession to landlords is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Rudolph, EJ., McCabe and Tanenbaum, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
