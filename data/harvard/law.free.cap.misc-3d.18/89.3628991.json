The factual portion of the information alleged, inter alia, that at the subway station at Grand Central terminal defendant approached and spoke with at least five persons; that defendant, in exchange for money, \u201c swipe [d] a Metrocard through the turnstile\u201d allowing one person entry into the subway system; and that police thereupon recovered from defendant\u2019s pants pocket three MetroCards that \u201cwere bent in a manner as to allow the holder of said cards to enter the subway system even though there [was] an insufficient fare on said cards to allow entry.\u201d These factual allegations, \u201cgiven a fair and not overly restrictive or technical reading\u201d <em>(People v Casey, </em>95 NY2d 354, 360 [2000]), are sufficient for pleading purposes to establish reasonable cause to believe and a prima facie case of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the third degree <em>(see People v Dixson, </em>9 Misc 3d 358, 366-367 [2005]; <em>People v Owens, </em>12 Misc 3d 600 [2006]). At the pleading stage, the sworn police allegation that the MetroCards found in defendant\u2019s possession were bent in a manner that would allow illegal entry into the subway system was \u201csufficiently evidentiary in character\u201d <em>(People v Allen, </em>92 NY2d 378, 385 [1998]) to establish prima facie that the MetroCards were \u201cfalsely alter[ed]\u201d so as to constitute \u201cforged instruments\u201d within the meaning of the forgery statute <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 170.00 [6], [7]; \u00a7 170.10 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The verdict convicting defendant of unlicensed general vending was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the weight of the evidence. There is no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s determinations concerning credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">McCooe, J.E, Schoenfeld and Heitler, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
