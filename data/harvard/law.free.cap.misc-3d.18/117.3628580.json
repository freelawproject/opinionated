The parties agreed that the eviction would be stayed for a period of two years and the possessory judgment thereafter vacated, provided, inter alia, that tenants \u201cnot contact DHPD, DHCR and/or any other agency or forum with respect to repairs and/or conditions in the [apartment] and/or the subject building.\u201d On or about April 25, 2005, less than two weeks prior to the expiration of the stipulation\u2019s probationary period, landlord moved to execute on the warrant, alleging, as relevant herein, that tenants \u201ccontacted Rita Wilson of the Davidson Senior Center to complain about Petitioner\u2019s alleged failure to serve Respondent^] with a renewal lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Even putting aside the public policy concerns raised by the stipulation\u2019s ban on tenant initiated complaints over \u201chousing repairs and/or conditions\u201d <em>(compare D\u2019Agostino v Forty-Three E. Equities Corp., </em>16 Misc 3d 59 [2007]), the conduct attributed to the long-term elderly tenants did not constitute a violation of the stipulation as written. Applying the principle of ejusdem generis (s<em>ee 242-44 E. 77th St., LLC v Greater N.Y. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>31 AD3d 100, 103-104 [2006]), we find that the senior citizen center here involved \u2014 so far as known, a private, community-based, eleemosynary organization \u2014 is not the type of \u201cagency or forum\u201d contemplated by the stipulation\u2019s terms, since it is not at all like the housing-related, governmental agencies listed in the stipulation. Moreover, tenants\u2019 conduct in voicing a complaint concerning the absence of a renewal lease \u2014 the sole violation cited by landlord in seeking tenants\u2019 eviction \u2014 did not relate to apartment-specific or building-wide \u201crepairs or condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tions\u201d within the meaning of the stipulation. To the extent that the hearing evidence went beyond the narrow allegations set forth in landlord\u2019s moving papers, it does not constitute a proper basis for eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Landlord\u2019s cross appeal, not having been briefed, is deemed abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">McKeon, EJ., Davis and Schoenfeld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">[Next page is 126]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
