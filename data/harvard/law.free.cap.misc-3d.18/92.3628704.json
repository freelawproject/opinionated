Although there was sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that a red visual signal was in operation at the time defendant passed the bus, the record is entirely devoid of proof that the school bus was in compliance with subdivision 20 of section 375 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, as is specifically required by the statute pursuant to which defendant was convicted. Particularly, and as pointed out by defendant at the close of the People\u2019s case, there was no proof that the vehicle bore the required signs, identifying it as a school bus, painted on the proper color background. Accordingly, the People have failed in their burden of proving each and every element of the offense charged (CPL 70.20; <em>People v Brown, </em>25 NY2d 374, 377).\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Similarly, in the case at bar,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">\u201c[a]lthough there was sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that a red visual signal was in operation at the time defendant passed the bus, the record is entirely devoid of proof that the school bus was in compliance with subdivision 20 of section 375 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, as is specifically required by the statute pursuant to which defendant was convicted\u201d <em>(People v Quarantillo, </em>61 NY2d at 993-994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The only evidence of the size of the bus was from defendant, who testified that it could transport less than six children. From the officer\u2019s questions on cross-examining defendant, one might speculate that the officer believed it was a larger school bus, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>he never testified to this effect. Similarly, only defendant offered clear statements as to the number of \u201cSCHOOL BUS\u201d signs displayed on the bus. He testified that there was only one such sign displayed and that the size of its lettering and its background (white) failed to conform to the requirements of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 375 (20). Under the circumstances, therefore, the judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Rudolph, EJ., Tanenbaum and Scheinkman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
