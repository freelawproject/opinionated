S. 947, 69 S. Ct. 1506. He was tried and convicted on a charge of burglary and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. In addition to the grounds discussed in the previous application, he now contends that the \u201cstatutory burglary laws of Maryland\u201d are so vague, ambiguous and uncertain as to be unconstitutional, and that the indictment was not in conformity with the statutes or common law. It is sufficient to state that such questions cannot be reviewed on <em>habeas corpus. Cf. Loughran v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>194 Md. 719, 64 A. 2d 712 and <em>Winegard v. Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary, </em>194 Md. 699, 69 A. 2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
