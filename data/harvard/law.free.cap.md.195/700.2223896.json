He complains: (1) That he is being kept in solitary confinement, and (2) that he is denied the right to attend church and thus of his right to worship God, by the arbitrary action of the warden. He prays: (1) That a writ of habeas corpus may issue; (2) that a writ of mandamus issue (apparently for the purpose of requiring the warden to permit him to attend church to exercise his right to worship God) and (3) that this court hear the matters raised in his petition and allow him the right to issue for witnesses in his behalf to appear and testify in this Court and permit him the right to appear and conduct his trial in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">If a prisoner serving a sentence in the Maryland Penitentiary is maltreated by the warden or other officials or employees of the institution, his remedy is to apply to the Board of Correction of the State, where his complaint will be heard, and if sustained, corrected. <em>Edmondson v.
