L. c. 148, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The facts do not appear to be in dispute. The plaintiff is chief of the fire department of the city of Boston. The defendant is the owner of the premises at 518, 520, and 524 Cambridge Street. The buildings on its premises have two inner courts neither of which is \u201cprotected by a roof which will support a load of 40 lbs. per square foot\u201d or has \u201ca substantial parapet or barrier at least 30 inches high. \u2019 \u2019 On June 13, 1962, the plaintiff served an order on the defendant \u201cto provide each of such inner courts with a substantial parapet or barrier at least 30 inches high on or before June 30,1962.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant did not comply with this order. There was an earlier proceeding \u201cin the criminal side of the . . . [Municipal Court of the] Brighton District\u201d against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the defendant for failure \u201cto install protection around inner courts on roof of premises numbered 518 to 524 Cambridge Street.\u201d The trial judge in that case found the defendant \u201cnot guilty.\u201d At the trial of the instant case the following interrogatory to the plaintiff and answer were introduced in evidence: Q: \u201cState fully and in complete detail how the barrier or parapet referred to in the bill of complaint will prevent or remedy any condition in or about the building in question which may tend to become a fire hazard or to cause a fire.\u201d A. \u201cThe barrier or parapet referred to in the bill of complaint will, in the event of fire, guard against the loss of a fire fighter\u2019s function through his falling down the inner courts mentioned in said Bill and promote efficiency in a fire fighter\u2019s performance of his function by relieving him from watching for such inner courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The pertinent \u201cfindings\u201d and \u201crulings\u201d of the trial judge are as follows: \u201c (1) That Buie 18 of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Fire Prevention Regulations of the Department of Public Safety of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a lawful rule, order or regulation within the meaning of General Laws, Chapter 148, section 30; (2) That the petitioner is the head of the Fire Department of the City of Boston and authorized to enforce said rule; (3) That the respondent is in violation of said rule in that it is the owner of premises ... in the City of Boston with an inner court that does not meet the requirements of said Rule 18 . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The defendant contends that there is no statutory authority for the regulation and that it is unconstitutional. In addition, it maintains that \u201c [t]he issue involved in this action has been determined by the decision of the Municipal Court of the Brighton District\u201d and that decision is, therefore, a bar to this suit. The statute under which Rule 18 was adopted is G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The defendant states in its brief: \u201cThe only object to be accomplished here is to prevent a fire fighter from falling into a courtyard in the event of fire. This was not contemplated by the legislature in the enactment of this statute.\u201d In essence it argues that a condition which impairs the efficiency and endangers the safety of fire fighters does not <em>\u2018' </em>tend to become a fire hazard or to cause a fire. \u2019 \u2019 Even without an analysis of the legislative history, it seems clear that a condition is a fire hazard which renders fire fighters less efficient or which, while they are fighting a fire, is likely to be the cause of a disruptive accident. It seems equally clear that such a condition might tend to \u201ccause a fire\u201d in the sense that it would increase the probability that an existing conflagration might spread to another structure or area.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">A review of other provisions of the statute and of the legislative history convinces us that the defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. The earlier version of this statute gave the Department of Public Safety the power to make rules \u201cfor the purpose of remedying any condition found to exist in or about any building <em>... in respect to fires, </em>the prevention of fire and fire hazard ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1930, c. 399, \u00a71.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The defendant cites several cases to support the proposition that a statute is to be construed in connection with the cause of its enactment, the preexisting state of the law, the mischief to be remedied, and the main object to be accomplished. Desm<em>arais </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. </em>331 Mass. 199, 202. <em>A. Belanger &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Joseph M. Concannon Corp. </em>333 Mass. 22, 25. But the defendant does not say what \u201cmischief\u201d in the old law the present statute (see St. 1945, c. 710, \u00a7 12, and later amendments) was intended to remedy. An examination of the applicable sections of the report of the special commission which recommended the adoption of the 1945 amendment satisfies us that it was not a purpose of the change to narrow the scope of the rule making powers. 1945 Senate Doc. No. 520, Appendix R. Further, we note the provisions of paragraphs A, B, and N of c. 148, \u00a7 28. Paragraph A, which has been in the statute or its predecessor from the beginning (St. 1914, c. 795, \u00a7 13), permits the making of regulations with respect to the keeping of fire extinguishing equipment. It seems clear from paragraph A that, within the limitations of this statute, the rules to be promulgated thereunder concern the control of conflagrations already started as well as their prevention. Paragraph B, substantially amended in 1945 (St. 1945, c. 710, \u00a7 12), permits the making of regulations regarding \u201cegress and escape from fire.\u201d Paragraph N, added in 1946 (St. 1946, c. 363, \u00a7 9), permits regulations to be made requiring <em>' \u2018 </em>compliance with section twenty-four of chapter one hundred and forty-three.\u201d (Chapter 143, \u00a7 24, of the General Laws also deals with keeping means of extinguishing fires.) Both of these provisions would be rendered meaningless if the statute was construed to deal only with fire prevention.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The defendant seems to question the constitutionality of Rule 18, presumably because it is an invasion of vested property rights. The Commonwealth has the power under its constitution to interfere with vested property rights in order to effect a reasonable protection of the public safety. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>338 Mass. 368, 375-376. <em>Mile Road </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Corp. v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 379. See also <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>12 Pick. 184,194.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The defendant asserts that its acquittal in prior criminal proceedings on the same allegations as are made in this equitable proceeding is a valid defence to the present suit. It cites <em>Wishnewsky </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>325 Mass. 191, 193-195, in support of its contention. The <em>Wishnewsky </em>case is not directly relevant, however, for the prior judgment pleaded therein was in a civil rather than a criminal action. It has been held in this Commonwealth that the acquittal of a person on a criminal charge is merely res inter alios in a subsequent civil proceeding embodying the same cause of action. <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>Child, </em>164 Mass. 210, 214. See <em>Minasian </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>295 Mass. 1, 3. This principle is predicated on the proposition that the plaintiff in the civil action was a stranger to the criminal proceedings and is still entitled to his \u201cday in court.\u201d Also, see <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>297 Mass. 217. Likewise, we construed the words of a zoning by-law to permit the plaintiff to bring suit to enjoin violation of the by-law after a criminal complaint on a charge of a similar violation had resulted in the defendant\u2019s acquittal. <em>Building Commr. of Brookline </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>263 Mass. 270, 273-274. Under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 30, equitable enforcement is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">There are also other considerations. We note that there is no requirement in the statute that the criminal prosecution be instituted on the complaint of a fire officer. Thus, in a sense, the head of the fire department is as much a \u201cstranger\u201d to the criminal action as a private citizen would be. Furthermore, generally the degree of proof required to secure a conviction in a criminal case is higher than that required to obtain a favorable result in a civil proceeding. <em>Roberge </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>124 Mass. 277, 278. In addition, conviction under the statute is also contingent on the requirement that the accused have been given notice of the violation. Finally, we observe that the language of \u00a7 30 permitting equitable enforcement of the board\u2019s rules was added in 1945. (St. 1945, c. 710, \u00a7 13.) It was added upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the recommendation of a special commission appointed after the tragic Cocoanut Grove fire of 1942 (1943 Senate Res. No. 67) to investigate and recommend changes in the fire laws. 1945 Senate Doc. No. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The regulation in issue was reasonable and designed to avoid a fire hazard by increasing the efficiency of firemen, and by protecting their safety as well as the safety of the public. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> \"To: Sutherland Apartments, Ine.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">209 Washington Street Boston 8 Massachusetts</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">A rule of the Board of Fire Prevention Regulations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts prescribes that \u2018Any inner court not protected by a roof which will support a load of 40 lbs. per square foot shall have a substantial parapet or barrier at least 30 inches high.\u2019 (See FPR #9 of October 26, I960-\u2014 Rule 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">The buildings owned by you at 518, 520 and 524 Cambridge Street in the Brighton district of Boston have two such inner courts neither of which has a substantial parapet or barrier at least 30 inches high.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">Pursuant to Gr.
