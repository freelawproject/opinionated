L. c. 94, \u00a7 187, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>through St. 1948, c. 598, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Instantblend, a vegetable product resembling cream and served and used with coffee at public, or employer maintained, eating places.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The plaintiffs are Aeration Processes, Inc. (Aeration), an Ohio corporation which owns the formula of Instant-blend, and Instantwhip-Boston, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, which as a licensee of Aeration manufactures and sells Instantblend within the Commonwealth. Aeration \u201cpurchase[s] and . . . [has] prepared certain dry mixtures that the Instant Whip Companies use in manufacturing their products.\u201d The defendants are the Commissioner of Public Health, the Director of the Division of Food and Drugs, and the Attorney General. No one has contended that any defendant is not a proper or necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Section 187 of c. 94<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> declares food misbranded if \u201cin imitation or semblance of any other food\u201d unless, in certain cases, labeled as such an imitation. But it does not permit the imitation, even with labeling, \u2018 \u2018 of any food for which a standard has been established by law, other than as specifically provided herein. <em>\u2019 </em>\u2019 The words <em>'\u2018 </em>specifically provided herein\u201d must refer to all of c. 94, rather than merely to \u00a7 187, as that section makes no provision allowing the imitation of a food for which there is a statutory standard. There are in c. 94 some sections that allow the imitation of foods for which standards are set by statute provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>labeling requirements more specific than those of \u00a7 187 are met. See \u00a7\u00a7 49, 54, oleomargarine; \u00a7 50, \u201cimitation cheese\u201d; \u00a7 1, definitions of butter and cheese.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Statutory standards for cream and ungraded cream are established by G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended through St. 1955, c. 757, \u00a7 2. Chapter 94 contains no provision that permits the imitation of cream by combining nonmilk constituents. Section 17A prohibits the manufacture, sale or possession for sale, of milk, cream or skimmed milk to which any fat or oil other than milk fat has been added \u201cso that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk, cream or skimmed milk . . .. \u201d The addition of milk fat to such products is, however, not prohibited by \u00a7 17A provided the product is not sold as pure milk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Hence, if Instantblend is an \u201cimitation\u201d of cream it is misbranded however labeled or sold and is subject to an embargo under c. 94, \u00a7 189A; also, whoever delivers or offers to deliver such a misbranded product is subject to the criminal penalty provided in c. 94, \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The final decree, from which the defendants have appealed, ruled inter alla that Gr. L. c. 94, <em>\u00a7 </em>187, is constitutional; Instantblend is not an imitation milk product; the application of \u00a7 187 to Instantblend would be unconstitutional. It enjoined the defendants from prosecuting anyone for distributing, marketing or selling Instantblend or interfering with its distribution, use or sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">There are findings and rulings; the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The testimony of a vice-president of Aeration shows that Aeration, in the course of licensing the sale of two other nondairy products \u2014 Instantwhip and Instantwhip Top<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ping \u2014 noticed the sale by competitors of certain \u201cvegetable fat coloring agents,\u201d and thereupon, in order to maintain its share of the market, developed Instantblend. It was designed as a product that \u201cwould color coffee so it would give a commodity a pleasing appetizing appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Instantblend is a pasteurized blend of water, hydrogenated vegetable oils, dextrose, sucrose, enzyme modified casein, mono and di glycerides, protein stabilizers, salt, and artificial color and flavor. The vice-president\u2019s testimony also shows that he with two others associated with Aeration did the work in developing Instantblend and that in his view the color of Instantblend is very close to that of cream; it pours like cream and in coffee the average person cannot tell from the taste whether it is cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Other testimony shows that, closely observed, Instant-blend is somewhat different from cream. In color it is white as against the yellow tinge of cream, and it differs somewhat in taste when not in coffee, being sweeter and having perhaps a chalky taste. Its viscosity is less than that of cream, and more like that of milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Instantblend has certain advantages; it does not feather (or separate so that its fat content rises) when added to coffee at a high temperature as cream sometimes does; it does not spoil as quickly as cream. In coffee dispensing machines it does not clog the separate chute through which it flows, in contrast to cream, which tends to do so because of its calcium content. Some attributes, such as the absence of butter fat, may be thought by some consumers to be an advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The Director of the Division of Food and Drugs testified that Instantblend is \u201cnutritional,\u201d though of different nutritional value from cream, and the defendants, by counsel, in effect so conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The evidence shows that Instantblend is sold, sometimes through distributors, for use in restaurants or at lunch counters or in \u201cvending machines . . . placed in various locations\u201d in factories. The defendants do not contend that the label on the bulk package in which Instantblend is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sold does not fully disclose its composition; the judge, having a package before him as an exhibit, found that it is truthfully labeled with a full disclosure of its ingredients.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The plaintiff Instantwhip-Boston, Inc., with the sale of Instantblend, provides signs for posting in the retailers\u2019 premises to be put on the dispenser. These signs in varying sizes of type read, \u201cEspecially for You! For a Delicious Coffee We Use Instantblend A Non-Dairy Product.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">There was evidence that when an inspector from the Division of Food and Drugs, at a lunch counter, ordered a cup of coffee with cream on the side he was served black coffee and a one ounce glass container of a white liquid (later identified by the manager as Instantblend) taken from a dispensing device or \u201ccreamer.\u201d He saw no sign on the creamer and was sure that there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The evidence thus supports the judge\u2019s findings that Instantblend \u201chas some distinctive appearance and texture,\u201d that the plaintiffs do not intend to offer it as milk or cream, that it is truthfully labeled and is a nutritious, distinctive food product of Aeration\u2019s own research and invention. The judge\u2019s conclusion, however, that although Instantblend \u201cmay have some appearance of cream,\u201d it is not a substitute, nor is it an imitation under Gr. L. c. 94, \u00a7 187, is not justified. The plaintiffs, in effect, themselves assert that Instantblend is a substitute for cream; the reasons for our ruling that this intended substitute is an imitation of cream are next stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">1. <em>Instantblend is an imitation of cream within the meaning of G. L. c. 94, </em>\u00a7 <em>187.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The statute is designed to avoid confusion of other products with defined and familiar foods. Section 187, read with \u00a7 12, reflects the policy that the public shall not be exposed to the risk of mistaking for cream, milk or skimmed milk something that is not that product as defined by the statute. See <em>Carolene Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>323 U. S. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The meaning of \u201cimitation\u201d is not limited to a substance inferior to the product which it resembles. There is no suggestion of such a limitation in those provisions of \u00a7 187 which define \u201cmisbranded\u201d to include the \u201cimitation\u201d of a food. Compare the wording of paragraphs Fifth and Sixth of \u00a7 187 (food) under which inferiority may be an element. Compare also Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \u00a7 402 (b) (4), 52 Stat. 1046-1047 (1938), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 342 (b) (4) (1958); <em>United States </em>v. <em>88 Cases, More or Less, Containing Bireley\u2019s Orange Beverage, </em>187 F. 2d 967, 972 (3d Cir.), cert. den. 342 U. S. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Intent to pass off, impose or defraud is not required as a test of an imitation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>651 Cases, More or Less, of Chocolate Chil-Zert, </em>114 F. Supp. 430, 433 (N. D. N. Y.), and cases cited. Compare G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 187 (misbranding of food), \u201cSeventh, if the package containing it or its label bears any statement, design or device regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein which is false or misleading in any particular. \u2019 \u2019 The <em>Chil-Zert </em>case, <em>supra, </em>holds that a product resembling ice cream made with soy fat and soy protein and labeled \u201cnot an ice cream\u201d is an imitation and is misbranded under \u00a7 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1047-1048 (1938), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 343 (1958). This, because the statute itself in specifically providing the mode of labeling which will prevent the product from being characterized as misbranded precludes consideration of the truthfulness of nonstatutory labeling. Section 187 of our statute likewise has a specific labeling provision in all cases save where the food is one for which there is a statutory standard. In our opinion this provision precludes consideration of the veracity or effect of food product labeling in determining whether the product is an imitation. The word \u201cimitation\u201d has the same meaning throughout paragraph First of \u00a7 187 (food). Its meaning is the same where the food imitated is one for which a standard is set by statute (and, which therefore, may not be imitated even with a label) as for a food for which there is no such statutory standard and which may be imitated if labeled as the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The plaintiffs rely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>New England Maple Syrup Co. </em>217 Mass. 432, 434. The issue there was under R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 18, cl. 4, which declared food adulterated if \u201cin imitation of or . . . sold under the name of another article.\u201d Although the court held that there was another basis for finding adulteration, it said that likeness in color and consistency between maple syrup and a syrup made by compounding maple sugar, water and granulated cane sugar (which the agreed facts showed contained no artificial coloring) was not enough to classify the latter syrup as an imitation; \u201cnothing in the labels . . . or upon the cork . . . [was] calculated to show any attempt at such imitation . . ..\u201d This statement might be taken as averring that an intent to mislead by mislabeling was necessary before a product could be characterized as an imitation under that statute. However, R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 18, forbade the sale of imitation foods and did not provide an exception for foods labeled as imitations such as is found in the present statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, while a misleading label might appropriately be a condition of holding that a product was an imitation under the old.statute involved in the <em>New England Maple Syrup </em>case, supra, that case is not authority for making such a label a condition of holding that a product is an imitation under the present statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The plaintiffs further contend, however, that intention to imitate is a part of the statutory test and that Aeration\u2019s intent was not to imitate but to create a new and superior product. The short answer to this is that the mental state of a food processor or food manufacturer bears no necessary relation to whether an average consumer would confuse a product with a defined or established food. In this respect our statute resembles the Federal Filled Milk Act, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 61-64 (1958), which has been, held to apply to products \u201cin imitation or resemblance of milk\u201d even though the imitation or resemblance results from ingredients used and is not the result of conscious effort. <em>Caro-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>lene Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>323 U. S. 18, 25. Compare, as to oleomargarine under a State statute, <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton, </em>210 N. Y. 1,4, 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Even if the issue were relevant, we think it inescapable that Aeration had an intent to make, as it did make, a product which would closely resemble cream when used for the purpose for which it was developed and sold. The intent was to make a product which in appearance, and in taste in coffee, would be fully acceptable to persons accustomed to taking cream in coffee. It is necessarily inferable that the addition of artificial color and flavor served that purpose and result. This intent to make the product resemble cream, and be substantially indistinguishable from it when used for its intended purpose, was in no wise inconsistent with the intent to make a new, distinctive product and in some respects, at least, a product more acceptable to those who serve it or consume it.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The plaintiffs cite <em>Midget Prods. Inc. </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>140 Cal. App. 2d 517, and <em>Aeration Processes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>184 Cal. App. 2d 836. So far as these cases under a different statute are in point we do not find them persuasive. In the <em>Midget </em>case the court ruled that the evidence sustained the finding below, that a topping used by bakers and others on pies, cakes, and other foods was not an imitation of a milk product which must be labeled in compliance with the statute and that to require labeling would be unconstitutional. The court distinguished the <em>Chil-Zert </em>case, 114 F. Supp. 430, <em>supra, </em>only on the ground that the Federal court had found that the ice cream substitute was an imitation. In the <em>Aeration </em>case, the California court ruled that the evidence of differentiation from whipping and whipped cream supported the finding that Instantwhip Topping was not an imitation milk product.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We hold that Instantblend is an imitation within \u00a7 187 because (1) it resembles cream but does not conform to the statutory standards therefor, (2) apart from information supplied by labeling, there is a likelihood that an average consumer, aware of Instantblend\u2019s intended use, will con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fuse it with cream, and (3) there is no showing that Instant-blend and cream are so differentiated in the mind of the average consumer interested in the distinction that, by making reasonable effort, he would discover with which product he is confronted. That many attributes of Instant-blend differentiate it from cream does not take it out of the statutory category of an imitation. The significant properties are those which, being apparent, may cause it to be mistaken, or accepted, for cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">2. <em>There is no showing that G. L. c. 94, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>187,189A, and 191, would be unconstitutionally applied to the sale and distribution of Instantblend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution does not bar State action prohibiting the sale of an admittedly nutritious product as a measure within the police power aimed at avoiding consumer confusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Hebe Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>248 U. S. 297, 303-304; <em>Sage Stores Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas ex rel. Mitchell, </em>323 U. S. 32, 35-36. Cf. <em>Carolene Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>323 U. S. 18, 27-32. This record does not raise the issue whether such prohibition may be imposed under the State Constitution notwithstanding a showing that substantial confusion could not result because the product was distinctively labeled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>156 Mass. 236, 241-242, affd. sub nom. <em>Plumley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>155 U. S. 461. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>A. J. Bayless Mkts. Inc. </em>86 Ariz. 193, and cases cited; <em>Coffee-Rich Inc. </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>CCH Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law Rep. par. 40,047. The evidence shows only that Instantblend is distributed for use at public or employer maintained eating places. The labeling on the bulk package is, of course, inconsequential in respect of such use. The evidence shows that as presently distributed there is a substantial risk that Instantblend will he confused with cream. The supplying of signs for use on dispensers in eating establishments, which may not be used, or if used may not be seen, is not an adequate means of informing the consumer what he is consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The facts do not require us to consider whether the statute would be unconstitutional in application if relied on to bar distribution in retail stores, or elsewhere, in such a way that consumers would be informed as to the nature of the product sold or served and there would be no reasonable possibility of their mistaking it for cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">3. The final decree is reversed. A decree is to enter in the Superior Court declaring that Instantblend is an imitation of cream within the meaning of the word \u201cimitation\u201d in G-. L. c. 94, \u00a7 187, and that the statute is not unconstitutional in its application to the methods used for distributing and dispensing Instantblend as described in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\"> Subsequent amendments of \u00a7 187 have not changed the paragraph herein construed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> General Laws, c. 94, \u00a7 187, as amended through St. 1948, e. 598, \u00a7 2, provides, in part: \u201cFor the purposes of said sections an article shall also be deemed to be misbranded: \u2014. . .
