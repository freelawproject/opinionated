[Marguerite Brown who owned] the property, prior to the purchase by the . . . [defendant in November, 1956] testified, and the Court finds, that any use made of the right of way by the . . . [plaintiff] or other users was only by license of the true owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The plaintiff points out that the acquisition of a prescriptive right of way shared with others does not require the \u201cexclusion . . . of everyone else.\u201d But the words \u201cexclusive use\u201d are sometimes used in connection with the acquisition of rights of way to suggest the exclusion of the owner\u2019s dominion to the extent of the adverse use (see <em>Kilburn </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>7 Met. 33, 39), and we think the judge did not intend to rule that the plaintiff could not acquire a right of way while others in the neighborhood were also doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Mrs. Brown\u2019s testimony in respect of permissive use did not relate to use in a period prior to her ownership (1945-1953) and we agree with the plaintiff that it did not tend to show the character of such use. Compare <em>Truc </em>v. <em>Field, </em>269 Mass. 524, 530. Further, except for a generality that the use was \u201c [w]ith my permission\u201d her testimony was at least as consistent with recognition of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of right, and contest of it, as with a license. She testified that when the plaintiff complained of the state of the way she told him it was private property which he was using at his own risk; she posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs every spring and fall beginning in 1946 which were \u201calways removed promptly.\u201d Compare G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 3 (\u201cposted . . . for . . . six successive days\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The plaintiff does not, however, show error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that he had not sustained the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The uncontroverted testimony shows the use of the path and steps by the plaintiff and his family (and about thirty-five people in the neighborhood) from 1944 to 1957. It also shows use of the way and steps by occupants of the houses in the neighborhood (\u201call the surrounding people that had cottages\u201d;\u201ceverybody . . . used it\u201d; \u201cmany children, particularly, and their parents\u201d) from about 1909 or 1910 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to 1957, and that the plaintiff\u2019s house, across Sagamore Eoad from the defendant\u2019s lot, was built in 1914. There is no evidence of use by the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title. The evidence showed that there were no housed on the defendant\u2019s lot and on the lots adjacent to it until about twenty years prior to the hearings in 1962. It did not appear who built the steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The failure to show specific use with a claim of right by the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title justified the judge\u2019s finding and ruling. For private easement it is required that the plaintiff prove \u201copen, uninterrupted and adverse [use] for a period of not less than twenty years\u201d <em>(Tucker </em>v. Poch, 321 Mass. 321, 323) by the claimant and his predecessors in title. <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Zecchini, </em>342 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief refers to use by <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>the public at large \u2019 \u2019 but the case presented by the pleadings and the only issue which we think can be said to have been fully tried was whether there was a private easement appurtenant to the plaintiff\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>Final decree dismissing the hill affirmed with costs of the appeal 'to the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
