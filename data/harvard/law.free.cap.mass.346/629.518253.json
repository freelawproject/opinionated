Maloof (Maloof), which Modin alleges were transferred to Maloof by Hanron in furtherance of a conspiracy to hinder, delay, and defraud Modin as a creditor of Hanron. Emil G. Maloof, Jeanne \u00d1aman, and Alfred \u00d1aman (the executors) are executors of Maloof\u2019s will and are alleged to have certain of Hanron\u2019s assets in their hands. The bill prays that Hanron\u2019s debt be established, that the transfer be set aside, and that the transferred funds be applied to the indebtedness. The bill was dismissed by final decree. Modin appealed. The facts are stated upon the basis of the trial judge\u2019s report of material facts. .</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">In February, 1956, Modin gave a deed of certain real estate to Hanron, in return for Hanron\u2019s check for $2,800 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>drawn on the State Street Trust Company (State Street) to Modin\u2019s order. \u201cHanron issued a stop payment order . . . and the check was not paid. ... In March, 1956, Hanron\u2019s sole assets consisted of her checking account balance . . . $3,000.\u201d Acting upon the advice of. \u201ca third person to draw her money out of State Street and to place it beyond the reach of Modin,\u201d Hanron did withdraw her money \u201cand transferred it to Maloof for safekeeping until the Modin matter was concluded. Both Hanron and Maloof knew the full details of the Modin controversy\u201d and that Hanron had no other assets. \u201cBoth knew and understood the sole purpose of the transfer . . . was to place the funds beyond the reach of . . . creditors, especially Modin. Both anticipated litigation by Modin against Hanron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In April, 1956, Modin brought an action against Hanron. A trustee writ was served on State Street, which answered funds to the extent of $13. Modin recovered judgment on August 11, 1958, and execution was issued on August 15, 1958, on which there is a balance unsatisfied of $2,466.88. In July, 1958, before the law action went to judgment, Ma-loof returned the $3,000 to Hanron, leaving no funds of hers in his possession or control.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The present bill in equity was entered on December 8, 1959, when \u201cthe executors did not have any assets of Han-ron in their hands and possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">1. The bill, viewed merely as a bill to reach and apply, was properly dismissed for, when the suit was commenced, the executors had no funds of Hanron in their possession and the relief sought was no longer possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">2. Modin filed no motion to amend the bill prior to the final decree to seek any different type of relief or to attempt to impose direct liability upon Maloof or his estate as an alleged active participant in a scheme of fraudulent conveyance. Nevertheless, Modin\u2019s contentions in this court have been based upon the theory that Maloof so participated in a scheme to hinder and defraud Modin that Ms executors must be barred in equity from showing that he returned the $3,000 to Hanron.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>We assume that the transfer to Maloof could have been set aside while it remained in effect as a conveyance made with actual intent to defraud Modin. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 109A, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>7, </em>9, 10; <em>David </em>v. <em>Zilah, </em>325 Mass. 252, 256; <em>Virta </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>343 Mass. 286, 290-291. See also <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hamel, </em>337 Mass. 105, 111-112. Before this bill was brought, however, and before Modin\u2019s claim was reduced to judgment, the property transferred by Hanron to Maloof was returned. Ho creditor of Maloof has been shown thereby to have been injured. Maloof\u2019s action in returning the money to Hanron was not prohibited by any \u201crule of law or equity.\u201d <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev. </em>87 F. 2d 275, 276-277 (6th Cir.). See <em>Springfield Homestead Assn. </em>v. <em>Roll, 137 </em>Ill. 205, 212-213; <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>232 Iowa, 1220, 1223-1224; <em>Insurance Co. of Tenn. </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>116 Tenn. 1, 18-19; Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances (1940 ed.) \u00a7 57; Annotations, 89 A. L. R. 1166, 1168; 108 A. L. R. 1508. Various Massachusetts cases are consistent with this view. See <em>Rayner </em>v. <em>Whicher, </em>6 Allen, 292, 295. See also <em>Hyland </em>v. <em>Hyland, </em>278 Mass. 112,120; <em>O\u2019Gasapian </em>v. <em>Danielson, </em>284 Mass. 27, 3A-35. In <em>David </em>v. <em>Zilah, </em>325 Mass. 252, 256, this court held that it was error to impose personal liability (above the value of the transferred property in their hands) upon two transferees of property fraudulently conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Modin relied principally on <em>Manufacturers Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Simon Mfg. Co. </em>233 Mass. 85, 90, and <em>Massachusetts Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Simon Mfg. Co. </em>237 Mass. 92, 96. In these cases, transferees of property conveyed with the actual intent to defraud certain creditors of the transferor were held not entitled, in suits in equity by such creditors, to show that the transferees, respectively, had used some of the transferred funds to pay other creditors of the transferor. In these cases, and in <em>R. E. McDonald Co. </em>v. <em>Finkovitch, </em>270 Mass. 362, 366-367, however, there was substantially more active participation by the transferees (compared with the bare custodianship undertaken by Maloof) in the fraudulent scheme and there was no voluntary reconveyance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>property to the original grantor. Maloof\u2019s executors are not barred in equity from showing his voluntary reconveyance of the $3,000 to Hanron.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><em>Decree affirmed with costs. </em>.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
