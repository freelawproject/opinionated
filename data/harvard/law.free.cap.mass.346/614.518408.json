The defendant declared in set-off to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u2014 in count 1 for the value of goods delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor subject to the defendant\u2019s order and not returned, and in count 2 for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The case was heard in the Superior Court on the facts set out in a report of an auditor whose findings were not to be final. It was stipulated, however, that the facts set forth in the report were \u201cthe sole and only facts to be considered\u201d by the judge, \u201cthe said facts being agreed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The agreement as to the facts presented a case stated. <em>Quintin Vespa Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co. </em>343 Mass. 547, 551-552. It is our duty to order the correct judgment on the auditor\u2019s report. <em>Ibid. </em>We may draw inferences. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 126. The facts, however, are inadequate for a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The facts shown by the auditor\u2019s scanty report are these: Watuppa Finishing Corp. (Watuppa) was engaged in the dyeing and finishing business in Fall Eiver and was adjudicated a bankrupt in July of 1959: The defendant (Browdy) from time to time delivered goods to Watuppa for dyeing and finishing. \u201cWatuppa had an arrangement with the bank under which the bank advanced money from time to time and took assignments of accounts receivable as security and notified Browdy of the assignment in each instance before payment, and payment was made by Browdy to the bank in each instance, excepting the unpaid accounts \u2019 \u2019 in litigation. These are the accounts outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy in the amount of $9,496.16 assigned as security for advances of $7,596.93. The accounts represent work done on goods delivered to Watuppa between February 6, 1959, and June 6, 1959. These accounts were assigned to the bank on various days from June 12 through June 26, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The auditor found that Watuppa had received from Browdy 89,199 yards of goods valued at $42,393.10, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>these goods had not been returned, and that \u201cWatuppa owes Browdy at least $7,596.93 . . ..\u201d The financing statements required by Gr. L. e. 106, \u00a7 9-302 (1), were duly executed and filed October 8, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The case is governed by 0. L. e. 106, \u00a7 9-318 (1). Browdy contends that it is to be inferred that the $42,393.10 represents the goods delivered to Watuppa between February 6, 1959, and June 6, 1959. If this were so and the missing goods were processed under the contracts which gave rise to the assigned accounts, it would make no difference when the plaintiff gave Browdy notice of the assignment. The rights of the assignee would be subject to any defence or claim arising from the terms of the bailment contract between the assignor and the account debtor regardless of notice. Gr. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-318 (1) (a). However, the auditor\u2019s report does not show whether the missing goods were processed under the contracts which gave rise to the assigned accounts. The facts stated are insufficient satisfactorily to support an inference and we may not speculate.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">If the goods now missing were other than those on which the accounts arose, Gr. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-318 (1) (b), would be applicable and whether the bank\u2019s rights would be subject to Browdy\u2019s claim would hinge on whether Browdy\u2019s claim accrued before it received notice of the assignments. The auditor\u2019s report does not show when notice of the various assignments was sent or received nor does it show when the claim of the defendant accrued. The facts do not show, as the defendant contends, that its claim accrued at the time the goods were delivered to the assignor. The record fails to show whether the claim arose because the goods were destroyed as a result of the assignor\u2019s negligence (compare Ro<em>urke </em>v. <em>Cadillac Auto Co. </em>268 Mass. 7), or because the assignor intentionally departed from the terms of the bailment by an act inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s ownership (compare <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>133 Mass. 270, 274-275), or because there was a contractual extension of the bailee\u2019s common law liability by an unconditional promise to return the goods (compare <em>Amiro </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>256 Mass. 53, 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The stipulation that the facts of the auditor\u2019s report are the \u201csole and only facts\u201d is discharged as not conducive to justice. <em>Symmes Arlington Hosp. Inc. </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>292 Mass. 162,165. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>318 Mass. 179, 182-183. The waiver by the case stated of questions of pleading <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>338 Mass. 704, 711) is, however, not discharged. The parties have not attempted to present any such question (as, for example, the propriety of raising the defendant\u2019s claim by set-off) and the case should now be resolved on substantive issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The order for judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a determination of the necessary facts either on a recommittal or a new reference or by the court as it shall determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
