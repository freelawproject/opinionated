L. c. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 5C, 5D, both in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>serted by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 3) has purported to issue a permit to one Medeiros pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 29A, and 31 (see amendments by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, and 7). The selectmen\u2019s principal contention is that the board issued the permit in violation of the town\u2019s zoning by-law as amended<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also of a \u201cprotective regulation\u201d concerning so called \u201coff premises\u201d signs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This \u201cprotective regulation\u201d is not shown to have been approved by the Attorney General, under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32 (as amended through St. 1952, c. 337). It also was alleged that the board issued the permit \u201cwithout notice to\u201d the selectmen \u201cor hearing of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The prayers of the bill ask that the board be ordered not to issue a permit for the sign in violation of the Truro bylaw and that Medeiros be ordered to remove the sign. They also seek a declaration that the board has no authority to issue permits in conflict with the Truro by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The evidence is meager. The chairman of the selectmen testified that the selectmen on August 17,1960, had refused</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to give Medeiros an \u201coff premise\u201d sign permit for the sign, which is seven feet by three feet three inches (and thus larger than even the eighteen square feet signs permitted by the zoning by-law [fn. 1, <em>supra] </em>in general business districts) . Counsel stated that, apart from certain definitions, \u00a7 V (limited business district) and \u00a7 IV-A (9) of the zoning by-law were the relevant sections. This statement suggests that the sign was in a limited business district, but there is no direct testimony to that effect. A photograph of the sign and its immediate surroundings is the only proof of the general character of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The chairman of the selectmen stated that he had received notice from the board that Medeiros had applied for a permit and that \u201c [w]e turned it back to them putting a note on the bottom that we had disapproved it\u201d because not \u201cin the best interests of the town.\u201d He never made demand on the board for an opportunity to be heard. The rules and regulations of the board were in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The trial judge justifiably found on this evidence that the board gave notice to the selectmen of Medeiros\u2019s application and that the selectmen \u201cdid not file any written objections to the allowance of that application, nor request an opportunity to be heard at the hearing.\u201d He also justifiably found that, when the selectmen learned that a permit had been granted on August 23, 1960, they \u201cdid not appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>from the decision of the . . . [bjoard.\u201d The judge concluded that the board granted the permit in the absence of written objections or a request for hearing from the selectmen and that, as the selectmen \u2018 \u2018 offered no evidence tending to show that the . . . [b] card did not comply with the procedural requirements of notice and hearing ... it is to be presumed that the . . . [b] card acted legally and in good faith.\u201d A final decree was entered declaring that board\u2019s approval of the permit was a valid exercise of the board\u2019s statutory authority and that the selectmen are not entitled to the equitable remedies sought. The selectmen appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">1. Billboard and sign regulation now takes place under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33 (as amended by St. 1955, c. 584<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>). Section 29 gives the board authority to \u201cmake, amend or repeal . . . regulations for the proper control and restriction of . . . signs ... on public ways. \u2019 \u2019 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The last sentence of \u00a7 29 (see fn. 5) gives to towns the right further to restrict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>signs within their limits. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>306 Mass. 451, 458. We assume (without deciding) that the power, created by the last sentence of \u00a7 29, to pass such a by-law may be exercised by including an apt provision in a zoning by-law as well as by a wholly separate by-law. Cf. <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Falmouth </em>v. <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. Inc. </em>264 Mass. 85, 88-89, holding that an amendment of the then existing zoning enabling act to permit the regulation of \u201cstructures\u201d did not supersede the then existing provisions of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29. Cf. also <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 196-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">2. The selectmen have not pursued their administrative remedies before the board, nor have they sought review under Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), from the board\u2019s action granting the permit. Such a proceeding would have brought before us the evidence- and record before the board, and would have permitted review of whether the board\u2019s decision involved error of law and whether it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Instead, the selectmen have sought equitable relief, in part under G. L. c. 231A, and in part, apparently, under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 7) which gives to this court and to the Superior Court \u201cjurisdiction in equity upon petition of the attorney general, of any . . . town or any officer thereof, or of any interested party, to restrain the . . . maintenance of any . . . sign . . . maintained in violation of any . . . regulation, adopted by the board . . . and to order the removal . . . of such . . . sign ... as a nuisance.\u201d In <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>306 Mass. 451, under an earlier form of \u00a7 31, which also provided similar jurisdiction with respect to signs maintained in violation of town by-laws, this court ordered the removal of a sign so maintained. Section 31 thereafter was revised by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 7, to exclude the reference to by-law violations, although without explanation of the reasons for the change. See 1955 House Bills Nos. 750, 1478, 1734, 2557. The change indicates that review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>board\u2019s action should take place under c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), and that affirmative equitable relief for violation of a town bylaw concerning signs cannot now be obtained under \u00a7 31, as amended. In view of the 1955 amendment of \u00a7 31, we think that CL L. c. 40A, \u00a7 22, should not be applied to enforce the zoning by-law with respect to a sign maintained under an outstanding permit from the board, at least until the enforcing officials\u2019 administrative remedies and remedies under c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), have been adequately pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">3. We next consider whether declaratory relief alone should be granted. Although c. 231A, \u00a7 8, provides that declaratory relief is to be broadly construed and administered, c. 231A, \u00a7, 3, permits a court to refuse to grant such relief where it would not terminate the controversy (as in <em>Harvey Payne, Inc. </em>v. <em>Slate Co. </em>342 Mass. 368, 370, where all appropriate parties were not before the court) or for other sufficient reasons. Certain such reasons exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">(a) The failure of the selectmen to present to the board their objections to the permit and to seek review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), requires caution in granting declaratory relief, without having before us all the evidence that should have been before the board (in addition to any that the applicant may have submitted). If the selectmen had presented a complete case to the board, the board\u2019s action with respect to the permit might have been different.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">(b) The selectmen have not presented to the Superior Court evidence concerning important matters necessary to intelligent declaratory relief. Except by vague implication they have not shown in what zoning district the sign in controversy is placed. Apart from one photograph there is no evidence concerning the character of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">(e) If the sign is, as we suspect, in a limited business district (in which only certain tourist accommodations are allowed in addition to uses permitted in a residential dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>trict, see fn. 1), evidence of the character of the'neighborhood may be pertinent in determining whether there is in fact any conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 IV-A (9) and V of the by-law, on the one hand, and \u00a7 4A of the regulations, on the other hand. This evidence also might be appropriate in determining whether the board had or could have had substantial evidence before it to justify it in determining (in accordance with a fair application of the standard contained in \u00a7 4A) that the sign was in a \u201cbusiness area.\u201d See <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 192-193, 196-198. Some evidence also might be appropriate with respect to the background of \u00a7 6E of the board\u2019s regulations, which purports to reserve to the board the determination of the size of signs in particular instances. Whether this regulation contains a standard for the board\u2019s action, \u201csufficiently definite in description\u201d (see the <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. Inc. </em>case, at p. 192), may be pertinent in determining whether the regulation is valid as to this sign which is not a billboard (see fn. 3), and thus whether there is any real conflict between the by-law and \u00a7 6E. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>306 Mass. 451, 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">For these reasons and because a declaration will deal with issues which should not be decided upon an inadequate record, we think that declaratory relief should be denied as matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">4. Because they may not now receive the affirmative relief which they seek and because declaratory relief should be denied as matter of discretion, the final decree is to be modified to provide merely that the bill be dismissed. As so modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\"> The zoning by-law (art. XVIII of the town\u2019s by-laws) refers to a zoning map on file with the town clerk but not introduced in evidence. In \u201cresidential\u201d districts (\u00a7 IV-A) there may be (1) detached one family dwellings; (2) religious, educational, and municipal uses; (3) parks and noncommercial recreational activities; (4) hospitals and convalescent homes; (5) room rentals and boarding; (6) accessory uses; (7) \u201ccustomary or self home occupations\u201d; (8) certain nonoffensive farm uses; and (9) \u201c[s]igns . . . provided that such signs pertaining to the lease, sale, or use of a lot or building on which they are placed, do not exceed a total of six . . . square feet per sign, and . . . a total of two signs per lot or building.\u201d Certain additional uses are permitted if authorized by the board of appeals, such as aviation fields, golf clubs, cemeteries, research laboratories, nonprofit private clubs, boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 camps, and marine installations. In a \u201climited business\u201d district (\u00a7 V), in addition to the uses permitted in residential districts, there may be cottage or cabin colonies, motor courts, and motels, tourist type activities, which may not be within the \u201cbusiness area\u201d standard laid down in \u00a7 4A of the board\u2019s regulations (see fn. 3, <em>infra). </em>In a general business district (\u00a7 VI), in addition to uses permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 IV and V, there may be amusement places, hotels, restaurants, service stations, public utilities, retail or wholesale business, industrial uses (if authorized by the board of appeals), and certain signs not over eighteen square feet (\u00a7 VT-A [8]). The zoning by-law is stated to have been approved on various dates by the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> This \u201cprotective regulation\u201d provides, in part, \u201cNo \u2018off [premises\u2019 sign permits will be issued for such signs to be on [t]own [w]ays except when actual hardship has been proved and authorized by the [s]electmen. \u201d We assume that \u201coff premises\u201d signs are signs that do not advertise an occupation or operation conducted upon the premises where the sign has been placed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> Section 4A provides, in part, \u201cThe [Outdoor Advertising] [d]ivision may grant permits for the erection of . . . signs ... in areas which the [d]ivision may determine to be of a business character.

See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 Mass. 773, 778-779.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\"> Section 29 proceeds, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Such . . . regulations may require that said . . . signs ... be located in business, commercial, industrial, marketing or mercantile areas, or on unrestricted commercial arteries and adjacent to commercial enterprises; may prescribe standards of size, setback and clearance, considering the public interest; may require . . . signs ... to be licensed by the board ....
