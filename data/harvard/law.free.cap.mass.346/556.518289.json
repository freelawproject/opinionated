L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65M, \u201cso far as applicable,\u201d by ten corporations to review a decision of the respondent, the Commissioner of Insurance. The respondent upheld the grouping of the ten petitioners for rating purposes in accordance with Buie 9 of \u00a7 HI<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the \u201cEx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>perience Bating Plan Manual\u201d used by the rating bureau. A judge of the Superior Court entered a decree setting aside the decision of the respondent and ordering the Massachusetts Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bating and Inspection Bureau, an intervener in this suit, to \u201cestablish rates for each of the petitioners as separate risks, as provided in the first clause of said Section III, Buie 9. (\u2018Two or more separate risks shall not be combined for rating purposes.\u2019)\u201d The respondent and the intervener appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AgP\">In this court for the first time the respondent and the intervener question the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to act on the petition for review of the decision of the Commissioner. They argue that there was no statutory authority for an adjudicatory proceeding reviewable under Gf. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and no right to review under G-. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65M.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The substantive issue cannot be reached unless it is determined that there was jurisdiction in the Superior Court to act on the petition for review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. 740, 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Although we are urged to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, in the circumstances of this case we are reluctant to do so. The record is devoid of evidence from which we can decide the jurisdictional question. It is not for us to speculate. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, supra, </em>744.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The statutes under which the petitioners brought their petition in the Superior Court, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and c. 152, \u00a7 65M, set forth the circumstances in which the court has jurisdiction. There can be no review under c. 30A, \u00a7 14, unless there was an adjudicatory proceeding. <em>Springfield Motel Assn. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>338 Mass. 699, 702. In order to secure a review under \u00a7 65M, the petitioners must be parties \u201caggrieved by any order or ruling of the . . . commissioner of insurance under any provision of sections sixty-five A to sixty-five L, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>inclusive.\u201d The latter sections apply in general only to those employers originally assigned to their insurer, or to the voluntary pool, by the Commissioner. Both c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 65A-65M, and c. 30A, \u00a7 14, set forth provisions concerning the time and manner of filing appeals to the Commissioner or petitions for judicial review. There is no jurisdiction unless the petitioners complied with the appropriate requirements. See <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Fram-ingham, ante, </em>p. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">It is for the court below on adequate evidence to make such findings of fact as will show whether the petitioners come within the jurisdictional provisions of the pertinent statutes; whether they were voluntary risks or were risks assigned by the Commissioner; and whether they complied with the dates and manners of filing. If there are other findings which bear on the issue of jurisdiction they should also be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The decree is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-14\"><em> </em>\u2018\u2018Two or more separate risks shall not be combined for rating purposes; provided, however, that combination shall be made as respects risks in each of which the same person, or group of persons, or corporation owns a majority interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
