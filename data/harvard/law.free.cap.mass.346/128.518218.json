On the morning of July 2,1959, a misty, rainy day, he left his home in apparently normal physical condition and rode with a fellow employee to a parking lot on the hospital grounds arriving there between 6:20 and 6:25 a.m. While his employment hours were from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. he customarily rode to work with another hospital worker whose duties commenced at 6:30 a.m. He was not wearing rain clothes and while \u201crunning to get out of the rain\u201d was seized with a heart attack. He expired at 7:25 a.m. A single member of the Industrial Accident Board found in accordance with an opinion rendered by an internist (called by the claimant), who testified that the precipitating cause of the employee\u2019s heart attack and subsequent death lay in his running to escape the rain.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The single member concluded in his decision \u201cthat the act of \u2018running to get out of the rain\u2019 was not caused by the performance of any duty related to employee\u2019s occupation as hospital worker or in any way incidental to his employment, and that it is not an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. \u2019 \u2019 The findings and decision of the single member were adopted by the reviewing board. A decree in accordance with the board\u2019s decision was entered in the Superior Court and the claimant widow brought this appeal under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In our view the decision of the single member was erroneous. \u201c [A]n employee, in order to be entitled to compensation, need not necessarily be engaged in the actual performance of work at the time of injury; it is enough if he is upon his employer\u2019s premises occupying himself consistently with his contract of hire in some manner pertaining to or incidental to his employment.\u201d <em>Bradford\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 621, 622, and cases cited. See <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335; <em>Kubera\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 419, 420-421. The facts here are strongly similar to those of <em>Rogers\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 308. There, an employee had arrived as a passenger in a car driven by a fellow employee to a parking lot furnished by the employer. \u201c[T]he employee, while actually on his employer\u2019s premises and on his way to the place where his day\u2019s work was to be performed by a route which he was permitted and expected to take, fell and was injured.\u201d <em>Rogers\u2019s Case, supra, </em>309. Compensation was awarded to the employee. See <em>Warren\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 718, 719. In <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, it was held that a defendant using the parking facilities provided by his employer was within the scope of his employment one-half hour before he was obliged to report for the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Disability or death resulting from a heart attack may be found to have been caused by a strain connected with the employment and thus to constitute a personal injury under the act. <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 115, and cases cited. The effort of the employee to seek shelter from the rain in a reasonable manner, while on the employer\u2019s prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ises at a time appropriate to the employment, was incidental to his employment. The case is governed by <em>Rogers\u2019s Case, supra. </em>See <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56, 61; <em>Borin\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 452, 454; <em>Bator\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 104, 106; <em>Wabash Ry. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn. </em>360 111. 92, 95-96; <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>287 S. W. 2d 921 (Ky.).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The decree is reversed and a decree is to be entered in favor of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
