L. c. 123A, found that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person and ordered him committed to the treatment center for such persons (the center) for the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>determinate statutory period of one day to life. <em>Ibid. </em>\u00a7 6. Except for the points discussed below, this case is like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagle, </em>345 Mass. 539, which disposes of the defendant\u2019s exceptions in respect of constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It was not error to decline to rule that the \u201cfailure of the examining doctors to have both supervised the period of examination and diagnosis is fatal to the validity of this proceeding . . .The statute requires only that the \u201cexamination and diagnosis\u201d be \u201cunder the supervision of not less than two psychiatrists.\u201d This does not require that the psychiatrists be on the permanent staff. The evidence shows that the statutory purpose was fully met by the procedures adopted. Each of the two psychiatrists went to the center several times a week and laid out \u201ca program for the subject which they then recommend [ed] to . . . [the director of psychiatry at the center] or suggest [ed] at staff conferences. \u201d \u201c They were free to supervise in terms of requesting that psychological tests be done.\u201d One of the psychiatrists testified that he had considered the defendant\u2019s record and the opinions of the staff and had interviewed the defendant once. The other psychiatrist testified that he had interviewed the defendant on three occasions, had examined his record, and had considered the opinions of the staff. The director of psychiatry testified that persons committed for diagnosis are \u201cseen by the senior [staff] psychiatrist, ... by one social worker, . . . by a psychologist, . . . by . . . [the director\u2019s] administrative assistant, . . . almost always . . . by . . . [the director] . . . [as well as] by the two committing psychiatrists, and ... by the chief of the security force, so that at a staff conference we may have a convergence of all opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">It is inconsequential that, as the director of psychiatry testified, the \u201cdegree of supervision actually required in order to fill the need of the examination and diagnosis is extremely modest,\u201d and that one of the psychiatrists testified that \u201che did not supervise the examination and diagnosis period of sixty days . . ..\u201d If this means that in the particular case the latter did not lay out a program, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>not follow that the examination and diagnosis were not under his supervision to the full extent necessary to enable him to make the report which the statute contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">There is nothing in the contention that the written report of the psychiatrists is defective because it omits the recommendation called for by \u00a7 6, which both made orally in the course of their testimony, that is, that the defendant be committed to the center.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
