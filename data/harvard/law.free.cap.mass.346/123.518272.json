L. c. 138, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1958, c. 80<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and hence that the action of the mayor purporting to remove him, without charges, reasons given or a hearing, was invalid (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On the two petitions in the Superior Court, one for a writ of mandamus and the other for review under Gr. L. c. 138, \u00a7 5, orders were entered, respectively, for judgment for the respondent and for dismissal. The petitioner has appealed from the first order (G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 1D) and seeks a review of the second by a petition for a writ of certiorari. In the latter cas\u00e9 the mayor and the city of Brockton were allowed to intervene. This was irregular but, though not properly parties, the mayor and the city might be heard. <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>255 Mass. 5, 8. <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Northampton, </em>342 Mass. 620, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Errors of law may be reviewed on certiorari notwithstanding the provision of c. 138, \u00a7 5, that \u201cthere shall be no appeal from the decision\u201d of the Superior Court. <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 614, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The issue is whether the petitioner\u2019s appointment in 1961, by the city manager (Brockton then having a Plan D charter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 79-92A), was a nullity because not confirmed by the city council in accordance with G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">This court has held that the provisions of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 4, as to appointment and removal, are unaffected by provisions of city charters. Chapter 138, \u00a7 4, when adopted in 1933 (St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2), contained no requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>confirmation of the mayor\u2019s appointments to the licensing board. In <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Deschenes, </em>287 Mass. 202 (1934), it was held that an unconfirmed appointment was valid notwithstanding G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 60 (Plan B), which provides, inter alla, that 11 all heads of departments and members of municipal boards, except the school committee, officials appointed by the governor, and assessors if elected by the people . . . shall be appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation by the city council . . ..\u201d In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>299 Mass. 321 (1938), it was held that the power of removal given to the mayor by G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 5, was not qualified by the requirement of Pittsfield\u2019s charter (St. 1932, c. 280, \u00a7 30) that removal be subject to approval of the council. These holdings are founded primarily, we think, in the importance of uniformity in the administration of a State wide statute. The opinions stress the distinction between a licensing board and the usual \u201cmunicipal board.\u201d <em>Crocker </em>case, <em>supra, </em>207. <em>McDonald </em>case, <em>supra, </em>324. Whether the office of licensing board member is a municipal office for some purposes (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowe, </em>315 Mass. 217, 222-224; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>342 Mass. 82, 84), the <em>Crocker </em>and <em>McDonald </em>cases establish that it is not a municipal office to which charter provisions in respect of confirmation of appointment or consent to removal apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Section 89 of c. 43 provided at the time of these decisions that the city manager should be \u201cthe administrative head of the city government and shall be responsible for the administration of all departments.\u201d Statute 1948, c. 459, \u00a7 8, expanded \u00a7 89 so that the city manager, with exceptions not relevant, is \u201cresponsible for the administration of all departments, commissions, boards and offices of the city.\u201d This amendment was without effect on the nature of the office of licensing board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">There is nothing in c. 43, \u00a7 92, cited by the petitioner, that supports his contention. The prohibitions and criminal penalties of \u00a7 92 apply to members of the city council who \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>direct or request the appointment of any person to, or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>removal from, office ... or in any manner take part in the appointment or removal of officers or employees in that portion of the service of said city for whose administration the city manager is responsible.\u201d The licensing board is not one of the \u201cboards ... of the city\u201d under these sections. Nothing in \u00a7 92 suggests otherwise and we do not reach the issue whether the mistaken assumption of power to confirm an appointment or approve a removal would be subject to its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The petitioner contends that, in any event, the requirement of \u00a7 4 for confirmation by the council, is, in effect, negated by Gr. L. c. 43, \u00a7 90, which gives to the city manager \u201call the powers, rights and duties, other than legislative, had, possessed or exercised, immediately prior to the adoption of this plan, by the mayor, board of aldermen, common council . . ..\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We discern in c. 43, \u00a7 90, no legislative intention that the confirming function of the city council under c. 138, \u00a7 4, be transferred to the city manager. True, the present broad power of the city manager did not exist in 1933 and 1934 when c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, were enacted and (as to \u00a7 4) amended. Then the city manager\u2019s powers under \u00a7 90 did not include \u201call . . . [those] exercised [theretofore] . . . by the . . . council.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think, however, that the subsequent amendment of c. 43, \u00a7 90, by St. 1948, c. 459, \u00a7 8, did not intend a qualification of the requirements of c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5. That amendment of \u00a7 90 was an enactment in respect of the \u201cordinary and normal functions of municipal government . . ..\u201d <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Deschenes, </em>287 Mass. 202, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The differing provisions of the several charter plans in 1933 and 1934 in respect of appointments and confirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>which, except as to Plans D and E, are now in effect without change, tend to confirm that the Legislature in enacting c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 in 1933, and amending \u00a7 4 in 1934, intended that the essence of the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 prevail in all cities regardless of the local charter plan. Plan D at that time, as noted, left more power with the council than is now the case. Under Plan A no confirmation of the mayor\u2019s municipal appointments was required (c. 43, \u00a7 52). Plan B called for confirmation (\u00a7 60). Plan C, with its commission form of government, called for appointments by that one of the five commissioners who was in charge of the particular department in which the appointment was made, subject to confirmation (\u00a776), and the mayor was the chief executive officer and the commissioner of administration (\u00a7 74). Under Plan E, first enacted by St. 1938, c. 378, \u00a7 15, the city manager by c. 43, \u00a7 104, has powers like those given under Plan D by \u00a7 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">We rule that Gr. L. c. 138, \u00a7 4, calls for confirmation by the city council regardless of the lack of power of the council under c. 43 to confirm municipal appointments, and regardless of the grant by e. 43, \u00a7 90, of the council\u2019s former powers to the manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">It does not follow from our construction of c. 138 that in Plan D and Plan E cities appointments under Gr. L. c. 138, \u00a7 4, must be made by the. mayor rather than the city manager. The essential requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 are appointment by the city\u2019s chief executive and confirmation by its legislative body and in such cities the city manager is the chief executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\n<em>Order for judgment for the respondent in mandamus affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>Petition for writ of certiorari dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> \u201cIn each city which is not exempt by the provisions of section ten there shall be a licensing board appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation by the board of aldermen or, if there is no such board, by the city council . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\"> The members \u201cmay be removed by the mayor for cause, after charges preferred, reasonable notice thereof, and a hearing thereon; and the mayor shall, in the order of removal, state his reasons therefor. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\"> The Plan D charter was superseded in Brockton on January 1, 1962, by Plan B (G.
