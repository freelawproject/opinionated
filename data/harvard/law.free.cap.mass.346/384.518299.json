Atherton appealed from a decree of the Probate \u25a0 Court for Hampden County allowing an instrument as her last will and testament, and appointing Henry F. Atherton, Jr., and the Valley Bank and Trust Company, of Springfield, as administrators with the will annexed of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The evidence is not reported. The judge made a report of material facts and, in response to an order of this court, filed a supplemental report. We summarize the facts in these reports. The decedent, late of Hampden, in Hamp-den County, died on April 28, 1962, leaving as her sole heir at law her son, Henry F. Atherton, Jr., also of Hampden. Her estate was estimated at approximately $900,000 in personalty and $50,000 in real estate. At the time of her death all of the assets were in Hampden County, \u201cwith the exception of a few thousand dollars in accumulated credits from a trust established under her late husband\u2019s will,\u201d which were in the custody of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of Hew York. The will made several specific bequests including $50,000 and real estate to her son. The residue was left in trust, the son to be the sole beneficiary of the net income during his life. In her will the decedent nominated Mr. Fitz Gibbon, an attorney in Hew York, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of Hew York, and her son as coexecutors and cotrustees. On May 10, 1962, the original will, together with a petition for probate thereof, was filed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court for the County of Hew York, State of Hew York, by the three designated executors. Shortly thereafter, the decedent\u2019s son filed a petition in that court to withdraw his name as a party petitioner in that proceeding. \u201cSome time in June of 1962, the Surrogate\u2019s Court acted favorably upon the petition . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In May of 1962 the son, accompanied by his attorney, held a conference with Mr. Fitz Gibbon in the latter\u2019s law office in Hew York. The son \u201cexplained that he was opposed to any probate proceedings in Hew York because of the tremendous expenses involved there in comparison with the probable expenses in Massachusetts probate proceedings.\u201d On May 28, 1962, the Probate Court for Hampden County appointed the son and the Valley Bank and Trust Company, of Springfield, as special administrators of the decedent\u2019s estate. \u201cOn May 29, 1962, counsel for . . . Atherton offered in writing to both . . . [Mr.] Fitz Gibbon and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, an opportunity to join in a petition for the probate of the will in Hampden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>County, and both of said parties refused to do so until the New York proceedings were determined.\u201d Atherton and the Valley Bank and Trust Company, on May 31,1962, petitioned the Probate Court to allow the will and to appoint them \u201cor some other suitable person\u201d administrators with the will annexed, alleging that the other two nominated executors \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refused presently to file the said Will for original probate in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d On July 23, 1962, a hearing was held on this petition at which the sole issue \u201cwas whether or not the said petitioners should be appointed administrators with the will annexed,\u201d no objection having been raised \u201cas to the competency of the testatrix, the will or the proper execution thereof.\u201d At that time, notwithstanding their prior refusals to act, Mr. Fitz Gibbon and the representative of the New York bank made a motion that they be appointed executors in Massachusetts and \u201cindicated that . . . [they] were willing and prepared to sign a petition to qualify as executors in Massachusetts.\u201d This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The judge found the petitioners to be \u201ccompetent and suitable in every respect.\u201d He entered a decree appointing them administrators with the will annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The decedent\u2019s will has been reproduced in the record. The ninth clause thereof directs that the will be probated in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This clause, more fully set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> partially explains the delay in seeking probate of the will in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The decedent was domiciled in Massachusetts and all of her real estate and almost all of her personal property were located in Massachusetts. Upon such facts Massachusetts has jurisdiction to probate her will, G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 3, <em>Rackemann </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>204 Mass. 394, 397, irrespective of whether primary probate would also have been proper in New York. Indeed, it is clear from the supplemental report of material facts that no one is now opposing admission of the will to probate in Massachusetts. The issue then is whether administrators Avith the will annexed should be appointed, pursuant to G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 7, in lieu of the executors nominated in the will. General Laws c. 193, \u00a7 7, proAddes, in part: \u201cIf no executor is named in a will, or if all the executors therein named are dead or incompetent or refuse to accept the trust, or if, after being duly cited therefor, the executor neglects to accept the trust, . . . the court shall commit administration of the estate, with the will annexed, to any person interested in the Avill of said deceased . . ..\u201d In view of the ninth clause of the will we do not think that the delay on the part of two of the nominated executors in seeking to probate the will in Massachusetts is tantamount to a refusal to accept the trust, particularly when it appears that they had expressly sought to be appointed executors in Massachusetts prior to the entry of the decree. As the nominated executors are not dead and cannot be said to have refused to accept the trust, the executors nominated in the Avill should be appointed executors unless, upon further proceedings, they are found unsuitable or refuse to apply for probate in Massachusetts. See <em>Grossman </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>343 Mass. 565, 568. They are given leave to file, Avithin twenty days after rescript, a petition for probate of the will in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The decree is reversed and the case is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The ninth article of the will reads in part as follows: \u2018' Whereas, the . . . will ... of my late husband . . . was probated in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of . . . New York, and the trusts . . . thereunder are New York trusts which will continue after . . . my death, with my son . . . the income beneficiary thereof for . . . his life, and whereas my son will be the life income beneficiary of the trust created under my Will, and whereas the guaranty trust company of new york . . . will, up on my death, become a successor Executor and Trustee under the Will of my late husband, as well as a co-Executor and co-Trustee under my Will. I believe that the administration of both estates should be governed, regulated and construed under the same laws. To that end, I . . . direct that my Will shall be probated in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the State of New York, County of New York, and that the administration of my estate and the dispositions thereunder shall in all respects be governed, regulated and construed by and in accordance with the laws of . . . New York, and that the trusts created under my said Will shall be New York trusts, and that the same shall be administered and in all respects governed, regulated and construed by and in accordance with the Laws of . . . New York.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
