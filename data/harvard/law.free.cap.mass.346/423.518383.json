Ramos, Jr., hereinafter referred to as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">There are findings of fact; the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The defendants in 1945 bought the parcel of land that occupies the entire block between Acushnet Avenue and Belleville Avenue, and is bounded on the north by Dawson Street and on the south by Harwich Street. It had been the site of \u201cone of those big, old houses\u201d which had been taken down. The parcel was partly in the business zone of Acushnet Avenue which, in the parcel and in the blocks to the south, was eighty feet in depth, but was deeper in the block across Dawson Street to the north. Thereafter in 1946, a zoning amendment widened the business district in the defendants \u2019 parcel to 250 feet measured along Dawson Street, or to about the same width as that in effect across Dawson Street. This left about 180 feet of the parcel in the residence \u201cB\u201d district which extends on both sides of Belleville Avenue for varying distances from the parcel. In this district and near the parcel there are a number of residences. The portion of the parcel zoned for residential use is vacant land and is the locus for which the variance was granted. In 1947 the defendants erected a building on that portion of the parcel zoned for business. The building has since been used for the conduct of an eating and refreshment business.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The defendants in March, 1960, petitioned the city council to extend the business district within this parcel so as to include the locus. The planning board reported favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ably but after an unfavorable committee report the council tabled the petition. The council in January, 1961, granted the defendants leave to \u201cwithdraw . . . without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The petition for a variance, dated March 16,1961, sought permission to erect a supermarket building on the defendants\u2019 parcel to stand in greater part on the locus, and it disclosed the purpose to use the remainder of the parcel, mostly in the business zone, for parking for customers of the supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The board\u2019s decision, after a summary reference to the petition, records only that the board \u201cvoted four to one in favor of the petition.\u201d The parties, have, however, by stipulation, waived any objections to the decision based \u2018 \u2018 on the ground that it fails to show how each member voted . . . [or] to state . . . reasons . . . or . . . that a detailed record of the proceedings ... is not included . . ..\u201d Our holding is such that we need not consider the effect of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Many of the findings of the judge would tend to support a zoning amendment to expand the business district in the vicinity of the locus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Neither the findings nor the evidence, however, shows that the requirements of Gr. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, cl. 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as to hard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ship have been met. If we assume that the evidence permitted the judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cvacant land ... [of the defendants] would not be practical to use for residential purposes,\u201d nevertheless, the consequent \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d which he found is not of the kind that supports a variance. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Belmont, ante, </em>81, 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">What it comes down to is that the defendants\u2019 parcel is less valuable because not all of it may be used for a business purpose and no major use for part of it is presently eco-' nomically practical. This is a hazard often accompanying the ownership of property along or near zone boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Even if the locus could be separately considered, the defendants have not sustained the burden (see <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. 547, 555-556) of coming forward with evidence that the lack of demand for new dwellings to be built in the vicinity is a circumstance <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>especially affecting such parcel.\u201d <em>Shacha </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chelmsford, </em>341 Mass. 593, 594-595. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>343 Mass. 742, 744-745. It expressly appears, indeed, that there is other vacant land near by in the residence \u201cB\u201d district.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The decree is reversed. A final decree is to be entered in the Superior Court adjudging that the decision exceeded the authority of the board and is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> \u201c [T]here has been no demand for residential development in this area in recent years.\u201d There are nonconforming uses and \u201cmany light manufacturing and mercantile establishments in the vicinity.\u201d The business zone and an industrial zone are not far away.
