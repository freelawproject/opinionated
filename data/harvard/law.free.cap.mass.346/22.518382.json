GK L. c. 231A. From a final decree declaring the ordinance to be invalid and enjoining the proposed use, the defendant appealed. The judge voluntarily filed a document entitled \u201cFindings of Fact and Order,\u201d which, upon request of the defendant, he adopted as a report of the material facts found by him. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 23 (as amended through St. 1947, c. 365, \u00a7 2). The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">The judge\u2019s findings are extremely meager, and, except as otherwise stated, the facts necessary to our decision we ourselves find.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The eight acre parcel is part of an abandoned granite quarry presently used for the dumping of rubbish. On June 7,1943, the city council adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance which divided the city into six classes of districts : Residence A, B, and 0, Business, and Industrial A and B. It was approved by the mayor on July 1, 1943. Made part of the ordinance was a map, entitled \u201cQuincy Massachusetts Building Zone Map,\u201d which displayed a key showing small rectangles with differing markings plainly indicating the six classes of districts and a category of \u201ccity property.\u201d This category, strangely enough, was not referred to elsewhere in the ordinance, and, lacking express restrictions, can only be treated as an unzoned area. Nothing in the enabling act as it then stood, GK L. c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 25-30B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 or in common sense requires a municipality to impose restrictions upon all of its territory as a condition of the exercise of its zoning powers.\u201d <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>316 Mass. 124,125-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In 1949 the ordinance was amended and two new classes of districts, making eight in all, were added: Industrial A-l and City Property. See-Rev. Ord. of Quincy (1960) c. 24, \u00a7 3. The only other reference to City Property in the ordinance, as now amended, is in the section entitled, \u201cBoard of Appeals \u201d: \u201c City property. All uses of property zoned city property other than municipal uses shall be subject to the approval of the board of appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17 (f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The ordinance under attack, Order No. 278, was passed to be ordained by the city council on November 20, 1961, and was approved by the mayor on November 27, 1961. It purported to amend the Revised Ordinances of the city c. 24, \u00a7 3 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and stated, \u201cThe Building Zone Map of Quincy, Mass, be and is hereby amended by changing from \u2018Residence B\u2019 to \u2018City Property\u2019 the following parcel of land.\u201d Here followed a description of the eight acre parcel by metes and bounds. This had the effect of removing all restrictions upon municipal uses of the parcel. \u201cThe Zoning Enabling Act,\u201d Gr. L. c. 40A, inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2, has not changed the principle quoted <em>supra </em>from <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Rosenthal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The judge ruled that the zoning ordinance permits the erection and maintenance of an incinerator only in Industrial B zones. We assume that the basis of the ruling was c. 24, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ruling was error. There is nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>provisions respecting Industrial B zones which requires such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The judge also stated: \u201cIt is irrelevant that the proposed incinerator site is ideally adapted for the purpose, which the court finds; that the citizens have voted for a municipal incinerator; that other sites are not as readily available; nor that part of the proposed site is currently used as a municipal dump. The sole question is whether the city has exceeded the authority given it under the enabling act. The court finds that it has. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We cannot agree. There was nothing in the zoning enabling act which barred the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendant has urged that the plaintiffs have no standing to raise the question of the validity of the amendment under c. 231A. In their bill they allege that they have an interest in the subject matter because the purported ordinance seeks to erect an incinerator in a Residence B zone; that they \u201call live in a Residence A or Residence B zone near and proximate to the locus which is the subject of said ordinance. \u2019 \u2019 The answer denied that they have a legal interest in the subject matter or that they live \u201cnear and proximate to the locus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">With this record, we shall not study the voluminous testimony and exhibits to ascertain where the ninety-four plaintiffs live or their relationship to the subject matter of the ordinance. Neither shall we endeavor to find facts on the issue of spot zoning sought to be raised by the plaintiffs. If these or other issues are still live issues, the case may be further heard in the Superior Court. Should the case come before us again we hope that the issues of fact will be covered by adequate findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> We have not been informed when this section was enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> The first sentence of e. 24, \u00a7 3 (b), is \u201cThe boundaries of the districts shall be the sidelines of streets, property or lot lines, or other lines shown on the map entitled 1 Building Zone Map of Quincy, Massachusetts, \u2019 on file in the office of the inspector of buildings, which map is hereby adopted and made part of this chapter. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\"> \u201cWithin any industrial \u2018B\u2019 area no building or structure shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected to be used in whole or im part for any one of the following specified uses: . . .
