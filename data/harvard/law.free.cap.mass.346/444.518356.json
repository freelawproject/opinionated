O\u2019Neil, late of New Bedford. The probate judge entered a final decree ordering the assets turned over to the executors of the wall of John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., the only son of the testator; these executors and several beneficiaries under the will of the son are the appellees. The appellants are nieces and nephews of the testator who claim the trust assets and the executors of the will of the testator\u2019s deceased sister. The evidence is reported and the judge made a report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Clause Fifth of the will, dated February 7, 1936, provides : <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018All the rest and residue of my estate, I give, bequeath and devise to The Safe Deposit National Bank of New Bedford and said William S. Downey jointly, in trust, nevertheless, for the following trust purposes: . . . Sec- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>and. I direct my Trustees to pay over the net income of this trust to my wife, Florence L. O\u2019Neil, so long as she shall live or remain my widow. Third. I direct my Trustees to pay over to my son, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., the following sums out of the principal of this trust: 1. The sum of Twenty-five - Hundred (2,500) Dollars at the time he marries. 2. The sum of One Thousand (1,000) Dollars when he reaches the age of thirty years. 3. The sum of One Thousand (1,000) Dollars when he reaches the age of thirty-five years. 4. The sum of One Thousand (1,000) Dollars when he reaches the age of forty years. Fourth. Upon the decease or remarriage of my said wife, I direct my Trustees, subject to the aforesaid payments of principal, to pay the net income of said trust to my said son, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., for and during his life-time. Fifth. At the decease of my son, and after the decease or remarriage of my said wife, I direct my Trustees to pay over to my son\u2019s issue in equal shares, the net income from said trust until the youngest of my son\u2019s issue shall reach the age of twenty-one years, when my Trustees shall pay over the whole of said trust then remaining in equal shares to said issue, free of all trusts.. Sixth. If by reason of death or remarriage or lack of issue living at my son\u2019s decease, the foregoing provisions cannot be carried out, I direct my Trustees to pay over the trust estate then remaining, free of all trusts, to my next of kin, according to the laws of descent and distribution in intestate estates in this Commonwealth. Seventh. Neither the income nor the principal of the legacies and trust estate herein created shall be assignable, or anticipated, or alienated in any manner by the beneficiaries, nor are they to be subject to the control or claims of creditors or subject to any process of law. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We herewith summarize pertinent portions of the judge\u2019s findings taken from his report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On January 6, 1937, John V. O\u2019Neil (the testator) died. In 1946, Florence L. O\u2019Neil, the testator\u2019s widow, died. Later that year, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., married Anna Gr. Ring, who is an appellee in the present case. In 1947, the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tor\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Clark, died. On December 20, 1961, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., died, testate, without leaving issue. It is agreed that pursuant to the sixth section of the fifth clause in the testator\u2019s will the time has arrived for final distribution of the principal of the trust created under that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The paramount issue before us is whether the term \u201cnext of Idn, \u2019 \u2019 as used in the sixth section, refers to those who had this status on January 6, 1937, the date of the testator\u2019s death, or to those who were his next of kin on December 20, 1961, the date on which his son died. The appellees argue, and the Probate Court ruled, that the 1937 date is applicable ; the appellants contend that under a proper construction of the will the next of kin are to be determined as of December 20, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>11 Met. 16, 23, Chief Justice Shaw said: \u201cWe consider that when a bequest is made to one or more for life, and remainder to the testator\u2019s heirs, or next of kin, or relations, or such persons as would take his estate by the rules of law if he had died intestate, the bequest is to those who are such heirs or next of kin at the time of his decease, unless there are words indicating a clear intention that it shall go to those who may be his relations or next of kin at the time of the happening of the contingency upon which the estate is to be distributed.\u201d Although in that case so much of the court\u2019s opinion as applied to the term \u201cnext of kin\u201d was dictum, the same rule was applied to the term \u201cnearest of kin\u201d in <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Mayhew, </em>169 Mass. 166, 169, and has been restated often enough to be regarded as a settled rule of construction in this Commonwealth. <em>Whall </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>146 Mass. 345, 348-349. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co. </em>314 Mass. 528, 531. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>344 Mass. 287, 291. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stephens, ante, </em>94, 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">A rule of construction, however, should not be confused with a rule of substantive law. <em>Agricultural Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>316 Mass. 288, 291. We have repeatedly said that canons for the interpretation of wills are to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>only as aids for determining testamentary intent and should not be used to defeat that intent. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>202 Mass. 512, 516. <em>Worcester County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Marble, </em>316 Mass. 294, 297. <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Audubon Soc. Inc. </em>318 Mass. 482, 486. The appellants contend that there is other language in the testator\u2019s will which tends to prove that he intended the term \u201cnext of kin\u201d as used in the sixth section to refer to those who legally would occupy this status on the death of his son and not on his own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The appellants \u2019 strongest argument is that it is unlikely that the testator intended a contingent remainder to vest in his son (assuming his son to have been the \u201cnext of kin\u201d in 1937) upon his son\u2019s death, where the express gifts in the will to the son were only a life interest in the trust and nominal payments of trust principal upon the happening of certain events during the son\u2019s lifetime. We see nothing unlikely in such a result. Perhaps a similar result would be more often accomplished by giving the life beneficiary a contingent power of appointment over the remainder, or a more restricted result accomplished by giving a contingent remainder to the life beneficiary\u2019s heirs. See <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>297 Mass. 147,148-149. Cf. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Mass. 600, 602-603. Nevertheless, we have held in several cases that a gift of a life interest to an heir with a remainder in the testator\u2019s heirs does not prove that the heirs were to he determined at the time of the life beneficiary\u2019s death. <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Cush. 232, 235-236. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>291 Mass. 17, 21. <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Congregational Home Missionary Soc. </em>276 Mass. 580, 584. We observe that the testator\u2019s will was drawn after these cases had been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In another line of cases, however, we have held that where a testator gives a life interest to those who would have been his heirs in intestacy, and a contingent remainder to his \u201cheirs,\u201d these heirs are to be determined at the end of the life interest. <em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>150 Mass. 225, 229-231. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, </em>169 Mass. 204, 211. <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Read, </em>169 Mass. 216, 222. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>194 Mass. 540, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>545. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>227 Mass. 242, 246. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>278 Mass. 244, 247. In most of these eases, the court found some language in the testamentary instrument or some other facts to take the case out of the general rule that heirs of the testator are to be determined at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>230, the court seemed to be of the opinion that the absence of any reference to statutes of descent gave the word \u201cheirs\u201d a less strict meaning. In <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, supra, </em>208, 213, the word \u201cthen,\u201d followed by other language, was significant. The proviso there in question read: \u201cProvided, however, that in case my said son shall die having no issue him surviving, or such issue shall decease during minority, then, and in either of such cases, my will is that my sister Eliza Oliver shall have and take the said moiety of my estate . . .; and if the said Eliza O. shall not then be living, I give said estate, with its accumulations, to the person or persons who shall be my heir or heirs at law.\u201d As the court construed the proviso, the word \u201cthen\u201d modified not only \u201cshall not be living\u201d but also the verb \u201cshall be\u201d in the syntactical clause \u201cwho shall be my heir or heirs at law. \u2019 \u2019 In <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Read, supra, </em>224, a case analogous to <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, supra, </em>the court did not apply the general rule. The court reasoned that the contingent remainder was to the testator\u2019s \u201cheirs\u201d whereas his heir at law would have been only one person and that the testator\u2019s use of the words \u201cas though I died intestate\u201d described the manner in which the disputed half of the estate was to be distributed after the life beneficiary\u2019s death with no surviving issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>194 Mass. 540, 545, the general rule was not applied because, among other reasons, the heirs and life beneficiary, whose legatees were claiming under the rule, had been entitled only to a limited share of the trust income during her lifetime. In <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>278 Mass. 244, 247, the court noted a manifest intent on the testator\u2019s part to keep the bulk of the property in his own family.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Thus far, there is little in the case at bar to indicate a result similar to that reached in the cases just discussed. Although the testator does refer to the \u201claws of descent and distribution in intestate estates in this Commonwealth\u201d to modify the term \u201cnext of kin\u201d and although the will does use the word \u201cthen,\u201d it is not used in the same sense as it is in <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, supra. </em>There is no adverb or adverbial phrase to indicate that the testator intended that his next of kin be determined at any time other than the time of his death. The term \u201cnext of kin\u201d may, of course, be singular as well as plural. In the instant case, the net income from the trust created under the fifth clause was to be distributed to the son after the death or remarriage of the testator\u2019s wife. Furthermore, there is no apparent plan in the present will from which we can infer an intent on the part of the testator to keep his property in the possession of that portion of the \u201cfamily\u201d represented by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>227 Mass. 242, 246, it was said: \u201cThat the intention was not to vest the remainder in the life tenants may be inferred from the fact that they were the sole heirs at law at the time the will was made, that they survived the testator, and that their interest could never vest in possession. <em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>150 Mass. 225, 230. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, </em>169 Mass. 204, 212. <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Read, </em>169 Mass. 216, 223.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Since the above quoted paragraph appears to be the point upon which the decision rests, that case is in conflict with <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Congregational Home Missionary Soc. </em>276 Mass. 580, 584, and other cases cited, <em>ante, </em>in support of the general rule. However, subsequent cases show that the actual holding of <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>was far less broad than the language therein would imply. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>241 Mass. 565, 568, we cited <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>as a case taken out of the general rule of construction because the contingency clause contained the word \u201cthen.\u201d (Such a reading would harmonize the holding of the case with that of <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Brimmer, </em>169 Mass. 204, 211.) In <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Bank Farmers Trust Co. </em>314 Mass. 528, 532, we referred to \u201cother circumstances\u201d as taking <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>out of the general rule. Similar distinctions were drawn in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>313 Mass. 717, 720, and <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>291 Mass. 17, 22. In short, although the case at bar falls within the language of <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>the facts thus far discussed do not by themselves take this case out of the general rule that next of kin are to be determined at the time of the testator\u2019s death. To the extent that <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>may he authority for a contrary result, we choose not to follow that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The appellants also argue that if the testator intended by the sixth section of the fifth clause that the remainder of the trust should go to his son\u2019s estate, then the practical effect would he that creditors could attach the estate on the son\u2019s death and the purpose of the spendthrift clause would be to a great extent undone. In two cases, we adopted similar arguments and held that the heirs were to be determined at the time of the life beneficiary\u2019s death when the \u201cscheme of distribution\u201d in the will pointed to such a result. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>278 Mass. 244, 247-249. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>313 Mass. 717, 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We rejected the above argument in a case in which the spendthrift clause was the only evidence that the testator had intended his heirs to be determined upon the death of the life beneficiary. <em>Rotch </em>v. <em>Rotch, </em>173 Mass. 125, 131-133. Again, in <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Clarke, supra, </em>21-22, we rejected that contention; in that ease, as in the case at bar, it was coupled with the point that the life beneficiary was the testator\u2019s heir, in whose estate the testator would not have intended to leave the contingent remainder. Furthermore, as in the <em>Botch </em>case, <em>supra, </em>132-133, we note that the testator could have imposed the spendthrift clause in order to provide any children that his son might have (see fifth section, fifth clause) with the largest possible estate. Although the testator had only one child, he could not predict how many children his son might have and may have intended that as much as possible of the trust principal re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>main for their enjoyment. If this were his purpose, it hardly follows that he intended to keep the trust assets out of his son\u2019s estate should his son die childless.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We note also that the spendthrift clause seemed to govern not only that trust in which John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., had a life interest but all other trust interests established by the will including the trust established under the fourth clause,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which the mother of four of the appellants, Elizabeth Clark, had an equitable life interest. It does not appear, therefore, that the testator was obsessed with the single purpose of restraining his son. Nor is there any reason to believe that the testator was particularly mindful of providing the largest possible estate for his nieces and nephews while restricting the estates of his wife, his sister, and his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The appellants introduced testimony showing the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the testator and the claimant appellants. They contend that it was error for the probate judge not to include in his report of material facts a finding based on this testimony. We are of the opinion that the testimony was of no probative value, and in any event, the judge was not required to advert to it. <em>Building Inspector of Salem </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>259 Mass. 615, 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The only remaining issue concerns the determination of the persons who were the testator\u2019s next of kin on January 6,1937, the date of his death. The judge held that only his son, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr., answered to this description and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ordered the petitioners to turn over the remaining principal to the son\u2019s estate. He specifically held that the testator\u2019s wife was not next of kin under a proper construction of the will. We agree with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In this Commonwealth, the words next of kin are limited to blood relations and do not include spouses, unless there is a clear intention to the contrary; such an intention will not be inferred from mere reference to the law of descent and distribution. <em>Haraden </em>v. <em>Larrabee, </em>113 Mass. 430, 431. See <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Smith, 222 </em>Mass. 600, 602. Furthermore, the statute of descent and distribution, as it appeared at the time of the testator\u2019s death (G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 1), distinguishes between kindred and spouses. Likewise, c. 190, \u00a7 3, seems to distinguish between the share to which a spouse is entitled and rules governing descent to blood relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Accordingly, we hold that under c. 190, \u00a7 3 (1), the testator\u2019s next of kin at his death in 1937 was his son, John V. O\u2019Neil, Jr. Costs and expenses of appeal are to be in the discretion of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> \" Fourth.
