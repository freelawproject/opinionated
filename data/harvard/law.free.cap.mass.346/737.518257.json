L. c. 118A, \u00a7 21. The controversy arose because of the refusal of the city of Marlborough to pay to the hospital the amount of its charges for a part of a patient\u2019s stay in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">In the Superior Court the hospital prevailed in all of its substantive contentions. The judge ruled (1) that the hearing before the referee (G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 21) was not the \u201cfair hearing\u201d required by that section, (2) the decision of the referee (approved by the commissioner and hence the decision of the department under \u00a7 21) was not supported by substantial evidence under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and (3) the commissioner was without authority to promulgate a rule reducing the amount of needed medical assistance to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>entitled to medical care to the aged under GL L. c. 118A because of a determination that contributions should be made by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The \u201cfinal decree\u201d remanded the proceedings for a new hearing. See Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8): \u201cThe court may . . . remand the matter for further proceedings before the agency . . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The judge\u2019s ruling that there had not been a fair hearing is based on the finding that after the conclusion of the hearing the referee submitted the evidence for the opinion of the medical consultant and followed the consultant\u2019s views. The hospital\u2019s present contention is that this did not make the hearing unfair, and that any error can be fully corrected by disregarding the medical consultant\u2019s views and by ruling for the hospital on the uncontroverted testimony of the patient\u2019s physician. Hence, the hospital asserts, the case should not have been remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">These issues are not now before us. The case may not be brought to this court after an order for remand. Our power under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, is to review \u201cproceedings . . . determinations . . ., and orders or decrees issued in the superior court ... in the same manner and to the same extent as in equity suits, so far as the provisions governing equity suits are applicable. The court may by rule vary the procedure . . . upon a finding that the review by the court will thereby be made more simple, speedy and effective.\u201d There is no rule which varies the procedure. Appeals from interlocutory decrees must await an appeal from the final decree. <em>Orth </em>v. <em>Paramount Pictures, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 580, 581. <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 562-563. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19. The title \u201cfinal decree\u201d did not make the decree of remand final in substance. <em>Vincent </em>case, 319 Mass, at 563-564.
