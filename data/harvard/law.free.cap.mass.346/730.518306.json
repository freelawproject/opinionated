The case was tried in the Superior Court on a statement of agreed facts, which included a contract incorporated by reference. The judge ordered judgment for the defendant from which the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In 1958 the defendant entered into a written contract with National Associates, Inc. (National). Under its terms, National was to make a revaluation of the defendant\u2019s taxable property, was to he present at hearings of the defendant\u2019s board of assessors to defend values and assist in the settlement of complaints, and was to provide the defendant with record cards containing essential information on the property assessed. On November 14,1958, the defendant issued a letter to the plaintiff consenting to a proposed \u201cassignment of $9,000 from the National Associates, Inc. to the Quincy Trust Company of their interests in the above-mentioned contract.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 26, 1958, National assigned to the plaintiff its interest in the unpaid balance. In March, 1959, the defendant paid the plaintiff the sum of $4,500 but made no subsequent payment. In November, 1959, National was adjudicated a bankrupt, and in January, 1960, the defendant voluntarily paid to National\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy the sum of $3,000 to secure possession of the record cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">At the time of the assignment, National had performed all services owed to the defendant under the contract except that it had not participated in the complaint and adjustment hearings and had not delivered the record cards. It appears that National never participated in the hearings. The defendant\u2019s assessors never issued a certification that the contract had been fulfilled, unless the letter of November 14, 1958, is deemed to be such a certificate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>We believe that the trial judge correctly concluded that the assignment by National to the plaintiff was an assignment only of an interest in a contract and not of an amount of money.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>345 Mass. 555, 557, 559-560. Cf. <em>Claycraft Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co. </em>287 Mass. 255, 257. In this case, the assignee stands in no better position than the assignor, and any defence which the defendant could raise against the latter may also be raised against the former. <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>22 Pick. 253, 261. <em>Buttrick Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>202 Mass. 413, 418. <em>Harrison Mfg. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Philip Rothman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 625, 628. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In the present case, a condition precedent to the making of the final payment was the issuance by the board of assessors of a certification that the contract had been \u201cfulfilled.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate that this certification has been improperly withheld. This condition not having been met, neither the assignor nor the assignee is entitled to payment. <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Life Ins. Co. </em>187 Mass. 538, 540. <em>Dolben </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>270 Mass. 381, 384-385.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> The pertinent portion of the letter reads as follows: \"This is to inform you that National Associates, Inc., who contracted with the Town of Pembroke to revaluate its taxable property for the sum of $16,000.00 has completed its work except for hearings and adjustments.
