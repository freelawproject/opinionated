The declaration (see fn. 3, <em>infra) </em>in that action alleged negligence causing Barker\u2019s death and conscious suffering. The present case, before us on Liberty\u2019s bill of exceptions, was heard in the Superior Court upon a statement of agreed facts. Liberty requested a ruling that \u201c [o]n the facts stated, as a matter of law, there must be a finding for\u201d Liberty. The trial judge denied this request and ordered judgment for Magoun in the sum of $3,526.48. Liberty has argued exceptions to the judge\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">On December 23,1950, Liberty issued a \u201cschedule general liability policy (manufacturers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 form)\u201d to Magoun. Coverage A of this policy, in effect when Barker was killed, bound Liberty to \u201cpay on behalf of . . . [Magoun] all sums which . . . [Magoun] shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury . . . including death . . . resulting therefrom . . . caused by accident and arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined.\u201d Under the heading \u201cDefinition of Hazards,\u201d division 1 of the policy reads, \u201cpremises \u2014 operations \u2014 The . . . use of premises and all operations necessary or incidental thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the heading \u201cExclusions\u201d ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>pears a provision (for convenience referred to as the \u201cloading exclusion\u201d) which reads, \u201cThis policy does not apply: (a) under division 1 of the [definition of [h]azards, to the . . . use, including loading or unloading, of ... (2) automobiles while away from such premises or the ways immediately adjoining . . ..\u201d The word \u201cautomobile\u201d is defined as \u201ca land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer,\u201d with certain exceptions not relevant. This definition plainly includes a truck. The policy, under the heading, \u201cDefense, Settlement, Supplementary Payments,\u201d contained also an agreement by Liberty to defend Magoun, the pertinent portion of which appears in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On May 22, 1951, \u201cMagoun was engaged in removing steel joists from railroad cars ... on premises [at 1670 Hyde Park Avenue] owned and controlled exclusively by\u201d a railroad. \u201cThe . . . [railroad] premises properly were being used by Magoun in loading the steel joists onto trucks to be used in connection with the erection of the . . . [s]chool. The . . . [railroad] premises were not adjoining premises of Magoun,\u201d whose employees were doing the unloading and placing the joists on Magoun\u2019s trucks and \u201con a truck owned by C. E. Hall &amp; Sons, which truck and a driver were hired by Magoun to help fulfill his job as a subcontractor. . . . Barker, the operator of the . . . [Hall] truck, was killed on the . . . [railroad] premises . . . when joists, which were loaded on the . . . [Hall] truck by employees of Magoun, fell upon him from that truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Prompt oral and written notice of the accident was given to Liberty. On August 29, 1951, Liberty wrote to Magoun, \u201c[W]e are handling this claim under full reservation of rights under your policy contract with us. Our investigation to date indicates that . . . Barker\u2019s death arose out of the loading of the 0. E. Hall truck. Tour policy contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>with us does not provide protection to you under these circumstances.\u201d The letter then quoted the loading exclusion and continued, \u201cPlease forward promptly . . . any correspondence or legal papers which may be served on you in order that we may review them to be sure that we give you all the protection to which you are entitled under the terms of your policy of insurance.\u201d Subsequently, \u201can action of law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was brought by . . . [Barker\u2019s] [administratrix . . . against Magoun and others. Liberty . . . notified Magoun that it was willing to undertake the defense of the action under the reservation set forth above. Magoun was unwilling to have Liberty represent it under the terms of that reservation and so notified Liberty. As a result, Magoun hired his own counsel to handle the defense of the . . . tort action. Counsel for Liberty thereafter cooperated with the counsel retained by Magoun in the defense of the . . . tort action,\u201d in which it \u201cwas found . . . that the employees of Magoun negligently caused the death of . . . Barker .... The tort action resulted in a final judgment on October 6, 1958, for Magoun on the ground that the <em>\u2018 </em>common employment\u2019 doctrine . . . [see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, as amended through St. 1939, c. 93; see also <em>McPadden </em>v. <em>W. J. Halloran Co. </em>338 Mass. 189,192-194] was a complete bar to recovery. . . . Magoun . . . demanded that Liberty reimburse him for the . . . reasonable amount of the legal fee . . . [of] counsel who defended the tort action. Liberty . . . refused to make such reimbursement. The fair and reasonable amount of that legal fee is $2776.76.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Liberty contends (a) that the accident occurred in circumstances within the loading exclusion, and (b) that Liberty should not be required to pay Magoun\u2019s legal expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>in view of Liberty\u2019s offer to defend Magoun in the tort action under reservation of rights, Magoun\u2019s refusal of that offer, and Liberty\u2019s surrender to Magoun of control of de-fence of the tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Liberty\u2019s basic, initial liability to defend under its agreement to do so (see fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>is determined by the allegations of the declaration in the tort action. Liberty was not required to defend unless the policy would bind it to indemnify Magoun if Barker\u2019s administratrix should prevail upon the allegations of the declaration. See <em>Fessenden School, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 124, 128-130; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>178 F. 2d 750, 751 (2d Cir.); Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1962) \u00a7\u00a7 4683-4685. The declaration in the tort action (see fn. 3, <em>supra) </em>was broad enough to require Liberty to defend Magoun, for the declaration was not sufficiently specific, at least in failing to mention that loading a truck was involved, to show that the case was within the loading exclusion. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. the <em>Fessenden School </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 129-130. Upon the allegations it could have been found that \u201chandling . . . a load of steel at the freight depot in Hyde Park\u201d was \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201d to the \u201cuse of [the school] premises\u201d under the basic hazard definition, division 1. See <em>Reed, Roller Bit Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>198 F. 2d 1, 2-3 (5th Cir.); Appleman, op. cit. \u00a7\u00a7 4493.2-4493.4, 4500; Couch, Insurance 2d, \u00a7\u00a7 44:300-44:304, 44:307. It does not necessarily follow, of course, merely because the declaration in the tort action stated a cause of action apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>within the coverage of the policy, that Liberty upon the facts actually proved upon a trial would be bound to satisfy a judgment for Barker\u2019s administratrix. The facts proved might involve no variance from the declaration and yet be clearly within the loading exclusion. Nevertheless, even if the proof would ultimately relieve Liberty from liability to indemnify Magoun against the judgment, Liberty would still be bound to defend the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The case presents a question not decided in <em>Salonen </em>v. <em>Paanenen, </em>320 Mass. 568, in respect of Liberty\u2019s attempted reservation of rights to disclaim liability under the policy while offering to defend Magoun against the tort action. In the <em>Salonen </em>case, this court pointed out (p. 572) that \u201cthe defence of an action against an insured under a so called \u2018nonwaiver\u2019 agreement will not estop the insurer from subsequently disclaiming liability.\u201d See <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>338 Mass. 139, 143. It pointed out (pp. 573-574) the dilemma confronting an insurance company, when it discovers in the course of the defence of an action that it has a probable basis for disclaiming liability. If the insurer continues to defend, without taking other action, it runs \u201cthe risk of losing its right to disclaim later.\u201d See <em>Searls </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. </em>316 Mass. 606, 608-610. If it severs \u201cits connection with the case, it . . . [runs] the risk of incurring liability to its assured\u201d for breach of the covenant to defend. See <em>Salonen </em>case, at p. 574, and cases cited. See also <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Lumber Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>297 N. Y. 148, 154. This court concluded in the <em>Salonen </em>case that an insurer, who had (p. 574) \u201cnotified the assured that it [the insurer] would thereafter defend under a reservation of rights,\u201d was not estopped to disclaim liability at a later date, at least where the assured had not been lulled into a false sense of security by action of the insurer after learning of the ground for disclaimer. The <em>Salonen </em>opinion then proceeded (p. 574), \u201cWe are not to be understood as holding that an insurer may reserve its rights to disclaim liability in a case and at the same time insist on retaining control of its defence. But here the assured never, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>learning of the company\u2019s position, offered or attempted to assume defence of the action but, for aught that appears, acquiesced in the conduct of the case by the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Liberty here made a reservation by its letter of August 29,1951, before the tort action was commenced (see <em>Marvel Heat Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>325 Mass. 682, 684-685; cf. <em>Berke Moore Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>345 Mass. 66, 70-71) and apparently also after that action began. When Magoun turned out to be \u201cunwilling to have Liberty represent it under the terms of . . . [the] reservation,\u201d Liberty did not insist upon retaining control of the defence of the tort action (cf. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart Dry Goods Co. </em>208 Ky. 429, 438-439), and merely cooperated with Magoun\u2019s counsel. For this reason and because there was no recovery by the administratrix, we need not consider whether, if Liberty had insisted both on retaining control and upon its reservation of rights, it thereafter would have been estopped to deny liability for any recovery by Barker\u2019s estate. Various decisions elsewhere so indicate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, there was no acquiescence by Magoun in having the insurer conduct the defence under the reservation, as there was by the insured in the <em>Salonen </em>case (see p. 574).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We are thus confronted with the question whether the insurer must pay the insured\u2019s legal expenses, if the insurer (a) has a substantial ground for disclaimer of liability, (b) asks for the insured\u2019s consent to its defending under a reservation of right, (c) is denied that consent, and (d) then yields control of the defence to the insured at the latter\u2019s request. Our cases have not dealt with this precise point.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The covenant to defend (see fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>does not spell out in any great detail the insurer\u2019s obligation in such cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>cumstances. It, however, must be taken to require the insurer, to the extent that the facts permit, to defend the insured at least in good faith and without negligence. See <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>339 Mass. 184, 187. See also <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Factory Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>298 Mass. 141, 143-144; Keeton, Liability Insurance and [Responsibility for Settlement, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1136, 1137-1148; Appleman, op. cit. \u00a7\u00a7 4711-4715. We assume that the insurer may reasonably protect its own interests \u201cfor its own advantage\u201d even \u201cwhere there is a conflict of interest between insurer and insured\u201d in respect of the right and duty to defend (see the <em>Abrams </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 143-144). Nevertheless, the insurer\u2019s discretion under the covenant to defend is not unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Where the insured\u2019s interest in controlling tort litigation against him conflicts with the similar interest of the insurer, the insured may have good cause to ask that he be represented by counsel independent of the insurer. The insurer, on the other hand, reasonably may be reluctant to entrust its possible obligation to indemnify to counsel not of its own selection, particularly where, as here, the obligation to defend exists largely, if not entirely, only because the declaration of the tort plaintiff is not stated in a manner revealing that the claim is not within the policy coverage. See note, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 1436, 1448; note, 2 Stanford L. Rev. 383, 387-388; annotation, 49 A. L. R. 2d 694, 700-703. See also Appleman, op. cit. \u00a7 4694.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was the recognition of this type of potential clash of interests, which led us in <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 218, 227, to permit separate representation of the insured at the expense of the insurer. See <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Meiss, </em>263 Minn. 315, 319-322. See also <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>307 F. 2d 521, 524-525 (4th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>In the present case, in view of the possible divergence of interests, the parties have at least acquiesced in defence of the insured by counsel retained by him and Liberty has cooperated in that successful defence. The agreed facts reveal no agreement or reservations concerning the cost of the independent defence. Because Liberty could have included in the covenant to defend explicit provisions concerning the cost of defence in various situations some of which have been mentioned above, we think that uncertainty should be resolved against the insurer. See the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>case, 345 Mass. 218, 226. Accordingly, we hold that, in the circumstances, the covenant to defend is broad enough to require Liberty to pay the reasonable charges of Magoun\u2019s counsel, who provided, with at least Liberty\u2019s acquiescence, the defence that Liberty itself was bound to furnish. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Lumber Mut. Gas. Ins. Co. </em>297 N. Y. 148, 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> Operations classifications specified included \u201cIron, or Steel Erection \u2014 frame structures, iron work on outside of buildings including erecting or repairing balconies, fire-escapes, railings, staircases, coal chutes or fireproof shutters\u201d (Code No. 3452) and Iron or Steel Erection \u2014 N[ot], O[therwise].
