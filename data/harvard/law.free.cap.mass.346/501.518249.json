L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79, \u00a7 14, for a taking of about eleven acres of the petitioner\u2019s land in the town of Sheffield. The case is here on exceptions of the petitioner to the admission and exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">The land taken formed part of a parcel of about twenty-four acres, all of which was \u201cgravel bearing land.\u201d Th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>petitioner OAvned additional land to the east and south of this parcel. The \u201chighest and best use\u201d of the land at the time of the taking was \u201cfor a gravel bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The petitioner excepted to the exclusion of evidence of a royalty agreement in effect at the time of the taking. This agreement provided for payment of a certain price for gravel removed from the twenty-four acre parcel. He also excepted to the exclusion of evidence of the fair market value, at the time of the taking, of \u201cgravel in the bank\u201d in the area taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The petitioner cites the cases of <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>155 Mass. 35, and <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>220 Mass. 312, 318, and maintains that under these decisions the court was in error in excluding the evidence. In the <em>Providence (B Worcester </em>case the question of whether evidence showing \u201cthe value of the gravel as it lay in the bank\u201d was admissible was not before this court, since an exception had not been taken to its admission. In the <em>Wellington </em>case there was no assertion that the trial judge was bound to admit this evidence. To the contrary, this court stated that where land and gravel beds Avere taken evidence of the value of the unexcavated gravel was \u201cadmissible in the discretion of the court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">This court recently considered the question whether a trial judge could exclude evidence of the value of the separable material in determining the compensation to be paid to the owner of a gravel bed which had been taken by the Commonwealth. We held that such evidence might be confusing and speculative and that its exclusion was within the \u201cwise exercise of discretion\u201d of the trial judge. <em>Joseph De Vries &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>339 Mass. 663, 664-665. There was no error in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The petitioner also excepted to the exclusion of evidence of the prices at which gravel bearing land immediately contiguous to the area taken, and \u201cidentical\u201d therewith, was sold within a few months of the taking. The land was sold in two parcels. One had an area of one fifth of an acre and \u25a0 the other, an area of forty acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The respondent\u2019s principal argument against the admission of this evidence appears to be based upon the size of the lots sold and that \u201c [t]his difference is a strong factor in determining whether the parcels were similar.\u201d This court held that where the respondent took a thirty acre tract, the petitioner\u2019s evidence of the sale price of lots which had been subdivided from a similar tract was admissible. <em>Fourth Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Mass. 66, 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The sale price of comparable property may be admitted in evidence as bearing on the value of the property taken. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>149 Mass. 346, 350-351. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>173 Mass. 100,104. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>252 Mass. 311, 312. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>317 Mass. 393, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We note that the contiguous land was operated as a gravel bed; that there was no difference in the material excavated ; that the depth of the gravel was the same throughout the area; and that the general topography of the area was the same. We conclude that it was error to exclude this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The petitioner\u2019s final exception relates to the admission of testimony of one Clarence Dohoney who testified for the respondent. Dohoney recited his qualifications and then gave his opinion as to the value of the land taken. While Dohoney had an extensive background in real estate appraisals he had, however, appraised only one other gravel bed. Generally it is within the discretion of the trial judge to determine whether to admit the testimony of an expert. <em>Joseph De Vries &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>665. <em>Conness </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Mass. 541, 544. Compare <em>Lee Lime Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>337 Mass. 433, 437. We are unable to say that the trial judge abused his discretion in concluding that Dohoney was qualified to give an expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
