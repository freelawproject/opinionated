See G-. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 5 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 558, \u00a7 3); \u00a7 18 (as amended through St. 1938, e. 445, \u00a7 12). The judge filed a report of the material facts found by him. A final d\u00e9cree was entered dismissing the bill. The plaintiff appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On or about May 15, 1961, the plaintiff met one Endler, a registered representative of the defendants, at Fort Dev-ens, where both were enlisted men briefly on army reserve duty. The plaintiff said that \u201che was not unwilling to engage in the purchase of low-priced speculations,\u201d and asked Endler if he knew of any. Endler mentioned a low priced over-the-counter stock, Triumph Storecrafters. The plaintiff asked Endler to find out the price. Later Endler telephoned the defendants\u2019 Boston office and learned that the stock was selling between $5.50 and $6 a share. The following day Endler reported this to the plaintiff, who told Endler to buy 100 shares with a limit of $6. Endler telephoned the order to the Boston office, which telegraphed it to the defendants\u2019 New York office, which bought 100 shares at $5.50 from a firm known as Gregory <em>&amp; </em>Company. The New York office confirmed the execution of the transaction to the Boston office, and sent the plaintiff a written confirmation of the purchase as his agent. Later delivery was made, and the plaintiff paid $550 for the stock and a commission of $12.50 to the defendants. The defendants operate a brokerage business limited to buying and selling stocks on orders of customers on a commission basis. They did not own any Triumph Storecrafters stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Upon these facts the judge ruled that the case is governed by <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Hornblower, </em>294 Mass. 26; that the defendants were the agents of the plaintiff in buying the stock; that there was no solicitation of the plaintiff to buy; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>there was no sale by the defendants to the plaintiff; and that the plaintiff had not sustained the burden of proof of establishing such a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">General Laws c. 110A, inserted by St. 1932, c. 290, \u00a7 1, provides in part in \u00a7 5: \u201cNo security, not exempt under section four, shall be sold, except as exempted by section three, within this commonwealth, until there shall have been filed with the commission a notice of intention to sell the security in question . . ..\u201d In the definitions in \u00a7 2 of c. 110A \u201csale,\u201d \u201csell,\u201d and \u201csold\u201d shall include \u201csolicitation, looking to a sale.\u201d The issue is whether there was a sale, or solicitation looking to a sale, by the defendants to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The facts found by the judge were fully justified, if not required, by the evidence and wholly preclude most of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments. Completely decisive are the findings that there was no solicitation of the plaintiff nor any sale by the defendants to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The judge correctly ruled that the case is governed by <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Hornblower, </em>294 Mass. 26, the facts of which are indistinguishable from those in the case at bar. There the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix gave to the defendants, a firm of Boston stockbrokers, an order to buy 500 shares of Electric Bond and Share Company. The defendants were in no way interested in promoting the sale of that stock, and had not given notice of intention to sell under G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 5. Purchase was made on the New York Curb Exchange, of which the defendants were members, and certificates in the name of the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix were delivered to her in Boston. In deciding for the defendants it was said: \u201cIn ordinary speech, the transaction . . . would not be described as a \u2018sale\u2019 of stock by the defendants to the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix. Rather, the defendants were her agents to buy stock. Reported cases tend to show that the law takes the same view of the transaction [pp. 28-29]. . . . [T]he essence of the transaction was a purchase for the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix and not a sale by the defendants to her [p. 30]. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s efforts to distinguish the <em>Gill </em>case are too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>specious to merit protracted discussion. In <em>Kneeland </em>v. <em>Emerton, </em>280 Mass. 371, and <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Bond &amp; Goodwin Inc. </em>285 Mass. 117, there was no agency. Both were cited in the <em>Gill </em>case. They do not aid the plaintiff. Certain amendments to c. 110A do not affect the question before us. St. 1932, c. 290, \u00a7 1. St. 1938, c. 445. St. 1954, c. 558. We do not agree that the Legislature has shown an intent to include both principal and agent transactions within the word \u2018 \u2018 sale. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed ivifh costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
