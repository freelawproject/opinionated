Mallett. In his declaration the plaintiff alleged that he and the defendant entered into an oral contract whereby the plaintiff was to <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>take all steps necessary to the successful settlement of . . . [the case of Maz-zola v. Mallett] and, if necessary, and only if necessary, to try the said case, \u2019 \u2019 for which he was to receive an amount equal to one third of the defendant\u2019s fee; that the \u201cplaintiff undertook the entire prosecution of such case, interviewed witnesses, visited the locus of the accident . . . and took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>divers other steps pursuant to the said agreement\u201d; and that \u201cwithout either the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff\u201d the defendant settled the case and, although requested, has failed to pay to the plaintiff any portion of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $6,948, which was recorded under leave reserved. Thereafter, the judge entered a verdict for the defendant, and the correctness of this action presents the sole question for decision. That question is the same as where a verdict has been directed. <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Blomerth, </em>312 Mass. 299, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s version of the alleged contract is as follows: About May 1, 1959, the defendant told the plaintiff that he had a \u201cbig case\u201d which he wanted the plaintiff to handle and that he would be paid an amount equivalent to a third of the defendant\u2019s fee. The plaintiff said, \u201cAll right. It\u2019s all right with me.\u201d The plaintiff asked to see the police officer thought to be involved in the case but was told by the defendant that this would not be necessary. He made two telephone calls to Dr. Kozol, one of the doctors who had treated the child who was the plaintiff in the tort case, and discussed his injuries. He consulted the attorney \u201cfor the Archdiocese to make the arrangements to produce the Nun [as a witness], if necessary. \u2019 \u2019 He visited the scene of the accident where he made certain observations, and thereafter was taken by the defendant\u2019s son to talk with the child\u2019s grandmother. Subsequently, the plaintiff \u201clearned from the newspapers\u201d that the case had been tried and he called the defendant on the telephone and stated, \u201cI read in the paper that the Mazzola case is settled for . . . ($59,000) .... I was in your office yesterday afternoon while you were in the process of settling it. You told me nothing about it. I am going to look for my fee.\u201d The plaintiff never filed an appearance in the tort case, never got in touch with the defendant in that case, and did not participate in the settlement of the case because, as the plaintiff said, he \u201cwas prohibited from it\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t get the opportunity.\u201d He had no written memorandum concerning the case as the \u201cmemorandum . . . [was] in . . . [his] mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>There was evidence that the institution of the tort action and the various steps in the proceeding were performed by the defendant. There was a trial lasting several days in which the defendant, but not the plaintiff, participated. Before the completion of the trial the case was settled for the sum of $59,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We hold that if there was a contract it was bilateral and that the plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proving performance. On his own testimony the plaintiff \u201cnever got in touch with anyone representing the defendant [Mal-lett], took no steps at all with the defendant [Mallett], and did nothing regarding the settlement of the . . . [case].\u201d And there is nothing to show that he was prevented by any act of the defendant from performing his undertaking. The bald conclusion of the plaintiff, mentioned above, that he was \u201cprohibited\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t get the opportunity,\u201d when read with all the evidence, cannot fairly be said to be proof of prevention of performance on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
