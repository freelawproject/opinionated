Plaintiffs, former employees of Oxford Automotive U.A.W. Local 2088 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), challenge the United States Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cLabor\u201d) negative determination in Notice of Negative Determination on Reconsideration on Remand, 67 Fed. Reg. 70,464 (Dep\u2019t Labor 2002) [hereinafter Second Remand Determination] (denying Plaintiffs\u2019 certification of eligibility for North American Free Tirade Agreement-Transitional Adjustment Assistance (\u201cNAFTA-TAA\u201d)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that Labor\u2019s determination is contrary to law and not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>record. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek to set aside this determination and obtain a court order requiring Labor to certify Plaintiffs as eligible for NAFTA-TAA benefits.

In June 2000, Oxford\u2019s Argos, Indiana location (\u201cArgos facility\u201d) began laying off workers, and layoffs continued until the facility closed in June 2001. PARI at 28.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Labor claims that layoffs were attributable to the Argos facility\u2019s primary customer ceasing production,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while Plaintiffs contend layoffs were due to Oxford\u2019s decision to transfer an 180-inch press line to Mexico. PARI at 2, 19, 45. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>Argos facility was engaged in the production of various types of automobile and truck parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-4\">On December 4, 2000, Plaintiffs requested certification for NAFTA-TAA benefits through the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (\u201cstate agency\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> NAFTA-TAA benefits, which are available to eligible workers, include \u201cemployment services, appropriate training, job search and relocation allowances, and income support payments.\u201d See Former Employees of Chevron Prods. Co. v. United States Sec\u2019y of Labor, No. 00-08-00409, Slip Op. 03-96 at 3 n.2 (July 28, 2003) (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(d); Statement of Administrative Action Accompanying NAFTA Implementation Act, H.R. Doc. No. 103-159, vol 1 at 673-674 (1993)). Plaintiffs sought certification under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-5\">A group of workers . . . shall be certified to be eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under this subpart... if the Secretary determines that a significant number or proportion of workers in such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-6\">(A) that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-7\">(I) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-8\">(ii) imports from Mexico or Canada of like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision have increased, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-9\">(iii) the increase in imports under clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers separation or threat of separation and to the decline in the sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1516-10\">(B) <em>that there has been a shift in production by such workers\u2019 firm, or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1516-11\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 (emphasis added). In their petition, Plaintiffs alleged that their job losses were due to a shift in production to Mexico and loss of sales to customers who were importing products from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>Mexico. PARI at 2. Plaintiffs further specified that articles affected by the shift in production included the \u201c \u2018180 inch Automated Press Line\u2019for \u2018car side panels.\u2019 \u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-4\">On December 21, 2000, the state agency conducted a preliminary investigation into Plaintiffs\u2019 petition and submitted its findings to Labor for review and final determination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On February 20, 2001, Labor determined that Plaintiffs produced \u201cautomotive side panels\u201d and denied them NAFTA-TAA certification of eligibility, concluding that layoffs were attributable not to a shift in production from the Argos facility to Mexico, but instead to \u201cthe customer\u2019s decision to take back the production of side panels ... at the customer [\u2019s] U.S. plants.\u201d PARI at 19; Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance, 66 Fed. Reg. 10,916, 10,917 (Dep\u2019t Labor 2001). In addition to the state agency\u2019s findings, Labor\u2019s investigation was based on a letter from and two telephone conversations with Oxford\u2019s representatives.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1517-6\">In response to denial of their petition, Plaintiffs asked Labor to reconsider its decision. In support of their request for reconsideration, Plaintiffs attached an Oxford Appropriation Request Form, which showed Argos\u2019 request for $60,000 to reassemble an 180-inch line \u201cfor transfer to another Oxford Automobile plant in Mexico.\u201d PARI at 48. On May 9, 2001, Labor denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for administrative reconsideration, because \u201csome of the machinery was sent to Mexico, [but] ... it was not being used.\u201d Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration, 66 Fed. Reg. 23,732 (Dep\u2019t Labor 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-7\">On June 13, 2001, appearing <em>pro se </em>before this court, Plaintiffs sought judicial review of Labor\u2019s negative determinations. On August 28, 2001, the court granted Labor\u2019s consent motion for a voluntary remand. See Former Employees of Oxford Automotive v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, No. 01-00453 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Aug. 22, 2001). Labor\u2019s remand investigation consisted of sending an email to Oxford to determine whether it had imported side panels from Mexico or Canada. See Notice of Negative Determination on Reconsideration on Remand; PAR2 at 4-6. Oxford responded negatively and on October 19, 2001, Labor again denied Plaintiffs\u2019 petition. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-8\">In March 2002, Plaintiffs were appointed counsel, and on June 28, 2002, they contested Labor\u2019s negative determination and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>again granted Labor a voluntary remand. See Former Employees of Oxford Automotive, No. 01 \u2014 00453 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Aug. 20, 2002). On November 22, 2002, Labor affirmed its negative determination of Plaintiffs\u2019 eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA benefits, explaining that \u201c[a]lthough some of the machinery from the Argos plant had been moved to Mexico . . . [it] was idle. The layoffs at the plant were attributable to the customer\u2019s decision to take back the production of the side panels.\u201d Second Remand Determination. Labor based its decision on information it received from Oxford, including a list of products sold to Argos facility\u2019s primary customer. Labor also obtained verbal confirmation from the primary customer that all products it previously purchased from the Argos facility were subsequently purchased from other domestic Oxford facilities. Id. Finally, Oxford informed Labor that the 180-inch press line and two other major presses (10 presses total and one blanking press), that were transferred to Mexico, were never been put into production. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-5\">I. A Remand is Necessary</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-6\">In a NAFTA-TAA case, the court \u201cfor good cause shown, may remand the case to [Labor] to take further evidence.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(b). In this case, Labor\u2019s determination denying Plaintiffs NAFTA-TAA eligibility warrants a remand because: (1) Labor failed to comply with the applicable statute; and (2) the administrative record does not include relevant evidence submitted by Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-7\">A. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-8\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1), for workers to be certified as eligible for NAFTA-TAA benefits, Labor must determine that there was either: (A) an increase in imports from Mexico or Canada which contributed to workers separation; or (B) \u201ca shift in production by such workers\u2019 firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1)(A) \u2014 (B). At issue here is subsection (B). In its Second Remand Determination and Response (\u201cLabor Resp.\u201d), Labor asserted that Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the requirements under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1)(A) or (B). Plaintiffs have made it clear, however, that subsection (A) is not applicable; they challenge only Labor\u2019s ruling regarding subsection (B) \u2014 whether there was a \u201cshift in production\u201d to Mexico. Pls.\u2019 Second Mot, for J. on Agency R. at 13-14 (\u201cPis.\u2019 Second Mot.\u201d). Labor\u2019s lengthy arguments regarding 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(a)(1)(A) are therefore not relevant in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>Furthermore, Labor\u2019s determination that Plaintiffs are ineligible to apply for NAFTA-TAA benefits under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1)(B) is not supported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with the law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-4\">1. \u201cLike or directly competitive\u201d articles</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-5\">The statute requires Labor to determine whether articles produced in Mexico are \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with articles formerly produced by plaintiffs at U.S. facilities. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2231(a)(1)(B). Rather than applying the \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d standard here, however, Labor incorrectly focused on \u201cproduct scope.\u201d Its findings are therefore inconsistent with the law. See Former Employees of Gen. Elec. Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 14 CIT 608, 611 (1990) (noting that an agency\u2019s rulings made on the basis of factual findings must be \u201cin accordance with the statute\u201d) (quoting Int\u2019l Union v. Marshall, 584 F.2d 390, 396 n.26); see also Abbott v. Donovan, 6 CIT 92, 100, 570 F. Supp. 41, 49 (1983) (noting that \u201cthe court will reject the agency\u2019s interpretation or application of a statute when it is inconsistent with the legislative purpose of the statute or frustrates Congress\u2019 intent\u201d). On remand, Labor must make its determination based on the statute. Labor must first accurately identify the articles produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility, and then determine whether Oxford\u2019s facilities in Mexico produced \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-6\">First, Labor must accurately identify the articles produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility. In its Second Remand Determination, Labor found that Plaintiffs produced \u201cautomotive side panels.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But in making this determination, Labor failed to consider evidence in the administrative record regarding the automobile parts production process. In order to accurately identify the articles produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility, Labor must have an understanding of this industry. See Gropper v. Donovan, 6 CIT 103, 104, 569 F. Supp. 883, 884 (1983) (reviewing textile manufacturing process to affirm that knit fabric garments are not \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with finished fabric); United Rubber, etc, v. Donovan, 652 F.2d 702, 704 (7th Cir. 1981) (examining assembly of and uses for rubber and metal components to determine whether imported mounts are \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with domestic bushings); United Shoe Workers of Am. v. Bedell, 506 F.2d 174, 186-87 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>ing stage of processing to determine shoe components are not \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with shoes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim involves the transfer of an \u201c180-inch automated press line\u201d to Mexico. PARI at 2. Labor should therefore investigate how this press line operates. Plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit A describes the world\u2019s largest hydraulic tandem press line, stating that it \u201cwill produce complete body sides for automobiles and pickups for various customers.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is clear from this information that press lines are designed to produce many different kinds of parts, for various vehicles, and to adapt to new models as they are introduced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is therefore likely that workers on a press line could be involved in the production of a variety of parts for different car models.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On remand, in order to accurately determine the articles produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility, Labor should examine how the 180-inch press line functioned and determine the variety of articles it produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-5\">Second, after identifying the articles produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility, the statute requires Labor to determine whether they are \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with those produced in Mexico. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(a)(1)(B). Labor failed, however, to even inquire into the articles Oxford produced in Mexico, and instead relied erroneously on unverified statements by Oxford that the press lines transferred there were never used.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On remand, in investigating whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>the articles produced in Mexico are \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with those produced by Plaintiffs at the Argos facility, Labor must follow TAA regulations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1521-3\">Pursuant to TAA regulations, \u201clike articles\u201d are defined as \u201cthose which are substantially identical in inherent or intrinsic characteristics (i.e., materials from which the articles are made, appearance, quality, texture, etc.);\u201d and \u201cdirectly competitive articles\u201d are \u201cthose which, although not substantially identical in their inherent or intrinsic characteristics, are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (i.e., adapted to the same uses and essentially interchangeable therefor).\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2 (2002). In addition, under case law governing TAA cases, \u201cit is well established that an imported article is \u2018like or directly competitive\u2019 with a domestic product if it is \u2018interchangeable with or substitutable for\u2019 the article under investigation.\u201d Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 10 CIT 524, 527, 642 F. Supp. 1183, 1186 (1986). See also Bedell, 506 F.2d at 185 (noting that the terms \u201clike\u201d and \u201cdirectly competitive\u201d are not synonymous or explanatory of one another and that \u201cmany products can be directly competitive without having identical or nearly identical physical characteristics\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-4\">As discussed above, the Argos facility\u2019s press lines had the capacity to produce various automobile parts, including \u201c \u2018car side panels\u2019. . . [and car] tunnel [s].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> PARI at 2. And, Oxford\u2019s Mexico facility was producing \u201cthe door, hood, and underbody assemblies for a new [customer] program.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Form 10-K at 3, 15. Under the statute, therefore, Labor must determine whether car side panels and tunnels are \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d with car doors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>underbodies. 19 U.S.C. '\u00a7 2231(a)(1)(B). Moreover, pursuant to TAA regulations, Labor must widen its focus from \u201cautomotive side panels\u201d to encompass the variety of articles produced by Plaintiffs at theArgos facility that may be \u201csubstantially identical in inherent or intrinsic characteristics\u201d or \u201cadapted to the same uses\u201d as the products produced by Oxford in Mexico. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">2. \u201cShift in production by such workers\u2019 firm\u201d to Mexico</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">The statute also requires Labor to determine whether there has been a \u201cshift in production by such workers\u2019 firm or subdivision to Mexico\u201d of \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d articles. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Because Labor focused here on the primary customer\u2019s shift of production within the United States, rather than properly investigating whether Oxford shifted production of \u201clike or directly competitive\u201d articles to its Mexico facility, its findings are inconsistent with the statute. Labor itself noted that \u201cany shift in production is required to have been made by Oxford Automotive or its subdivision.\u201d Labor Resp. at 25. Moreover, Labor\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with its own precedents. In a recent NAFTA-TAA case, Labor denied workers reconsideration of a negative determination because it was based on the \u201callegation that \u2018a major customer . . . switched its] purchases . . . from the subject firm in favor of producing the products at the customer\u2019s affiliated location in Mexico.\u2019 \u201d Fernandez v. Chao, No. 02-00183, Slip Op. 03-123 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Sept. 17, 2003) (quoting Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration, 67 Fed. Reg. 35,157 (Dep\u2019t Labor 2002)). Thus, in previous NAFTA-TAA cases, a shift in production by a customer of the workers\u2019 firm was found to be insufficient to constitute a \u201cshift in production by such workers\u2019 firm or subdivision.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(a)(1)(B). Labor\u2019s focus here on the primary customer\u2019s shift in production of automotive side panels is other than its settled position. Because Labor\u2019s findings are not in accordance with the statute, and because Labor failed to \u201cfollow its existing precedents or provide a reasonable explanation for its deviation or noncompliance,\u201d a remand is necessary. W. Conference of Teamsters v. Brock, 13 CIT 169, 181, 709 F. Supp. 1159, 1169 (1989) (quoting ILWU Local 142 v. Donovan, 9 CIT 620, 625 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-6\">B. Extra-Record Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-7\">Plaintiffs contend that exhibits attached to their motions, although \u201cextra-record evidence,. . . clearly demonstrate! ] that [Labor\u2019s] investigation of Plaintiffs\u2019 petition has been inadequate and has ignored factors relevant to [its] determination.\u201d Pl. Reply at 7. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>Plaintiffs therefore ask the court to consider the documents. Labor, on the other hand, argues that because it \u201cdid not consider that information . . . [nor] include those documents in its second remand supplemental record,\u201d the court should disregard Plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits. Labor Resp. at 8. Labor contends that even if the exhibits were considered, the \u201cnon-record evidence . . . does not conclusively demonstrate\u201d that Plaintiffs are eligible for certification. Id. at 25-26. In Former Employees of Tyco Elecs. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1330 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2003), the court held that \u201cLabor\u2019s rejection of. . . information voluntarily submitted by the Plaintiffs was a result of Labor\u2019s arbitrary and capricious treatment of [the] . . . investigation.\u201d Similarly here, Labor\u2019s failure to examine Plaintiffs\u2019 relevant submissions and offer any satisfactory explanation for its actions renders its findings arbitrary and capricious. See Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">On June 28, 2002, Plaintiffs\u2019 filed their first motion and exhibits A, B and C with the court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Labor was therefore aware of these documents prior to taking a voluntary remand and conducting further investigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See Former Employees of Oxford Automotive, No. 01-00453 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Aug. 20, 2002) (granting second voluntary remand). During its remand investigation, Labor considered additional evidence from Oxford and its primary customer, which it included in a supplemental administrative record. At the same time, however, Labor refused to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits. It is unfair for Labor to consider submissions from one party while ignoring those from another. Furthermore, \u201cbecause of the <em>ex parte </em>nature of the certification process, and the remedial purpose of the trade adjustment assistance program, [Labor] is obliged to conduct [its] investigation with the utmost regard for the interests of the petitioning workers.\u201d Stidham v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 11 CIT 548, 551, 669 F. Supp. 432, 435 (1987) (citing Abbott v. Donovan, 7 CIT 323, 327-28, 588 F. Supp. 1438, 1442 (1984)). By ignoring Plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits here, Labor failed to fully \u201cinvestigate whether [Plaintiffs] are members of a group which Congress intended to benefit from the [NAFTA-TAA] legislation,\u201d and a remand is necessary. Former Employees of Barry Callebaut v. Herman, 240 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1228 (Ct.

Although a court cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>substitute its judgment for that of an agency, \u201cthe agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019 \u201d Former Employees of Alcatel Telecomms.

Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits include information about press lines in the automotive industry and facts about Oxford\u2019s Mexico facility.

Labor\u2019s findings must be in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(a)(1)(B) and must consider all relevant evidence.
