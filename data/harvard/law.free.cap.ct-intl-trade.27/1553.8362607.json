In <em>China National Machinery Import &amp; Export Corp. v. United States, </em>27 CIT_, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1229 (2003) <em>(\u201cCMC I\u201d), </em>familiarity with which is presumed, the court sustained in part and remanded in part the Department\u2019s determination with respect to Plaintiff China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (\u201cCMC\u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u201d) in <em>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of 1999-2000 Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Determination Not to Revoke Order in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 57,420 (Nov. 15, 2001) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-13\">Plaintiff CMC is an exporter of the subject merchandise, tapered roller bearings (\u201cTRBs\u201d), from the People\u2019s Republic of China, a non-market economy (\u201cNME\u201d) country. The dispute involves the prices of a steel input, hot-rolled alloy steel bar, which CMC purchased from its supplier in [[ ]], a market economy country, and used in the production of TRBs sold to the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>CMC I, </em>the court held that, if Commerce had \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that he supplier\u2019s prices were subsidized, Commerce could employ surrogate values instead of actual prices in normal value (\u201cNY\u201d) calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>tions of dumping margins where it determines that such prices are best information available under the statute. <em>See CMC I </em>at 1238; <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l) (2000) (providing the use of \u201cthe best available information\u201d concerning the values for factors of production of an exporter in an NME country); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-576, at 590 (1988), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1623 <em>(\u201cHouse Report?\u2019) </em>(instructing Commerce to avoid using <em>any </em>price \u201cwhich it has reason to believe or suspect may be dumped or subsidized\u201d) (emphasis supplied). In <em>CMC I, </em>the court stated that it will \u201caffirm Commerce\u2019s actions if, given the entire record as a whole, there is substantial, specific, and objective evidence which could reasonably be interpreted to support a suspicion that the prices CMC paid to its market economy supplier were distorted.\u201d <em>CMC I </em>at 1240. Applying the standard to the facts of the case, the court found that Commerce did not sufficiently explain and highlight evidence in support of its determinations in the <em>Final Results. Id. </em>Consequently, the court remanded the case to Commerce to review and augment the administrative record and explain its determinations further. <em>See id. </em>at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-4\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, Commerce issued its <em>Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Remand </em>(May 13, 2003) <em>(\u201cRemand Results\u201d). </em>Plaintiff CMC and Defendant-Intervenor The Timken Company (\u201cTimken\u201d) timely responded to the <em>Remand Results. </em>In this matter the court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court must uphold Commerce\u2019s determination if it is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, the administrative record, and all other papers and proceedings, the court is satisfied that the <em>Remand Results </em>are in adequate compliance with the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, the court sustains the <em>Remand Results.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-6\">Commerce has a duty to calculate dumping margins as accurately as possible and should typically refrain from using surrogate values (which in themselves are imperfect substitutes) in dumping margin calculations where market-determined values are available. <em>See Lasko Metal Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1442, 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Consistent with this mandate, the applicable regulation advises Commerce to employ actual market values, where available, for NV calculations of an NME exporter, under normal circumstances. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1) (2000). On the other hand, as this court pointed out in <em>CMC I, </em>Commerce cannot be compelled to use actual prices where it has reason to believe or suspect that such prices are subsidized. <em>See CMC I </em>at 1238. The court must look to the facts of record in the case to determine whether Commerce has suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>cient reasons to suspect that actual prices are distorted such that the substitution of actual prices with surrogate values is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-3\">The court notes that, until the twelfth administrative review of this antidumping duty order, Commerce employed actual prices paid in its dumping margin calculations. During the twelfth review, Commerce determined that such prices were likely to be distorted by subsidies and should therefore be abandoned in favor of surrogate values. Commerce based its determination on a generally available and countervailable subsidy program in the exporting country, uncovered in countervailing duty investigations from the 1999-2000 period involving subject merchandise other than hot-rolled alloy steel bar and companies other than CMC\u2019s supplier. After remand, Commerce supplemented the record with an Office of Policy Memorandum (dated February 2002), which memorializes Commerce\u2019s decision to abandon steel-related factor input prices from the exporting country, as well as two other countries. In this memorandum, Commerce explains that these countries maintain \u201cbroadly available, non-industry specific export subsidies,\u201d and adds that, where Commerce already conducted a countervailing duty investigation, \u201cthe facts of the underlying investigation must be examined and taken into account.\u201d In the <em>Remand Results, </em>Commerce maintains that the exporting country provides \u201cindustry specific subsidies and non-industry specific export <em>subsidies.\u201dRemand Results </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-4\">In <em>CMC I, </em>this court articulated three specific grounds in finding Commerce\u2019s offered reasons insufficient. First, neither the subject merchandise in question, nor CMC\u2019s supplier was ever specifically investigated in a countervailing duty investigation. Accordingly, the level of distortion, if any, in the price of hot-rolled alloy steel bar by reason of subsidies was never determined. Second, in the <em>Final Results </em>Commerce relied on an internal confidential memorandum, <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>(Nov. 7, 2001), as justification for its change of methodology. The court was concerned that numbers tabulated (without explanation in that memorandum) as the level of subsidies for steel products from the exporting country appeared to be very low. In other words, it seemed to the court that, even in affirmative countervailing duty determinations for other steel products, the range of subsidy values barely exceeded <em>de minimis </em>amounts at the upper limit. Specifically, [[ ]]. Third, one of the countervailing duty investigations from the 1999-2000 period pertaining to the exporting country yielded a negative result. <em>See </em>[[ ]]. That is, Commerce found with respect to the merchandise subject to that investigation that the countervailable subsidy rate was <em>de minimis. </em>In sum, the court was reluctant to allow Commerce to choose imprecise surrogate values over actual prices without further justification where evidence of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>tortion in prices CMC paid to its market economy supplier fell short of substantial, specific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-3\">In the <em>Remand Results, </em>Commerce emphasizes that CMC\u2019s supplier is a \u201cmember of a subsidized industry\u201d and \u201ccould have benefit-ted\u201d from subsidies generally available in the exporting country for exporters of steel products, regardless of the type of product or com-: pany, and further emphasizes that such subsidies were specifically found to be utilized by several steel producers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Remand Results </em>at 9, 12-13. The existence of these subsidies was confirmed in the Department\u2019s 1999-2000 countervailing duty determinations. Commerce offers that there is no evidence in the record that CMC\u2019s supplier \u201cwas not eligible to participate\u201d in subsidy programs. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Commerce points to its long standing agency policy to disregard suspected distorted prices. <em>Id. </em>at 9 \u2014 10. Commerce and Defendant-Intervenor Timken further point out that the company subject to the negative countervailing duty determination constitutes an \u201canomaly\u201d in that it is the largest steel producer in the exporting country and is government-controlled. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15 n.16; <em>Def.-Intervenor\u2019s Rebuttal to Pl.\u2019s Comments on Commerce Dep\u2019t\u2019s Remand Redetermination (\u201cTimken Br\u201d) </em>at 4; <em>see also CMC I </em>at 1240 (dictating Commerce to explain why this producer\u2019s case is an anomaly). That company is also known to participate in the subsidy programs as a provider, such as engaging in [[ ]]. Commerce further states that companies that were recipients of the subsidy programs and that were subject to the Department\u2019s positive countervailing duty determinations are more representative of CMC\u2019s supplier. <em>Remand Results </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">Commerce explains that it is reasonable to believe that \u201ca market company operating under normal [i.e., competitive] market principles would take advantage of. . . benefits\u201d that are made available to it. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 13. Commerce stresses that export subsidy programs in the steel industry of the exporting country were \u201ccontingent on a company\u2019s export performance\u201d and were not otherwise restricted. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Commerce argues that \u201c[ujnless a particular market supplier has been found to have <em>de minimis </em>subsidy benefits, . . . the specific level of subsidization is not a relevant consideration in [its] analysis of whether there is reason to believe or suspect that prices may be subsidized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-6\">With respect to level of subsidization, Defendant-Intervenor Timken adds that \u201c[n]othing in the statute or regulation, or even the legislative history, speaks in terms of subsidy <em>sizes </em>so far as input values are concerned.\u201d <em>Timken Br. </em>at 5-6 (emphasis in the original). Timken therefore avers that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of which values to use in the calculation of NV in an NME country context is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>\u201csubject only to reasonableness review.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6. Timken contends that the agency acted reasonably because it \u201clooked to legislative history to construe and administer the statute and regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the <em>House Report </em>speaks of discarding \u201cany\u201d distorted price, Timken\u2019s argument implies that such mandate includes actual prices paid on market.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1573-3\">Plaintiff CMC responds that Commerce\u2019s explanations of the <em>Remand Results </em>merely consist of \u201ca re-argument of the case based on the same record facts that this Court already found insufficient to justify the initial results.\u201d <em>PI. \u2019s Comments on the Dep\u2019t of Commerce\u2019s Proposed Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Remand </em>at 2. CMC argues that Commerce has failed to address the negative countervailing duty finding that undermines its conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 3. CMC contends that Commerce failed to specifically link CMC\u2019s supplier to any subsidy program. <em>Id. </em>at 5. CMC further points out that the <em>Remand Results </em>\u201calso fail to address the <em>de minimis </em>issues that the Court raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. CMC maintains that \u201cCommerce\u2019s analysis leads inevitably to a perverse result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. In particular, actual prices charged by an input supplier with a <em>de minimis </em>countervailing duty finding would be acceptable while such prices of a supplier with no countervailing duty finding (whether positive \u00f3r negative) may be disregarded based on findings relating to other suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-4\">The \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard articulated in the <em>House Report </em>by which Commerce\u2019s actions must be evaluated establishes a lower threshold than what is required to support a firm conclusion. The clarification of the standard in <em>CMC I, </em>as well as its juxtaposition with the substantial evidence standard in that opinion, does not modify the standard in terms of its demands on the agency. <em>Cf. Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1353, 985 F. Supp. 1166 (1997) (employing the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard). The court in <em>CMC I </em>maintained that the agency\u2019s actions are entitled to deference as long as the agency points to substantial, specific, and objective evidence in support of its <em>suspicion </em>that the prices are distorted. <em>CMC I </em>at 1240 (emphasis added). As Commerce notes in the <em>Remand Results, </em>a \u201creason to believe or suspect requires less evidence than an actual finding of subsidies in fact.\u201d <em>Remand Results </em>at 6. Moreover, the <em>House Report </em>specifically points out that a \u201cformal investigation\u201d is not necessary. <em>House Report </em>at 590. The statute further allows Commerce to act given \u201cbest available information.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l). Therefore, it is clear that Congress provided the agency with ample discretion to disregard suspected distorted prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">The court finds that the Department\u2019s <em>Remand Results </em>sufficiently comply with the court\u2019s remand order, even though the court acknowledges CMC\u2019s argument that Commerce\u2019s actions may indeed produce less than ideal results, and the question of whether the suspicion of subsidization at any level should warrant the use of imperfect surrogate values. The <em>Remand Results </em>are sufficient in that Commerce further explains the exporting country\u2019s subsidy programs, and why one negative countervailing duty determination is immaterial to CMC\u2019s case. It also explains why it could not determine CMC\u2019s particular subsidy level short of a formal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">Moreover, even though accurate calculation of dumping margins is an overarching goal of the antidumping duty statute, a recent decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit emphasized that such a goal must necessarily be \u201cwithin the confines of the statutes, not in derogation of a statutory provision.\u201d <em>Viraj Group, Ltd. v. United States, </em>343 F.3d 1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Analogously here, Commerce\u2019s actions are within the confines of the statute, the regulation, and the legislative history despite the fact that such actions may produce a less than precisely accurate result. As Timken points out, the statute does not specify a particular level of subsidization at which actual market prices may be discarded. In fact, the statute does not mention market prices. It is only the Department\u2019s regulation that mentions and states a preference for market prices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-6\">Under the applicable standard of review, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as long as the agency\u2019s construction of the statute is reasonable. <em>See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1565, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (noting that \u201ca court must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if the court might have preferred another\u201d) (citation omitted). Furthermore, substantial evidence \u201cis something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966) (citation omitted). Here, Commerce\u2019s actions are reasonable because a company like CMC\u2019s supplier may have benefitted from a generally available subsidy program given the competitive nature of the industry and by virtue of having engaged in foreign trade. Commerce spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>cifically found that such a program existed and companies like CMC\u2019s supplier did indeed utilize the program. Given the level of deference owed to the agency and the low threshold established by the \u201creason to belief or suspect standard,\u201d the court accordingly affirms the <em>Remand Results.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1575-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, the Department\u2019s determination in <em>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of 1999-2000 Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Determination Not to Revoke Order in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 57, 420 (Nov. 15, 2001), as modified by <em>Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Remand </em>(May 13, 2003), is sustained.
