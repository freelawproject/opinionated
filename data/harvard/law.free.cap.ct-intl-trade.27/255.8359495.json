CMC challenges certain aspects of the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) determination in <em>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of 1999-2000 Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Determination Not to Revoke Order in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 57,420 (Nov. 15, 2001) <em>{\u201cFinal Results\u201d). </em>The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Plaintiff CMC is an exporter of tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished (\u201cTRBs\u201d), from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d) to the United States. The antidumping duty order concerning TRBs from the PRC was issued on May 27, 1987. <em>See Tapered Roller Bearings from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 19,748 (May 27, 1987). Commerce designated the PRC as a non-market economy (\u201cNME\u201d) country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From the People\u2019s Republic of China: Preliminary Results of 1999-2000 Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Notice of Intent Not to Revoke Order in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 35,937, 35,938 (July 10, 2001) <em>{\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). </em>At issue in this case are the 1999-2000 sales of TRBs from the PRC, which constitute sales made during the thirteenth administrative review of the anti-dumping duty order (\u201cPOR\u201d). Specifically, CMC challenges Commerce\u2019s rejection of the actual market prices that CMC paid for steel used in the production of the TRBs, in favor of using surrogate val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ues for steel in the final calculation of normal value (\u201cNV\u201d) to determine dumping margins.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">On July 7, 2000, Commerce published the preliminary results of the twelfth administrative review, which showed a zero dumping margin for CMC. <em>See Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Preliminary Results of 1998-1999 Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Notice of Intent to Revoke Order in Part, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 41,944, 41,949 (July 7, 2000). On July 31, 2000, Commerce initiated the thirteenth administrative review. <em>See Initiation of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Requests for Revocation in Part, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 46,687 (July 31, 2000), <em>amended by </em>65 Fed. Reg. 48,968 (Aug. 10, 2000). On February 26, 2001, Commerce published the amended final results of the twelfth administrative review, which reflected a jump from zero to 0.82% (despite remaining <em>de </em>minimis)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of CMC\u2019s dumping margin determined in the preliminary. <em>See Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Amended Final Results of 1998-1999 Administrative Review and Determination to Revoke in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 11,562, 11,564 (Feb. 26, 2001). Commerce changed its methodology regarding the prices for steel input in mid-review in the twelfth administrative review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On July 10, 2001, Commerce published the preliminary results of the thirteenth administrative review. <em>See Preliminary Results. </em>Commerce found a 4.79% dumping margin for CMC in this preliminary investigation and therefore denied CMC\u2019s revocation request. <em>See id. </em>at 35,941. On November 15, 2001, Commerce published the final results and found a 4.64% dumping margin for CMC. <em>See Final Results </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>at 57,422. Commerce\u2019s reasons for its determinations are found in the accompanying <em>Issues and Decision Memo for the 1999-2000 Administrative Review of Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results (\u201cIssues and Decision Memo\u201d), </em>A-570-601, Pub. Doc. DAS I/1:JG (Nov. 7, 2001), in app. 14 to Pl.\u2019s <em>Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. upon an Agency R. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Br.\u201d). </em>As it cannot meet the standard of three consecutive years of sales at not less than fair value, <em>see </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.222(b)(l)(i)(A) (2000), CMC remains subject to the anti-dumping duty order regarding TRBs from the PRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The merchandise at issue here is cups and cones which CMC sold in the United States. <em>Tr. </em>at 10:21-25 to 11:1 \u2014 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To manufacture cups and cones, CMC used hot-rolled alloy steel bar which it imported from another country paying in market currency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 9. CMC thus challenges Commerce\u2019s use of surrogate values for its hot-rolled alloy steel bar input instead of the actual price it paid. There is no indication on the record, nor is there an argument in the parties\u2019 briefs that CMC and its supplier are affiliated. The exporting country is a market economy country. Normally, to construct NV for the final product, Commerce uses actual prices which an NME producer pays for the input from a market economy country since actual market prices are the best approximation of the input\u2019s value. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1). However, in this case, both in the final stage of the twelfth administrative review and in the entire thirteenth administrative review, Commerce declined to use the actual prices CMC paid to the supplier for its steel because it claimed it had a \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that the supplied steel was benefitting from subsidies, and the actual prices were thus distorted. <em>See Preliminary Results </em>at 35,940; <em>Issues and Decision Memo </em>at 9. To support its finding that the steel was subsidized, Commerce relied on an internal confidential memorandum, <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>(Nov. 7, 2001), in app. 4 to <em>Pl.\u2019s Br.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>lists various affirmative anti-dumping and countervailing duty findings applying to various steel products from the market economy country at issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>is a negative finding from 1999 relating to one particular steel product, [[ ]], from the market economy country: <em>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination: </em>[[ ]] <em>{\u201cFinal Negative Determination\u201d). </em>There are no specific antidumping or countervailing duty findings regarding the hot-rolled alloy steel bar that is at issue here. <em>See Market Economy Steel </em>Memo; <em>Tr. </em>at 11:7-11. However, during these antidumping or countervailing duty investigations, Commerce \u201cdiscovered . . . not company specific\u201d but generally available subsidies to steel producers in the concerned country, including directed credit, export industry facility loans, short-term export financing, and investment tax credits. <em>Market Economy Steel Memo. </em>Commerce maintains without further elaboration that \u201cin two of the three recent [pertinent] investigations, [these general subsidies] are greater than <em>de minimis.\u201d Tr. </em>at 16:2-4. There is no record evidence of a generally available subsidy verified in the case of hot-rolled alloy steel bar from the country in question as Commerce has never specifically investigated this merchandise. <em>See Market Economy Steel Memo. </em>In addition, Commerce never specifically verified whether CMC\u2019s supplier had ever taken advantage of any generally available subsidies for this or any other steel product. <em>See Tr. </em>at 17:21-25 to 18:1-16. Commerce nevertheless believes that CMC\u2019s supplier may have (or must have) benefitted from generally available subsidies resulting in a distortion in the prices of hot-rolled alloy steel bar and, therefore, such prices cannot properly be used in the NV calculations for the cups and cones CMC sold in the United States. The contention is that \u201cas a matter of commonsense, we can assume that no one is going to leave money on the table. [Companies] are going to take advantage of a program that\u2019s out there and exists.\u201d <em>Tr. </em>at 30:24-25 to 31:1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Given the designation of the PRC as an NME country, Commerce resorted to surrogate country analysis pursuant to its authority under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, Commerce selected India as surrogate and used adjusted weighted-averages of Japanese export prices to India for hot-rolled alloy steel bar based on the Japanese Ministry of Finance statistics. <em>See Preliminary Results </em>at 35,940. Commerce explained the selection of India as the surrogate country by pointing out that India was at a comparable level of economic development with the PRC and was the most significant producer and exporter of TRBs among other suitable countries, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Pakistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Selection of a Surrogate Country and Steel Value Sources Memo </em>at 3 (July 2, 2001) <em>(\u201cSurrogate Country Memo\u201d), </em>in app. 14 to <em>Pl.\u2019s Br.; see also </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(b) (basing comparability on <em>per capita </em>GDP). Finding India\u2019s own import statistics \u201cunreliable,\u201d however, Commerce instead chose Japanese export data to India as \u201cthe best data\u201d because \u201cthe Japanese tariff category [was] the narrowest category which could contain bearing quality steel, and because it [was] consistent with values contained in our U.S. benchmark category.\u201d <em>Surrogate Country Memo </em>at 3; <em>see also Def.\u2019s Mem. in Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. upon an Agency R. </em>at 4 <em>(\u201cDef.\u2019s Br.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">After the preliminary results were released, CMC submitted rebuttal evidence to Commerce in the form of a letter from its supplier which denied the existence of any subsidies or financial assistance, direct or indirect, from its government in its production of steel sold to CMC. <em>See Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 10; <em>Tr. </em>at 12:8-11. CMC charges that Commerce ignored this evidence submitted by CMC. See <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 26. Commerce counters that the letter was insufficient to \u201crefute Q [Commerce\u2019s] reason to believe or suspect subsidization\u201d since it was unsupported by \u201csales, financial, or other empirical economic information demonstrating the supplier\u2019s prices were not subsidized.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memo </em>at 8; <em>see also Tr. </em>at 13:17-19. \u201cThe statement also lack[ed] any specificity, particularly as it [did] not indicate the basis upon which the supplier [made] its statement.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memo </em>at 8. Commerce further argues that, in addition to being general, the letter was not \u201cdirected to Commerce. There [was] no indication ... of what. . . the duties and responsibilities of the letter writer [were] and why he , would have knowledge of what subsidies the company did or did not take advantage of.\u201d <em>Tr. </em>at 23:17-22. The letter also consisted of \u201ctwo sentences,\u201d <em>Tr. </em>at 24:4, and was not \u201cin the form of an affidavit,\u201d <em>Tr. </em>at 33:13-14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On January 11, 2002, CMC filed its complaint <em>{\u201cCompl\u201d) </em>with this court. First, CMC challenges in general Commerce\u2019s use of surrogate values in place of actual prices paid by CMC for the input. <em>Compl. </em>\u00b6 6-A. Second, CMC challenges in particular Commerce\u2019s use of prices of steel imported from Japan to India to value cups and cones. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Compl. </em>\u00b6 6-B. In addition, CMC challenges Commerce\u2019s adjustment of the Japanese prices for freight and insurance costs which were not included in the prices. <em>Compl. </em>\u00b6 6-C. CMC claims Commerce\u2019s determinations are \u201carbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, and [are] otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Compl. </em>\u00b6 6. The Timken Company (\u201cTimken\u201d) is the Defendant-Intervenor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The antidumping duty statute requires Commerce to use \u201cthe best available information\u201d concerning the values for factors of production from a market economy in the NY calculations for product exported from an NME country. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l) (1999).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe statute does not define the phrase \u2018best available information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Luoyang Bearing Factory v. United States, </em>26 CIT_,_, Slip Op. 02-118 at 4 (Oct. 1, 2002). CMC argues that the statutory mandate to use the best available information directs Commerce to utilize \u201cactual prices paid to market economy suppliers [over] surrogate values.\u201d <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 15. As support, CMC relies on <em>Lasko Metal Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1442, 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1994), which noted that \u201c \u2018[w]here we can determine that a [sic] NME producer\u2019s input prices are market determined, accuracy, fairness, and predictability are enhanced by using those prices. Therefore, using surrogate values when market-based values are available would, in fact, be contrary to the intent of the law\u2019 \u201d (quoting Commerce\u2019s determinations in the same case, <em>Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>56 Fed. Reg. 55,271, 55,275 (Oct. 25, 1991) (final determination)). <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 16; <em>see also Shakeproof Assembly Components, Div. of Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>268 F.3d 1376, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (echoing <em>Lasko\u2019s </em>reasoning).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">CMC further argues that Commerce\u2019s own regulations compel the use of actual market values over surrogate valu es. <em>See Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 17. The applicable regulation is 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1), which states that \u201cwhere a factor is purchased from a market economy supplier and paid for in a market economy currency, [Commerce] <em>normally </em>will use the price paid to the market economy supplier\u201d (emphasis added). CMC contends that the \u201conly\u201d exception to this rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cwhere the quantity of the input purchased was insignificant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 17-18; <em>Pl.\u2019s Reply to Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Commerce responds that the antidumping duty statute does compel Commerce to use \u201cthe best available information,\u201d but not necessarily market values. <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 10. Commerce argues that it has \u201cbroad discretion to determine the \u2018best available information\u2019 in a reasonable manner upon a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Commerce further argues that \u201cCongress instructed Commerce to avoid using any prices \u2018which it has reason to believe or suspect may be dumped or subsidized prices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 12 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-576 at 590 (1988), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1623 <em>(\u201cHouse Report\u201d)). </em>Timken adds to this argument by observing that \u201cCongress did not intend for Commerce to conduct formal investigations before rejecting unfair prices.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Def.-Intervenor\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. upon an Agency R. </em>at 18. Finally, with respect to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1), Commerce contends that while,, through the inclusion of the word \u201cnormally,\u201d the \u201cregulation evinces a preference for the use of market values, that preference does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>require Commerce to use market values in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 17. Commerce concludes that \u201c[h]ere, the use of market prices [was] not appropriate because those prices [were] distorted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">CMC objects to Commerce\u2019s resort to the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard under these facts. <em>See Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 20. According to CMC, the <em>House Report </em>from which Commerce derived the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard relates only to a selection among surrogate values, not to the selection of surrogate values over market prices. <em>See id. </em>at 20-21. Thus, Plaintiff urges that the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard would not be applicable where market prices are available. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">A. Commerce\u2019s use of certain surrogate prices over actual prices of inputs in NV calculations under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201cThe court\u2019s role is not to determine whether the information chosen by Commerce is the \u2018best\u2019 actually available, but whether the choice is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with <em>law.\u201d Novachem, Inc. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 782, 786, 797 F. Supp. 1033, 1037 (1992) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the first issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s use of surrogate input values instead of the actual prices paid by an NME producer to a market economy supplier is in accordance with law where Commerce has \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that the actual prices are distorted.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The court agrees with Commerce that nothing in the antidumping duty statute directs Commerce to employ actual prices paid to a market economy supplier by an NME producer in NV calculations. Under the antidumping duty statute, \u201cCommerce\u2019s duty [is] to determine margins as accurately as possible, and to use the best information available to it in doing so.\u201d <em>Lasko, </em>43 F.3d at 1443; <em>Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1185, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <em>Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 1185, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Commerce has especially \u201cwide discretion in the valuation of factors of production.\u201d <em>Nation Ford Chem. Co. v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The statute \u201csimply does not say-anywhere-that the factors of production must be ascertained in a single fashion.\u201d <em>Lasko, </em>43 F.3d at 1446; <em>Shakeproof Assembly Components, Div. of Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>102 F. Supp. 2d 486, 491 (2000), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>268 F.3d 1376 (2001). Commerce\u2019s methodology in selecting values for factors of production will be upheld, as long as such methodology does not contravene \u201cthe purpose of the statute, [which is] to construct the product\u2019s normal value as it would have been if the NME country were a market economy country.\u201d <em>Rhodia, Inc. v. United States, </em>25 CIT_,_, 185 F. Supp. 2d 1343, 1351 (2001) (citations omitted). The statutory term \u201cbest available information\u201d is at best an ambiguous term. See \u00a7 1677b(c)(l). When the statute is ambiguous on a point, the court must uphold an agency\u2019s reasonable constructions of the statute. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). In particular, \u201cstatutory interpretations articulated by Commerce during its antidumping proceedings are entitled to judicial deference under <em>Chevron.\u201dPesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>see also Allied-Signal, </em>996 F.2d at 1191 (observing that \u201cbecause Congress has \u2018explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill\u2019 in determining what constitutes the best information available [(which phrase appeared in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c) (1988)), Commerce\u2019s] construction of the statute must be accorded considerable deference\u201d under <em>Chevron).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Contrary to CMC\u2019s contention, the <em>Lasko </em>decision cannot be construed as requiring Commerce to employ actual prices (paid by an NME producer to a market economy supplier) over surrogate values in every situation. In <em>Lasko, </em>Commerce won the right to use market prices instead of surrogate values for factors of production in NV calculations on the rationale that \u201caccuracy, fairness, and predictability are enhanced by using those prices.\u201d <em>Lasko, </em>43 F.3d at 1446. Where actual prices reflect true market values, not to employ such prices would indeed be contrary to Commerce\u2019s mandate of estimating anti-dumping duty \u201cmargins as accurately as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1443. If the prices CMC paid to its supplier for the steel input were artificially low, however, due to subsidies it was receiving from the government, then the calculated NV for the end product, TRBs, would be artificially low, suppressing the dumping margins of CMC. Thus, if CMC were indeed dumping in the United States, that fact would have been concealed by the artificially low NV. If actual \u201cmarket\u201d prices are distorted in such a way, Commerce\u2019s use of such prices would undermine \u201caccuracy, fairness, and predictability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1446, in the calculation of margins and contravene the antidumping and countervailing duty statute, the purpose of which is to correct for the effect dumping and subsidies have on prices and competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Moreover, nothing in the applicable regulations compels Commerce to choose actual prices ov\u00e9r surrogate values. As Commerce urges, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1) merely indicates a preference for market prices. That is, while Commerce will use market values under normal circumstances, under certain circumstances Commerce may choose not to do so. The court rejects the argument that Commerce may deviate from this practice only when quantities of input purchased are insignificant. Section 351.408(c)(1) itself does not supply the exceptional circumstances under which Commerce may disregard market prices. In explaining \u00a7 351.408(c)(1), Commerce had indicated that one situation where it \u201cwould not re\u00edy on the price paid by an NME producer to a market economy supplier [is where] the quantity of the input purchased was insignificant.\u201d <em>Rules and Regulations: Antidumping </em>Duties; <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,366 (May 19, 1997). That cannot, however, be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>only situation when a deviation from the normal practice of using market prices is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">It is true, as CMC urges, that the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard articulated in the <em>House Report </em>explicitly refers only to a selection among surrogate prices, as opposed to a choice between surrogate and market values. This Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have, in addition, upheld Commerce\u2019s use of the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard in the context of a choice among surrogate values and affirmed Commerce\u2019s refusal to use distorted surrogate values. <em>See Nation Ford, </em>166 F.3d at 1377-78; <em>Rhodia, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d at 1352; <em>Technoimportexport, UCF Am. Inc. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 13, 17, 783 F. Supp. 1401, 1405 (1992). \u201cEvidently, the main consideration is the unreliability of the price information due to the unknown dumping margin if any.\u201d <em>China Nat\u2019l Metals &amp; Minerals Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 859, 864, 674 F. Supp. 1482, 1486 (1987). Such a consideration would, however, also be pertinent whenever market values are involved. There are also policy concerns on each side of this issue. The policy in favor of determining margins as accurately as possible weighs against further use of the \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard. On the other hand, given that the overarching purpose of the antidumping and countervailing duty law is to counteract dumping and subsidies, the court cannot conclude that Congress would condone the use of any value where there is \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that it reflects dumping or subsidies. \u201c[S]urrogate country values are, at best, an <em>estimate </em>of the true value of the factors of production\u201d and, therefore, not precise. <em>Shakeproof, </em>268 F.3d at 1382 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). However, if Commerce had \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that steel used by CMC in the production of the TRBs sold in the United States were subsidized, Commerce may employ surrogate values where it determines that they are the best information under the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>B. Commerce\u2019s use of the reason to believe or suspect standard in the case of certain subsidies is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\">The second question before the court is whether, in this case, Commerce\u2019s actions are supported by substantial evidence that would have given Commerce \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d that the steel used by CMC in the production of the TRBs sold in the United States was subsidized.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The \u201creason to believe or suspect\u201d standard that is argued here has no statutory definition. In attempting to define a similar phrase, \u201creasonable grounds to believe or suspect,\u201d which appears in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(l) (1999),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this Court observed that \u201cin order for reasonable suspicion to exist there must be \u2018a particularized and objective basis for suspecting\u2019 the existence of certain proscribed behavior, taking into account the totality of the circumstances-the whole picture.\u201d <em>Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>6 CIT 245, 247, 575 F. Supp. 1277, 1280 (1983) (quoting from criminal law cases that analyzed the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard for searches pursuant to <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968)). This insistence on \u201ca particularized and objective basis\u201d has been interpreted to mean a \u201c \u2018demand for specificity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981), and also citing <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 320-21 (1978), for the proposition that \u201cprobable cause in the administrative law context is established by <em>specific evidence\u201d </em>(emphasis in the original)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the \u201creason to believe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>suspect\u201d standard at issue here must be predicated on .particular, specific, and objective evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">On the other hand, substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla;\u201d it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938); <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984). \u201cFor purposes of judicial review, the evidence before this Court is limited to the evidence contained in the administrative record.\u201d <em>Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1353, 1361, 985 F. Supp. 1166, 1173 (1997) (citations omitted). In applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, \u201cthe court affirms [an agency\u2019s] factual determinations so long as they are reasonable and supported by the record as a whole, even if there is some evidence that detracts from the agency\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Olympia Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 387, 389, 7 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1000 (1998) (citing <em>Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Merging the two standards and under the facts of this case, the court will accordingly affirm Commerce\u2019s actions if, given the entire record as a whole, there is substantial, specific, and objective evidence which could reasonably be interpreted to support a suspicion that the prices CMC paid to its market economy supplier were distorted. Otherwise, this court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. <em>See Granges Metallverken AB v. United States, </em>13 CIT 471, 474, 716 F. Supp. 17, 21 (1989) (citation omitted). Additionally, the agency is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record, and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove otherwise. <em>Roses, Inc. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 662, 668, 720 F. Supp. 180, 185 (1989); <em>Nat'l Ass\u2019n of Mirror Mfrs. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 771, 779, 696 F. Supp. 642, 648 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">To support its contention that there is substantial evidence in the record, Commerce argues that the discovery of subsidies which are not company specific in the investigations of other steel products gave it reason to infer that CMC\u2019s supplier alongside other steel producers in the relevant country may have benefitted from these so-called general subsidies. <em>See Def.\u2019s </em>Sr. at 15. Commerce further argues that \u201cthe letter [from CMC\u2019s supplier], at most, created a conflict in the record,\u201d to which Commerce was entitled to give \u201cminimal <em>weight.\u201dId. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">CMC, on the other hand, points to contradictory evidence. First, \u201cthere are no current or prior countervailing duty orders in the United States or in China on the material input in question, hot-rolled bars and rods of bearing quality steel manufactured in [the exporting country].\u201d <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 25 (citing <em>Market Economy Steel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Memo). </em>Second, not only the steel input in question, but also CMC\u2019s supplier was never investigated in any recent countervailing or anti-dumping duty investigations. <em>See id. </em>Third, \u201c[i]n a recent countervailing duty case on [a steel input from the exporting country, Commerce] made a final negative countervailing duty determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Final Negative Determination). </em>According to CMC, this finding would \u201cobviously militate[ ] against the notion that there are \u2018industry-wide\u2019 subsidies conferring benefits on manufacturers of steel products.\u201d Id. at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">CMC is correct. Evidence exists in the record - Commerce\u2019s own negative finding for one steel product from the country at issue - compelling the conclusion that all steel products from that country could not have benefitted from general subsidies. <em>See Final Negative Determination. </em>This evidence is not merely a contradictory piece of evidence to which Commerce is entitled to give minimal weight. On the contrary, this evidence directly undermines Commerce\u2019s justification of using surrogate values in CMC\u2019s case. If this specific finding is an anomaly, Commerce must explain to this court why it is an anomaly. Otherwise, Commerce cannot reasonably claim that, if one or two steel products in the exporting country were subsidized, then all must have been because at least one was found by Commerce itself not to have been subsidized. Conjectures are not facts and cannot constitute substantial evidence. <em>China Nat\u2019l Arts and Crafts Imp. and Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>15 CIT 417, 424, 771 F. Supp. 407, 413 (1991) (\u201cGuesswork is no substitute for substantial evidence in justifying decisions.\u201d). In this case, it may be that there in fact exists a countervailable subsidy program to support steel producers in the country in question, but CMC\u2019s supplier might not have qualified for this program and, therefore, could not have benefitted from it. There is no indication on this record whether this program is offered across the board to all steel producers in the country, to those of a certain size, to those which manufacture a certain product or set of products, to those in a specific geographical area or so on. Without explaining more of the program and without explaining, for example, who could benefit from the program or whether companies may choose not to participate (for example, because the program comes with certain obligations), the contention that all steel producers must have benefitted from the program is logically unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Moreover, even the existence of a sufficiently significant general subsidy program is in question here. This court raised the issue with counsel at oral argument. The numbers that appear in the <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>that allegedly indicate the existence of a subsidy program appear to be very low numbers. The court was concerned that, even if there is an available steel subsidy program in the country in question, its effects are minimal and do not rise to the level of a distortion which Commerce must address. Neither Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>merce in the administrative proceedings, nor counsel at oral argument or in their papers explained the magnitude of these \u201cgeneral\u201d subsidies, i.e., whether they are <em>de minimis </em>and whether they, accordingly, must be treated as if they were zero. <em>See Tr. </em>at 16:5-11. The <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>merely states that \u201cthe general subsidies found in [[ ]] investigations are greater than <em>de minimis.\u201d </em>If this program had no significant effect on the prices CMC paid to its supplier, then there may be no distortion and, therefore, no justification to deviate from the actual input prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The court is mindful of the fact that previous administrative reviews of CMC with respect to TRBs yielded zero or <em>de minimis </em>dumping margins.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Commerce rejected CMC\u2019s actual prices in favor of using surrogate values which are by their nature imprecise. Arguably, Commerce was faced with a difficult choice between potentially distorted actual prices and imprecise surrogate values. Choosing surrogate values resulted in above <em>de minimis </em>dumping margins for CMC which were not found when actual prices were used. The court does not question Commerce\u2019s discretion to use surrogate values when it has reason to believe that the actual prices are distorted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, the alleged distortion in the actual prices must be shown more clearly than present here. The regulation in question, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1), evinces a preference in favor of market prices. While this preference may not rise to the level of a legal presumption, nevertheless, in Order to deviate from its own regulation, Commerce must base its decision on a clearer and more substantial record than presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The lack of any specific evidence linking either CMC\u2019s supplier or its steel input to any subsidies further undermines Commerce\u2019s justification and reasoning to use surrogate values in CMC\u2019s case. Neither this specific steel input in question, nor CMC\u2019s steel supplier was ever investigated by Commerce. There is no evidence on the record indicating that CMC\u2019s supplier benefitted from generally available subsidies, which were incidentally discovered in other investigations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This insistence on specific evidence in CMC\u2019s case is consistent with the remedial, not punitive, purpose of the antidump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ing duty laws. <em>See, e.g., NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d 1204, 1208 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Finally, Commerce\u2019s continuous reference to the <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>to support its determinations in CMC\u2019s case does not constitute a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d that is required under the statute. <em>See, e.g., Usinor v. United States, </em>26 CIT_,_, Slip Op. 02-70, 01-10 at 14 (July 19, 2002); Altx, <em>Inc. v. United States, </em>25 CIT ___, _, 167 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1360 (2001). Under the statute, Commerce must \u201cinclude in a final determination ... an explanation of the basis for its determination that addresses relevant arguments, made by interested parties who are parties to the investigation or review . . ., concerning the establishment of dumping or a countervail-able subsidy.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(i)(3)(A). This does not mean that Commerce must \u201cmake an explicit response to every argument made by a party, but instead requires that issues material to [Commerce\u2019s] determination be discussed so that the \u2018path of the agency may reasonably be discerned\u2019 by a reviewing court.\u201d Statement of Administrative Action at 892, accompanying H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-826(1), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4215 (quoting case law). Commerce \u201cmust specifically reference in [its] determinations factors and arguments that are material and relevant or must provide a discussion or explanation in the determination that renders evident [Commerce\u2019s] treatment of a factor or argument.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-826(1) at 98, <em>reprinted in </em>1995 U.S.C.C.A.N 3773. What constitutes an explanation is an \u201carticulation of a] rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Queen\u2019s Flowers De Columbia v. United States, </em>21 CIT 968, 978, 981 F. Supp. 617, 627 (1997) (quotation omitted). Here, Commerce attempted to establish a link between certain \u201cnot company specific\u201d subsidies found in other investigations and CMC. However, it is not a reasonable exercise of discretion for Commerce to use a subsidy finding of a past or different investigation and apply it without inquiring further whether such a finding is applicable to the particular set of circumstances at hand. <em>Cf. Nation Ford Chem. Co. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1371, 1377, 985 F. Supp. 133, 138 (1997), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>166 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201c[S]ubsidy findings are fact-specific, and circumstances often change;\u201d therefore, \u201cfactual findings in past determinations, while often relevant, are not binding in subsequent cases.\u201d). It is \u201cmaterial and relevant\u201d that other merchandise subject to antidumping and countervailing duty orders differs from the input at issue in this case. Accordingly, Commerce must explain its decision sufficiently so that this court can reasonably discern the path of Commerce\u2019s reasoning as to why CMC\u2019s supplier must have benefitted from subsidies discovered elsewhere in the production of hot-rolled alloy steel bar sold to the PRC. The <em>Issues and Decision Memo </em>of the thirteenth administrative review simply references the <em>Market Economy Steel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Memo </em>without much elaboration.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Market Economy Steel Memo </em>is a five page document with sparse text, reporting (mostly in tables) Commerce\u2019s (and other countries\u2019) dumping and subsidy findings about steel from the market economy country in question without further explanation. The so-called \u201cgeneral\u201d subsidies at issue here are reported in a separate table tabulating various subsidies, such as investment tax credits, short-term export financing and the like, against three steel products, [[ ]].<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Again, there is no mention of hot-rolled alloy steel bar, the steel product in question here, in the table. The numbers that appear in the table are also presented without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Therefore, the court remands this case to Commerce to review and augment the administrative record and to explain its determinations adequately. It must demonstrate particular, specific, and objective evidence to uphold its reason to believe or suspect that the prices CMC paid the supplier for the inputs were subsidized. \u201cIf the record before the agency does not support the agency action, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, </em>470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). Following the language of the <em>House Report, </em>a \u201cformal investigation\u201d may not be necessary here; however, a presentation by Commerce to this court of substantial, specific evidence and an adequate elucidation of reasons for its determinations are essential for the court to uphold Commerce\u2019s results in the thirteenth administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, the court holds that Commerce\u2019s determinations in <em>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of 1999-2000 Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Review, and Determination Not to Revoke Order in Part, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 57,420 (Nov. 15, 2001), are unsupported by substantial evidence and, therefore, should be remanded to the agency for review and action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A separate order will be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\"> An NME country is \u201cany foreign country that [Commerce] determines does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(18)(A) (1999). There is no dispute here as to the PRC\u2019s NME status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> \u201cThe term \u2018dumping margin\u2019 means the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price ... of the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(A). \u201cSubject merchandise\u201d is merchandise subject to an antidumping investigation, review or order. \u00a7 1677(25). \u201cNormal value\u201d is \u201cthe price at which the [subject merchandise or its equivalent] is first sold (or. .. offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country.\u201d \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)(i); \u00a7 1677(16). \u201cThe term \u2018export price\u2019 means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold)... in the United States.\u201d \u00a7 1677a(a). The dumping margin is thus the difference between the domestic price and the United States price of the subject merchandise. In the case of an NME exporting country, the domestic price will not be market determined, and the normal value must accordingly be constructed. The statute provides that the values for factors of production used in the construction of normal value for exports of an NME country will be those of a market economy country of comparable economic development, the so-called surrogate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677b(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> \u201c[A] weighted average dumping margin is de minimis if [Commerce] determines that it is less than 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> The results of the twelfth administrative review of the antidumping duty order (concerning 1998-1999 sales) are challenged in a separate action before another judge of this Court.

Reg. 27,296 (May 19, 1997) <em>(\u201cFinal Rule\u201d), </em>which document contains explanations of Commerce\u2019s new rules revised in conformity with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, including 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1). According to CMC, the <em>Final Rule </em>states on its page 27,413 that \u201c[t]he <em>only </em>situation in which [the Department] would not rely on the price paid by an NME producer to a market economy supplier is where the quantity of the input purchased was insignificant.\u201d <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 17-18 (emphasis in the original). Given that this quote is one of the cornerstones of its argument, CMC\u2019s mistake is unfortunate. The <em>Final Rule </em>merely states on its page 27,366 that \u201cas noted in the AD Proposed Regulations, 61 [Fed. Reg. 7308,] 7345, we would not rely on the price paid by an NME producer to a market economy supplier if the quantity of the input purchased was insignificant.\u201d <em>See also Proposed Rules: Antidump-ing Duties; Countervailing Duties, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 7308, 7345 (Feb. 27, 1996) (\"where the amount purchased [by an NME producer] from a market economy supplier is insignificant, [the] price [paid to the market economy supplier] may be disregarded.\u201d). Without more, the \u201conly\u201d language simply cannot be read into the <em>Final Rule </em>and, accordingly, into Commerce\u2019s understanding of its own regulations as reflected in the <em>Final Rule. </em>The court notes, however, that the same language appears in another case. <em>See Certain Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People\u2019s Republic of China; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 61,794, 61,796 (Nov. 19, 1997) (containing the same quote supplied by CMC and citing to the <em>Final Rule </em>at 27,366). That is, in at least one occasion, Commerce agreed with Plaintiff that the only situation that permitted a deviation from the use of readily available market prices was when the quantity of input sold by the market supplier was insignificant. What Commerce said or did in another case does not, however, have the same persuasive value in this case as a pronouncement in the <em>Final Rule </em>would have had.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> The <em>House Report </em>further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">However, the conferees do not intend for Commerce to conduct a <em>formal investigation </em>to ensure that such prices are not dumped or subsidized, but rather intend that Commerce base its decision on information generally available to it at that time. In addition, Commerce should seek to use, if possible, data based on production of the same general class or kind of merchandise using similar levels of technology and at similar levels of volume as the producers subject to investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\"><em>House Report </em>at 590-91 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\"> Commerce may also choose among surrogates which fit the requirements of \u00a7 1677(c)(4). <em>See Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corp. v. United States, </em>20 CIT 1362, 1368, 947 F.Supp. 525, 532 (1996) (\u201cCommerce does not need to prove that its methodology was the only way, or even the best way to calculate surrogate values for\u201d subject merchandise.). Such choices will be upheld as long as they are reasonable. <em>See Coalition for the Preservation of Am. Brake Drum and Rotor Aftermarket Mfrs. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 88, 118, 44 F. Supp. 2d 229, 258 (1999). CMC failed to fully articulate to this court why Indonesia would have been a better choice as a surrogate than India, other than claiming that Indonesian values would not have exceeded the U.S. benchmark range as much as Indian values did. Commerce found that both India and Indonesia were of comparable economic development to the PRC and explained that India was selected over Indonesia (and over other suitable surrogates) because it was \u201cthe most significant producer and exporter of tapered roller bearings.\u201d <em>Selection of a Surrogate Country and Steel Value Sources Memo </em>at 2 (July 2, 2001), in app. 14 to <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>Commerce\u2019s action was consistent with the statutory mandate under \u00a7 1677b(c)(4), to choose a \u201csignificant producer\u201d of the merchandise as a surrogate. Therefore, Commerce was within its discretion to use Japanese export data to India, as opposed to any Indonesian values. <em>Cf. Luoyang Bearing Factory v. United States, </em>26 CIT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>_,_, Slip Op. 02-118 at 4 (Oct. 1, 2002) (pointing out that Commerce has discretion to switch from primary to secondary surrogate data). Similarly, Commerce may adjust data by adding ocean freight and marine insurance costs (\u201cF&amp;I\u201d), as long as such adjustment is reasonable. Here, the base values Commerce used were F.O.B. Japanese export prices. \u201cF.O.B.\u201d or \u201cFree-On-Board\u201d prices do not include F&amp;I whereas \u201cC.I.F.\u201d or \u201cCost-Insurance-and-Freight\u201d prices do. <em>See </em>International Chamber of Commerce, Incoterms 2000 49, 65 (1999). The F&amp;I data used in the adjustment was that from the PRC to the United States west coast. <em>See Issues and Decision Memo </em>at 14. Commerce claims that this data was \u201cthe best available information [that] most closely approximate[d] the shipping distance between Japan and India.\u201d <em>Id. </em>CMC argues that the F&amp;I used in the adjustment was approximately three times the difference between F.O.B. and C.I.F. Japanese values and, therefore, such adjustment was unreasonable. <em>See PL\u2019s Br. </em>at 28-29. Even though subtracting F.O.B. values from C.I.F. values may be one method of extracting F&amp;I, it is not the only method, and it is not the method Commerce chose to employ here. Plaintiff has not shown to this court why Commerce\u2019s adjustment methodology is unreasonable. We need not, however, decide this difficult issue as Commerce\u2019s basic decision must be remanded as unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\"> \u201cWhenever [Commerce] has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of [the subject merchandise or its equivalent] for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, [Commerce] shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production.\u201d \u00a7 1677b(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> The court notes that the exact quote from <em>Marshall </em>is: \u201cFor purposes of an administrative search such as this, probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that \u2018reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an .. . inspection are satisfied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>respect to a particular [establishment].\u2019 \u201d 436 U.S. at 320 (quotation omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> The court notes that CMC may have been entitled to revocation by virtue of no dumping for three consecutive years and such revocation may have been prevented by this change of methodology - a result with great detrimental significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> The court, however, questions whether a simple adjustment could not have corrected this potential and alleged distortion in the actual prices which may have in turn resulted in more accurate dumping margins, instead of discarding the set of actual prices in its entirety.
