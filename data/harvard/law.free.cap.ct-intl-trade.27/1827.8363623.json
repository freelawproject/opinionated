On September 29, 2000, the domestic honey industry filed a petition with Commerce and the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d), alleging, among other things, that it was being injured as a result of less than fair value sales of honey from Argentina and the PRC. <em>See </em>Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Pet., Honey from Arg. and the P.R.C. (Sept. 29, 2000), Pub. R. Doc. 1. Thereafter, Commerce initiated its preliminary investigation. <em>See </em>Honey From Arg. &amp; the P.R.C., 65 Fed. Reg. 65,831 (ITA Nov. 2, 2000) (notice of initiation of antidumping duty investigation). Commerce identified the period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) as January 1, 2000, through June 30, 2000, a period during which the Suspension Agreement was in effect. <em>See </em>Prelim. Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 24,102. In November 2000, the ITC determined that there was a reasonable indication that the domestic honey industry was materially injured by reason of imports of honey from Argentina and the PRC. <em>See </em>Honey From Arg. <em>&amp; </em>China, 65 Fed.

By letter dated February 23, 2001, the petitioners alleged that there was a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances existed with respect to imports of honey from the PRC. <em>See </em>Letter from Collier Shannon Scott, PLLC to Commerce of 2/23/01, Pub.

Plaintiffs contend that since their U.S. sales of honey complied with the reference price contained in the Suspension Agreement, Commerce\u2019s determination that these sales were made at less than fair value is <em>\u201cprima facie </em>evidence that the data selected by Commerce to make its dumping calculation was unreasonable (and not the \u2018best available information\u2019).\u201d <em>See </em>Br. Supp. Pis.\u2019 Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cPis.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 14-15 (citation omitted). According to Plaintiffs, the inclusion of the reference price provision in the Suspension Agreement necessarily prevented the special rule governing suspension agreements with NME countries (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z)) from being the authority for the Suspension Agreement. Rather, Plaintiffs insist that, even though the Suspension Agreement states it was entered into pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z), the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1836\">*1836</page-number>the reference price requires a finding that the Suspension Agreement was entered into pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(b),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that the Suspension Agreement was thus designed to \u201celiminate completely\u2019 any dumping of the Subject Merchandise. <em>Id. </em>at 13 (\u201c[T]he \u2018special rule\u2019 [found in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z)] for nonmarket economy suspension agreements only establishes new criteria for <em>quantitative </em>restrictions. Any price restrictions must still comply with the standard requirements for all suspension agreements, which include setting price levels that eliminate less than fair value sales.\u201d (emphasis in original) (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(b)(2)); Pls.\u2019 Reply Br. (\u201cPis.\u2019 Reply\u201d) at 4 (\u201c[U]nder the plain language of the statute, any <em>price </em>based limitations included in an NME suspension agreement would not be subject to the criteria established by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z)(l) because this provision does not address price restrictions. Instead, a price based restriction would need to comply with the requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(b), which specifically governs suspension agreements based on price limitations.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs contend that the legislative history surrounding the enactment of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z) supports this argument.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Plaintiffs further claim that the Suspension Agreement\u2019s reference to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(f)(2)(A)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is also evidence that it was intended to eliminate sales at less than fair value because by its terms, 19 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1837\">*1837</page-number>\u00a7 1673c(f)(2)(A) applies if the suspension agreement at issue \u201cis [one] described in [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(b)],\u201d i.e., one to eliminate the occurrence of dumping or to cease exports altogether. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(f); <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 13. Thus, based on the premise that the Suspension Agreement is an agreement to eliminate dumping, Plaintiffs claim that by failing to take the reference price into consideration in calculating normal value, Commerce did not determine normal value based on the best available information and thus failed in its duty to calculate margins as accurately as possible. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1853-3\">The United States (\u201cGovernment\u201d) on behalf of Commerce argues that Commerce\u2019s use of its standard NME methodology to calculate antidumping duty margins is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. The Government contends that the Suspension Agreement is irrelevant for purposes of calculating antidumping duty margins because the purpose of the reference price provision was to prevent price suppression in the United States market, not to eliminate the dumping of honey.

The Government asserts that this is clear from the Suspension Agreement itself, which recites that it was entered into pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z). <em>See id. </em>at 24-25. Furthermore, the Government argues that \u201c[t]he fact that the reference prices were based upon the average unit value of honey imports into the United States from all other countries, and not from prices or costs associated with [the calculation of] [normal value] (in this case, from the surrogate country India) demonstrates that these prices were not intended to eliminate \u2018less than fair value\u2019 sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. Thus, the Government maintains that \u201cCommerce . . . correctly calculated antidumping margins in this case based upon the actual price and \u2018factor\u2019 information submitted on the record, and not based upon irrelevant \u2018reference prices\u2019 contained in the expired suspension agreement.\u201d Zci. at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1853-4\">The court finds Commerce\u2019s antidumping determination and calculation of antidumping duty margins to be in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. As the PRC is an NME country, Commerce applied the NME methodology pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) to determine normal value for Zhejiang, Kunshan, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Native Produce &amp; Animal ByProducts Import &amp; Export Corp. (\u201cInner Mongolia\u201d), which represented, by volume, the three largest exporters of the Subject Mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1838\">*1838</page-number>chandise during the POI. Prelim. Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 24,101. Commerce selected and valued the factors of production using data from India and explained its calculations. <em>See id. </em>at 24,105-06; <em>see generally </em>Prelim. Analysis Mem. of 5/4/01, Conf. R. Docs. 47\u2014 49; Verification Mem. of 7/72/01, Conf. R. Docs. 64-66; Final Analysis Mem. of 9/26/01, Conf. R. Docs. 73-75; Am. Final Analysis Mem. of 11/28/01, Conf. R. Doc. 78. Commerce determined export price by referring to sales and pricing information submitted by Plaintiffs regarding sales made to unaffiliated purchasers in the United States during the POI. <em>See </em>Prelim. Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 24,105; <em>see also </em>Prelim. Analysis Mem., Conf. R. Docs. 47-49 at 1-2; Section C &amp; D Questionnaire Resps. of Inner Mongolia, Conf. R. Doc. 22, Ex. C-1; Kunshan, Conf. R. Doc. 23, Ex. C-1; Zhejiang, Conf. R. Doc. 24, Ex. C-l (U.S. sales listings). Plaintiffs\u2019 questionnaire responses indicate that they freely negotiated the contract price for the sale of honey with U.S. purchasers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>Kunshan Section A Supp. Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 73 at 9 (\u201c[P]rices with U.S. customers are determined as a result of negotiations with those U.S. customers.\u201d). Commerce\u2019s comparison of normal value and export price led to the conclusion that the Subject Merchandise was being sold or was likely to be sold at less than fair value in the United States. The mathematical accuracy of Commerce\u2019s computation of antidumping duty margins is not in dispute. <em>See Lasko Metal Prods. Inc., </em>43 F.3d at 1446.</p>\n<p id=\"b1854-4\">What is in dispute is whether Commerce used the best available information in making the comparison. The court does not agree with Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Commerce erred by finding Plaintiffs\u2019 U.S. sales were made at less than fair value where those sales were made in compliance with the Suspension Agreement. First, nothing in the statutes or regulations that guide Commerce\u2019s antidumping determination in the NME context requires (or for that matter permits) Commerce to consider the terms of a suspension agreement. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b(c), 1677a(a); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(a). Second, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the inclusion of the reference price does not require the court to find that the Suspension Agreement was entered into pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(b). While 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(i) authorizes Commerce to enter into suspension agreements that restrict the volume of imports with NME countries, subsection (Z) does not provide any guidance with respect to how volume restriction is to be achieved, the terms that may or may not be included in an agreement to restrict the volume of imports, or the permissible means by which prevention of the \u201csuppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports\u201d might be realized. Certainly, the statute cannot be read to restrict an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1839\">*1839</page-number>ment to a single term related only to quantity, and to forbid a term dealing with price. Rather, it appears that the terms of such agreements are products of negotiation, and are designed to give effect to the suspension agreement\u2019s purpose \u2014 here, to prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of the domestic product. <em>See, e.g., Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT ,_, 146 F. Supp. 2d 927, 928 (2001) (noting that, in general, a suspension agreement is \u201ca unique form of settlement agreement\u201d); <em>see also Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT ,_, 159 F. Supp. 2d 730, 750 n.38 (noting \u201cnegotiated \u2018reference price\u2019 \u201d in subsection (c) suspension agreement at issue was price below which exporters were prohibited from selling steel in United States).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Third, the language of the Suspension Agreement clearly provided that its purpose was to prevent price suppression and undercutting and to restrict the volume of imports, not to eliminate dumping directly. Suspension Agreement, 60 Fed. Reg. at 42,522. There are numerous references to this purpose in the Suspension Agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The most convincing evidence that the reference price utilized in the Suspension Agreement was not designed to eliminate the dumping margin, however, is that it was arrived at by using none of the tools used in an antidumping case, i.e., a fair comparison of the normal value and export price. Rather, it was determined by reference to a number representing 92% of \u201cthe weighted-average of the honey unit import values from all other countries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42,524. Subsection (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1840\">*1840</page-number>agreements, by contrast, normally include provisions relating to the establishment of normal value.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1856-4\">Moreover, the legislative history surrounding 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(i) does not strengthen Plaintiffs\u2019 position. This history merely echoes the language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z). Subsection <em>(l) </em>permits Commerce to enter into agreements with NME countries \u201cto restrict the volume of imports into the United Stat\u00e9s of the merchandise under investigation only if [Commerce] determines\u201d certain statutory criteria have been met, i.e., that the agreement \u201cwill prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of the merchandise under investigation,\u201d as well as comply with the public interest requirements. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(i)(l)(A)-(B). Similarly, the legislative history states that this provision authorizes the \u201csuspension] of antidumping investigations of imports from non-market economy countries based on quantitative restraint agreements,\u201d and further notes that \u201c[s]uch agreements must satisfy the general requirements for suspension agreements, including public interest criteria, and prevent suppression or undercutting of domestic price levels.\u201d H.R. CONF. Rep. No. 100-576, at 593, <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1626. Nothing in the statute or legislative history dissuades the court from concluding that the goal of the Suspension Agreement, the restriction of the volume of imports and the prevention of price suppression and undercutting, may lawfully be achieved through the use of a reference price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1856-5\">Finally, the court finds that the Suspension Agreement\u2019s reference to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(f)(2)(A) does not in itself establish that the agreement was entered into to eliminate dumping. Rather, this reference was likely included because there is no statutory provision specifically directed to agreements concluded in the NME context by which the suspension of liquidation may be terminated. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(f)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1856-6\">As Commerce has complied with the statutes guiding its determinations with respect to the calculation of normal value in the NME context, and the calculation of export price, and as there is no dispute as to the mathematical accuracy of the estimated margins as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1841\">*1841</page-number>reported in the Amended Final Determination, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s calculation of antidumping duty margins is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lasko Metal Prods Inc., </em>43 F.3d at 1446; <em>NTN Bearing Corp., </em>74 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b1857-3\">II.

The Government acknowledges that the statute does not explicitly provide for the method by which Commerce is to evaluate the level of an importer\u2019s knowledge of dumping or material injury, and urges that the practices it has developed are reasonable and should be accorded deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A.

Citing Commerce\u2019s \u201csubstantial discretion,\u201d in determining importers\u2019 knowledge of dumping, the Government argues that \u201c[a] 11 that is required is that \u2018the evidence in the administrative record could have reasonably led to [Commerce\u2019s] conclusion that the importers . . . knew or should have known that the imports were being sold at less than fair value during the period that the dumping investigation was proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30 (quoting <em>ICC Indus., Inc., </em>812 F.2d at 698 (ellipsis as in original)).

In the absence of such guidance on this issue, Commerce has interpreted this standard in the course of its anti-dumping determinations. <em>See, e.g., </em>determinations cited <em>infra </em>nn.35, 36. Where a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the issue in question, the court must first determine whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation is a permissible, or reasonable, one. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843; <em>Pesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1847\">*1847</page-number>F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The court finds Commerce\u2019s construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii), with respect to whether an importer knew or should have known of dumping and material injury, to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1863-3\">With respect to knowledge of dumping, Commerce has interpreted 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii) to mean that where an antidumping duty margin is found to be 25% or more the importer knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than fair value. Commerce\u2019s rationale is that a margin of that magnitude is sufficiently high that a reasonable importer knew, or should have discovered (upon reasonable inquiry), that it was purchasing the subject imports at less than fair value. <em>See </em>Carbon Steel Wire Rod From Arg., 49 Fed. Reg. at 38,171 (\u201cIt is the Department\u2019s position that this test is met where margins calculated on the basis of responses to the Department\u2019s questionnaire are sufficiently large that the importer knew or should have known that prices for sales to the United States (as adjusted according to the antidumping law) were significantly below home market sales prices.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1863-4\">The court finds this interpretation to be a reasonable construction of the knowledge of dumping prong of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii) in the NME context. First, this court and our reviewing court have recognized that importers of merchandise from NME countries are not outside the ambit of the critical circumstances provision simply because importers cannot know, with certainty, what surrogate data Commerce might use to calculate normal value.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>ICC Indus., Inc., </em>10 CIT at 185; <em>ICC Indus., Inc., </em>812 F.2d at 698 (\u201cWhile the uncertainty of not knowing which country will be chosen by the ITA as the surrogate country is seemingly unfair to an importer of goods from NME countries, this is but one criticism of the statute and is not enough to exempt the importers from the reach of the statute.\u201d). Second, although the 25% or more rule was not reviewed in <em>ICC Industries, Inc., </em>the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did consider, and uphold, Commerce\u2019s reasoning in determining that the importer knew or should have known that the sales of the merchandise in issue were made at less than fair value. Commerce had found that the importers knew that the prices at which they had purchased potassium permanganate from the PRC were \u201ccompetitive,\u201d and that \u201cthe unit price of potassium permanganate was 22% less than that imported from Spain and 40% less than the price of the domestic prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1848\">*1848</page-number>uct.\u201d <em>See ICC Indus., Inc., </em>812 F.2d at 698. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated that \u201c[t]his level of underselling ... is sufficient to support the ITA\u2019s conclusion that these importers should have known that they were importing potassium permanganate at [less than fair value].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699. The 25% or more rule adheres to, and is a reasonable extension of, that rationale. The magnitude of the margin, i.e., 25%, is sufficiently large so as to justify concluding that any person in the business of importing honey knew or should have known that the price paid for the product was disproportionately low. This being the case, the court finds Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the knew or should have known standard with respect to importer knowledge of dumping to be reasonable.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1864-4\">With respect to importer knowledge that there would be material injury by reason of such less than fair value sales, Commerce has developed a practice of finding the requisite knowledge where the ITC has made an affirmative preliminary injury determination. <em>See, e.g., </em>Commerce determinations cited <em>infra </em>n.36. In 1994, Congress amended the critical circumstances statute to require that Commerce find not only that an importer knew or should have known of less than fair value sales of the merchandise at issue, but also that such importer knew or should have known \u201cthat there would be material injury by reason of such [less than fair value] sales.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>H.R.

Determination at 12. In its investigation of honey from the PRC, the ITC preliminarily concluded that the volume, price effects (including price suppression and depression), and impact of imports of the Subject Merchandise were significant. <em>See </em>ITC Preliminary Determination at 15-18. The ITC\u2019s findings with respect to these factors are unchallenged. <em>See </em>Pls.\u2019 Mem. at 24 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1865-5\">In addition, Plaintiffs do not challenge Commerce\u2019s massive imports determination, made pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.206(h). According to a comparison of monthly shipment data supplied by the PRC exporters, Commerce found that \u201cimports of honey from High Hope and Zhejiang showed post-filing increases of at least 15 percent\u201d between October 2000 and February 2001 (the post-filing period), as compared to May 2000 through September 2000 (the pre-filing period). <em>See </em>Prelim. Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 24,107. When combined with the importer\u2019s actual knowledge of massive imports, and Commerce\u2019s finding of antidumping duty margins of 25% or more, an affirmative preliminary determination by the ITC that there is a reasonable indication of material injury by reason of allegedly dumped imports of the Subject Merchandise supplies sufficient reason for Commerce to charge the importer with the duty of inquiry with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1865-6\">The existence of the Suspension Agreement does not alter the court\u2019s analysis. Although, as Plaintiffs correctly note, the Suspension Agreement\u2019s declared purpose was to \u201cprevent! ] the suppression or undercutting of price levels of the domestic product,\u201d Suspension Agreement, 66 Fed. Reg. at 42,522; Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 24, Plaintiffs incorrectly conclude that an exporter\u2019s alleged compliance with the quota restrictions and the reference price negates the reasonableness of Commerce\u2019s finding that an importer knew or should have known that material injury would result from dumped imports of the Subject Merchandise. This is especially true when one considers that Commerce determines whether a suspension agreement will prevent the suppression or undercutting of domestic prices in deciding whether or not to enter into a suspension agreement with an NME <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1850\">*1850</page-number>country, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(Z), whereas the ITC is charged with determining material injury. The two determinations involve distinct analyses conducted by different agencies; Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the existence of the Suspension Agreement renders Commerce\u2019s finding of knowledge of material injury unreasonable lacks merit. Thus, Commerce\u2019s methodology with respect to a finding that the importer knew or should have known of material injury is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1866-4\">Having determined that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the knew or should have known standard in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii), made in the context of an antidumping investigation, is reasonable, the court must next determine whether it is deserving of some level of deference. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that \u201cCommerce\u2019s antidumping determinations are \u2018adjudication [s] that produce. . . rulings for which deference [under Chevron] is claimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1382 (quoting <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 229 (2001)). Under <em>Chevron, </em>this court defers to statutory interpretations articulated by Commerce during its antidumping proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1382. Such pronouncements are considered to be precedential. <em>Id. </em>at 1381-82 (\u201cCommerce routinely considers the legal interpretations announced in its prior antidump-ing and countervailing duty determinations to be precedential. . . . So too does the Court of International Trade and this court.\u201d) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the court finds <em>Chevron </em>deference appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1866-5\">The longstanding status of Commerce\u2019s interpretations further argues in favor of deferring to them. <em>See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1565, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978)) (\u201c[TJhe longstanding status of Commerce\u2019s practice provides a . . . rationale for deferring to the agency\u2019s interpretation.\u201d); <em>see also Am. Silicon Techs. v. United States, </em>334 F.3d 1033, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <em>Koyo Seiko Co., </em>36 F.3d at 1570, 1575) (sustaining \u201cas reasonable Commerce\u2019s well established practice of basing interest expenses and income on fully consolidated financial statements.\u201d). It has long been Commerce\u2019s practice to impute knowledge of dumping, for purposes of determining whether critical circumstances exist, where Commerce finds an-tidumping duty margins of 25% or more.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indeed, evidence of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1851\">*1851</page-number>practice is present in Commerce determinations dating as far back as 1984. <em>See, e.g., </em>Commerce determinations cited <em>supra </em>n.32. In addition, Congress\u2019 silence on the matter, despite legislative amendment of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A) in 1994 \u2014 a decade after Commerce instituted its practice of imputing knowledge of dumping under the 25% or more rule \u2014 is significant. Moreover, as discussed <em>supra, </em>for years Commerce has, in the course of antidumping investigations, imputed knowledge of material injury by reason of sales at less than fair value, where the ITC makes an affirmative preliminary determination of material injury.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, (1) having determined that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii) with respect to the knew or should have known standard in both the dumping and material injury contexts is reasonable, (2) the interpretation having been made in the context of an antidumping determination, and (3) in light of the longstanding status of Commerce\u2019s interpretation, Congress having been afforded an opportunity to address this interpretation and having failed to do so, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the knew or should have known standard in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>See Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1867-3\">As noted, Plaintiffs do not challenge Commerce\u2019s massive imports determination, nor do they argue that Commerce miscalculated the antidumping duty margins Commerce found to be in excess of 25%. Further, it is undisputed that the ITC made an affirmative preliminary injury determination, the merits of which are unchallenged. Thus, in light of the court\u2019s finding with respect to Commerce\u2019s construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(3)(A)(ii), the court finds that Commerce\u2019s final affirmative critical circumstances determination is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1867-4\">III. Commerce\u2019s valuation of raw honey is neither in accordance with law nor supported by substantial evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1867-5\">Among the factors of production valued by Commerce was raw honey. In valuing raw honey, Commerce \u201cused an average of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1852\">*1852</page-number>highest and lowest price for raw honey given in [an article published in The Tribune of India (\u201cTribune Article\u201d)], entitled, \u2018Apiculture, a major foreign exchange earner.\u2019 \u201d Prelim. Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 24,106. In the Final Determination, Commerce continued to value honey using information contained in the Tribune Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1868-3\">The raw honey price data from <em>The Tribune of India </em>is the best available surrogate value for the following reasons: 1) it is the most contemporaneous, dated May 1, 2000; 2) the broad-based data is specific to Indian raw honey prices (i.e., generally Indian honey, like PRC raw honey, has a high moisture content); and 3) it is quality agricultural data. We do not find that the prices offered by petitioners and respondents offer more accurate or representative alternatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1868-4\">Decision Mem., Pub. R. Doc. 216 at 21; <em>see The Tribune of India </em>(May 1, 2000), Pub. R. Doc. 219, App. IX. In deciding to use the Tribune Article, Commerce rejected a study published by the Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (\u201cAPEDA Study\u201d), finding that \u201cthe values in . . . the APEDA study submitted by respondents . . . suffer from inherent weaknesses not present in the prices reflected in <em>The Tribune of India.\u201d </em>Decision Mem., Pub. R. Doc. 216 at 21. In particular, Commerce stated that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1KE\">unpersuaded that the APEDA study . . . provides a more accurate representation of Indian raw honey prices than does <em>The Tribune of India. </em>The APEDA study is a feasibility study which projects possible future revenues for Indian honey producers. The prices reflected in the study, therefore, are not actual market prices, but rather price projections or estimates. Although respondents are correct that the Department has used projections in the past, its preference is still to use actual prices whenever appropriate actual prices are available. Furthermore, the APEDA study appears to have been completed in 1999; thus, its price projections for 1999 are probably based on information gathered prior to 1999. Therefore, the APEDA study is not contemporaneous with the POI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1868-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22; <em>see also </em>APEDA Study, Pub. R. Doc. 114, Ex. 1. The Tribune Article listed the sale price of honey to be 25 to 45 rupees per kilogram, and Commerce determined the value of raw honey to be 35 rupees per kilogram. <em>See </em>Prelim. Analysis Mem., Conf. R. Docs. 47-49 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1868-7\">Plaintiffs take issue with Commerce\u2019s rejection of the APEDA Study entitled \u201cA study on the Export potential for Indian Honey,\u201d which listed the average \u201cvalue\u201d of honey in India to be 25 rupees per kilogram. Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 26; APEDA Study, Pub. R. Doc. 114, Ex. 1, \u00b63.1. Plaintiffs argue that the Tribune Article is not the best available information and that the reasons Commerce offered for reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1853\">*1853</page-number>ing the APEDA Study are speculative, for the following reasons: (1) Commerce assumed that the study contains <em>estimates </em>of prices instead of actual prices, <em>id. </em>at 28; and (2) Commerce stated that the information represented in the APEDA Study is \u201c \u2018probably based on information gathered prior to 1999.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Decision Mem., Pub. R. Doc. 216 at 22). Plaintiffs assert that the APEDA data are superior to the data contained in the Tribune Article because the APEDA Study \u201cdemonstrates detailed and extensive research into the Indian honey industry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29, as opposed to the \u201coffhand reference\u201d as to the price of honey varying \u201cfrom Rs 25 to Rs 45 per kg\u201d contained in Tribune Article. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs further point out that the Tribune Article does not specify when the pricing data were compiled. <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1869-3\">It is well-established that Commerce enjoys wide discretion in valuing the factors of production. <em>See Nation Ford Chem. Co., </em>166 F.3d at 1377 <em>(citing Lasko Metal Prods. Inc., </em>43 F.3d at 1446) (\u201cWhile \u00a7 1677b(c) provides guidelines to assist Commerce in [constructing foreign market value], this section also accords Commerce wide discretion in the valuation of factors of production in the application of those guidelines.\u201d). However, \u201c[d]espite the broad latitude afforded Commerce and its substantial discretion in choosing the information it relies upon, the agency must act in a manner consistent with the underlying objective of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) \u2014 to obtain the most accurate dumping margins possible.\u201d <em>Shandong Huarong Gen. Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT_,_, 159 F. Supp. 2d 714, 719 (2001) (citing <em>Writing Instrument Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1185, 1192, 984 F. Supp. 629, 637 (1997)); <em>Shakeproof Assembly Components, </em>268 F.3d at 1382 (\u201c[T]he critical question is whether the methodology used by Commerce is based on the best available information and establishes antidumping margins as accurately as possible.\u201d). To determine whether Commerce\u2019s selection of surrogate values furthers this statutory purpose, the court must determine whether \u201cCommerce\u2019s choice of what constitutes the best available information evidences a rational and reasonable relationship to the factor of production it represents.\u201d <em>Shandong Huarong, </em>159 F. Supp. 2d at 719 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1869-6\">As between the source of data relating to the price of honey Commerce selected, and that offered by Plaintiffs, Commerce appears to have used the more reliable source. The Tribune Article addresses the sale price of honey, whereas the table in the APEDA Study from which Plaintiffs identify the \u201caverage value of honey\u201d appears in the context of a discussion concerning the development of a model for \u201cdoubling] the number of bee colonies every 2 years,\u201d not determining the value of honey. <em>See The Tribune of India </em>(May 1, 2000), Pub. R. Doc. 219, App. IX, at 43 (stating that \u201c[t]he sale price of honey by beekeepers in India varies from Rs 25 to Rs 45 per kg\u201d and comparing that price range to prices charged in the United States and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1854\">*1854</page-number>countries); APEDA Study, Pub. R. Doc. 114, Ex. 1, tbl. 3.1; <em>id. </em>\u00b63.1.1. The publication of the Tribune Article, dated May 1, 2000, coincides with the POI.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The APEDA Study, in contrast, bears the year 1999. <em>See generally </em>APEDA Study, Pub. R. Doc. 114, Ex. 1. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that \u201cthere is no reason to assume that \u2018present-day5 values contained in the study are from any period earlier than 1999,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 28, the APEDA Study does not specifically mention any date later than 1998 for the material referenced therein. Thus, as Commerce noted in the Decision Memorandum, the information in the APEDA Study was not contemporaneous with Commerce\u2019s investigation. Moreover, the Tribune Article, published on <em>The India Tribune\u2019s </em>Web site, was publicly available, while Plaintiffs make no such argument with respect to the APEDA Study. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(1) (\u201cThe Secretary normally will use publicly available information to value factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1870-4\">Nonetheless, the results reached by applying the data from the Tribune Article are sufficiently incredible so as to call into question their reliability. Specifically, the weighted-average U.S. price of honey from the PRC was calculated as $857.77 for Zhejiang, $866.59 for Kunshan, and $805.32 for Inner Mongolia (per metric ton). <em>See </em>Final Analysis Mem., Conf. R. Doc. 74, App. XIX (Zhejiang); Conf. R. Doc. 73, App. IX (Kunshan); Conf. R. Doc. 75, App. IX (Inner Mongolia). In accordance with the Suspension Agreement,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the minimum price at which honey could be sold during the POI was equal to 92% of the weighted-average of the honey unit import values from all other countries.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Suspension Agreement, 60 Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1855\">*1855</page-number>Reg. at 42,524. Thus, taking Zhejiang\u2019s data as an example, the weighted-average of honey unit import values from all other countries during the POI would have been approximately $932.25 per metric ton. Using a price of 35 rupees per kilogram, however, Commerce calculated normal value for Zhejiang to be $1,001.99 per metric ton and the foreign unit price in U.S. dollars to be $1,067.72. <em>See </em>Final Analysis Mem., Conf. R. Doc. 74, App. VIII. Thus, the weighted-average of the honey unit import values from all other countries was approximately $69.74 less than Commerce\u2019s calculation of the normal value of honey sold by Zhejiang. Because raw honey is by far the most important factor of production, its valuation appears to be the most anomalous. As MOFTEC put it in a letter to Commerce, \u201cThis conclusion implies that the whole world was dumping honey during [the POI], which is irrational.\u201d Letter of MOFTEC to Commerce via facsimile of 9/21/01, Pub. R. Doc. 237 \u00b62. While it is possible that the PRC is the worldwide high cost producer of honey, the very magnitude of the difference between Commerce\u2019s calculation of normal value and the weighted-average of honey unit import values from all other countries during the POI, calls into question Commerce\u2019s methodology and the evidence on which it relied. Indeed, this anomalous result indicates that Commerce\u2019s methodology was lacking, and thus not in accordance with law, and that its conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1871-3\">On remand, Commerce shall revisit its decision to value raw honey at 35 rupees per kilogram. Commerce shall (1) determine whether the use of the Tribune Article results in the \u201cvaluation of [raw honey] . . . based on the best available information regarding the value[] of such factor[ ],\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l), (2) should it find that it is, explain in detail how the use of 35 rupees per kilogram in determining normal value \u201cevidences a rational and reasonable relationship to the factor of production it represents,\u201d <em>Shandong Huarong, </em>159 F. Supp. 2d at 719, (3) no matter whether it continues to use the Tribune Article or other sources, fully and completely justify any sources of data as the \u201cbest available information\u201d for the finding such data are used to support, and (4) should any resulting calculation of normal value of honey from the PRC exceed that of the weighted-average of the honey unit import values from all other countries during the POI, explain in detail how this furthers the goal of estimating antidumping duty margins as accurately as possible. <em>See Lasko Metal Prods. Inc., </em>43 F.3d at 1446. To the extent Commerce\u2019s findings on remand alter its determinations with respect to the calculation of antidumping duty margins or critical circumstances, Commerce shall amend such determinations accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1856\">*1856</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1872-4\">Based on the foregoing, this matter is remanded to Commerce for further consideration in conformity with this opinion.

First, Commerce established and notified MOFTEC of a quota for honey exported to the United States from the PRC. Then, through a bidding process conducted within the PRC, the quota was allocated among the largest honey exporters. Next, those exporters were notified by the FTA of their eligibility for an export license. Once it received a quota allocation and notice that it was eligible for an export license, the exporter could enter a contract for the sale of honey to the United States. If a contract for sale was entered into by the exporter, the Chamber reviewed the contract price to ensure that it complied with the reference price. Then, to obtain an export license, the exporter submitted various documentation to the QLB, including the FTA notice of quota allocation, the sales contract, and the notice of eligibility for an export license from the Chamber.

Nonetheless, Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged compliance with the Suspension Agreement (which Commerce does not dispute) is a useful way to establish the facts upon which a substantial evidence determination can be made. In other words, while Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the Suspension Agreement as evidence to refute a dumping or critical circumstances determination may not be justified, the actual facts relating to U.S. sales price resulting from compliance with the Suspension Agreement can be used to determine if a finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1870-7\"> It is clear that the Suspension Agreement was before Commerce during the course of the Second Investigation and thus may fairly be considered part of the record. <em>See Floral Trade Council v. United States, </em>13 CIT 242, 244, 709 F. Supp. 229, 231 (1989) (holding documents from earlier investigations that become \u201csufficiently connected to the current investigation [may] be considered to be before the agency for purposes of the decision at issue.\u201d). At the administrative level, Commerce addressed Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments concerning the relevance of the Suspension Agreement with respect to such matters as, e.g., Commerce\u2019s critical circumstances determination. <em>See, e.g., </em>Decision Mem., Pub. R. Doc. 216 at 4 (cooperation of PRC producers/exporters), 7 (critical circumstances); Final Determination, 66 Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1855\">*1855</page-number>Reg. at 50,610 (adopting by reference the Decision Memorandum). Likewise, the issue was argued before this court in the parties\u2019 briefs, see, <em>e.g., </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 4; Def.\u2019s Mem. at 20, and at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
