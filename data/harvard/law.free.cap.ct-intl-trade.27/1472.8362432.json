Introduction</p>\n<author id=\"b1489-5\">WALLACH, <em>Judge:</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5IM\">This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff, Viraj Forgings, Ltd.\u2019s, (\u201cViraj\u201d) Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record, pursuant to USCIT Rule 56.2. At issue are certain aspects of the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d) decision in Certain Stainless Steel Flanges from India; Final Results of Anti-dumping Duty Administrative Review, 66 Fed. Reg. 48,244 (Sept. 19, 2001) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d) and the accompanying Memorandum from Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary AD/CVD Enforcement Group III, to Fayar Shirzad, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results in the Antidumping Duty Administrative of Certain Stainless Steel Flanges from India (Sept. 19, 2001) (\u201cDecision Memoranda\u201d). Pub. Doc. 158; Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix for Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment Upon the Agency Record, 2 (\u201cPub. App.\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, the Court remands the challenged determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-7\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-8\">Plaintiff Viraj is an Indian manufacturer of stainless steel flanges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1994, Commerce published an antidumping duty order for stainless steel flanges from India in Amended Final Determination and Antidumping Order; Certain Forged Stainless Steel Flanges from India, 59 Fed. Reg. 5,994 (Feb. 9, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-9\">In 2000, Commerce published the opportunity to request a review of the antidumping order. Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity To Request Administrative Review, 65 Fed. Reg. 7,348 (Feb. 14, 2000). In conformity with 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.213(b)(1) (1999), petitioners Gerlin Inc., Ideal Forging Corporation, and Maas Flange Corporation requested reviews of manufacturers Isibars, Panchmahal, Patheja, and Viraj. Commerce subsequently published a notice of initiation of antidump-ing duty administrative reviews covering the period of investigation from February 1, 1999 through January 31, 2000. Initiation of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, 65 Fed. Reg. 16,875 (Mar. 30, 2000). The scope of the administrative review covered \u201ccertain forged stainless steel flanges from India both finished and not-finished,\u201d and included five general types of flanges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>that also generally matched the American Society for Testing and Materials (\u201cASTM\u201d) specification A-182. Final Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 48,244.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-4\">In April of 2000, as part of the antidumping review, Commerce sent an antidumping questionnaire to respondents. Certain Forged Stainless Steel Flanges From India; Preliminary Results of Anti-dumping Duty Administrative Review, 66 Fed. Reg. 14,127, 14,128 (Mar. 9, 2001) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). Plaintiff stated in its questionnaire responses that the cost of the raw materials, mainly stainless steel, accounted for the preponderance of the cost of production during the period of review. Plaintiff also stated that the costs of the other factors of production such as labor, fixed overhead, and variable overhead were roughly proportional to the cost of materials. The petitioners filed sales-below-cost allegations based on Plaintiffs questionnaire responses and Commerce initiated an investigation to determine whether Plaintiffs sales of flanges during the period of investigation were made below the cost of production, hi at 14,129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-6\">Commerce verified the information provided by Plaintiff and preliminarily determined that Plaintiffs dumping margin was 21.10 percent. Id. at 14,130. On September 19, 2001, Commerce published the Final Results containing the weighted-average dumping margin for the firms under review, which adopted the 21.10 percent dumping margin from the preliminary determination for Viraj. Final Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 48,245. On October 18, 2001, Plaintiff filed a summons with the Court initiating this suit and challenging Commerce\u2019s final results. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-7\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-8\">This Court will not sustain determinations, findings or conclusions of Commerce that are \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d Fujitsu General Ltd. v. United States, 88 F.3d 1034, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1996); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1999). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 299, 59 S. Ct. 206, 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938)). Therefore, in order for Commerce\u2019s determination to be sustained, the determination must be reasonable, supported by the record as a whole, and the grounds that the administrative agency acted upon clearly disclosed. See Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, 744 F.2d 1556, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1984); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, 750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984); see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S. Ct. 454, 462 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>IV. Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-4\">Plaintiff challenges the Final Results on three grounds. First, Plaintiff claims that Commerce impermissibly ignored its past precedent and regulations when it selected Germany as the third-country comparison market pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)(ii) (1999) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e) (1999). Second, Plaintiff argues that Commerce impermissibly compared non-comparable merchandise and ignored its past precedent and regulations when it treated United States ASTM standard forgings and German Deutsches Institut fur Normung e.V. (\u201cDIN\u201d) standard flanges as foreign like products under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16) (1999). Third, Plaintiff contends that Commerce\u2019s decision to calculate the dumping margin on a per-kilogram basis rather than a per piece basis resulted in an inaccurate dumping margin, was an unexplained departure from its past precedents, and was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-5\">V. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-6\">Antidumping laws require that Commerce impose antidumping duties on imported merchandise sold, or likely to be sold, in the United States at less than its fair value when those sales injure or threaten injury to a United States industry. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673 (1999). The amount of duty that Commerce imposes is the amount by which the price charged for the subject merchandise in the home market or the \u201cnormal value\u201d exceeds the price charged in the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(A), (B). In most instances, Commerce bases normal value calculations on sales of the foreign like product in the home market. However, Plaintiff stated in its questionnaire response that it sold no flanges in its home market, India. Based on this fact, Commerce concluded that Plaintiffs sales to a third country should be used as the basis for normal value calculations. Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,128-14,129; see 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(C); see also 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-7\">The initial threshold for determining whether a third country constitutes a viable comparison market is whether \u201c[t]he Secretary is satisfied that sales of the foreign like product in that country are of sufficient quantity to form the basis of normal value.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(b)(1). Sufficient quantity for a third country comparison market \u201cis 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of its sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(b)(2) (2000). In this review, Commerce had to calculate normal value as the price at which the flanges were first sold for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>sumption, in one of the three countries plaintiff listed in its questionnaire (Australia, Canada, or Germany) in usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-4\">In calculating normal value based on prices in a third country, \u201cwhere prices in more than one third country satisfy the criteria of section 773(a)(l)(B)(ii) of the Act. . . [Commerce] generally will select the third country based on the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-5\">(1) The foreign like product exported to a particular third country is more similar to the subject merchandise exported to the United States than is the foreign like product exported to other third countries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-6\">(2) The volume of sales to a particular third country is larger than the volume of sales to other third countries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-7\">(3) Such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1492-8\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e). Plaintiff indicated in its questionnaire responses that its exports of flanges to Australia comprised the smallest market; its exports to Canada had 12 times the required 5 percent threshold with 60 percent of U.S. Sales; and its exports to the largest market, Germany, had 20 times the required 5 percent threshold with 104 percent of U.S. sales. Plaintiff Viraj\u2019s Reply to the Defendant\u2019s Reply to Viraj\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record (\u201cPlaintiffs Reply\u201d) at 19; see also Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff Viraj\u2019s Motion for Judgment upon the Agency Record (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Opposition\u201d) at 4. In order to calculate normal value for this review, Commerce chose Germany, the largest market Plaintiff reported, as the third country comparison market and verified that the German sales were above the cost of production. Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,128-29 (stating that \u201c[w]e found no reason to determine that quantity was not the appropriate basis for these comparisons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-9\">In addition to determining the appropriate third country comparison market, Commerce must also choose \u201cforeign like products\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to compare to the merchandise exported to the United States. Pesquera Mares Australes LTDA. v. United States, 266 F. 3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The statute governing foreign like product provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-10\">\u201cforeign like product\u201d means merchandise in the first of the following categories in respect of which a determination for the purposes of part II of this subtitle can be satisfactorily made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-11\">(A) The subject merchandise and other merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics with, and was produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>in the same country by the same person as, that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-4\">(B) Merchandise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-5\">(i) produced in the same country and by the same person as the subject merchandise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-6\">(ii) like that merchandise in component material or materials and in the purposes for which used, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-7\">(iii) approximately equal in commercial value to that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-8\">(C) Merchandise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-9\">(i) produced in the same country and by the same person and of the same general class or kind as the subject merchandise,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-10\">(ii) like that merchandise in the purposes for which used, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-11\">(iii) which the administering authority determines may reasonably be compared with that merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1493-12\">19 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16) (1999). Accuracy, as well as the statute, requires Commerce to first look for identical merchandise with which to match the United States model to the comparable home market or third country model.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Torrington Co. v. United States, 146 F. Supp. 2d 845, 874 (CIT 2001); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16). If identical merchandise is unavailable, Commerce must look to merchandise under the second category, and, if that is not available, under the third category. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16). Whenever possible, Commerce must make an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison of merchandise to effectuate a fair comparison between the normal value and United States price. See Torrington Co. v. United States, 68 F.3d 1347, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Thus, in \u201caccordance with the statutory mandate, [of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)] absent identical merchandise, Commerce must \u2018choose the most similar merchandise for comparison.\u2019 \u201d Hussey Copper, Ltd. v. United States, 17 CIT 993, 995, 834 F Supp. 413, 417 (1993) (quoting Timkin Co. v. United States, 10 CIT 86, 96, 630 F. Supp. 1327, 1336 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-13\">Commerce determined the cost of production by calculating \u201cthe sum of the costs of materials and fabrication employed in producing the foreign like product, plus selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) and packing.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 5; Prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>nary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,129. Commerce next calculated German market sales prices and excluded sales that were less than the cost of production. Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 5. Where Plaintiff sold less than 20 percent of the German merchandise below the cost of production, Commerce averaged the cost of all merchandise sales. Id.; see 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(2)(C). Where Plaintiff sold more than 20 percent at below the cost of production Commerce excluded all below cost sales from the sample it averaged. Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 5; see \u00a7 1677b (b)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-4\">Commerce then developed a methodology to compare the German DIN proof or fully machined flanges to the ASTM rough forgings, because the merchandise sold to Germany and the United States were made to these two different industrial standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the Decision Memoranda, Commerce agreed with the petitioners that flanges, \u201c \u2018whether produced to DIN standards or ASTM standards, will still look the same, serve the same function and be of comparable size and weight. . . [and] [w]hile conceding that flanges produced to DIN standards could be slightly different from the merchandise sold in the United States, the actual differences .... are very likely minor or nonexistent.\u2019 \u201d Decision Memoranda at 29; Pub. App. 2 at 38. In order to make the merchandise comparable, Commerce converted all flanges and forgings from cost-per-piece, which is how Plaintiff sold the merchandise, to cost-per-kilogram. Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,128 (stating that \u201c[t]he record demonstrates that there can be large differences between the weight (and corresponding cost and price) of stainless steel flanges based on relative sizes, so comparisons of aggregate data would be distorted for these products if volume comparisons were based on the number of pieces.\u201d). In its cost of production analysis, Commerce \u201cdetermined that only grade, type, size, pressure rating, and finish were required to define models for purposes of matching.\u201d (collectively \u201cmatching criteria\u201d). Id. at 14, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-5\">The antidumping statute provides for adjustments to normal value if differences in physical characteristics between the foreign like product and the merchandise exported to the United States exist. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C). Therefore, Commerce adjusts normal value for the \u201cdifference in cost attributable to the difference in physical characteristics\u201d if the foreign like product is not identical to the merchandise exported to the United States. Mitsubishi Heavy Indus. v. United States, 23 CIT 326, 340, 54 F. Supp.2d 1183, 1196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>(1999). Commerce applied the standard 20 percent difference in merchandise (\u201cDIFMER\u201d) deviation gap to exclude Plaintiffs products that had a greater than 20 percent difference in cost of production per kilogram from the dumping margin calculations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id.; Decision Memoranda at 24-26; see also Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 9 at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-4\">B. Commerce\u2019s Selection of Germany as the Third Country Comparison Market was Inconsistent with its Prior Determination and Unsupported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">During an administrative review, Commerce recalculates a company\u2019s dumping margin in order to determine whether that company has continued to sell its merchandise in the United States for less than a comparable foreign like product sold in either the company\u2019s home market or the applicable third country comparison market. See NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, 295 F.3d 1263, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A) (1999). Plaintiff argues that Commerce\u2019s selection of Germany as the third country comparison market in this review was inconsistent with its own regulations and prior determination. Commerce claims that it chose Germany as the third country comparison market for the purpose of calculating normal value because Germany was the largest market of the three countries Plaintiff listed. Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 14, Decision Memoranda at 29-30; Pub. App. 2 at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>Commerce considers the legal interpretations of prior antidump-ing and countervailing duty determinations precedential. Citrosuco Paulista, S.A. v. United States, 12 CIT 1196, 1209, 704 F. Supp. 1075, 1088 (1988); MM&amp;P Maritime Advancement, Training, Education &amp; Safety Program, 729 F.2d 748, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Commerce need not \u201cforever hew\u201d to its precedents, but should the agency reverse itself, as a result of the sagacity acquired from experience and changed circumstances, it must confront the issue squarely and explain why its departure was reasonable. Davila-Bardales v. INS, 27 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Baoding Yude Chem. Indus. v. United States, 170 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1340 (CIT 2001). The flexibility to change its position, requires that the agency must explain the basis for its change, and that explanation must be in accordance with law, and supported by substantial evidence. Cultivos Miramonte S.A. v. United States, 21 CIT 1059, 1064, 980 F. Supp. 1268, 1274 (1997). During oral argument, Defendant stated that Commerce \u201cweighed the relative importance of markets, to having an exact model match, and in this case determined that the market was more important.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1496-4\">In a prior review of stainless steel flanges from India, Commerce chose Canada as the appropriate third country comparison market rather than the largest available market, Japan. See Certain Forged Stainless Steel From India; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 61 Fed. Reg. 51,263 (Oct. 1, 1996) (\u201cAkai Decision\u201d). The exporter in that review, Akai Impex, Ltd. (\u201cAkai\u201d) argued against the use of Canada as its third country comparison market. Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 10 at 67. Akai claimed that Japan was the more appropriate comparison market because Japan was the largest of the third country markets available for comparison. Id. Additionally, Akai wanted Commerce to determine normal value by comparing Akai\u2019s sales made to the United States ASTM standard to sales made to the Japanese Industrial Standards (\u201cJIS\u201d). Id. Akai\u2019s reasoning was that \u201cthe merchandise end use, raw material and process of manufacturing is [sic] same\u201d and the end product in terms of \u201cDollar per K.G.\u201d could be a reasonable comparison methodology. Id. However, Commerce chose the smaller market, Canada, which had goods made to the similar ASTM standard, \u00e1nd compared the merchandise on a price-per-piece basis rather than engaging in the methodology Akai proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>Commerce has changed its position in this review and used the method previously proposed by Akai, yet eschewed by Commerce. Defendant admits to a change in position in its brief but claims that \u201cCommerce explained in the Decision Memorandum that, in this case, the German market was decidedly the largest market, whereas, in the earlier decision, the two markets were of roughly equal size.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 14. Thus, Defendant alleges that Commerce adequately explained its factual distinction and departure from Akai. RL; Decision Memoranda at 30; Pub. App. 2 at 39. Specifically, Commerce stated in the Decision Memorandum that it chose Germany because (1) \u201cin volume, Viraj\u2019s German market surpasses its Canadian market significantly;\u201d (2) the Akai Impex precedent \u201cinvolved a different set of markets, of relative different size;\u201d and (3) Germany was the \u201clargest available comparison market.\u201d Decision Memoranda at 30; Pub. App. 2 at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-4\">Commerce\u2019s reasoning assumes and reiterates its conclusion that Germany is the appropriate comparison market without adequate explanation or support. Neither the preliminary nor final results in the Akai Decision mention that the size of the Canadian and Japanese markets was a factor in the previous determination. See Certain Forged Stainless Steel Flanges from India; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 61 Fed. Reg. 14,073 (Mar. 29, 1996); Akai Decision, 61 Fed. Reg. 51,263. Moreover, Defendant does not provide the court with evidence that the size of the market in the Akai Decision was a determining factor. If the factual distinction that Commerce is attempting to make is that the size of the market had bearing on Commerce\u2019s determination, then that distinction must be supported by evidence. Without such evidence, Commerce\u2019s claim is merely unsupported conjecture. \u201cIt is well established that an agency\u2019s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n. v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443, 462 (1983). The Court cannot speculate on Commerce\u2019s claims of a (1) \u201cdifferent relative size;\u201d (2) whether the markets were of \u201croughly equal size;\u201d or (3) whether market size was even a factor in the Akai Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">The only evidence provided to the court regarding Commerce\u2019s prior practice for determining the appropriate comparison market is the published results from the Akai Decision and the public records from Akai that Plaintiff provided. Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 10 at 67. That evidence indicates that previously, Commerce\u2019s practice has been to chose a smaller market where merchandise was made to the same industrial standard. Lacking further evidence, the Court must view Defendant\u2019s claim as unsupported by the prior review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">On remand, Commerce must either rationally articulate the basis for its departure from its previous practice or provide adequate evidence to support its claim of a factual distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>i. Commerce\u2019s Claim of a Longstanding Policy of Choosing the Largest Available Third Country Market as the Comparison Market is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-4\">Defendant also claims that in this determination \u201cCommerce . . . followed its longstanding policy of giving more weight to market size, where product differences are easily adjusted, to conclude that German and U.S. market flanges were substantially similar and that the substantially larger size of the market in Germany made it the best available comparison market.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 13-14; See also Decision Memoranda at 29-30; Pub. App. 2 at 38-39. During oral argument, Defendant was unable to provide any evidence to support its claim of a longstanding policy or practice. Plaintiff contends that Commerce\u2019s claim of a longstanding practice is unsupported and its decision was an impermissible, unexplained departure from its prior precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">Commerce may base its normal value calculations on third-country prices pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)(ii). The appropriate third country comparison market is generally chosen based on: (1) a more similar foreign like product to the subject merchandise exported to the United States than other third countries; (2) the volume of sales is larger than the volume of sales to other third countries; and (3) other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e). Defendant argues that Commerce followed the same practices that it did in prior reviews and that \u201cweighing all of the 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e) factors, Commerce determined that Germany was the most comparable third-country market.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-6\">The comments to the 1997 regulations in Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,358 (May 19, 1997), explain that \u201c\u00a7 351.404(e) is sufficiently clear that (1) not all of the three criteria need be present in order to justify the selection of a particular market, and (2) <em>no single criterion is dispositive.\u201d </em>Anti-dumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,358 (emphasis added). Therefore, pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e), Commerce is not required to choose the appropriate comparison market <em>solely </em>because the goods are identical, any more than it is required to choose the appropriate comparison market <em>solely </em>because the market is the largest available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim, without evidence, that it is following a longstanding policy, is problematic for the Court because Plaintiff has provided evidence that Commerce used sales of merchandise to a third country market that was not the largest available in a prior review. See Akai Decision, 61 Fed. Reg. 51,263. Hence, Commerce\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>conclusory statement that it is following a longstanding policy without providing adequate evidence that such a practice exists, as well as its failure to conform itself to its prior review, renders its decision unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-4\">On remand, Commerce must conform itself to its prior precedent, adequately explain the basis for its departure from its prior precedent, or provide substantial evidence of its longstanding practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">ii. Plaintiffs Claim that Commerce was Required to Choose Canada as the Appropriate Third Country Comparison Market is Unavailing</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">Plaintiff argues that Commerce should have determined that Canada was the appropriate third country comparison market, because the merchandise it sold in Canada was made to the same ASTM standards as the merchandise sold in the United States. Plaintiffs sales to Canada meet the statutory requirements for third country comparison markets. First, Plaintiffs exports to Canada had 12 times the required 5 percent threshold, with 60 percent of U.S. Sales. Second, the exports to Canada were made to the same standard as the exports to the United States, thus, meeting the criteria of \u00a7 351.404(e)(1). Finally, while both Australia and Canada flanges are made to ASTM standards, Plaintiffs exports to Canada exceed those to Australia; thus, Canada meets the requirements of \u00a7 351.404(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">Had Commerce initially determined that Canada was the appropriate market, it could have easily conformed its determination to prior reviews and compared identical merchandise. However, Commerce chose to use Germany, and \u00a7 351.404(e) states that the factors should <em>generally </em>be used to determine which market is the appropriate third country market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">Defendant accurately points out the court must defer to Commerce\u2019s choice of market when Commerce has assessed and weighed \u201cmarket size and strength, product and market similarity, and other factors it deems relevant.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 13. Defendant\u2019s reason for choosing Germany was that \u201cCommerce weighed both of the enumerated factors and followed its longstanding policy of giving more weight to market size.\u201d IcL Because of the prior precedent, and Defendant\u2019s failure to provide evidence of the longstanding policy, the court is unable to uphold Commerce\u2019s determination that Germany was the appropriate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-9\">However, Plaintiffs conclusion that Commerce\u2019s failure to provide adequate evidence requires that Commerce chose Canada as the third country comparison market is inaccurate. The evidence before the Court is that three markets meet the third country market viability requirements and that Germany was the largest, followed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>Canada, and finally, Australia. Commerce has not provided evidence, pursuant to \u00a7 351.404(e)(1), that certain \u201cforeign like products\u201d are more similar than others, as explained below. Nor has Commerce provided the Court with evidence of any other criteria it may have used in determining the appropriate market. Thus, Plaintiffs assumption that Canada was the only appropriate third country comparison market, although compelling, is premature. Therefore, the Court rejects Plaintiffs claim that the only appropriate comparison market is Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">C. Commerce\u2019s Claim that ASTM Forgings and DIN Proof Machined and Fully Machined Flanges are Comparable is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-5\">Plaintiff argues that the rough forgings sold in the United States should not be compared to proof-machined or fully machined flanges sold in Germany. Commerce claimed that ASTM forgings and DIN flanges could be compared by adjusting for the matching criteria. See Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,129. Defendant stated that \u201cbecause United States and German market flanges are manufactured to different standards, Commerce applied 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16) (B) to match the appropriate foreign like products to corresponding U.S. market flanges.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 17; Decision Memoranda at 26-28; Pub. App. 2 at 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-6\">Commerce\u2019s methodology for making the German DIN standard proof or fully machined flanges comparable to the ASTM standard United States rough forgings consisted of converting all flanges and forgings from a cost-per-piece basis, which is how Plaintiff sold the merchandise, to a cost-per-kilogram basis. Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,129. In its cost of production analysis, Commerce determined that it would define comparable models based on matching criteria, of (1) grade, (2) type, (3) size, (4) pressure rating, and (5) finish. Id. Finally, Commerce applied the standard 20 percent difference in merchandise (\u201cDIFMER\u201d) deviation gap to exclude products that had a greater than 20 percent difference in cost of production per kilogram from the dumping margin calculations. Id.; Decision Memoranda at 24-26; Pub. App. 2 at 33-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-7\">Commerce agreed with petitioners that flanges, \u201cwhether produced to DIN standards or ASTM standards, will still look the same, serve the same function and be of comparable size and weight [, and] [w]hile conceding that flanges produced to DIN standards could be slightly different from the merchandise sold in the United States, the actual differences.... are very <em>likely </em>minor or nonexistent.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>Decision Memoranda at 29; Pub. App. 2 at 38; Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 7 (emphasis added). During oral argument Defendant admitted that the petitioners had not provided evidence for their assertion that any differences between German flanges and United States flanges were in fact \u201clikely\u201d insignificant or minor. See Decision Memoranda at 29; Pub. App. 2 at 38 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-4\">Commerce must determine the appropriate \u201cforeign like product,\u201d in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(B), and must \u201cmake a fair comparison between the United States price charged for the subject merchandise . . . and the price charged for the corresponding \u201cforeign like product.\u201d Pesquera, 266 F.3d at 1375. While it is certainly simpler for Commerce to identify and compare identical merchandise when it exists; lacking identical goods for comparison Commerce must find similar merchandise in order to make a proper comparison with the United States imports. See NTN Bearing Corp. of Am. v. United States, 127 F.3d 1061, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The Tariff Act of 1930, broadly defines \u201csuch or similar,\u201d and the methodology that Commerce may use to match U.S. products with third country products.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, 66 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Because the Act does not specify a model match method, the Act implicitly authorizes Commerce to choose a method by which to identify such or similar merchandise. Id. However, when Commerce has chosen a methodology that is patently unreasonable, unsupported by the evidence, or contrary to the antidumping laws, Commerce\u2019s determination may not be sustained by this Court. See NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, 14 CIT 623, 633, 747 F. Supp 726, 736 (CIT 1990); see also Zenith Elecs. Corp, v. United States, 77 F.3d 426, 430 (Fed. Cir. 1996); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">Commerce apparently used the second criteria of \u00a7 351.404(e), the larger market size of Germany, in order to deem the DIN flanges and ASTM forgings substantially similar foreign like products. Commerce\u2019s determination begs the question of whether the merchandise is similar by propagating a conditional fallacy that the antecedent, Germany as the appropriate market because it is the largest market available, affirms the consequent, German DIN flanges and ASTM forgings are similar and comparable merchandise. This argument errs because there is no record evidence that Commerce independently determined that the foreign like product that Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>used, German DIN flanges, were in fact either fundamentally identical or similar to the United States ASTM forgings for the purposes of the 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16) hierarchy; nor has Defendant provided evidence of a longstanding policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">In response to Commerce\u2019s supplemental questions, Plaintiff indicated that rough forgings were sold in United States while only proof or fully-machined flanges were sold to Germany.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff requested that proof and fully-machined flanges made to DIN standards be compared to proof and fully-machined flanges made to ASTM standards for the United States. Plaintiff asserted that \u201c[a] customer who has ordered an [ASTM] 304L flange will not accept a [DIN] 1.4541 flange as a substitute,\u201d and that DIN flanges weighed significantly less than the rough forgings sold to the U.S. and yet were higher in both cost and value. Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 8 at 41. Plaintiff claimed that the ASTM forgings that Commerce compared to DIN flanges were not functional without significant further processing and that \u201ccomparing a rough forging to a flange is like comparing a cloth and a garment made from cloth \u2014 the two cannot be compared.\u201d Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 10 at 64. Additionally, Plaintiff stated that DIN standard flanges and ASTM standard forgings are sold to different end users.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">The lack of interchangeability between products will not defeat a finding of \u201csimilar merchandise.\u201d See Sony Corp. of America v. United States, 13 C.I.T. 353, 359, 712 F. Supp. 978, 983 (1989). Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(B)(ii), Commerce must find that the third country comparison product is \u201clike\u201d the subject merchandise in the purpose for which it is used. Koyo Seiko Co., 66 F.3d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">In this review, Commerce assumed that the merchandise was comparable because of market size without adequately elucidating any comparable qualities of ASTM forgings and DIN flanges or supporting its choice with substantial evidence. Conversely, Plaintiff pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>vided record evidence that suggests that the ASTM forgings and DIN flanges that Commerce compared were not similar.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues and the record shows that first, the materials used in producing the flanges and forgings are of different composition. The type of liquid that is going to pass through the flange generally dictates the grade of steel used. See Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 7 at 36. German DIN flanges use steel with a higher level of nickel and titanium, and it is the addition of nickel which improves the quality of the steel. The European flanges Plaintiff sells are used in \u201chighly corrosive areas where better corrosion capacity of steel is always preferred.\u201d Plaintiffs Reply at 17; Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 6 at 32. Accordingly, Plaintiff states that these general chemical differences between Ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>man DIN standard merchandise and United States ASTM merchandise exist and are critical to the buyer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">Second, Plaintiff provided evidence that the DIN and ASTM flanges\u2019 physical structure differs, and that flanges must meet different standards and specifications. \u201cStandards are determined by the type of liquid which will pass through a system (e.g., acid, water), the pressure, and the flow-rate of the liquid.\u201d Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 7 at 36. A DIN flange that is put to the same application as an ASTM flange has a different outside diameter and a DIN standard flange is thinner than its ASTM counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, given Commerce\u2019s use of cost-per-kilogram price comparisons, the record evidence regarding the differences between DIN and ASTM flanges, reveals that DIN standard flanges weigh less than the supposedly similar ASTM forgings. The record indicates that extensive machining may be required to convert a rough forging into a finished flange made to the German DIN standard. This machining may resuit in a 30% average weight loss from forging to finished flange.

Substantial evidence \u201cmust be enough reasonably to support \u00e1 conclusion.\u201d Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, 10 C.I.T. 399, 405, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986). It is not necessary for Commerce to compare merchandise that is \u201ctechnically substitutable, purchased by the same type of customers, or applied to the same end use as the U.S. model,\u201d Koyo Seiko Co., 66 F.3d at 1210, and thus, a comparison of DIN flanges and ASTM forgings might be permissible should Commerce determine and provide substantial evidence that the products are \u201clike\u201d merchandise in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16). However, the court \u201ccannot defer to a decision which is based on inadequate analysis or reasoning.\u201d USX Corp. v. United States, 11 CIT 82, 88, 655 F. Supp. 487, 492 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>While Plaintiffs evidence and reasoning in and of itself does not indicate that Commerce could not compare ASTM and DIN flanges and forgings, it does indicate that differences exist between forgings and flanges. Without adequate record evidence as to whether the differences are insignificant, the Court cannot uphold Commerce\u2019s determination that the differences are \u201clikely\u201d minor or insignificant and thus, the products \u201clike\u201d for the purposes of calculating normal value pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">D. Commerce\u2019s Comparison of ASTM Forgings and DIN Proof Machined and Fully Machined Flanges is a Departure from its Prior Determination and its Reasoning is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">As noted above, Commerce compared Viraj\u2019s U.S. sales with contemporaneous sales in Germany and considered stainless steel flanges identical based on the matching criteria. See Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,129. In the Akai Decision, Commerce chose Canada, which uses the same standards as the U.S., as the appropriate third country comparison market. Akai Decision, 61 Fed. Reg. at 51,263 \u2014 65. Plaintiff claims that in order to be consistent with previous determinations, Commerce should have used the Canadian market and compared ASTM flanges to other ASTM standard merchandise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Motion at 6-7; Plaintiffs Reply at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">In the Akai Decision, Commerce determined the most similar third-country model, based on the alloy grade, size, type, and the ASTM standard, and compared the merchandise to the U.S. model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>on a cost-per-piece basis; and then adjusted for product differences using DIFMER.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1506-4\">[T]he Department selected alloy grade, size, type, and the ASTM standard designation as the hierarchy of physical characteristics to use in determining the identical or most similar third-country model to compare to each U.S. model... in determining NV, the Department must base its valuation on the price of \u201csuch or similar merchandise\u201d sold in the home market (third country) (see 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(A)). . . . When several third-country models are equally similar in physical characteristics, we choose the third-country model which, when compared to the U.S. model, has the lowest difference in variable costs of manufacturing, provided the difmer does not exceed 20 percent of the total cost of manufacturing of the U.S. model. . . . The Department\u2019s adoption of the \u201c20 percent difmer\u201d test, pursuant to 19 CFR \u00a7 353.57(b)(1992), ensures the selection of the home market (third-country) model with the greatest commercial similarity to the U.S. model. Therefore, when the four physical criteria of alloy, type, size, and ASTM standard designation were equally similar, we matched the U.S. model to the third-country model having the least difference in variable costs between it and the U.S. model, provided the cost difference was no greater than 20 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">Akai Decision, 61 FR at 51,264-65 (citations omitted); See also Certain Forged Stainless Steel Flanges From India, 61 Fed. Reg. 14,073.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">In this review, Commerce converted all of the merchandise to cost-per-kilogram, determined that differences in the goods were likely minor, and compared Plaintiffs U.S. sales with contemporaneous sales of the foreign like product in Germany by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>consider[ing] stainless steel flanges identical based on the following five criteria: grade, type, size, pressure rating, and finish. . . us[ing] a 20 percent difference-in-merchandise (diftner) cost deviation cap as the maximum difference in cost allowable for similar merchandise, which we calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the U.S. and comparison market variable costs of manufacturing divided by the total cost of manufacturing of the U.S. product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">Preliminary Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 14,129. Commerce has broad discretion to devise model-match methodologies to determine what constitutes similar merchandise. See, e.g. Torrington Co. v. United States, 881 F. Supp. 622, 635 (CIT 1995). However, the product\u2019s standard was apparently not used as one of the criteria because Commerce agreed with petitioners that the actual differences between ASTM and DIN standard merchandise were \u201cvery likely minor or non-existent.\u201d Decision Memoranda at 29-30; Pub. App. 2 at 38-39. Commerce\u2019s previous model-match methodology compared ASTM standard merchandise and then used DIFMER to adjust for differences on a cost-per-piece basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">Defendant\u2019s insistence during oral argument that by selecting the largest comparison market, merchandise might be rendered comparable, is a significant departure from its prior method for determining comparable merchandise. While Commerce has the flexibility to change its methodology, its change must be reasonable. See Cultivos Miramonte S.A., 980 F.Supp. at 1274. Volume of sales to a particular third country market compared to sales with other third countries is certainly a factor that Commerce may consider, pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404(e), in determining the appropriate third country comparison market and merchandise. However, Commerce\u2019s premise, that forgings and flanges \u201clikely\u201d had minor differences, and, thus, DIN and ASTM merchandise were sufficiently comparable, is neither supported by substantial evidence nor born out by the administrative record, prior administrative reviews, or illustrative case law. Commerce\u2019s insufficient assertion, that differences between ASTM forgings and DIN flanges are \u201clikely\u201d minor and that use of the largest comparison renders merchandise comparable, ultimately results in its model match methodology and reasoning unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">Therefore, because Commerce changed its methodology and matching criteria from previous reviews, and no record evidence exists to support its claims that the goods are similar, the Court finds that Commerce has departed from its prior precedent without adequate explanation or support by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>E. Commerce\u2019s Calculation of the Antidumping Margin Based on Per Kilogram Prices is Not in Accordance with Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">Plaintiff alleges that in prior antidumping reviews Commerce has held that if merchandise is sold per piece, not by weight, the dumping margin must be calculated per piece in order to avoid distortion in the dumping margin. See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand, 57 Fed. Reg. 21,065, 21,069-70 (May 18, 1992) (\u201cCarbon Steel\u201d). Defendant claims that it has long been Commerce\u2019s policy to compare prices for similar steel products across markets by weight, and \u201cin all cases where the agency made per piece comparisons, the weights of the compared products were identical.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-6\">The Defendant mentions two instances in which per piece costs were used and questions Plaintiffs reliance on the first, Carbon Steel, in its brief because Carbon Steel was a \u201cdecade-old decision.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id. Defendant states that \u201cthe use of per-piece comparisons in earlier reviews comparing identical products does not tie the agency to such a methodology where weight governs the cost of production of different products.\u201d Decision Memoranda at 24; Pub. App. 2 at 33. Additionally, Commerce stated that \u201cViraj has not cited, nor can we find, any examples of cases in the past six years to substantiate the assertion that per-piece analysis was continued beyond the early and distinct instances.\u201d Analysis Memo, Comment 13. The calculation of the dumping margin in Commerce\u2019s previous review of Plaintiff, as well as in Plaintiffs New Shipper review, was accomplished on a per piece basis. See Plaintiffs Reply at 8; Plaintiffs Attachment 1; Non Pub. App., NPD 2 at 3. In prior reviews when the Plaintiffs comparison market and United States sales were similar rather than identical, due to physical differences, including weight, the DIFMER adjustment was made on the dumping margin calculation to account for differences. See Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-7\">The court is concerned with Commerce\u2019s easy dismissal of past precedents. Precedent, unless inapplicable or properly invalidated, binds this court and Commerce. The court agrees with Commerce to the extent that an agency is not forever tied to a methodology. However, if an agency departs from its prior precedent without adequate explanation, its actions are unlawful. MM&amp;P Advancement Training, Education Safety Program v. DOC, 729 F.2d 748, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Final Results in Carbon Steel state that Commerce \u201cconverted all prices and adjustments from a weight basis to a unit (per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>piece) basis <em>because </em>merchandise is sold by piece instead of weight.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Carbon Steel, 57 Fed. Reg. at 21,065 (emphasis added). Among the explanations in Defendant\u2019s brief, what remains clear is that Defendant\u2019s arguments sublimate the results of the Carbon Steel determination into a different form. Commerce argues that the Carbon Steel comparisons were de facto per-kilogram comparisons because the products were identical; and therefore, the Carbon Steel determination is distinguishable. Defendant\u2019s explanation for its departure, which it claims is not actually a departure at all, is that \u201cin Carbon Steel, whenever Commerce <em>seemingly </em>made comparisons of merchandise on a per-piece basis, the comparisons were of identical merchandise.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 21. (Emphasis added). If the comparison by weight or by piece was truly unimportant in cases of identical merchandise, this Court is left to speculate on why Commerce would bother converting from cost-per-weight to cost-per-piece in Carbon Steel because, according to Defendant, it should not matter how the merchandise was compared if it was identical. Yet in Carbon Steel, Commerce specifically explained that it was going to convert from per weight to per piece \u201cbecause\u201d that was the way the merchandise was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-4\">Because Defendant has not submitted any evidence to the contrary, the court bases its decision on Commerce\u2019s prior determinations and the reasoning stated in the Carbon Steel review, that Commerce converted all prices and adjustments from a weight basis to a per piece basis <em>because </em>the merchandise was sold by piece instead of weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-5\">Therefore, Commerce must either conform itself to its prior precedent and compare Plaintiffs merchandise in the manner in which it is sold, or adequately explain its departure and support all of its factual arguments with substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>F. Commerce\u2019s Reasoning for Its Price Per Kilogram Methodology for Comparing Rough Forgings to Proof-Machined and Finished Flanges is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">Plaintiff claims that Commerce, by converting Viraj\u2019s reported per piece prices and costs to per kilogram amounts, increased the dumping margin from 8.95 percent to 21.1 percent. Plaintiffs Motion at 3. Defendant argues that in cases where differences in the cost of production of similar products are almost entirely attributable to weight, Commerce has consistently harmonized the process by using weight as the common denominator rather than per piece price comparisons. Defendant claims that Commerce \u201ctook careful note of the commercial realities of the flange market\u201d and that the \u201craw material costs dominate the cost of production.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 22, 26. Therefore, Defendant stated that logically \u201cif a flange has a higher weight, and the cost of raw materials predominates, one expects a higher cost and a higher price . . . [and accordingly Commerce explained in the Final Results, as well as in earlier decisions, why weight is a better basis in this type of scenario.\u201d Id. at 22. Hence, \u201cCommerce agreed with the petitioners and determined that it would follow its standard methodology of comparing prices by weight,\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-5\">Plaintiff supplied Commerce and the Court with merchandise comparisons that show that Commerce\u2019s comparisons of forgings to flanges by cost-per-kilogram create significantly different results than those claimed by Commerce. See Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 10 at 70. The record indicates that, on average, a forging has a 30 percent weight loss when machined from its rough state into a finished state. Plaintiffs Reply at 4-5 &amp; n.4. Additionally, a finished flange can have up to a 50 percent higher price per piece than its heavier rough forging counterpart. See Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 10 at 64. The record also indicates that the cost-per-kilogram, for a proof machined flange, may be up to 167 percent more than the rough forging; and a fully finished flange may be up to 234 percent more than the rough forging. See Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 4 at 17-19. Thus, given the 30 percent weight loss, the value added from the machining process gives the lighter flange a higher cost of production on a per kilogram basis than the heavier rough forging.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-6\">If Defendant\u2019s claim were accurate, then logically, a heavier forging should cost more per-kilogram than the lighter flange. The record evidence indicates the opposite. See Non Pub. App., NPD 2 at 3. Commerce has broad discretion to determine similar merchandise, however, its methodology and reasoning must be supported by substantial record evidence. In this case, Plaintiff claims, and the record evidence suggests, that the value added from machining gives the lighter proof or fully machined flange a higher cost of production on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>a cost-per-kilogram basis, than the heavier rough forging, even though on a cost-per-piece basis the heavier forging costs more.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See Non Pub. App., NPD 2 at 3, 5, 47-50; Plaintiffs Reply, Attachment 4 at 16-19. Therefore, the record evidence indicates that the finish must be more determinative of cost than the weight of the piece.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\">Additionally, Defendant contends that Commerce has referred to the use of weight as \u201cour standard methodology\u201d since 1993 and cites to Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Determination Not to Revoke in Part: Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products and Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Canada, 66 Fed. Reg. 3543 (Jan. 26, 2001) (\u201cCorrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel\u201d) and accompanying Memorandum from Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary, to Troy H. Cribb, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Issues and Decision Memo for the Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and the Determination not to Revoke in Part of Certain Corrosion Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products and Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Canada \u2014 8/01/98 through 7/31/99 (Jan. 16, 2001 (\u201cCarbon Steel Memo\u201d). In Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel, the product under review was sold on a weight basis. Commerce stated that the use of weight \u201cprovided the Department with results which are both consistent and predictable in formulating the margin analysis.\u201d Carbon Steel Memo at Comment 1. However, Commerce also stated that it used weight comparisons because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1511-11\">a large number of steel products are most commonly priced using weight as the standard measurement. Because weight is so commonly used in this manner, many companies track costs based on a weight unit measure for determining selling expenses, inputs and other information. Thus, the Department is able to make comparisons between steel products on a consistent unit basis by using a weight based standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1511-12\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-13\">Plaintiff argues that, unlike the products in Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel, stainless steel flanges and forgings are not sold on a weight basis nor does Plaintiff track its costs on a weight basis. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>ing the review, Plaintiff argued to Commerce that in all past flange cases, Commerce calculated the dumping margin on a per piece basis, and that no adequate explanation had been given for why, for the first time, the dumping margin calculation was done on a per kilogram basis. Plaintiffs Attachment 10 at 58. Additionally, Plaintiff contended that the dumping analysis should be done on the \u201cbasis of prices as they actually exist in the market, not on artificially created prices that have no market or real world basis.\u201d See id. Plaintiff claims that no meritorious justification has been offered by Commerce as a rationale for departing from real world prices and using artificially created per kilogram prices and that by comparing the merchandise on a cost-per-kilogram basis, Commerce compared and treated as comparable flanges with greatly different per piece weights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">Commerce considers differences in physical characteristics of similar merchandise pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C)(ii)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.411 (1999).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In response to Plaintiffs arguments, Defendant states that Plaintiffs concerns regarding the comparison of dissimilar merchandise are addressed by including size among the comparison criteria, and using the DIFMER to remove those results that were greater than 20 percent. Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 25. The DIFMER adjustment to normal value is used to account for the differences in cost attributable to differences in physical characteristics between merchandise. Defendant claims that \u201cCommerce explained in the Final Results as well as in earlier decisions, why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>weight is a better basis in this type of scenario.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-4\">In past flange cases, Commerce calculated the dumping margin on a cost-per-piece basis. Commerce has previously determined that weight was a better basis for comparison in steel cases where the product was sold based on its weight. Plaintiffs products are not priced strictly according to weight but rather the amount of machining and finishing involved. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s decision in Corrosion-Resistant Steel Plate and its decision in Stainless Steel Flanges do not appear to be analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">Plaintiff claims that had its merchandise been compared on cost-per-piece basis, rather than Commerce\u2019s cost-per-kilogram basis, the comparisons Commerce made would not have passed the DIFMER margin. Hence, Plaintiff claims that the resulting differences, between DIFMER done on a per-piece-basis and DIFMER calculated on a cost-per-kilogram basis, are indicative of an improper comparison by Commerce. The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131, 141 (1966). As long as the agency\u2019s decisions are rational, the Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. American Silicon Techs. v. United States, 23 CIT 589, 591, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1326 (1999). Thus, the court does not find that Commerce may not make weight comparisons of flanges. However, the record evidence provided by Plaintiff indicates that Commerce made an erroneous assumption regarding the comparability of rough forgings and proof and fully machined flanges in this review. If Commerce decides to use weight on remand, it must ensure that it is in fact comparing the most similar products and that its methodology and reasoning comport with its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-6\">The record does not contain sufficient evidence of the comparability of ASTM standard forgings and DIN standard flanges. In addition, Commerce\u2019s explanation for its comparison of rough forgings and finished flanges on a cost-per-kilogram basis, based upon the Defendant\u2019s stated reasoning that a heavier forging that weighs more cost more than the same standard good in a fully finished state, is inaccurate. The evidence presented and verified by Commerce indicates that the cost of production is substantially different when comparing ASTM forgings to DIN flanges on a cost-per-kilogram and cost-per-piece basis. While inconsistent results are permitted, Commerce must base its determinations on substantial evidence. Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Commerce\u2019s new cost-per-kilogram methodology and comparison of rough forgings to finished flanges is distortive, and thus, unreasonable. While Commerce has discretion to determine and apply a methodology necessary to yield similar merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>comparisons under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16), when such patent inconsistencies appear in Commerce\u2019s determination, it may not be upheld. See Koyo, 66 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-3\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-4\">This court is vested with the power to order a remand to Commerce pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2643(c)(1) (1994).
