The petition alleged that these SSWR imports \u201care being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677], and that such imports are materially injuring an industry in the United States.\u201d <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 45,224 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Aug. 26, 1997).

Reg. 45,224 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Aug. 26,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1808-7\">During the preliminary injury investigation, Defendant-Intervenors Krupp Edelstahlprofile GmbH (\u201cKEP\u201d) and Krupp Hoesch Steel Products, Inc. (collectively, \u201cKrupp\u201d) argued that imports of SSWR from Germany were \u201cnegligible\u201d within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b(a)(l) and \u00a7 1677(24)(A)(i).

Krupp noted a discrepancy between the \u201cofficial\u201d import data and its own records with respect to German imports of SSWR when it noted a concentration of German imports under the tariff subheadings 7221.00.0045 HTSUS (stainless steel wire rod with cross-sections exceeding 19mm) and 7221.00.0075 (coiled stainless steel wire rod and bars of non-circular cross-sectional profiles) when it actually only shipped <em>[a relatively low number of] </em>tons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1793\">*1793</page-number>C.R. 27 at 32, C.R. 76 at 2-4. Specifically, it argued that statistics showing 1,024 tons \u2014 or 44% \u2014 of German imports were classified under subheadings 7221.00.0045 and 7221.00.0075 could not be correct since Krupp [ ] and the Commission estimated Krupp accounted for [a <em>very high </em>percentage] of all SSWR imports from Germany as of September 1997.

Specifically, official import statistics showed [a <em>major inconsistency compared to] </em>reported imports and exports in 1996. C.R. 173. Official statistics showed 1,655 short tons of SSWR imported from Germany, but questionnaire responses reported only <em>[a much smaller </em>quantity] exported to the United States. C.R. 43, <em>Preliminary Staff Report, </em>IV-4 (Table IV-2), VII-2 to -3 (Table VTI-1). When asked about the discrepancy, counsel for Krupp guessed that the problem could be misclassification of goods or mislabeled country of origin. C.R. 173. Counsel for Krupp requested that the Commission, in the event of a final investigation, \u201cdo an extensive analysis\u201d to trace \u201cexactly where the shipments were originating.\u201d C.R. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1809-6\">The Commission published notice of its preliminary affirmative determination that there was \u201ca reasonable indication that an industry in the United States [was being] materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Germany ... of stainless steel wire rod that [were allegedly being] sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).\u201d <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan, </em>62 Fed.

In its preliminary determination, the Commission relied on the unadjusted, official U.S. import statistics for imports for consumption to find that imports of SSWR from Germany accounted for more than three percent of total imports for consumption during twelve months prior to the petition for which information was available, that is Julyl996 through June 1997. P.R. 144, <em>Preliminary Commission Views </em>at 14. The Commission also noted Krupp\u2019s argument to the contrary. P.R. 144 at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1809-7\">Commerce also published notice of a preliminary affirmative determination that imports of SSWR from Germany were being sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1794\">*1794</page-number>for less than fair value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod From Germany, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 10,847 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Mar. 5, 1998) <em>(\u201cDOC Preliminary Determination\u201d). </em>Commerce later issued a final determination that imports of SSWR from Germany were being sold at less than fair value, stating it would impose final antidumping duties on the imports if the Commission found material injury, or threat of material injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod From Germany, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 40,433 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 29,1998) <em>(\u201cDOC Final Determination\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1810-4\">On February 26, 1998, Krupp again raised the issue of the apparent discrepancies in the official import statistics with the Commission. C.R. 270. Krupp noted the possibility that [ ] non-German material may have been included in the statistics. C.R. 270. Two weeks later, counsel for Krupp spoke with the Commission noting its concern that \u201cthere is a misclassification in the official statistics\u201d because <em>\u201c[of a significant discrepancy in official statistics on imports of stainless steel wire rod from Germany compared to] </em>the exports from Germany to the United States reported by the [ ] major producers/ exporters in Germany.\u201d C.R. 270. The Commission then began the final phase of its injury investigation on March 23, 1998. <em>See Stainless Steel Wire Rod From Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 13,872 (Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n Mar. 23, 1998) (scheduling of final phase of countervailing duty and antidumping investigations).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1810-5\">Ultimately, the Commission Staff reported two major discrepancies between official import statistics and questionnaire responses that resulted in the Commission Staff adjusting the official statistics. P.R. 481/C.R.81 <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan, </em>Report to the Commission on Investigations Nos. 70-9A-373 (Final) and 731-9A-769 through 775 (Final) (\u201cFinal Staff Report\u201d), F-18 to -19, (Table F-8) nn.1-4. The first significant discrepancy was a difference in import volumes of <em>[Company A]; [Company A] </em>imports were misclassified, so the Commission Staff excluded the misclassified imports. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1795\">*1795</page-number><em>[Company </em>A] reported [ ] imports of SSWR during July 1996 through June 1997 on its certified questionnaire response. C.R. 102. But official import statistics showed <em>[Company A] </em>as having imported a significant tonnage of SSWR during that period. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at F-18 to -19, Table F-8 <em>&amp; </em>n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1811-4\">Commission Staff contacted the U.S. Customs Service<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to obtain import data, sorted by importer, C.R. 274, and contact information for manufacturers for which Commission Staff could only identify a manufacturer code. C.R. 275. Customs identified <em>[a particular German </em>manufacturer]. C.R. 276. Commission Staff reviewed the import data sent by Customs and noted that <em>[a substantial proportion of) </em>imports classified under one subheading under investigation were imported by <em>[Company </em>A], C.R. 545. Further, Commission Staff noted that imports from <em>[the German manufacturer identified by </em>Customs] tracked \u201calmost exactly with publically official statistics.\u201d C.R. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b1811-5\">Commission Staff called [a <em>representative of Company A) </em>to ask for an explanation of the large discrepancy between <em>[Company </em>Ah] report of [ ] imports from Germany and the import volume recorded in official import statistics.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> C.R. 426. The response was \u201cthat <em>[Company </em>Ah] \u2018major product by far\u2019 in the past several years has been [a <em>particular type of steel </em>product]; <em>[Company A] </em>imports <em>[that type of </em>product], not <em>[steel of the type subject to the </em>investigation].\u201d C.R. 426. Commission Staff probed, asking if <em>[the steel product imported by Company </em>A] may fall under the scope definition in these investigations, and <em>[the representative of Company </em>A] said no. Commission Staff called a second time to ask about the physical characteristics of the good imported by <em>[Company </em>A], but <em>[Company </em>Ah] description did not conform with that of the merchandise subject to the investigation. C.R. 426. <em>[Company </em>A] did admit to importing SSWR in previous years; and, when told that at least some of its nonconforming imports were classified as SSWR, <em>[the representative of Company </em>A] stated <em>\u201c[he would make inquiries to determine whether there had been a misclassification].\u201d </em>C.R. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b1811-6\">The Commission Staff followed up with <em>[Company </em>A], asking for written confirmation of the statements made in telephone conversations that the imports classified in official statistics as SSWR attributable to <em>[Company </em>A] were actually misclassified and not subject to the investigation. C.R. 545. <em>[Company </em>A] complied with the request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1796\">*1796</page-number>by sending written confirmation that <em>\u201c[all its imports from Germany were of a steel product other than the subject </em>merchandise].\u201d C.R. 550. Commission Staff then contacted <em>[the German manufacturer that Customs had </em>identified] by fax to inquire into <em>[the manufacturer\u2019s] </em>production facilities and production of SSWR. C.R. 558. Bol-linghaus replied by fax, explaining <em>[the limitations of its facilities] </em>and certifying its [ ] answer to the questionnaire inquiry, \u201cHas your firm produced stainless steel wire rod since January 1, 1995?\u201d C.R. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b1812-4\">The second discrepancy was a difference in import volumes due to allegedly mislabeled countries of origin by importer, <em>[Company B]. </em>The resulting adjustment was the exclusion of <em>[a substantial percentage] </em>of the imports originally labeled as German. <em>See </em>C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report, </em>F-18 to -19 (Table F-8) n.4. The Commission Staff was first alerted to the possibility that the official statistics may be unreliable regarding <em>[Company </em>Ns] imports when it contacted and received confirmation from <em>[Company B] </em>that [a <em>particular German supplier], </em>from which <em>[Company B] </em>imported all its SSWR, was the company listed as the manufacturer of the SSWR shipped to <em>[Company B] </em>but was not a producer of SSWR. C.R. 274; C.R. 81 <em>Final Staff Report </em>F-18 (Table F-8) n.1; C.R. 280, Letter from [ ]. <em>[The president of Company B] </em>explained to the Commission Staff that <em>[Company B\u2019s supplier] </em>purchased SSWR from European sources, tested the SSWR, then shipped it to <em>[Company </em>B], C.R. 274. Accordingly, Commission Staff \u201casked <em>[the president of Company B] </em>to identify his imports by individual producers\u201d on the Importer\u2019s Questionnaire he was to file with the Commission. C.R. 274. Official import statistics showed that all <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] SSWR imported from [its <em>supplier] </em>was designated as originating in Germany. <em>Final Staff Report, </em>C.R. 81, F-19 (Table F-8) n.4. <em>[The president of Company </em>B] memorialized the conversation by way of letter to Commission Staff reiterating that <em>[Company B\u2019s supplier] </em>did not produce SSWR, purchasing SSWR from European sources instead, and shipping the purchased SSWR to <em>[Company </em>B], C.R. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1812-6\"><em>[Company B] </em>indicated <em>[that a certain percentage of its imports were of German origin, with the remainder from a second </em>country]\u2014 without any tonnage breakout \u2014 by handwritten marking next to country selections and in response to the share-of-imports question on its Importer\u2019s Questionnaire. C.R. 396. After receiving the questionnaire, Commission Staff called <em>[Company B\u2019s president] </em>and wrote a letter requesting \u201ca better breakout of <em>[the two countries of origin],\u201d </em>and suggesting, \u201c(I believe you said that maybe the grades or the \u2018heat\u2019 classification might help you?)\u201d C.R. 492V. <em>[Company B\u2019s president] </em>responded to the further inquiry on behalf of <em>[Company B] </em>by sending a letter with a print out of <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] vessel list containing SSWR import data from July 1996 through June 1997. C.R. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b1813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1797\">*1797</page-number>The vessel list included handwritten notations in the country-of-origin column stating <em>[the origin of material </em>\u2014 either <em>Germany or the second country], </em>C.R. 496. The word \u201cGermany\u201d appears <em>[a number of] </em>times; and each time lines extend from the word to material-weight figures in the weight column, indicating which material volumes are associated with the country label. C.R. 496. One group of material volumes in the weight column corresponding to <em>[the second country] </em>is similarly marked. C.R. 496. But most groups of volumes from the weight column have an arrow pointing from material volume subtotals appearing in the weight column to <em>[the name of the second country] </em>in the country-of-origin column. C.R. 496. Further, each material volume has a corresponding \u201cheat code\u201d in a column labeled \u201cHeat #,\u201d to the right of the country-of-origin column. C.R. 496. Every material volume marked <em>[with the name of the second country] </em>has a corresponding <em>[heat number of a particular type], </em>and every material volume marked \u201cGermany\u201d has a corresponding <em>[heat number of a different type], </em>C.R. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b1813-4\">Commission Staff noted that, while the certified questionnaire \u201cestimated a <em>[particular] </em>split in imports between Germany and <em>[the second country] </em>... in subsequent information [that <em>[the president of Company </em>B]] submitted it appears that [a <em>substantial percentage] </em>of his imports were from <em>[the second country].\u201d </em>C.R. 597. <em>[Thepresident of Company B] </em>confirmed the approximate <em>[ratio of material of German origin to that of second country origin], </em>C.R. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1813-5\">Commission Staff then prepared a worksheet comparing the import and country-of-origin information provided by <em>[Company B] </em>with official import statistics. C.R. 603. Commission staff noted, \u201cthere are a number of instances where the date appearing in the Customs Net Import File (CNIF) differs from the date appearing in the vessel list supplied by <em>[Company </em>B]; however, even with this inconvenience, the correlation between the data is obvious.\u201d C.R. 603. In the worksheet, Commission Staff labeled [a <em>number of] </em>groups of import volumes as \u201cunknown\u201d country of origin. C.R. 603. The marked-up copies of the vessel lists \u2014 used by Commission Staff to prepare the comparison chart \u2014 show that the \u201cunknown\u201d volumes of material were volumes at the beginning of groups of volumes in the weight column before a subtotal of material volume by weight, but were volumes not included in the subtotal. C.R. 603. Further, in each case of an \u201cunknown\u201d volume, the \u201cunknown\u201d group was sandwiched between volumes <em>[identified as being of second country] </em>origin, and had no intervening subtotal which would create an obvious break in the numbers in the column of import volumes by weight.\u201d C.R. 603.Moreover, each \u201cunknown\u201d volume has a corresponding <em>[heat code of the particular type associated with origin in the second country], </em>C.R. 603. The Staff Report explains that \u201c[ ].\u201d C.R. 81 <em>Final Staff Report, </em>F-19, (Table F-8) n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1798\">*1798</page-number>Approximately [ ] percent of <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] imports on the vessel list were not marked with any country of origin. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report, </em>F-19, (Table F-8) n.4. The percentage break down of <em>[Company B\u2019s] </em>imports with country-of-origin markings \u2014 according to <em>[the company president\u2019s] </em>handwritten notations \u2014 ]was [ ] percent <em>[second country origin] </em>and [ ] percent German. <em>Id. </em>The Commission Staff extrapolated the same <em>[country of origin ratio </em>derived] from the <em>[material of known </em>origin] to the [ ] percent of imports the Commission Staff labeled as having \u201cunknown\u201d origin. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>F-19 (Table F-8) n.2; C.R. 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b1814-6\">As a result of its investigation, the Commission Staff concluded that official imports from Germany were overstated, because: (1) \u201cthey include <em>[stainless steel wire rod of second country </em>origin] that was shipped to <em>[Company B] </em>by [\u00bfis <em>sole supplier, which does not manufacture SSWR]\u201d; </em>and (2) \u201cimports of <em>[a steel product other than stainless steel wire rod] </em>by <em>[Company A] </em>into <em>[a specific U.S. port] </em>from Germany, <em>[and two other countries] </em>are misclassified as stainless steel wire rod.\u201d RR. 481/C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at IV-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1814-7\">The Commission Staff then adjusted the \u201cofficial\u201d import statistics for the data covering the twelve-month period prior to the petition (the data used for the negligibility analysis) to account for these discrepancies by <em>[the two companies]. See </em>P.R. 481/C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at IV-4 (Table IV-1) (U.S. Imports, questionnaire data, period of investigation, by source), F-8 to 9 (Table F-3) (U.S. Official Imports for Consumption as adjusted by Commission staff, period of investigation, by source), F-10 to 11 (Table F-4) (U.S. Imports, questionnaire data, period of investigation, by firm); F-13 (Table F-5) (U.S. Imports, official data, imports for consumption adjusted for misclassification).</p>\n<p id=\"b1814-8\">The Final Staff Report included negligibility calculations based on imports-for-consumption and general-imports data, both unadjusted and adjusted for errors. <em>See generally </em>P.R. 481/C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at F-13 (Table F-5), F-18 to -19 (Table F-8). Specifically, using official imports-for-consumption statistics, <em>adjusted for inaccuracies </em>imports from Germany accounted for 2.76 percent of all SSWR imports during the 12-month period preceding the filing of the petition (July 1996 through June 1997).

The Statement of Administration Action (\u201cSAA\u201d) is to the same effect. SAA at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b1816-13\">he Commission\u2019s negligibility analysis is specifically guided by Section 771(24) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the URAA, which provides that imports are considered \u201cnegligible\u201d if such imports \u201caccount for less than 3 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States in the most recent 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1801\">*1801</page-number>month period for which data are available that precedes\u201d the filing of the petition. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(A)(i) (1994). In this case, the Commission determined that imports of SSWR from Germany were negligible during the relevant twelve month period preceding the filing of the petition \u2014 July 1996 through June 1997. <em>ITC Final Determination, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 49,610; <em>see also </em>P.R. 506, <em>Final Commission Views </em>at 20-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1817-4\">The plaintiff Domestic Industry here argues (a) that the Commission erred in relying on statistics concerning \u201cimports for consumption\u201d (rather than \u201cgeneral imports\u201d) in reaching its negligibility determination;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (b) that certain adjustments made to the official statistics are not supported by substantial evidence. Although the Commission based its determination on \u201cimports for consumption,\u201d it also analyzed the \u201cgeneral imports\u201d data \u2014 the data that Plaintiffs urged. Like its analysis based on statistics concerning imports for consumption, the Commission\u2019s analysis of statistics on general imports concluded that German imports were negligible. Accordingly, because \u2014 as detailed below \u2014 the adjustments are supported by substantial evidence in the record and are otherwise in accordance with law, there is no need to reach Plaintiffs\u2019 other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1817-5\">A. <em>[Company A] </em>Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b1817-6\">As discussed in section I above, the Commission adjusted the official statistics to reflect information supplied by <em>[Company A] </em>in the course of the investigation indicating that imports from Germany, <em>[and two other </em>countries] \u2014 which had been declared to Customs to be SSWR \u2014 were, in fact, instead <em>\u201c[another steel product].\u201d </em>The Domestic Industry contends that \u2014 for two reasons \u2014 the Commission\u2019s adjustments to <em>[Company </em>A\u2019s] data are not supported by substantial evidence on the record, and are otherwise contrary to law. <em>See generally </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 3, 9, 21-23; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 27-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1817-7\">First, the Domestic Industry seeks to depict <em>[Company A] </em>as untrustworthy, and to cast doubt on the \u201caccuracy, reliability, and probative value\u201dof the information it provided \u2014 emphasizing that, at the time it made its disclosure, the company knew that a negligibility determination would result in no liability for antidumping duties; suggesting that the company may have intentionally misclassified its merchandise to obtain the lower customs duty rate applicable to SSWR; and questioning whether the company ever reported the misclassification to Customs. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 21-22; Plaintiffs\u2019 Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1802\">*1802</page-number>ply Brief at 27-30. The Domestic Industry asserts that, at a minimum, <em>[Company A] </em>is guilty of misrepresentation to at least one of the two federal agencies and that, under the circumstances, the Commission erred in \u201csimply takfing] the importer\u2019s word for what it said had occurred regarding its imports.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1818-4\">As an initial matter, it is worth noting \u2014 in the context of the Domestic Industry\u2019s challenges to the reliability of information provided by <em>[Company </em>A] \u2014 that the credibility of sources is largely a matter within the province of the Commission, as the trier of fact. <em>See generally </em>Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at <em>58-59.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1818-5\">But, contrary to the Domestic Industry\u2019s claims, the Commission did not blindly accept <em>[Company </em>As] statements at face value. As section I above explains, discrepancies in the official import data first came to the Commission\u2019s attention in the preliminary phase of the investigation, when counsel to the German producers noted in post-conference briefing that the official data showed an inexplicable concentration of German imports in one particular HTSUS subheading, covering material with circular cross-sections exceeding 19 mm. Those data could not be reconciled with the fact that KEP \u2014 which accounted for <em>[a very high </em>percentage] of total German imports \u2014 had shipped a [ ] quantity of the material in the relevant twelvemonth period. C.R. 43, <em>Preliminary Staff Report </em>at VII \u2014 3; C.R. 27 at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1818-6\">After analyzing the foreign producer and importers\u2019 questionnaire data, the Commission staff expressed similar concerns about the vast \u201cdiscrepancy between official statistics on imports from Germany and the numbers reported by <em>[one company] </em>in the foreign producer questionnaire and <em>[another company], </em>in the importer\u2019s questionnaire.\u201d C.R. 173. The staff investigator further noted that \u201cthe numbers in the official statistics are <em>[significantly higher in calendar year 1996 than] </em>the reported import and export numbers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Preliminary Staff Report showed that \u2014 according to the official statistics \u2014 1996 imports of SSWR from Germany totaled 1,655 short tons, while foreign producer questionnaire data reflected total shipments to the United States of <em>[a significantly smaller] </em>quantity. <em>See </em>C.R. 43, <em>Preliminary Staff Report, </em>at IV-4 (Table IV-2) and VII-3 (Table VII-1). When asked about the discrepancy, counsel to the primary German producer suggested that the problem might lie with the large diameter material, and requested that \u2014 in the event of a final investigation \u2014 the Commission \u201cdo an extensive analysis\u201d to trace \u201cexactly where the shipments were originating.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1818-7\">The concerns about these discrepancies in the official import data continued unabated into the final phase of the Commission\u2019s investigation. In late February 1998, counsel for KEP spoke with the Commission investigator, seeking a meeting to discuss \u201cissues specific to the exports from Germany, for example some shipments classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1803\">*1803</page-number>German are not German (they may be transhipments).\u201d C.R. 270. Counsel spoke with the Commission staff again in mid-March 1998, emphasizing that <em>\u201c[there was a significant discrepancy in official statistics on imports of stainless steel wire rod from Germany compared to] </em>the exports from Germany to the United States reported by the [ ] major producers/exporters in Germany.\u201d Counsel indicated his belief that misclassification was involved, and asked that the Commission staff \u201clook into this matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1819-5\">The source of counsel\u2019s concern was manifest in the official import statistics, which indicated that a substantial volume of the imported, allegedly \u201cGerman\u201d material consisted of stainless steel coiled bars with diameters of 19 mm or more, and coiled stainless steel wire rod and bars of non-circular cross-sectional profiles. However, as Krupp noted in post-hearing briefing, the official data could not be correct, and could not accurately reflect imports of German material, because the evidence compiled in the final investigations indicated that KEP \u2014 which was by far the largest German producer and exporter of subject merchandise \u2014 [ ] non-circular product (subheading 7221.00.0075, HTSUS) or coiled bar (subheading 7221.00.0045, HTSUS) to the United States during the relevant period. C.R. 76 at 3. Similarly, the only other German producer of SSWR \u2014 [ ] \u2014 advised in its prehearing brief that it, too, had sold only [ ] in the United States. C.R. 53 at 3. Thus, the volumes of non-circular product reported in the official statistics could not be attributed to <em>[that producer].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1819-9\">Through its final investigation, the Commission staff sought to resolve the identified discrepancies. The information developed, confirmed, and corroborated by the Commission through correspondence with importers and foreign suppliers, as well as proprietary Customs sources, eventually enabled the Commission to reconcile the data, and resulted in the adjustments to the <em>[Company A] </em>data. The evidence supporting those adjustments includes: (1) the certified importers\u2019 questionnaire response which <em>[Company A] </em>submitted in the preliminary investigation, listing imports of SSWR from <em>[a country other than Germany] </em>only \u2014 [ ] (C.R. 102); (2) the certified foreign producers\u2019 questionnaire response, with cover letter, submitted by the German supplier/manufacturer [ ], confirming [iis <em>product line] </em>(C.R. 568; <em>see also </em>C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at IV-3 n.4); (3) proprietary Customs entry data showing that all material entered by <em>[Company A] </em>in the relevant period and listed as \u201cGerman\u201d was classified as [a <em>particular type of steel product, under a particular subheading of the HTSUS] </em>\u2014 the productcategory which was confirmed [ ] (C.R. 263); and (4) confirmation that the data provided by <em>[Company A], </em>the data listed in the CNIF import files, and the official import data, all matched and cross-checked. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at IV-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1804\">*1804</page-number>In short, contrary to the claims of the Domestic Industry, there is ample evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s adjustment to the official data, excluding the <em>[Company A] </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-4\">The Domestic Industry\u2019s arguments concerning <em>[Company </em>A\u2019s] obligations <em>vis-a-vis </em>Customs are similarly unavailing. As Krupp notes, there is no evidence on the record to substantiate any claim that <em>[Company </em>A] lied, either to Customs or to the Commission. It is entirely possible that any misclassification was entirely inadvertent. <em>See </em>Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-5\">Moreover, while it may be true that there is no record evidence that <em>[Company </em>A] reported its misclassification to Customs, it is equally true that there is no evidence that the company failed to make any necessary subsequent disclosures. Defendant\u2019s Brief at 30 n.38; Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 47. And, indeed, what evidence there is on the record cuts against the Domestic Industry\u2019s position: <em>[Company </em>A] did, in fact, advise the Commission staff that it would be contacting its customs broker to ascertain whether merchandise had been misclassified. C.R. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-6\">Further, there is no merit to the Domestic Industry\u2019s implication that any inconsistencies between the information that <em>[Company </em>A] reported to the Commission and that reported to Customs necessarily renders the information furnished to Customs the only information on which the Commission could reasonably rely. Customs\u2019 responsibility for classifying imports for the purpose of assessing duties does not detract from the Commission\u2019s independent obligation to compile the necessary information required for its analyses. Other agencies are not bound by Customs\u2019 classifications. <em>See, e.g., Royal Business Mach., Inc. v. United States, </em>1 CIT 80, 507 F. Supp. 1007, 1014 n.18 (1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>669 F.2d 692 (CCPA1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-7\">It is beyond cavil that the Commission is entitled to supplement information from official statistics with the information that it gathers during its own investigation, and \u2014 after weighing the evidence \u2014 to choose to rely upon one set of facts over the other. Indeed, the Commission routinely relies on information it gathers in the course of its investigations, even when that data conflicts with other official statistics on the record; and the Commission has been repeatedly upheld when it has done so. <em>See, e.g., Texas Crushed Stone Co. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 428, 822 F. Supp. 773, 781 (1993), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>35 F.3d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <em>see generally </em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at 27-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1820-9\">Here, the Commission obtained specific, detailed information about the merchandise at issue that was not previously available to Customs. The record before the Commission thus included different \u2014 or additional \u2014 information from that which Customs used in itsclassification. The Commission responsibly reviewed its own administrative record and, based on those facts and drawing on its expertise, reached an informed conclusion as to the appropriate adjustments to be made to the data used for its negligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1805\">*1805</page-number>The Domestic Industry\u2019s second challenge to the Commission\u2019s reliance on information provided by <em>[Company </em>A] rests on its complaint that the information was not submitted in the form of a certified questionnaire response. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 7, 21-22. While it is true that <em>[Company A] </em>did not return the importers\u2019 questionnaire in the final phase of the investigation, the company was responsive to the Commission\u2019s requests for information. C.R. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b1821-4\">More to the point, the information that <em>[Company A] </em>submitted in the final phase of the investigation confirmed and was consistent with information that it had previously submitted. The Domestic Industry thus conveniently ignores <em>[Company </em>A\u2019s] importers\u2019 questionnaire response submitted in the course of the Commission\u2019s preliminary investigation \u2014 which <em>was </em>certified, and which indicated that the company had imported SSWR only from [a <em>country other than Germany] </em>and that [ ] throughout the relevant period. C.R. 102; <em>see also </em>C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report </em>at IV-3 n.4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1821-6\">B. <em>[Company B </em>] Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b1821-7\">The Commission\u2019s adjustments to the official statistics were not confined to the data on <em>[Company A]. </em>The Commission also adjusted the official statistics to reflect information supplied in the investigation indicating that a portion of <em>[Company B\u2019s] </em>imports of SSWR that were declared to Customs as being of German origin were actually of <em>[another (i.e., second) country] </em>origin. Specifically, based on the handwritten notations on the <em>[Company B] </em>worksheet, the Commission determined the origin of [a <em>very high]% </em>of the <em>[Company B] </em>shipments at issue. The Commission further determined that \u2014 of that <em>[very high]% </em>\u2014 approximately [ ]% were actually of <em>[second country] </em>origin, while only approximately [ <em>]% </em>were of German origin. The Commission allocated the remaining [ <em>]% </em>of the material \u2014 the so-called \u201cunknown\u201d material \u2014 between <em>[the second country] </em>and Germany, based on the <em>[ratio derived from the material for which the countries of origin were known]. See generally </em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1806\">*1806</page-number>Just as it objected to the adjustments to the data on <em>[Company A], </em>so too the Domestic Industry contends that the Commission\u2019s adjustments to the <em>[Company </em>J3] data are not supported by substantial evidence on the record, and are otherwise contrary to law. <em>See generally </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 14-21; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 16-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1822-4\">The Domestic Industry first attacks the Commission\u2019s reliance on the worksheet. The Domestic Industry portrays the <em>[Company B] </em>data as a \u201cmoving target,\u201d emphasizing that Customs records indicated that all the <em>[Company B] </em>merchandise at issue was of German origin; that - in the course of the investigation \u2014 <em>[Company B] </em>initially advised the Commission that the merchandise was [ <em>]% </em>German and [ ]% <em>[from the second </em>country]; and that only after <em>[Company </em>B] was pressed to provide a more specific breakdown did it provide the worksheet with handwritten notations on country of origin, from which the Commission staff derived the <em>[ratio which the staff then used to allocate the \u201cunknown\u201d material between Germany and the second country]. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 16-19; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 16-23. All in all, the Domestic Industry seeks to impugn the credibility of <em>[Company B], </em>and to challenge the \u201caccuracy, reliability, and probative value\u201d of the information provided by the company on which the Commission\u2019s adjustments were based. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 14.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1822-5\">The Domestic Industry charges that <em>[Company </em>\u00a3&gt;\u2019s] worksheet reflects nothing more than the company\u2019s \u201cestimates,\u201d and that its figures lack any corroboration. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 15; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 18. However, <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] worksheet was no \u201cestimate\u201d; it was a shipment-by-shipment \u201creconstruction],\u201d annotated by the hand of the president of the company to indicate country of origin. C.R. 496. Nor is the record lacking in evidence to substantiate <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1822-6\">The Commission specifically confirmed that <em>[Company B\u2019s German supplier] </em>\u2014 listed as the manufacturer in the official statistics \u2014 simply does not manufacture SSWR. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report, </em>at F-18 (table f-8) n.1; C.R. 280; C.R. 274; C.R. 396 at 5; C.R. 592. In addition, German SSWR producers had separately informed the Commission that the official statistics on SSWR imports appeared to be inaccurate (overstating imports from Germany), and had requested that the Commission investigate the matter further. C.R. 270. Moreover, the total imports which <em>[Company B] </em>reported to the Commission were virtually identical to the totals listed for the company in the official statistics. C.R. 81, <em>Final Staff Report, </em>at F-18-19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1807\">*1807</page-number>(Table F-8) n.4 (and revisions at C.R. 89).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, there is substantial evidence in the record to support both <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] claims and the Commission\u2019s determination that adjustments to the official statistics were needed. Moreover, although the Domestic Industry characterizes as \u201carbitrary\u201d the eountry-of-origin breakdown set forth in <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] worksheet (Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 15), they point to no evidence and advance no arguments to support their skepticism, other than their general attacks on <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] credibility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1823-4\">As with <em>[Company A], </em>the Domestic Industry seeks to make much of the fact that there is no record evidence that <em>[Company </em>B] ever reported its misclassifications to Customs. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 17; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 17 n.17. However, as discussed in section II.A, there is also no evidence that <em>[Company </em>B] <em>failed </em>to make any necessary disclosures. <em>See also </em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at 36; Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 54. With the record in equipoise on this point, it provides no grounds to second-guess the Commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1823-5\">In a further effort to undermine <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] credibility, the Domestic Industry questions the motivation behind the company\u2019s statements, asserting that an interest in obtaining a lower [ ] dumping margin would have given <em>[Company </em>B] an incentive to lie. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 17-18. However, that concern is largely disposed of by Krupp\u2019s observation that, \u201c[b]y definition, the imports at issue <em>all </em>were made before the antidumping petitions were even filed and, therefore were never subject to an antidumping-related suspension of liquidation, let alone an assessment of anti-dumping duties. Consequently, the origin of the entries could not possibly have any impact on the potential liability for antidumping duties. Furthermore, because the importer at issue [ ], the importer would have been free to source future imports elsewhere in the event that substantial dumping margins were imposed.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1823-8\">Similarly, the Domestic Industry\u2019s assertion that <em>[Company </em>B] had an incentive to lie because it was \u201ckeenly aware\u201d that its responses could affect the outcome of the case for Germany is sheer speculation. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 18. Indeed, as Krupp points out, the only authority cited by the Domestic Industry to support its claim is a letter that is addressed not to <em>[Company </em>B], but to another, unaffiliated importer. Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1808\">*1808</page-number>_While the Domestic Industry objects generally to the <em>[specific </em>ratio] derived from <em>[Company B\u2019s] </em>worksheet, it takes particular exception to the Commission\u2019s extrapolation of that ratio to the [ <em>]% </em>of the material that the ITC Staff deemed to be of unknown origin. Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 18-21; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 23-25. The Domestic Industry complains that the Commission \u201cnot only rejected official statistics when the importer claimed to have conflicting information, it also rejected official statistics even when the importer had no information indicating a conflict.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 18. According to the Domestic Industry, where <em>\u201c[Company B] </em>did not even provide a <em>guess </em>as to the origin of particular material, the staff gave the company the best treatment possible for the missing data.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1824-4\">Indeed, the Domestic Industry claims that the only record evidence as to the country of origin of the <em>[so-called \u201cunknown\u201d material] </em>is the Customs declaration made at the time the materials were entered. According to the Domestic Industry, that \u201cunrebutted\u201d record evidence identifies the [ ] \u201cunknown\u201d material as German, and the Commission should have treated it as such. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 19; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 17 n.18, 23, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1824-5\">But, contrary to the Domestic Industry\u2019s claims, the Customs declarations do not stand \u201cunrebutted.\u201d In the course of the investigation, <em>[Company B] </em>\u2014 in effect \u2014 affirmatively superseded the Customs declaration with the submission of the <em>[Company B] </em>worksheet (and with the submission of its questionnaire responses before that). Based on the record before the Commission, it was entirely reasonable for the Commission to apply the <em>[ratio derived by the staff from the material of known origin] </em>to the [ ] \u201cunknown\u201d material. Applied to the same general data set from which the ratio was drawn, there was clearly \u201ca rational relationship between the data chosen and the matter to which they are to apply.\u201d <em>Manifattura Emmepi S.p.A. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 619, 624, 799 F. Supp. 110, 115 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1824-6\">In any event, the Domestic Industry\u2019s quarrel with the Commission\u2019s extrapolation of the <em>[ratio derived from the material of known </em>origin] to the \u201cunknown\u201d shipments is of no moment. Even if the Commission had treated <em>[all the \u201cunknown\u201d] </em>material as German in origin (as the Domestic Industry urged), it would have had no effect on the Commission\u2019s negligibility determination. Although the Domestic Industry repeatedly asserts that \u2014 with that assertedly \u201cslight modification\u201d \u2014 the German share of imports would have been 3% (and thus above the negligibility threshold), in fact the share would have been only [Zess <em>than 3]%. Compare </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 19-20 <em>with </em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at 35 <em>and </em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 57-58. In short, even if all of the <em>[\u201cunknown\u201d material] </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1809\">*1809</page-number>hadbeen assumed to be German, the negligibility determination would have been unchanged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1825-4\">Krupp takes it one step further, reasoning that application of the <em>[ratio derived from the material of known </em>origin] to the \u201cunknown\u201d [ ] material was not only reasonable, it was actually <em>conservative, </em>and ultimately prejudicial to <em>[Company B], See </em>Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 55-56. As Defendant-Intervenors note, the <em>[Company </em>B] worksheet provides, <em>inter alia, </em>the manufacturer\u2019s \u201cheat code\u201d for each material listed. Each volume of material specifically identified as German in origin has a <em>[particular type of\\ </em>heat code, while those identified as <em>[originating in the second </em>country] have [a <em>different type of\\ </em>heat code. Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 56; C.R. 603. As Defendant-Intervenors note, the Commission\u2019s worksheet shows that, in each and every case, the \u201cunknown\u201d material has <em>[the second type of\\ </em>heat codes \u2014 which are consistent with <em>[second </em>country] \u2014 rather than German \u2014 origin. Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 56-57; C.R. 496; C.R. 603. Obviously, if the \u201cunknown\u201d [ ]% of <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] material had been treated as being entirely of <em>[second country origin] </em>(rather than allocated pursuant to the <em>[ratio derived by the Commission from the material of known origin]), </em>the German share would have been even further below the negligibility threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1825-6\">Indeed, the Defendant-Intervenors further reason that, in fact, the <em>[Company </em>B] worksheet affirmatively identifies the country of origin of <em>all </em>the listed material, and that the Commission staff\u2019s identification of [ <em>]% </em>of the material as being of \u201cunknown\u201d origin is the product of a simple misreading of the document. A review of the <em>[Company </em>B] worksheet indicates that, as Defendant-Intervenors note, each designation of origin supplied by <em>[Company </em>B] is handwritten next to a subtotal (of weight) that corresponds to the preceding series of <em>[heat codes of one of two different </em>types] (which, in turn, as discussed above, apparently correspond to country of origin). As Defendant-Intervenors note, it appears that <em>[Company </em>B] \u201cwas attempting to provide the origin of <em>all </em>of the listed material\u201d by specifying the country of origin next to each subtotal. However, as the Commission staff later discovered, some of the subtotals did not include all of the material listed above. It was these few entries that the Commission staff treated as being of unknown origin. <em>See </em>Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1825-7\">The Domestic Industry takes strong exception to the Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 interpretation of the <em>[Company </em>B] worksheet, dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1810\">*1810</page-number>ing it as <em>post hoc </em>rationale unsupported by the record. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 17-18. But, contrary to the Domestic Industry\u2019s claims, there is explicit support in the record for the asserted relationship between heat codes and country of origin. In a conversation with a Commission staffer, the president of <em>[Company B] </em>indicated that a review of heat codes would enable him to provide a more specific country of origin breakdown for <em>[Company </em>B\u2019s] material. <em>See </em>C.R. 492V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1826-4\">It is, in any event, unnecessary under the circumstances to rely on the Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 interpretations of the <em>[Company B] </em>worksheet, because there is no need to consider whether the [ ] \u201cunknown\u201d material was actually of German origin. Both the Commission\u2019s adjustments to the official statistics on <em>[Company </em>5] and the Commission\u2019s negligibility determination as a whole are supported by substantial evidence in the record as it now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1826-6\">C. The Path of the Commission\u2019s Decisionmaking</p>\n<p id=\"b1826-7\">As a final challenge to the determination at issue, the Domestic Industry asserts that the Commission failed to articulate an explanation for its use of adjusted data. Specifically, the Domestic Industry contends that the negligibility determination lacks a rational basis, because it is assertedly \u201cnot clear from the Commission\u2019s determination that any commissioner was aware of the concerns raised by the domestic industry, and that the commissioners had an opportunity to consider these important issues in reaching their determination.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 30. <em>See generally </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 23; Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1826-8\">However, the Commission is presumed to have considered all evidence in the record in reaching its determinations \u201cabsent a showing to the contrary.\u201d <em>USEC Inc. v. United States, </em>34 Fed. Appx. 725, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 7845, at **14 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Here, the Domestic Industry proffers no evidence that the Commission failed to consider its views regarding the adjusted imports data. Indeed, the Domestic Industry expressly concedes that \u201cit is possible that [the Commissioners] did read some of the staff notes and footnotes to tables that mentioned [the concerns of the Domestic Industry]. . . .\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1826-9\">Moreover, the Domestic Industry\u2019s arguments in this action go to the <em>evidentiary basis </em>for the Commission\u2019s negligibility determination (i.e., its adjustments to the official statistics). While the Commission is required to address the facts and conclusions of law upon which its determination is based, it \u201cis not required to address every piece of evidence presented by the parties. ...\u201d <em>USEC Inc., </em>2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 7845, at **14; <em>cf. Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 290 (1974) (affirming the Commission\u2019s action where the court was able to \u201cdiscern in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1811\">*1811</page-number>Commission\u2019s opinion a rational basis for its treatment of the evidence. . . . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1827-4\">Applying these standards, the Commission\u2019s determination here clearly passes muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1827-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1827-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the Commission\u2019s negligibility determination in this matter is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the agency record is therefore denied, and the Commission\u2019s negligibility determination in <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod From Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan, </em>63 Fed.
