For the reasons outlined below, Fair Beam\u2019s USCIT R. 56.2 Motion for Judgment upon an Agency Record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">A. Procedural History.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">On May 23, 2001, the domestic industry filed petitions with the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) and the Commission which led to investigations by both concerning structural steel beams of certain specifications<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imported from China, Germany, Luxembourg, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and Taiwan (\u201csubject countries\u201d or \u201crespondents\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Preliminary results were issued by the Commission on July 16, 2001, and by Commerce, on December 28, 2001. In May 2002, Commerce issued its final determinations. <em>See </em>67 Fed. Reg. 35,479-35,490 &amp; 35,497. A hearing was held before the Commission on May 15, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notice of the Commission\u2019s final determination was published in the Federal Register on June 27, 2002. <em>See </em>67 Fed. Reg. 43,340. A panel of five Commissioners found no present material injury from subject imports. One Commissioner, however, dissented from the panel\u2019s negative determination with regard to threat of material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">B. The product and the U.S. market.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Structural steel beams are load-bearing support members in the construction of large steel structures, such as buildings, bridges, towers, pre-fabricated homes, ships, and equipment. Demand for structural beams fluctuates in tandem with construction activity which in turn tracks aggregate U.S. economic activity. <em>Certain Structural Steel Beams from China, Germany, Luxembourg, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and Taiwan, </em>Staff Report to the Commission on Invs. Nos. 731-TA-935-936 and 938-942 (Final) at 1-6 &amp; 11-10 (June 3, 2002) <em>(\u201cStaff Report\u201d) </em>in <em>Administrative Record, </em>List 2, Doc. No. 169. In the U.S. market, there are two types of purchasers of structural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>steel beams: distributors (or service centers) and end users (or fabricators).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at II \u2014 1. Imported product is mostly sold to distributors; end users, however, typically buy from domestic suppliers. Distributors keep inventories while end users do not. Domestic mills charge the same price to both distributors and end users. In the event an end user buys from a distributor, it accordingly pays a higher price. Purchasers rank domestic product superior in availability and delivery time<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to imported product, but inferior in price. <em>Id. </em>at 11-13. On the other hand, domestic and imported product are perceived to be comparable in product quality and consistency. Purchasers of structural steel beams report evaluating factors such as price, quality, and availability in determining whether to purchase domestic or imported beams and rank these factors in a descending order of importance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11 \u2014 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The short-term price elasticity of U.S. demand for structural steel beams is low reflecting lack of substitutes for steel beams in construction, especially after the design phase of construction is complete. <em>Id. </em>at II \u2014 9. In other words, once the quantity of beams requested is set, later price variation will have no or little effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">On the supply side, the price elasticity of domestic supply is lower than that of the subject countries\u2019 supply. <em>Staff Report </em>at 11-16 &amp; 17. That is, subject countries can respond to price changes in the U.S. market faster than domestic producers can in terms of increasing shipments to the U.S. market.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The price elasticity of supply is dependent on excess capacity, ability to shift production or alter capacity, inventories, and availability of alternate markets. The relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>greater flexibility of the subject countries is partially due to the existence of home markets and alternate export markets from which they are able to divert products to the U.S. market with relative ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The largest share of cost in the production of structural steel beams is that of steel scrap, the raw material from which beams are produced. <em>Id. </em>at V-I. Thus, the supply of beams is tied to the price of steel scrap.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It has also been determined that in offers domestic producers use price lists whereas sales of subject imports are on a transaction-by-transaction basis, price and quantity being determined by the then existing market conditions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Staff Report </em>at V-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">C. The ITC\u2019s findings in the <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC evaluated the prevailing market conditions during the period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d). <em>See Final Determination </em>at 17-21. Consulting Census Bureau statistics, the ITC determined that nonresidential construction activity in the United States, which is an indicator of U.S. demand for structural steel beams, increased from 1999 to 2000 and declined in 2001. Using its own questionnaires and official Commerce import statistics, the ITC further observed that apparent U.S. consumption of steel beams rose from 4.96 million short tons in 1999 to 6.23 million in 2000, and then declined to 4.81 million in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The ITC next noted that the domestic industry experienced supply difficulties during 1999 and the first half of 2000. The ITC based this finding on questionnaire responses of fortyfive purchasers, eighteen of which (sixteen of thirty-one distributors) represented that they either were put on \u201callocation\u201d during this time period by domestic producers or were otherwise unable to meet their requirements from domestic suppliers. The ITC further noted questionnaire responses of the largest domestic producers which confirmed that purchasers were \u201callocated a portion of production based on historical levels of purchases\u201d in applicable products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Staff Report </em>at II-2. The ITC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>also referenced news articles in trade publications which reported a domestic supply shortage in this time period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The ITC\u2019s finding of domestic supply shortage was informed by an additional observation that imports of structural steel beams from Japan became subject to a June 2000 antidumping duty order, and imports of structural steel beams from Korea became subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Finally, the ITC noted the changes to domestic production during the POI. Two new domestic mills (Nucor and TXI) became operational during 1999 with a third (Steel Dynamics, InC.) expected to become operational in 2002. On the other hand, another domestic firm (Northwestern Steel &amp; Wire Company) completely shut down its operations in May 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">i. Subject import volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">In a material injury investigation, the statute requires the Commission to determine whether a domestic industry \u201c(i) is materially injured, or (ii) is threatened with material injury * * * by reason of imports.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l). The statute defines \u201cmaterial injury\u201d as \u201charm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(A). In making a material injury determination, the statute first requires the ITC to consider the \u201cvolume\u201d of subject im-pdrts already determined to be sold at less-than-fair value. \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(i)(I). In particular, the ITC shall consider whether the volume of subject imports (or any change therein) in either absolute or relative terms is \u201csignificant\u201d during the POI. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC observed that the volume of subject imports rose from 331,436 short tons in 1999 to 772,809 in 2000, and then fell to 300,150 in 2001 (to a level lower than its 1999 level). <em>Final Determination </em>at 21. The value (as opposed to quantity) of subject imports followed a similar curve. These numbers represented a market penetration by subject imports of 6.7% in 1999, 12.4% in 2000, and 6.2% in 2001. The ITC linked the rise in U.S. market penetration of subject imports to its finding that the domestic industry was experiencing supply difficulties. Accounting for the gap in time between order placement and delivery, the ITC noted that changes in volume of subject imports trailed the domestic supply conditions, with the domestic shortage and its subsequent alleviation responsible for the rise and in part for the later fall of subject imports during the POI. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Before the ITC, the domestic industry had argued that the increase in demand during 2000 was \u201crelatively modest,\u201d and therefore the domestic industry could satisfy \u201creal\u201d demand with their supplies \u2014 which argument was an attempt to dispute the domestic shortage finding of the ITC. The ITC responded by noting that instead of contemporaneous demand conditions, perceptions about future demand are what stimulate orders. <em>Id. </em>at 22. As evidence of purchasers\u2019 expectations of strong future demand during the POI, the ITC cited testimony by one fabricator and the predictions of a trade publication, which incidentally also reported \u201cmajor concerns about steel availability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. In the ITC\u2019s scenario of events, expected strong demand and limited domestic supply led to an increase in purchases of subject imports (especially by distributors). The ITC further acknowledged that by the third quarter of 2000, the domestic supply situation improved and, after import volumes had reached their peak in August 2000, orders for subject imports began to fall. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Further, the ITC remarked that subject import volumes started to fall \u201cwell before\u201d the filing of the May 2001 petition that initiated the present investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Consistent with this observation, the ITC pronounced that the filing of the petition had \u201climited\u201d impact on the decline of subject import volumes in 2001 and, accordingly, the ITC did not \u201creduce the weight\u201d accorded to the 2001 data. The ITC finally concluded that resolution of domestic shortages coupled with decline in demand led to a decline in subject import quantities in this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">After thus accounting both for the upward movement of subject import volumes from 1999 to 2000 and their decline from 2000 to 2001, the ITC went on to say: \u201c[I]n light of the foregoing conditions of competition and the lack of price effects discussed below, we find that the volume of subject imports is not significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">ii. Price effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The statute also requires the ITC to consider the \u201ceffect of imports * * * on prices in the United States for domestic like products.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(i)(II). In particular, the ITC is required to analyze whether \u201cthere has been significant price underselling\u201d of imports compared with domestic products and whether \u201cthe effect of imports * * * otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(ii)(I) &amp; (II).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Comparing domestic prices with subject import prices, the ITC first found that prices of subject imports reflected \u201ca mixed pattern of overselling and underselling\u201d the domestic product during the POI. <em>Final Determination </em>at 25. In particular, subject imports undersold the domestic product in 90 of 147 quarterly comparisons. <em>Id.-, Staff Report </em>at V-17 &amp; V-18. The ITC noted that product 1, a type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>structural steel beams (wide-flange beams of 8 to 14 inches), experienced the \u201cmost intense\u201d competition because it was the most widely sold and additionally had the most complete pricing data from the subject countries. <em>Final Determination </em>at 26. Isolating the price information for this product, the ITC observed that prices of product 1 exhibited 22 occasions of underselling and 32 occasions of overselling. To estimate underselling more accurately, the ITC also conducted a second comparison which incorporated the differing delivery times of subject imports and domestic product. In this comparison, the incidence of underselling for product 1 increased to 27 and that of overselling decreased to 25. Even though in this instance underselling occurred more frequently than overselling, the ITC nevertheless emphasized that \u201cstill more tonnage was oversold.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 26 n.100; <em>Staff Report </em>at V \u2014 9 &amp; V- 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\">While also acknowledging that other products under investigation exhibited greater incidence of underselling, the ITC noted that the domestic product was typically sold at a premium, the existence of which was established at the administrative hearing by testimony of four domestic industry witnesses (also characterizing the premium of $10 to $40 per ton as \u201csmall\u201d) and one respondents witness (adding that the premium could more than double in a \u201cvery weak market\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Final Determination </em>at 25 n.98; <em>ITC Hearing Tr. </em>at 232. The ITC attributed the more frequent occurrence of underselling (as opposed to overselling) to the premium. The ITC additionally observed that subject imports continued to increase even though some subject import prices were higher than domestic price levels. <em>Final Determination </em>at 27. The ITC concluded that \u201c[t]hese factors all serve to diminish the significance of the underselling that was observed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Next, the ITC noted that in 2000 the volume of imports was at its highest level when both domestic and subject import prices were highest. Prices of subject imports sharply rose from 1999 to their peak in 2000 and declined in 2001, following a trend similar to that of subject import volumes. <em>Id.; Staff Report </em>at V-9 to V-16. The ITC thus pronounced that \u201cfactors other than competition from subject imports were responsible for price movement of the domestically produced product.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 27. In identifying domestic shortages as the likely culprit, the ITC observed that \u201c[p]rice increases are a natural function of supply shortages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>The ITC further noted that once the domestic supply shortage was alleviated, prices along with subject imports declined. According to the ITC, \u201cthe sharp decline in prices observed during 2001 cannot be a function of that year\u2019s subject import volumes, which declined sharply, [and it] also cannot be a function of subject imports entering the U.S. market in 2000 at rising prices that were sometimes above those for the domestically produced product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reason for the fall in price, the ITC determined, was the misestimation of the 2001 demand (which in fact declined from its 2000 level) by purchasers who placed their orders earlier and the consequential rise in distributors\u2019 inventories \u2014 which can also be termed as an \u201coversupply\u201d in the market.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">The ITC ended its price effects analysis by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">We cannot conclude that the record indicates that either the inventory overhang or the resulting price declines were the function of the subject imports. High and increasing subject import prices during the portion of 2000 when subject import volumes increased cannot explain subsequent price declines. Nor, in light of the subject import pricing and volume patterns, can there be any nexus between the subject imports and business decisions by steel service centers to increase purchases that proved, in retrospect, to be wrong. We consequently conclude that the subject imports did not have significant price-depressing or -suppressing effects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">iii. Impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The last component of a material injury determination is the analysis of the impact of subject imports sold at less-than-fair value on the domestic industry.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The ITC is statutorily required to consider \u201call relevant economic factors\u201d that bear on \u201cthe business cycle and conditions of competition\u201d in the industry, including changes in output, sales, inventories, capacity utilization, market share, employment, wages, productivity, profits, cash flow, return on investment, ability to raise capital, and R&amp;D. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii). In addition, the 1994 amendments to the statute now require the ITC to consider the size of dumping margins determined in an anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>dumping investigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii)(V); The Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Statement of Administrative Action (\u201cSAA\u201d) at 850, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4040, 4184. No single factor is dispositive. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677(7)(E)(ii) (\u201cThe presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subpara-graph (C) * * * shall not necessarily give decisive guidance\u201d to a material injury determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC observed that apparent U.S. consumption of structural steel beams, domestic output indicators (such as capacity, capacity utilization, production, and U.S. shipments), domestic sales revenues (including per unit sales values, the domestic industry\u2019s operating income and margins), employment indicators (such as number of workers, productivity, hours worked, and wages paid) \u2014 all followed a pattern of increase from 1999 to 2000 and decline from 2000 to 2001. <em>Final Determination </em>at 31-34; <em>Staff Report </em>at VI-2. In contrast, the ITC found that domestic producers\u2019 inventories, hourly wages, and R&amp;D steadily increased, and industry capital expenditures decreased from 1999 to 2001. More significantly, the ITC determined that the domestic industry\u2019s market share (as measured by domestic output\u2019s share in U.S. consumption), despite a \u201cmodest\u201d decline in 2000, was actually higher in 2001 than it was in 1999 (specifically, 81.1% in 1999, 79.8% in 2000, and 90.3% in 2001). <em>Final Determination </em>at 31-32. Thus, the ITC dubbed the 2000 loss of market share by the domestic industry a \u201ctemporary phenomenon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The ITC concluded that domestic industry\u2019s overall performance improved from 1999 to 2000, when imports were at their peak, and that none of the components that led to decline in performance from 2000 to 2001 were a result of the increase in imports. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The ITC attributed the decline in prices of the 2000-2001 period to increasing supply and declining demand for this period. Accordingly, the ITC determined that \u201cthe subject imports did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic structural steel beams indus<em>try\"Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">iv. Threat of material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The statute also protects the domestic industry from a threat of material injury (as opposed to a present material injury) on account of imports sold at less-than-fair value in the U.S. market. To be able to conclude that the domestic industry is thus threatened, the ITC must find whether \u201cfurther dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>unless an order is issued.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii). The ITC is required to evaluate the threat factors outlined in section 1677(7)(F)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC first looked at subject import volume and market penetration, emphasizing that, even though increasing in the beginning of the POI, both variables exhibited a sharp decline at the end of the POI. <em>Final Determination </em>at 36. The ITC found \u201cno current shortages of domestic supply and no likelihood of shortages in the imminent future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In connection with this finding, the ITC stressed that TXI had solved its problems at its Petersburg mill and a new Steel Dynamics, Inc. mill was in the works. Further, although the subject countries projected an increase in imports in both 2002 and 2003, the projections fell short of their peak in 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 37. The subject countries had ready markets at home and abroad, and that, although there was some \u201cability to shift exports from other markets to the United States,\u201d it was \u201cunlikely that subject imports [would] increase to significant levels,\u201d given the decline in subject imports in 2001.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Capacity utilization in the subject countries persisted at high levels during the POI, and further increases in both capacity and capacity utilization were anticipated in 2002 and 2003; the ITC thus found that there was no indication in the record of an \u201cimminent\u201d increase in subject volumes. Moreover, subject countries presented testimony (by one Of their executives) rebutting the contention that an impending increase in subject imports was likely. <em>Id. </em>at 38 n.142; <em>ITC Hearing Tr. </em>at 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The ITC additionally pointed to the lack of any significant price effects in the POI and predicted that such would continue in the imminent future. <em>Final Determination </em>at 38. With respect to subject countries\u2019 inventories, the ITC observed that despite an increase in inventories, not all of the inventoried beams were suitable for sale in the United States because they did not conform to the U.S. standard. Moreover, even though other products which could be substituted for structural steel beams in production were subject to U.S. safeguards tariffs (as in the case of hot-rolled bar) \u2014 with the implication that more structural steel beams could be produced \u2014 , the ITC maintained that \u201c[n]evertheless, as previously noted, we do not believe that the presence or potential for additional productive capacity in the subject countries is likely to lead to substantially increased im<em>ports.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Finally, the ITC decided that the domestic industry was not in a \u201cvulnerable state\u201d because the industry remained \u201cprofitable overall\u201d despite variable performances of individual producers and was also \u201ccharacterized by the recent and imminent expansion of capacity at new and efficient production facilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ITC concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Accordingly, we find that material injury by reason of subject imports will not occur absent issuance of antidumping orders against the subject imports. We therefore conclude that the domestic structural steel beams industry is not threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-3\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The court must uphold the Commission\u2019s determinations unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).

No. 731-TA-853 (Final), USITC Pub. No. 3308 (June 2000) <em>(\u201cBeams F) </em>in <em>Pis.\u2019 App. </em>tab 3. <em>See Pls.\u2019Br. </em>at 8. In <em>Beams I, </em>the ITC found that the domestic industry was materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of structural steel beams imported from Japan.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Beams I </em>at 3. Fair Beam makes this argument by focusing on the language found in a recent United States Court of International Trade case, <em>Usinor v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 02-70 (July 19, 2002) <em>(\u201cUsinor\u201d). </em>The <em>Usinor </em>court, while acknowledging that \u201ceach injury or investigation is <em>sui generis, </em>involving a unique combination and interaction of many economic variables,\u201d emphasized that the ITC \u201cmay not disregard previous findings of a general nature that bear directly upon the current review.\u201d <em>Usinor </em>at 39 (quotation omitted). In <em>Usinor, </em>the issue was whether the ITC can assert in one case that the countries in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) were \u201cexport oriented,\u201d poised to export to the United States, after having found in an earlier case that the primary marketing focus of one European country was the European market. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>cording to <em>Usinor, </em>the \u201cobservations regarding EU markets [were] general in nature and [did] not depend on the specific products at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. The <em>Usinor </em>court accordingly ordered the ITC to sufficiently explain its contradictory positions. Basing its argument on <em>Usinor, </em>Fair Beam contends that observations on \u201cgeneral market dynamics\u201d are sufficiently \u201cof a general nature.\u201d <em>Pis.\u2019 Br. </em>at 9. Fair Beam adds that <em>\u201cBeams I </em>and <em>Beams II </em>involved the same product, the same domestic producers, the same volume trends, the same manifestation of injury, in overlapping periods of investigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">On the other hand, the ITC emphasizes the <em>sui generis </em>nature of injury investigations. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 8. ITC cites prior cases of this Court which rejected the argument, among others, that the ITC was required to use the same volume and price analysis in subsequent investigations for the same product. <em>See id. </em>at 9 (citation omitted). The ITC stresses the difference between \u201cagency practice,\u201d which would have precedential value, and case-specific determinations, which would not. <em>See id. </em>at 10 (citing <em>Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Foundation v. United States, </em>23 CIT 861, 884-85, 74 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1374 (1999)). The ITC concludes that because <em>Beams I </em>or <em>Beams IPs </em>factual determinations are not \u201cof a general nature\u201d under <em>Usinor, </em>but based on specific facts, <em>Beams II </em>need not have followed <em>Beams I. See id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The ITC argues in the alternative that even assuming such factual determinations are \u201cof a general nature,\u201d the \u201cITC acts in accordance with law when it either follows or distinguishes such determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (citation omitted). The ITC points to footnote 105 in <em>Beams II, </em>where the Commissioners rejected the argument that <em>Beams I </em>would have any precedential bearing on the present investigation and further indicated that, in any event, the two investigations were factually different. For the ITC, footnote 105 serves to distinguish the <em>Beams II </em>investigation from the <em>Beams I </em>investigation sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The arguments of Defendant-Intervenors Stahlwerk Thuringen Gmbh <em>et al. </em>(\u201cStahlwerk\u201d) and Salzgitter AG Stahl und Technologie (\u201cSalzgitter\u201d) center on the rejection of Fair Beam\u2019s <em>Usinor </em>analysis. Specifically, Stahlwerk argues that the determinations of <em>Beams II </em>concerning volume, price, and impact are not \u201cof a general nature,\u201d but fact-specific. <em>See Stahlwerk\u2019s Br. </em>at 7-8. Stahlwerk presents a doomsday scenario in which, were the court to agree with Fair Beam, the ITC would subsequently be required to consider \u201chundreds\u201d of its prior determinations in every investigation in search of consistency. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Salzgitter adds that the <em>Usinor </em>court clearly adhered to the familiar standard of substantial evidence and that the plaintiff in <em>Usinor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>was challenging the ITC\u2019s construction of a statute, not fact findings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See Salzgitter Br. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Comparative Analysis of Beams I and the Final Determination (or Beams II).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">An agency that engages in formal adjudication may not render arbitrary and inconsistent decisions. <em>See Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923 (1971); <em>Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency, </em>656 F.2d 42, 47 (3d Cir. 1981). Should the agency choose to deviate from a practice it consistently employed in the past for the evaluation and testing of a set of facts, it must delineate and give reasons for its subsequent change of policy as to provide adequate guidance to parties affected by its actions and to present the reviewing court with a discernable basis to judge the discrepancy. <em>See Sec\u2019y of Agriculture v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 645, 652-53 (1954); <em>British Steel PLC v. United States, </em>127 F.3d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">At the same time, it is an equally well-established proposition that the ITC\u2019s material injury determinations are <em>sui generis-, </em>that is, the agency\u2019s findings and determinations are necessarily confined to a specific period of investigation with its attendant, peculiar set of circumstances. <em>See U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1190, 1213, 873 F. Supp. 673, 695 (1994) (quotation omitted). In <em>Beams I, </em>the period of investigation was from 1997 to 1999; in <em>Beams II, </em>from 1999 to 2001. Given the dynamic nature of the economy, rarely would circumstances and their multi-faceted interactions defining a period of material injury investigation exhibit sufficient similarity to those of another period.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Fair Beam is correct in that <em>Beams I </em>and <em>II </em>involved the same product, and subject imports were present in the U.S. market at noticeable and increasing levels in both periods of investigation. Yet the statute dictates the ITC to attach importance only to those increases in subject import quantities and to those price effects of the subject imports which are deemed \u201csignificant.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(i) &amp; (ii). Accordingly, the ITC first acknowledged in footnote 105 of the <em>Final Determination </em>that subject imports in <em>Beams I </em>\u201cwere entering the U.S. market at low and declining prices even after a period when the domestic industry was having difficulty satisfying demand.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number><em>Final Determination </em>at 28 n.105. In contrast, a finding was made in the <em>Beams II </em>investigation that both subject import volumes and prices were increasing during the first portion of the POI.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Second, the ITC further noted in the <em>Final Determination </em>that \u201cthe peak subject import volume and the increase in subject import volume in <em>[Beams I </em>were] substantially greater than in <em>[Beams II\\.\u201d Id. </em>As a third observation, the ITC offered that in <em>Beams I </em>\u201cthe subject imports undersold the domestic like product in the <em>vast majority </em>of pricing comparisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). In <em>Beams II, </em>on the other hand, under- and overselling were approximately of equal frequency for product 1, the most widely traded product among structural steel beams and, even though more underselling than overselling occurred for other products, underselling was mitigated by the price premium. The ITC finally concluded in the <em>Final Determination </em>that \u201c[a]s the accompanying discussion indicates, the record in these investigations is substantially different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The court agrees with the ITC that these three observations are of crucial importance to distinguish the underlying factual pattern of <em>Beams II </em>from that of <em>Beams I. </em>In a material injury determination, the ITC is required to determine whether a material injury to the domestic industry (or a threat thereof) occurred \u201cby reason of\u201d subject imports that are sold in the U.S. market at less-than-fair value. \u00a7 1671d(b)(l). That is, the record must support a sufficient nexus between the injury (or threat of injury) and subject imports. <em>See Goss Graphics Sys. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 983, 989-90, 33 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1089 (1998). Moreover, \u201cevidence of <em>de minimis </em>(e.g., minimal or tangential) causation of injury does not reach the causation level required under the statute.\u201d <em>Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>132 F.3d 716, 722 (Fed. Cir. 1997), <em>quoted in Coalition for the Preservation of Am. Brake Drum and Rotor Aftermarket Mfrs. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 520, 523, 15 F. Supp. 2d 918, 922 (1998). In the <em>Final Determination </em>here, the ITC was unpersuaded by the argument that aggressive price cutting by the subject countries was what allowed subject imports to penetrate the U.S. market and subsequently cause injury to the domestic industry. Instead, the ITC attributed the rise in subject import volumes to a temporary domestic supply shortage observed during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The ITC based its finding of domestic supply shortage on three separate pieces of evidence: questionnaire responses of purchasers and of domestic producers, and contemporaneous news articles in industry publications. The ITC noted that \u201c[p]rice increases are a natural function of supply shortages.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 28. The ITC further observed that subject import volumes were increasing alongside prices. According to the ITC, the rise in both the subject imports and prices was thus a consequence of the domestic supply shortage.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>In <em>Beams II, </em>the domestic industry was temporarily unable to satisfy demand.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The domestic producers\u2019 inability to satisfy demand resulted in a supply shortage or an excess demand in the market. As purchasers competed for fewer available products, prices rose. In addition, the supply of the domestic industry was relatively more inelastic than the supply of the subject countries vis a vis the U.S. market. <em>See Staff Report </em>at 11-16 &amp; 11-17. That is, subject producers could react to a rise in U.S. prices faster than their domestic counterparts in terms of increasing shipment to the U.S. market. As the subject countries diverted their goods to the U.S. market to satisfy excess demand, subject import quantities began to rise and, as expected, this phenomenon was observed alongside an increase in prices.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the domestic shortage was, more likely than not, responsible for the rise in both subject import volumes and prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In <em>Beams I, </em>however, prices were declining as the subject import volumes were increasing. In addition, the ITC found significantly more underselling than overselling the domestic product by subject imports. These two observations serve to show that in <em>Beams I </em>a more immediate connection could have been made between subject imports and falling prices. That is, it was likely that persistent price cutting by foreign exporters had led to the increase in subject import volumes by spurring purchases of imports over the domestic product where a domestic supply shortage by itself would have resulted in an increase in price. Accordingly, in <em>Beams I </em>the finding of domestic shortage was not as significant as in the <em>Final Determination </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">As urged by the ITC, this court also notes that in <em>Beams I </em>\u201c[n]othwithstanding the decrease from 1998 levels, the 1999 volume of subject imports represented] a 728-percent increase over the 1997 volume.\u201d Beams <em>I </em>at 12. In contrast, the volume of subject imports in <em>Beams II </em>showed a net decline over the POI. As a parallel observation, the domestic industry gained market share over the POI in <em>Beams II </em>(despite the dip in 2000) and lost market share in <em>Beams I. </em>This distinction between <em>Beams I </em>and <em>II </em>lends credence to the assertion that in <em>Beams I </em>subject imports penetrated the market in numbers which went beyond a temporary exploitation of a domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>shortage whereas in <em>Beams II </em>the rise in subject import volumes was a \u201ctemporary phenomenon.\u201d The court finally observes that subject countries in the two investigations were different, a factor which plays an especially important role in a threat determination. As a result, the court finds (as did the ITC) that <em>Beams I </em>does not constitute legal precedent for <em>Beams II </em>and the ITC\u2019s consideration of <em>Beams I </em>in footnote 105 of the <em>Final Determination </em>is sufficient to distinguish the two investigations factually.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">In addition, the court rejects Fair Beam\u2019s argument that <em>Beams IFs </em>factual findings concerning \u201cgeneral market dynamics\u201d are \u201cof a general nature\u201d under <em>Usinor. </em>The \u201cgeneral market dynamics\u201d Fair Beam refers to is presumably the statutory framework the ITC is required to follow in every material injury determination. There is nothing in the statute or case law that requires the ITC to take as precedent any prior factual finding that was reached within this framework. In <em>Usinor, </em>the finding \u201cof a general nature\u201d pertained to a particular attitude toward the market of subject producers in question. Specifically, the <em>Usinor </em>court said that the ITC cannot reasonably claim that European countries are not export-oriented in one case and later retract that position without explanation. While <em>Usinor </em>correctly supports the need for consistency in the ITC\u2019s determinations, as well as the need for reasoned explanation, this court observes that there is no finding in <em>Beams II </em>that is likely to be governed by <em>Usinor. </em>The findings in <em>Beams II </em>are confined to observations on economic variables, which are necessarily volatile. Fair Beam does not point to any determination in <em>Beams II </em>(or in <em>Beams </em>I) that bears on particular, persistent attitudes of trading countries which, because they persist within a sufficiently short interval of time, would arguably have called for the same treatment by the ITC in different investigations undertaken also close in time. In addition, the fact that similar patterns are observed in different investigations with regard to some of the variables does not preclude a different interpretation of the patterns after viewing the entire economic environment as a whole. In fact, the statute requires the ITC to evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>patterns in a context, instead of encouraging an analysis of each piece in isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">B. The ITC\u2019s finding regarding the significance of subject import volume is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Fair Beam next argues that the <em>Final Determination\u2019s </em>findings are unsupported by substantial evidence. Fair Beam continues to compare the <em>Final Determination </em>to <em>Beams I </em>in this portion of its arguments before the court, specifically with respect to similar volume trends found in the two investigations. <em>See Pls.\u2019 Br. </em>at 11. In addition, Fair Beam contends that the <em>Final Determination </em>should have compared the size of the domestic shortage with the size of the increase in subject import volumes as <em>Beams I </em>did. <em>Id. </em>at 12. That subject import volumes exceeded the domestic shortage may have meant that the surge in subject imports was not solely due to the domestic supply shortage.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Fair Beam also maintains that the <em>Final Determination </em>should have taken into account the impact of the filing of the petition on subject import volumes. <em>See id. </em>at 13. Fair Beam argues that the decrease in subject imports in the later part of the POI may have been in part due to the petition. Fair Beam points out that [[ ]] importer withdrew from the market upon the filing of the petition. <em>See id. </em>at 14 (citing Fax from TradeARBED to its customers (dated June 7, 2001) in <em>Pls.\u2019 App. </em>tab 8 (\u201cAs is normal while under [an] investigation we are withdrawing from the market effective immediately.\u201d)).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">The ITC counters that, even if there was a sharp increase in subject import volumes, the statute requires the ITC to concentrate on the significance of such increase. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 12. The ITC also contends that the <em>Final Determination </em>was correct in not discounting post-petition data because the decrease in subject import volumes preceded the filing of the petition. <em>See id. </em>at 13. Moreover, the Commissioners did not completely ignore the petition, but decided that it had a \u201climited\u201d impact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Subject import volume analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">There is substantial evidence on the record to support the ITC\u2019s finding that the volume of subject imports was not \u201csignificant.\u201d First, as noted earlier, there is substantial evidence in the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>support the existence of a domestic supply shortage in the U.S. structural steel beams market. Second, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ITC\u2019s analysis of relationships among economic variables during the POI. Consulting data on both the subject import volumes and supply conditions, the ITC noted that the subject import quantities followed (with a temporal lag) the domestic supply conditions. Subject imports started to increase in response to the domestic supply shortage in 1999 and declined between 2000 and 2001 when the shortage was shrinking. Moreover, the ITC observed that in the beginning of the POI, purchasers overestimated future demand for structural steel beams, and towards the end of the POI, demand either declined or flattened with contraction in economic activity and construction. The ITC pointed to specific sources of information and evidence in support of these findings in the form of testimony, published articles, and statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">On the other hand, Fair Beam can point to no evidence in support of its argument that the rise in the subject import volumes was \u201csignificant.\u201d Fair Beam continues to engage in what this court considers a fruitless comparison between <em>Beams I </em>and the <em>Final Determination. </em>In addition to what has been explored above, the court notes that, even though the subject import volumes rose and fell (thus demonstrated a similar pattern) in both periods of investigation, the market penetration by subject imports in the <em>Final Determination </em>was far from its magnitude in <em>Beams I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Fair Beam is additionally concerned that the relative sizes of the domestic shortage and subject import volumes should have been noted in the <em>Final Determination </em>as they had been in <em>Beams I. </em>However, there is nothing in the statute or case law which requires the ITC to compare the size of a shortage, the existence of which has been confirmed, with the increase in subject import volumes. The statute solely mandates the ITC to consider the volume of subject imports and assess its significance. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1677(7)(B) &amp; (C). Because the precise course this analysis should take is not specified, the court must defer to reasonable and factually supported applications of the ITC\u2019s methods. <em>TJsinor </em>at 6-7 (\u201cwe affirm the agency\u2019s factual determinations so long as they are reasonable and supported by the record as a whole, even if there is some evidence that detracts from the agency\u2019s conclusions\u201d) (citing <em>Olympia Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 387, 389, 7 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1000 (1998)); <em>BIC Corp. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 448, 462, 964 F. Supp. 391, 404 (1997) (\u201cbecause Congress has granted the Commission broad discretion to choose its methodology, [the court] will not disturb the Commission\u2019s choice unless it is unreasonable\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The court further observes that, as noted above, the <em>Beams I </em>decision is not legally binding on the ITC in subsequent investigations and, therefore, does not serve as a framework for subsequent ITC determinations as far as the size of a domestic shortage or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>factual determination is concerned. Quite the contrary, <em>Beams I </em>and the <em>Final Determination </em>possess sufficient factual differences the most important of which (for our purposes here) is the fact that in <em>Beams I </em>the subject imports continued to persist in the U.S. market far above their levels in the beginning of the period. Had the increase in subject imports in <em>Beams I </em>been due to a domestic shortage then present, the subsequent decline in volumes when the shortage disappeared would have been expected to mirror the increase in approximate magnitude. More importantly, to the extent the ITC in the <em>Final Determination </em>attributed the rise in subject import volumes to the domestic shortage, the Commissioners properly evaluated and observed the two variables together in finding that they followed a similar curve with a lag.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Finally, as urged by the ITC, the statute gives it discretion to reduce the weight it accords to post-petition data. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677(7)(I). That is, the ITC \u201cmay\u201d discount such data, with the implication that, where proper, it need not. <em>Id. </em>Here, the ITC observed that the decline in subject import volumes preceded the filing of the petition by a sufficient interval. Therefore, the ITC decided that the petition had a \u201climited\u201d impact on the fall in subject import volumes at the end of the POI. Instead of the mere filing of the petition, the ITC determined that the alleviation of domestic supply shortage coupled with weak demand in this period contributed to the decrease in subject import volumes. The ITC\u2019s treatment of post-petition data was accordingly reasonable and supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">C. The ITC\u2019s determination that there were no adverse price effects is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Fair Beam next challenges the ITC\u2019s determination that the prices of structural steel beams were not suppressed by subject imports. <em>See Pis.\u2019Br. </em>at 17. In particular, Fair Beam takes issue with the <em>Final Determination </em>which found (i) that underselling was not widespread, (ii) that underselling was mitigated by the premium the domestic product fetches in the market, and (iii) that there was more overselling than underselling with respect to product 1. Fair Beam quotes another ITC material injury determination where the ITC observed that \u201cin a commodity market characterized by intense price-based competition, a mixed pattern of under- and overselling is to be expected; such a pattern, together with increasing volume of subject imports, indicates that subject imports played a substantial role in the price declines in this market.\u201d <em>Certain Stainless Steel Plate from Belgium, Canada, Italy, Korea, South Africa, and Taiwan, </em>USITC Pub. No. 3188 (May 1999) at 19. Fair Beam maintains that when price comparisons were adjusted by lag time, there was more underselling than overselling for product 1 and that the data from 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>shows \u201chigh margins\u201d of underselling. <em>Pis.\u2019Br. </em>at 16. Fair Beam next questions the ITC\u2019s finding of lack of causation between the increase in the volume of subject imports and the subsequent price declines. <em>Id. </em>at 17. Fair Beam emphasizes that a \u201cprice war\u201d resulted from the entry of subject imports to the U.S. market, which, it claims, was ignored by the ITC. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Consistent with its \u201cprice war\u201d theory, Fair Beam also rejects the ITC\u2019s observation that because the peak in import volumes coincided with the peak in prices, the increase in both was due to a shortage in domestically supplied steel beam. For Fair Beam, this observation ignores the delayed price effects of subject imports \u201cdue to the build-up of inventories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Fair Beam argues that \u201csubject imports triggered a buying spree by service centers, which led to large inventory build-ups, and which ultimately caused a domestic price collapse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The ITC first argues that the ITC thoroughly considered the record data of underselling. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 16. The ITC provides numbers in support of its position that \u201clarge quantities\u201d of beams were oversold at \u201csubstantial margins,\u201d even in 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The ITC urges that under- and overselling data should be evaluated in context. In particular, the ITC emphasizes that a price war, if any, did not start until the third quarter of 2000, well into the POI. The ITC cites case law to show that \u201cthe ITC need not find underselling significant merely because there are more instances of underselling than overselling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The ITC further points out that in <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>the Court upheld the ITC\u2019s conclusion that the price premium for the domestic product mitigated the significance of underselling. 20 CIT 76, 87-88, 913 F. Supp. 580, 590 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Price effects analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The court finds that the ITC\u2019s negative determination with respect to the significance of price underselling is supported by substantial evidence in the record. In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC first engaged, as required by the statute, in a comparison of prices of domestic and imported product. The ITC used the tabulations of domestic and import prices contained in the <em>Staff Report. </em>In these price comparisons, employing two slightly different methodologies, the ITC found a \u201cmixed pattern\u201d of under- and overselling and further noted that, for product 1, the incidences of underselling, despite slightly outnumbering overselling when a lag was incorporated, were nevertheless less infrequent than overselling in the absence of the lag.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>The ITC additionally observed that quantity oversold was greater than quantity undersold. The ITC proceeded to attribute the admittedly frequent occurrence of underselling for other products to the price premium the domestic product commands in the U.S. market. The existence of a price premium for domestic product was supported by testimony from both sides at the administrative hearing. As urged by the ITC, the court notes that the <em>Timken </em>decision stands for the proposition that the ITC may discount incidences of underselling on account of this price premium, where appropriate, as this premium mitigates underselling that is observed. <em>Timken, </em>20 CIT at 87-88, 913 F. Supp. at 589-90.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, the court agrees with the ITC that the \u201csignificance\u201d of price effects does not turn on a sole finding of more instances of underselling than overselling.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The statute also requires the Commission to determine whether \u201cthe effect of imports * * * otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(ii)(II). The court finds that the ITC\u2019s finding with respect to this second component of price effects analysis is supported by the record. In addition to the elimination of the supply shortage, the ITC in the <em>Final Determination </em>found that the price decline at the end of the POI was a result of weak demand in this period and a rise of distributors\u2019 inventories. The record contains sufficient evidence to support this finding of the ITC, as well as its implications. In particular, the record indicates that demand for structural steel beams rose from 1999 to 2000 and flattened in 2001. Moreover, testimony and published articles cited in the <em>Final Determination </em>supported the observation that in the beginning of the POI, purchasers had a more rosy outlook on the condition of the economy and the market, which at the end proved to be unwarranted. The record contained evidence of a developing domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>tic supply shortage in the beginning of the POI and its subsequent resolution. Moreover, the court notes that, as explained earlier, the rise of subject import prices from 1999 to 2000 and their subsequent decline in 2001 cannot be ascribed to the similar trajectory of subject import volumes since the introduction of subject imports into the U.S. market would have led to a more immediate fall in prices due to ensuing competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">Here, Fair Beam seems to be advancing a type of \u201cprice lag\u201d theory arguing that, if subject imports had a delayed impact on prices, the later fall in prices could be attributable to the rise in volumes at the beginning of the POI. Fair Beam\u2019s reading of events taking place during this period and their interaction may have some plausibility if a lag in price effects could be properly assumed. However, under the substantial evidence standard, this court is charged to uphold the ITC\u2019s re\u00e1sonable inferences from facts contained in the record. \u201cIt is not within the Court\u2019s domain either to weigh the adequate quality or quantity of the evidence for sufficiency or to reject a finding on grounds of a differing interpretation of the record.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 955, 962, 699 F. Supp. 300, 306 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>894 F.2d 385 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). In other words, the court cannot give effect to alternative theories advanced by Plaintiffs or accord more weight to supporting facts highlighted by Plaintiffs, however plausible they may be, as long as the ITC\u2019s theory of events are also reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Moreover, the ITC did entertain Fair Beam\u2019s argument that subject imports may have had a delayed impact on prices and rejected the argument. First, the ITC found that prices in the U.S. structural steel beam market are determined on the spot when offer and acceptance take place (even for the domestic producers). <em>See Final Determination </em>at 26 n.100. Second, the ITC rejected the \u201cprice lag\u201d predictions of Fair Beam\u2019s econometric model reasoning that the model was flawed. <em>See id. </em>at 29 n.107.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">At the end of its price effects analysis, the ITC announced, \u201c[w]e cannot conclude that the record indicates that either the inventory overhang or the resulting price declines were the function of the subject imports * * * * We consequently conclude that the subject imports did not have significant price-depressing or -suppressing effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. The ITC\u2019s decision was informed by its repeated observations in the <em>Final Determination </em>that the movements or activity in the U.S. structural steel beam market during the POI were explainable by factors wholly unrelated to subject imports with potentially unfair prices. The ITC was correct in highlighting that a finding of \u201csignificant\u201d price effects necessarily requires an accompanying finding of causal relationship between prices and subject imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>D. The ITC\u2019s determination that subject imports had no adverse impact is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Fair Beam next charges that the ITC failed to consider that the domestic industry suffered large losses in sales and revenues. <em>See Pls.\u2019 Br. </em>at 21. Fair Beam argues that in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC dismissed this evidence as \u201canecdotal,\u201d whereas in <em>Beams I </em>the ITC represented a similar condition as \u201cfurther evidence of the negative effects of subject imports,\u201d which inconsistency is allegedly unsupportable under <em>Usinor. Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The ITC argues that the <em>Final Determination </em>properly weighed the lost sales and revenues data. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 22. The ITC argues that since the decline in domestic industry performance occurred from 2000 to 2001 when subject imports were declining, a link could not be established between subject imports and alleged lost sales and revenues. <em>See id. </em>In addition, the <em>Final Determination </em>found no adverse price effects. The combination of these two observations led the ITC to discount as \u201canecdotal\u201d the lost sales and revenues data.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Salzgitter points out that \u201cthe performance of the domestic industry tracked the rise and fall of apparent U.S. consumption.\u201d <em>Salzgit-ter Br. </em>at 13. Thus, the decline in performance was not a function of imports. Salzgitter emphasizes that at the end of POI, the domestic industry actually gained market share (a \u201chistoric high\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Salzgit-ter observes that the ITC construed this phenomenon as imports \u201cfilling shortages\u201d and not \u201cdisplacing domestic production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Impact analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Contrary to Fair Beam\u2019s assertion, the ITC\u2019s analysis involved a reasoned consideration of the lost sales and revenues data based on an extensive and detailed staff report. In a footnote to the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC observed that because there was underselling of subject imports, it was \u201cnot surprising that there were some confirmed lost sales and revenues.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 26 n.102. The domestic industry \u201csubmitted 27 lost sales and 173 lost revenue allegations,\u201d alleged lost sales totaling $[[ ]] million and alleged lost revenues totaling $[[ ]] million. <em>Staff Report </em>at V-18 &amp; App. E. In the <em>Staff Report, </em>the ITC staff confirmed or \u201cpartially\u201d confirmed 17 lost sales allegations of $24.1 million and 49 lost revenue allegations of $786,411. <em>Id. </em>at V-18 &amp; V-19. The ITC staff added that a \u201clarge number of lost revenues allegations involve sales or quotations made after January 1, 2002\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause of time constraints, and because purchasers don\u2019t always keep records of unsuccessful bids, some purchasers were unable to confirm or deny some specific allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at V-19. In the <em>Final Determination, </em>considering the <em>Staff Report, </em>the ITC pronounced that \u201c[b]ecause these allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>concern a period later than that for which the Commission collected pricing data, the record does not indicate whether they are indicative of overall pricing or underselling trends.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 26 n.102. Moreover, the ITC stressed that the lost sales and revenue data was \u201canecdotal\u201d and could not \u201coutweigh the patterns\u201d contained in \u201cthe pricing data overall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court finds the ITC\u2019s reasons to be sound and consistent with the underlying record.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Further, the ITC is not required to accord more weight to any factor of impact analysis at the expense of other factors. Specifically, \u201c[n]o factor, standing alone, triggers a <em>per se </em>rule of material injury.\u201d <em>Am. Spring Wire Corp. v. United States, </em>8 CIT 20, 23, 590 F. Supp. 1273, 1277 (1984) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the fact that the ITC decided to de-emphasize confirmed lost sales and revenues data does not detract from its finding of no impact because assigning different weights to different pieces of evidence is fully within the ITC\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The court finally notes that there is substantial evidence on the record in support of the ITC\u2019s finding that subject imports did not adversely impact the domestic industry. As required by the statute, the ITC in the <em>Final Determination </em>considered \u201call relevant economic factors * * * within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii). In the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC noted that over the POI, the domestic industry actually gained market share, that the domestic industry\u2019s performance was improving as the subject import volumes were increasing, and that the later retardation in variables designed to measure the domestic industry\u2019s \u201chealth\u201d could not be ascribed to subject imports. The court agrees that improvements in the output indicators (and other \u201chealth\u201d factors) would likely not have been observed alongside increases in subject import volumes, had subject imports had an injurious present effect on the domestic industry. Further, as the ITC stated, the observed decline in output indicators at the end of the POI was likely not the result of the rise in subject imports on account of the intervening time between these two events. It may be that, as Salzgitter recommends, domestic output fell (as well subject import quantities) along with falling demand for structural steel beams in this period. For these reasons and given that the ITC found no \u201csignificant\u201d volume and price effects in the POI, the court concludes that the ITC\u2019s no adverse impact finding is supported by the record and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">E. The ITC\u2019s determination of no threat of material injury is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">In support of its argument that the ITC erred in finding no threat of material injury, Fair Beam first cites the testimony of a foreign ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>ecutive who stated that U.S. prices were \u201cgorgeous,\u201d and that foreign producers are able to \u201creact\u201d quickly and are profit oriented. <em>Pis.\u2019Br. </em>at 23. According to Fair Beam, this is evidence of the opportunistic nature of foreign producers who move quickly to take advantage of price differentials across markets. This part of Fair Beam\u2019s argument stresses an inability to learn from past lessons. In particular, in <em>Beams I </em>German and Spanish producers said they would not \u201copportunistically take advantage of shortterm opportunities\u201d and were thereby excluded from that investigation. However, \u201c[w]hat happened next?* * * No sooner was the ink dry\u201d on <em>Beams I, </em>then they returned and took advantage of short-term opportunities. <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Fair Beam further points to current excess capacity of foreign producers. <em>See id. </em>at 25. In <em>Beams I, </em>the ITC relied on a similar condition as part of its threat determination, whereas in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC focused on the existence of markets other than the U.S. where foreign producers could sell their products. According to Fair Beam, the <em>Final Determination\u2019s </em>focus ignores a number of facts. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. First, the foreigners demonstrated an ability to quickly penetrate and shift their exports to the U.S. market during the POI. Second, foreign producers projected an increase of exports to the U.S. in 2002 and 2003. Third, foreign capacity is expected to increase in the future. Similarly, Fair Beam also criticizes the ITC\u2019s failure to assign sufficient importance to increasing foreign inventories. <em>See id. </em>at 27. Because the ITC found that some of the foreign inventories were not suitable for the U.S. market, Fair Beam observes that \u201c[s]ubject foreign producers can meet home market demand with such inventories, while shifting production to ASTM products,\u201d which are U.S.-market-compatible. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Fair Beam further points out that \u201cthe scope of the merchandise subject to investigation [was] nearly identical in <em>Beams I </em>and <em>Beams II. </em>Therefore, assuming there is some merit to the contention regarding different ASTM standards, it would equally be true for the inventories in both <em>Beams I </em>and <em>Beams II.\u201d Id. </em>Finally, Fair Beam contends that the ITC improperly disregarded evidence concerning the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the domestic industry. <em>See id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The ITC counters that significant increases in imports were not imminent. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 23. The ITC highlights a number of factors. First, the volume of imports was declining at the end of the POI. Second, the domestic capacity was increasing. Third, even though foreign producers projected an increase in imports in 2002 and 2003, the projections were still below 2000 levels (the high in volume). Fourth, foreign producers had other markets in which to sell their products. Five, the U.S. prices were traditionally higher (thus, the U.S. prices were not any more \u201cattractive\u201d than they had always been).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The ITC also argues that the <em>Final Determination </em>properly evaluated existing foreign capacity and potential to shift the goods to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>United States. The ITC claims that these two factors are \u201cinsufficient to warrant an affirmative threat determination absent positive evidence showing that increased levels of importation are actually imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 (citing <em>inter alia BIC, </em>21 CIT at 464, 964 F. Supp. at 405 (\u201cConjecture and speculation are not enough; there must be positive evidence tending to show an intention to increase levels of importation.\u201d) (quotation omitted)). The ITC posits that the <em>Final Determination </em>adequately explained why foreign producers had no incentive to increase imports to the United States. Among other matters, the <em>Final Determination </em>explained that not all steel beams of foreign production were suitable for U.S. consumption because they did not meet U.S. standards. <em>See id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">The ITC next maintains that the <em>Final Determination </em>sufficiently considered the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the U.S. industry. <em>See id. </em>at 29. The ITC emphasizes that the domestic industry was about to expand capacity and \u201cnew and efficient\u201d facilities were about to open. The ITC indicates that while \u201cvulnerability\u201d is a proper factor to consider in threat analysis, it is not a substitute for statutory criteria. <em>See id. </em>at 30 (citing <em>NEC Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>23 CIT 987, 999, 83 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1342-43 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Stahlwerk argues that subject imports were declining at the end of the POI (\u201cfor six straight quarters\u201d) and, therefore, it was reasonable for the ITC to assume that such a trend would continue. <em>Stahlwerk Br. </em>at 25-26. With respect to U.S. prices being attractive for foreign producers to enter the market in the future, Stahlwerk stresses the price premium, implying that the U.S. prices will always be higher. <em>See id. </em>at 26. With respect to foreign unused capacity, Stahlwerk ponders why such capacity would not prevent subject imports from falling towards the end of POI. <em>See id. </em>at 27. With respect to the domestic industry\u2019s \u201cvulnerability,\u201d Stahlwerk argues that the ITC did consider the industry\u2019s overall profitability with \u201cnew and efficient\u201d mills in the works and that the ITC was not required to analyze the \u201cunusually sensitive\u201d nature of the industry to subject imports, once the ITC decided that the subject imports were not about to rise significantly. <em>See id. </em>at 28-29. Salzgitter adds that the ITC\u2019s negative threat determination followed logically from its negative material injury determination. <em>See Salzgitter </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Threat Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In a threat of material injury determination, the ITC must find whether \u201cfurther dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii). The pertinent factors outlined in the statute for a finding of threat of material injury are: (II) latent production capacity (or an imminent increase thereof) in the subject countries, taking into account alternative export markets; (III) \u201csignificant\u201d increase in volume or market penetration of subject imports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>indicating \u201clikelihood of substantially increased imports;\u201d (IV) likely \u201csignificant\u201d suppression of price as to lead to an increase in future demand for imports; (V) inventories; (VI) ability of subject countries to shift production to subject merchandise; (VIII) \u201cactual and potential negative effects\u201d on the domestic industry\u2019s development; and (IX) \u201cany other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of\u201d subject imports.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i). The ITC must evaluate the statutory factors \u201cas a whole\u201d in making a threat determination. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(ii). No such factor will \u201cnecessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the statute specifies that a threat determination cannot be based on a \u201cmere conjecture or supposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because section 1677(7)(F)(i) directs the ITC to consider all relevant economic factors in a threat investigation, the ITC has \u201cno discretion in this matter.\u201d <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 978, 984 (Fed. Cir. 1994); \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i) (providing that the ITC \u201cshall\u201d consider all relevant economic factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The court agrees with the ITC and Defendant-Intervenors that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the <em>Final Determination\u2019s </em>negative threat of material injury determination. A threat of material injury determination necessarily involves a prediction of the future. By warning that a \u201cmere conjecture\u201d is not enough to sustain an affirmative threat determination and by outlining non-discretionary factors to be evaluated, the statute aims to limit hypothesizing that naturally accompanies such a prediction. The Commissioner who dissented from the negative threat determination of the ITC pointed out that the outlook of the U.S. structural steel beam industry at the end of the POI was somewhat mixed. <em>See Separate and Dissenting Views of Commissioner Lynn M. Bragg, Certain Structural Steel Beams from China, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and Taiwan, </em>Invs. No. 731-TA-935- 942 (July 2002) at 6 in <em>Administrative Record, </em>List 2, Doc. No. 171. The dissenting Commissioner especially noted among conditions adverse to the domestic industry\u2019s health: the substantial decline in the domestic industry\u2019s operating income, declining domestic capital stock and restricted access to capital, domestic start-up operations that are especially vulnerable to competitive forces, weak U.S. demand and increasing domestic inventories, increasing cost/ price ratio indicating dampening profits, capacity increases in subject countries (especially in China), subject countries\u2019 allegedly demonstrated ease to shift production to U.S.-market-compatible product, domestic prices that persisted at higher levels than prices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>abroad, projected shipment increases by the subject countries, and projected capacity utilization increases in the subject countries. <em>See id. </em>at 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">The court notes, however, that these arguably unfavorable facts regarding the existence of a threat were evaluated by the majority of the Commissioners and rejected. The ITC\u2019s duty in making a threat of material injury determination is to evaluate the non-discretionary statutory factors. The statute, <em>inter alia, </em>requires the ITC to conduct renewed analyses of subject import volumes and price effects regarding threat of material injury. In particular, the ITC shall examine whether there has been a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in subject import volumes during the POI such that their continuing future presence in the U.S. market is \u201clikely\u201d and whether subject imports are \u201clikely\u201d to depress prices as to increase future demand for imports. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i)(Iip &amp; (IV). Accordingly, the ITC observed that at the end of the POI, both subject import volumes and prices were declining. In connection with its earlier finding that a domestic shortage was responsible for the rise in the subject import volumes, the ITC determined that \u201cthere was no likelihood of shortages in the imminent future\u201d and, therefore, a similar rise in subject import volumes was not likely to occur in the future. <em>Final Determination </em>at 36. As urged by Fair Beam, the subject countries demonstrated an ability to shift shipment to the U.S. market with relative ease; however, given that the subject countries\u2019 shipments to the United States increased as a response to a temporary domestic shortage during the POI and subject imports left the U.S. market once the shortage was resolved, the ITC further predicted that a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in subject imports was \u201cunlikely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Further, faced with declining prices at the end of the POI, the ITC could not but observe that imports were not likely to be spurred by favorable prices. Even though U.S. prices remained higher than prices elsewhere at the end of the POI, this was generally so and, therefore, this factor was not likely to encourage further imports in this specific period. In addition, as urged by the ITC counsel during oral argument, the pertinent comparison is not that the U.S. prices remained higher than prices abroad at the end of the POI, as expected, but that the U.S. prices were for the most part lower in 2001 than they had been in 2000.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Oral Arg. Tr. </em>34:5-21. Moreover, the ITC found no \u201csignificant\u201d volume and price effects for the POI and asserted that there was no indication that these phenomena were likely to change in the imminent future.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">With respect to subject countries\u2019 production capacity, the ITC noted that, even though an increase had been projected, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>no indication that such an increase would manifest itself as an imminent increase in subject import volumes. <em>Final Determination </em>at 37. As required by the statute, the ITC further indicated that subject countries had alternate markets at home or abroad to expend their capacity. With respect to subject countries\u2019 inventories, the ITC noted an increase during the POI, but also observed that not all structural beams inventories abroad were suitable for sale in the U.S. market by virtue of failing to satisfy the U.S. standard.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 38. With respect to the domestic industry\u2019s production capacity, the ITC pointed out that \u201cnew and efficient\u201d facilities had already been completed or were about to be completed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. All of these determinations concerning the statutory factors, provided for in section 1677(7)(F)(i)(II), (V) and (VI), were based on the detailed <em>Staff Report </em>and testimony presented at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Fair Beam also charges that the ITC did not consider the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the domestic industry. The court notes, however, that the consideration of \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the domestic industry is not specifically provided for in the statute as part of the required analysis.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> While it is proper for the ITC to consider \u201cvulnerability\u201d among \u201crelevant economic factors,\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i), it cannot be the sole basis of an affirmative threat determination in the presence of other statutory criteria that have not been fulfilled. <em>See NEC, </em>23 CIT at 999, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 1342-43.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Moreover, the ITC in the <em>Final Determina-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number><em>tioYi </em>did consider the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the domestic industry in indicating that despite varying performances of individual players, the domestic industry remained \u201cprofitable overall.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 39. The views of the dissenting Commissioner bring to the attention of the court a number of arguably unfavorable conditions surrounding the domestic industry in this period, especially towards the end of the POI, making it vulnerable to dumped imports. A decline in domestic industry\u2019s sales revenues and operating income in the 2000-2001 period was also acknowledged by the ITC panel in its impact determination. <em>Final Determination </em>at 33. There, the ITC determined that the declining trends were not due to subject imports, but at least in part ascribable to a decline in demand. As the statute requires a causal link between a threat of material injury finding and subject imports, \u00a7 1673d(b)(l), and as the record establishes a number of favorable conditions pertaining to the domestic industry, the court cannot say that the majority of the Commissioners\u2019 treatment of the domestic industry\u2019s adverse trends was unreasonable and factually unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">IV.

The court further notes that no cumulation issues are raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\"> \u201c/TC <em>Hearing Tr.\u201d </em>will signify the transcript of this administrative hearing, portions of which are included in tab 5 of Plaintiffs\u2019Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\"> Construction companies are the ultimate users of the finished product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\"> There is a three to five month \u201clead time\u201d for subject imports whereas the lead time for domestic beams is shorter, <em>Final Determination </em>at 23, although not by \u201cvery much,\u201d <em>ITC Hearing Tr. </em>at 26 (testimony of domestic executive).

The ITC in the <em>Final Determination, </em>however, paid virtually no heed to this information because of its implicit finding that in a time of supply shortage, purchasers are willing to pay more to circumvent the domestic unavailability of the product \u2014 which determination is more fully explained below. In connection with the price variable, the court also notes that at the administrative hearing at least one respondent witness denoted respondents as price takers. <em>See id. </em>at 199-200. In other words, respondents normally peg their price to that of the market leader, Nucor, a domestic producer. In this period, however, because Chaparral Steel, another domestic producer, \u201cwas playing a little bit havoc with the market,\u201d Chaparral Steel\u2019s price was matched. <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\"> Potential long-run substitutes for structural steel beams include reinforced concrete, structural tubing or wood. <em>Staff Report </em>at II \u2014 10 &amp; 11.

The ITC found that the model failed because it did not take into account changes in domestic supply capabilities. To rebut the predictions of the model the ITC cited testimony from industry players to the effect that price competition occurs when an order is placed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b955-10\"> Besides volume, price, and impact, the ITC \u201cmay [also] consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\"> Here, the ITC\u2019s consideration of dumping margins was limited to a listing of amended dumping margins for companies in subject countries. <em>Final Determination </em>at 30 n.110. The <em>Final Determination\u2019s </em>consideration of dumping margins is, however, not on review before the court because it was not raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\"> Here, the ITC noted outstanding antidumping duty orders against Russia by Korea and Taiwan and against South Africa by Australia. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 37 n.141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\"> This determination was subsequently adopted with respect to Korea by virtue of almost identical administrative records in both cases. <em>See Certain Structural Steel Beams from Korea, </em>Invs. Nos. 701-TA-401 and 731-TA-854 (Final), USITC Pub.

The ITC further observed that supply shortage \u201cquickly reversed as subject imports escalated in March 1998 and surged thereafter through the first quarter of 1999,\u201d that \u201c[t]he import surge far exceeded the prior shortfall in supply,\u201d and that \u201cimports gained market share at the expense of the domestic industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Fair Beam represents that thereby the ITC in <em>Beams I </em>compared the size of the domestic shortage to the increase in subject imports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\"> The domestic supply shortage may have been partially due to the exit of Japanese and Korean beams from the U.S. market, as the ITC implied, or to a positive shift in demand or to some other cause not easily discernable from the record. In any event, the \u201ccause\u201d of the domestic shortage is not relevant to the disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\"> The court notes that in the absence of subject imports the price rise may have been higher. Not explicitly discussing this possibility, the ITC nevertheless found that the price effects were not significant. It should also be noted that non-subject imports (other than Japanese and Korean beams which left the market due to the antidumping order) also increased from 1999 to 2000. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 23 n.89; <em>Staff Report </em>at IV-6 &amp; n.8. This fact further undermines the contention that price cutting by subject countries caused the volumes of subject imports to rise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b963-5\"> Fair Beam claims that the <em>Final Determination </em>should have addressed <em>Beams I </em>more extensively, beyond a mere footnote. The ITC responds that <em>Beams II </em>did not have to distinguish <em>Beams I </em>at all and, assuming that it did, footnote 105 in <em>Beams II </em>constitutes an adequate consideration of <em>Beams I. </em>The court observes that because Fair Beam raised <em>Beams I </em>as an \u201cunderlying theme\u201d of its arguments before the agency, the ITC was correct in addressing <em>Beams I </em>in footnote 105. <em>Final Determination </em>at 28 n.105; <em>Altx, Inc. v. United States, </em>25 CIT__.,_, 167 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1374 (2001) (the agency \u201cmust address significant arguments and evidence which seriously undermines its reasoning and conclusions\u201d). In footnote 105, the ITC first pointed out that Fair Beam\u2019s <em>Beams I </em>argument called for no \u201cresponse\u201d as a \u201clegal matter\u201d and, to the extent the argument had merit as a \u201cfactual matter,\u201d the ITC sufficiently addressed the crucial distinctions between <em>Beams I </em>and <em>II </em>in concluding that the two investigations had substantially different records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b964-12\"> At the administrative hearing an ARBED executive elaborated, \u201cwe never completely withdrew from the market.\u201d <em>ITC Hearing Tr. </em>at 199. The ITC appears not to have considered the letter as evidence in its determination on post-petition data. However, consistent with the court\u2019s evaluation of contradictory evidence under the substantial evidence standard, the court defers to the ITC\u2019s treatment of the letter in the <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\"> Contrary to Fair Beam\u2019s assertion, that the ITC in another investigation (that of stainless steel plate) found a mixed pattern of under- and overselling coupled with rising import volumes \u201csignificant\u201d for purposes of price effects is not binding on the ITC in a subsequent investigation, as the court noted throughout this opinion regarding the ITC\u2019s factual determinations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b968-5\"> The <em>Timken </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-6\">The Commission concluded that factoring in the price premium for domestic other special quality bars made the relatively small margins of underselling even less significant. [ ] Thus, the Commission appropriately examined whether there had been \u201csignificant price underselling\u201d by the subject imports. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(ii)(I). Evidence of underselling has been found to be less significant where there were price premiums for domestic products. <em>See Roses, Inc. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 662, 665-66, 720 F. Supp. 180, 183 (1989) (62 out of 110 instances of underselling found insignificant because price premiums for locally-grown roses based on freshness and an ability to supply the flowers on a short-term need basis). <em>See also Trent Tube Div., Crucible Materials v. United States, </em>14 CIT 386, 402, 741 F. Supp. 921, 935 (1990) (consistent underselling given less weight based on domestic price premium due to customer preferences and lead time differences, small volume of imports a consideration), <em>aff'd, </em>975 F2d 807 (Fed. Cir.1992). Thus, the Court cannot say that the Commission\u2019s conclusion was erroneous.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\"> As stated by the ITC, the statutory factors (I) and (VII) are not relevant to this investigation and, therefore, not considered in this opinion. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 35 n.130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\"> There is a suggestion in the record that an improvement in price at the very end of the POI took place as domestic producers responded to the onset of this investigation by increasing prices. <em>See Purchasers\u2019 Questionnaires </em>at 13 Question III \u2014 31 in <em>Pis.\u2019 App. </em>tab 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\"> By merely mandating that the ITC consider \u201cinventories of subject merchandise,\u201d \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i)(V), the statute is not clear about whether the domestic industry\u2019s inventories are also to be considered. The ITC in the <em>Final Determination </em>nevertheless considered the level of domestic inventories during the POI and observed that although increasing \u201cin absolute terms,\u201d domestic inventories declined \u201crelative to imports and U.S. shipments of imports from 1999 to 2000 <em>\"Final Determination </em>at 38. \u201cIn 2001, these inventories declined from 2000 levels in absolute terms but were greater in relative terms than in either 1999 or 2000.
