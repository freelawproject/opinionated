Reg. 39487 (July 31, 2001) (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Plaintiffs challenge five aspects of the Final Determination: (1) the Department\u2019s choice of surrogate values for coking coal; (2) the Department\u2019s finding that foreign producers reported coal usage amounts subsequent to washing; (3) the Department\u2019s use of adverse inferences based on non-cooperation by producers; (4) the Department\u2019s refusal to use surrogate values from related coal mines; and (5) the Department\u2019s use of adverse inferences against Sinochem. The Department\u2019s determination is remanded on all five issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On September 20, 2000, ABC Coke, Citizens Gas &amp; Coke Utility, Erie Coke Corporation, Sloss Industries Corporation, and Tonawanda Coke Corporation (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d or \u201cDefendant-Intervenors\u201d) filed an antidumping petition alleging that imports of foundry coke from China were being injuriously dumped in the United States. The Department initiated an antidumping duty investigation on October 10, 2000. <em>See Initiation of Antidump-ing Duty Investigation: Foundry Coke From the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 61303 (Oct. 17, 2000). Commerce determined the scope of the investigation to be \u201ccoke larger than 100 mm (4 inches) in maximum diameter and at least 50 percent of which is retained on a 100 mm (4 inch) sieve, of a kind used in foundries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61304. On November 7, 2000, Commerce issued Section A Questionnaires to the Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d), as well as courtesy copies to Sinochem, CITIC, Minmetals, and Shanxi Grand Coalchem Industrial Co. (\u201cShanxi\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, each a foundry coke exporter. On November 14, 2000, the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) preliminary determined that \u201cthere is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports from China of foundry coke.\u201d <em>Foundry Coke from China, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 69573, 69573 (Nov. 17, 2000) (\u201cITC Preliminary Determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>During the preliminary proceedings, Commerce provided the parties a list of countries operating at a similar level of economic development to the PRC for purposes of surrogate value determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Respondents submitted information from an Indian producer of coking coal, Bharat Coking Coal, for the relevant period of investigation running from January 1, 2000, through June 30, 2000. Petitioners similarly determined on January 23, 2001, that India was the most appropriate surrogate country and submitted publicly-available information concerning factors of production from India. On February 20, 2001, Commerce selected India as the primary surrogate country, noting that India was a significant producer of the subject merchandise, that Petitioners had submitted factors from Indian sources, and that India was at a level of economic development similar to the PRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In addition, Commerce requested that respondents provide information on their supplying foundries within the PRC. On January 23, 2001, Sinochem, CITIC, and Shanxi submitted Section D Questionnaires from some, but not all, of their suppliers, explaining that certain suppliers had failed to respond because they had been involuntarily closed by the PRC government. Commerce further issued Supplemental Questionnaires on January 26, 2001 requesting documentation on the closures. In response, Sinochem, CITIC, and Shanxi provided documents from the People\u2019s Government of Qing-Xu County and the People\u2019s Government of Shanxi Province representing that certain unidentified companies had been shut down due to their use of outdated equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">During the preliminary proceedings, Commerce also issued a Supplemental Questionnaire to Sinochem requesting additional information on an unreported U.S. sale where a portion of the merchandise was over 100mm in size. Sinochem responded on January 5, 2001, claiming that it had reported all sales of coke falling within the scope of the investigation. A second Supplemental Questionnaire was issued on January 26, 2001, in the response to which Sinochem confirmed that it did sell foundry coke over 100mm in size during the POI, but said that since the majority of the coke was under 100mm, the sale was not subject to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In the Preliminary Determination, Commerce determined that foundry coke from the PRC was being sold at less-than-fair value in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the United States. <em>See </em>Preliminary Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 13885. In determining surrogate values for coal, Commerce chose not to rely on Respondents\u2019 Indian coking coal prices but instead utilized Indian Import Statistics for the period of April 1998 through March 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 13890. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(b), Commerce applied adverse facts available against Sinochem for failure to report its sale containing coke over 100mm in size. 66 Fed. Reg. at 13889. Finally, Commerce determined that respondents did not act to the best of their ability to obtain section D responses from their suppliers and resorted to adverse facts available for exporters who purchased from those companies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In order to address Department\u2019s use of alternative coking coal prices, on May 1, 2001, respondents submitted additional coking coal prices from Coal Week International. Arguing that import prices relied upon by Commerce in the Preliminary Determination were imprecise and unreliable, respondents requested that Commerce use a basket of coking coal prices from comparable countries such as South Africa, Indonesia, Colombia, Venezuela and Poland.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In addition, Respondents also arranged for Chinese government officials to meet with Department\u2019s investigators to provide assurances of the credibility of the shutdowns and to counter Commerce\u2019s use of adverse facts available on the issue. Although Commerce met with the officials and they offered various documents to support their statements, Commerce did not accept any of the documents, claiming they would constitute new information on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Commerce published its Final Determination and accompanying Issues and Decisions Memorandum (\u201cDecision Memorandum\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on July 31, 2001. Final Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. 39487. In the Decision Memorandum, Commerce again rejected Respondents\u2019 submission of surrogate values for coking coal, preferring instead to continue using Indian Import Statistics for the period of April 1998 to March 1999. <em>Id. </em>As in the Preliminary Determination, Commerce continued using adverse facts available against those exporters that could not provide evidence substantiating that some of their suppliers had closed. Commerce explained that the continued application of adverse facts available was appropriate since respondents failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>to submit information in a timely manner and in the requested form. As for Sinochem\u2019s unreported sale, Commerce did not apply adverse facts available but rather applied facts available by conducting a \u201cmargin analysis\u201d on the portion of the sale considered in-scope, \u201cusing the price of the original sale and the volume of the sale which exceeds 100mm in size.\u201d Decision Memorandum at Comment 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In addition, Commerce also determined that Respondents reported coking coal inputs at stages subsequent to the washing. This conclusion was based on Respondents\u2019 questionnaires responses submitted earlier during the proceedings where respondents reported that they washed the coal themselves but recycled the by-product of the washing process, i.e. coal mud, into the production of coke. Commerce therefore determined that \u201cthe reported usage rates are for washed coal, and there is no need to adjust the coal factors to account for washing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Comment 2. Finally, Commerce determined that, contrary to respondents\u2019 contentions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it would not determine a surrogate value for coal obtained from related coal mines by using a factors of production methodology. Commerce did not \u201cconsider that coal is a self-produced input for any of the respondents,\u201d so it \u201cdid not value coal using the factors of production for coal from the coal mines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On September 14, 2001, the ITC determined \u201cthat an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports from China of foundry coke.\u201d <em>Foundry Coke from China, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 47926, 47926 (Sept. 14, 2001) (\u201cITC Final Determination\u201d). On October 17, 2001, Plaintiffs filed the present action to contest the Department\u2019s Final Determination that foundry coke from the PRC was being sold at less-than-fair value in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">III. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In reviewing the Final Determination, the court \u201cshall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found ... to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 USC \u00a7 1516a (b)(1)(B) (1994). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a \u2018mere scintilla,\u2019 and must be enough reasonably to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Primary Steel, Inc. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1080, 1085, 834 F.Supp. 1374, 1380 (1993); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 405, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>810 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1987). \u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., </em>10 CIT at 404 \u2014 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A. A Remand is Necessary Because The Department\u2019s Final Determination Is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence'</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Plaintiffs challenge five aspects of the Final Determination: (1) the Department\u2019s choice of surrogate values for coking coal; (2) the Department\u2019s finding that foreign producers reported coal usage amounts subsequent to washing; (3) the Department\u2019s use of adverse inferences based on non-cooperation by producers; (4) the Department\u2019s refusal to use surrogate values from related coal mines; and (5) the Department\u2019s use of adverse inferences against Sinochem. Because the court finds that the Final Determination is unsupported by substantial evidence, the Court concludes that remand is proper on all five issues. A detailed review of the parties\u2019 contentions follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">1. The Department\u2019s Choice of Surrogate Values Is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">a. Commerce Agrees That The Surrogate Value Date Upon Which It Relied Contains Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Plaintiffs dispute the Department\u2019s choice of surrogate values for coking coal as unsupported by the record, falling outside of the period of investigation, and unreflective of coal prices produced within PRC. More specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Department\u2019s reliance on Indian Import Statistics for the period of April 1998 to March 1999 is unsupported by substantial evidence because: (1) the prices used by Commerce are uncorroborated by the record and inconsistent explanations were provided as to what source documentation might show; (2) Commerce used coal prices outside of the period of investigation without taking into consideration the commodity\u2019s volatile nature; (3) Commerce failed to use prices from an authoritative source on the record that is both contemporaneous to the period of investigation and for coal produced and sold in economies of comparable levels of development to the PRC; and (4) Commerce used prices that were reflective of coal produced in non-comparable economies.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>To support their contention as to the unreliability and inconsistencies in Commerce\u2019s use of surrogate prices, Plaintiffs cite to the Decision Memorandum as well as various documents generated by Commerce in reaching its Final Determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In comparing the Decision Memorandum, the CITIC Analysis Memo and its supporting documents, Plaintiffs point to inconsistent listings of time periods for valuating coal input, and conflicting uses of value inflators and surrogate prices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also cite to discrepancies in the Sinochem Analysis Memo where the purportedly inflated values are not reflected in the supporting documents\u2019 listed values.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, Plaintiffs point to the Shanxi Analysis memo, where coal inputs are for inconsistent periods, and the Minmetals Analysis Memo, where coal prices and input periods conflict between the actual memo and its supporting documents. Plaintiffs argue that all these figures are unreliable because no source documents were provided for the asserted values.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Department has failed to follow its own preference for using surrogate data that is contemporaneous with the period of investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to Plaintiffs, it is the accuracy of the determination that is of paramount concern to the An-tidumping statute, and where prices from one source are shown to be distorted, DOC practice is to turn to another source. <em>Rhodia, Inc. v. United States, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d 1343, 1352 (CIT 2001). Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>claim that the data they submitted is more accurate since it is contemporaneous with the period of investigation and contains prices for merchandise from comparable surrogate countries. While they admit that their prices are from numerous other developing countries, Plaintiffs argue they are still appropriate as \u201c[i]t has been longstanding DOC practice to use prices from a basket of countries in appropriate circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo at 19. Accordingly, they conclude that in refusing to use the data they submitted and providing no source documentation for its surrogate prices, Commerce has \u201cfailed to follow its own preference and the requirement that it use the most accurate information available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Commerce has failed to provide any specifications as to the nature of the coking coal upon which it based its surrogate value determination. They note that Commerce had already previously rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 submission of coal prices, which were from an Indian Producer of coking coal and set contemporaneously to the period of investigation. This decision was based on the fact that the specifications of that coking coal were of a \u201csignificantly lower quality of coking coal than that which is actually used by foundry coke producers.\u201d Preliminary Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 13890. Plaintiffs therefore conclude that Commerce has acted inconsistently in its own findings since \u201c[njothing on the record allows DOC to know whether the coking coal import prices that it has used were for coal similar to that used in China or for a far different product.\u201d On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that the court should remand Commerce\u2019s final determination on surrogate values because the use of Indian Import Statistics for the period of April 1998 - May 1999 is unsupported by the record and not sufficiently contemporaneous to the period of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Defendant-Intervenors, in turn, argue that Department\u2019s decision to use Indian Import Statistics rather than Plaintiffs\u2019 price quote from Coal Week International is supported by substantial evidence \u201cbecause the source was from [a] primary surrogate [country], India, that is publicly available, sufficiently contemporaneous, specific to the input in question, and sufficiently reliable.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cDefendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief\u201d) at 9 (quoting Decision Memo at Comment 1). Accordingly, they say, Commerce \u201chad no need to turn to another surrogate country to obtain a value for coking coal.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>They further argue that Commerce properly determined the price quotes from Coal Week International to be improper since the data is not from a publicly available source and, contrary to the Indian Import Statistics, is only based on \u201cthe average of two spot price quotes from unidentified companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10 (quoting Decision Memorandum at Comment 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Finally, Defendant-Intervenors argue that the alleged inconsistencies regarding the source of surrogate values are merely reflective of Commerce\u2019s inadvertent mislabeling of supporting data. Although Department identified two different dates throughout the analysis memoranda,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an \u201c[examination of the coking coal value derived from the Indian Import Statistics used to calculate the final margins for each of the four respondents demonstrates . . . that the Department used a surrogate value derived from the period of April 2000 - September 2000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Defendant-Intervenors also argue that, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the April 2000 - September 2000 statistics were made part of the record in the underlying investigation. According to Defendant-Intervenors, they were referenced \u201con the record throughout the final analysis memoranda for CITIC, Shanxi Dajin, and Minmetals,\u201d and Commerce \u201cstated in the Final Determination that it had relied on similar data in other investigations, including Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Inv. No. A-570-865.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12; <em>see also </em>Decision Memorandum at Comment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On this basis, Defendant-Intervenors conclude that the court should uphold Department\u2019s use of surrogate value information on coking coal from the Indian Import Statistics from April 2000 - September 2000, as this data was sufficiently contemporaneous to the period of investigation and from a publicly available source often utilized in PRC investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Defendant admits to numerous inconsistencies in the administrative record. Nonetheless, Defendant argues that an examination into the mislabeled surrogate values demonstrates that the source of the data is for the period of April 2000 through September 2000, rather than April 1998 through May 1999. According to Defendant, \u201cthe differences in the identification of the source data in the memoranda and calculation charts is most likely attributable to clerical error.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memo at 15. Defendant argues that \u201cthe Court should remand this issue so that Commerce may reopen the administrative record, clarify clerical errors due to administrative oversight, make the Indian Import Statistics for the period April 2000 through September 2000 a matter of record, and allow for commentary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>b. The Record Evidence Does Not Provide a Reasonable Basis For Commerce\u2019s Selection of Surrogate Values</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The antidumping law provides the standard by which Commerce is to establish normal value for merchandise exported from non-market economies. Section 773(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 directs Commerce to base normal value on the non-market economy producer\u2019s factors of production. 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(4)(1999). These factors are to be valued, to the extent possible \u201cin one or more market economy countries that are: (A) at a level of development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and (B) significant producers of the comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Commerce must also value the factors of production \u201cbased on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(l). While the statute does not define \u201cbest available information\u201d, it \u201cgrants to Commerce broad discretion to determine the \u2018best available information\u2019 in a reasonable manner on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>2001 CIT 96, 166 F. Supp. 2d 608, 616 (2001).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">While accuracy is of utmost importance, 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c) fails to indicate the time periods from which surrogate values are supposed to be taken. This court, however, has repeatedly recognized that Commerce\u2019s practice is to use surrogate prices from a period contemporaneous with the period of investigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>while the standard of review precludes the court from determining whether Department\u2019s choice of surrogate values was the best available on an absolute scale, the court may determine the reasonableness of Commerce\u2019s selection of surrogate prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The surrogate value data provided within the administrative record reveals patent inconsistencies between the various documents listing surrogate prices.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These discrepancies are evident in Commerce\u2019s listings of time periods for valuating coal input, its sporadic use of value inflators to reduce inequalities between comparable markets, and its final listings of surrogate prices. The parties\u2019 discussion of their source was purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The parties seem to be in agreement that some form of clerical error occurred. While Plaintiffs and Defendant agree to a remand, Defendant-Intervenors recommend that the court speculate about what Commerce ultimately intended. That is beyond this court\u2019s perview and remand is necessary on the issue of surrogate values for coking coal produced in the PRC. Commerce must resolve its internal inconsistencies on this issue and select surrogate values that are sufficiently contemporaneous to the period of investigation and consistent with the objectives of 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">2. The Department\u2019s Finding that Foreign Producers Reported Coal Usage Amounts Subsequent to Washing is Unsupported by the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">a. Only Defendant-Intervenors Now Contends That Coal Inputs Were For Washed Coal</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s determination that the foreign producers reported coal inputs at a stage subsequent to coal washing. In the Issues and Decisions Memorandum, Commerce stated that \u201c[i]t is evident from respondents\u2019 questionnaire responses, and we further confirmed at verification, that respondents reported coking coal input quantities at the stage subsequent to coal washing.\u201d Decision Memorandum at Comment 2. Plaintiffs contend that these producers washed the coal themselves and reported all coal inputs prior to the washing stage. According to Plaintiffs, the washing process creates coal mud, which is a re-cycled input that is sometimes used in the production of coke. Plaintiffs argue that Commerce improperly determined that this re-cycled product constitutes coal inputs at a stage subsequent to the washing since there is no evidence on the record for this proposition. On this basis, Plaintiffs conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that the court should remand the Final Determination with instructions for Commerce to make an adjustment for the difference between the washed coal used by the producers and the unwashed surrogate coal prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Defendant-Intervenors, in turn, argue that Department\u2019s finding on coal usage amounts is supported by substantial evidence. They claim that Plaintiff\u2019s arguments \u201cregarding coal mud by-product does not undermine the Department\u2019s decision\u201d since other evidence on record supports the Department\u2019s conclusion. Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 13. Defendant-Intervenors point to the questionnaires submitted by Plaintiffs and argue that because coal inputs are \u201cbased on the number of beehives that are filled with coal,\u201d and \u201cthe coal in the beehives has already undergone washing,\u201d then \u201cthe coal input that the producers reported must therefore be washed coal.\u201d Id. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In addition, Defendant-Intervenors maintain that a comparison \u201cof the usage amount reported by a domestic producer of the subject merchandise in the petition to the Chinese producers\u2019 usage amounts clearly demonstrates that the Chinese producers reported coal input amounts of washed coal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Defendant-Intervenors, the coal washing process \u201cresults in losses as high as 40 to 50 percent as impurities in the coal are washed away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. As domestic producers use washed coal and both domestic and Chinese producers reportedly use similar amounts of coal per net ton of coke produced, Defendant-Intervenors argue that.\u201c[t]he similarity of these input amounts demonstrates that the Chinese producers reported the coal usage amount subsequent to washing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. On this basis, Defendant-Intervenors conclude that there is substantial evidence on the record for the court to sustain Department\u2019s determination on coal usage amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Defendant itself maintains that \u201c[u]pon further review of the record, Commerce has determined that it cannot support its finding\u201d on coal usage amounts. Defendant\u2019s Memo at 17. Defendant consequently argues that \u201ca remand is appropriate to allow Commerce to determine whether an adjustment is appropriate for Respondents\u2019 use of unwashed coal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">b. There Is No Cognizable Evidence Of Coal Inputs At Stages Subsequent To Coal Washing</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">As previously discussed, Commerce must base normal value on the non-market economy producer\u2019s factors of production. 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c). It values these factors of production \u201con the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(l). Purportedly applying that standard, Commerce determined that there was no need to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>just the coal factors to account for washing because \u201c [i] t is evident from respondents\u2019 questionnaire responses, and we further confirmed at verification, that respondents reported coking coal input quantities at the stage subsequent to coal washing.\u201d Decision Memorandum at Comment 2. The court, however, finds no discernable record evidence of coal inputs at stages subsequent to the washing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The questionnaire responses that producers submitted during the investigation demonstrate that the producers washed the coal themselves and recycled the by- product of this process as additional coal input.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This coal input is therefore neither for washed or unwashed coal, but rather for recycled inputs directly resulting from washing already reported unwashed coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Defendant-Intervenors also argue that a comparison between the practices of domestic and Chinese producers would demonstrate that the latter reported coal input amounts for washed coal. That argument was not the basis for Commerce\u2019s decision not to adjust coal input quantities. Commerce refused to adjust the inputs because it was \u201cevident from respondents\u2019 questionnaire responses . . . that respondents reported coking coal input quantities at the stage subsequent to coal washing.\u201d Decision Memorandum at Comment 2. Although Commerce is afforded considerable deference, this court will not accept Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 <em>post hoc </em>rationale as a basis for upholding a final determination. 19 U.S.C. \u00a71516a(b)(l)(B)(i)(1999). Accordingly, since respondents\u2019 questionnaire responses do not support Commerce\u2019s final determination on coal inputs, a remand is necessary so that Commerce may either make an adjustment reflecting respondents\u2019 use of unwashed coal, or provide a reasonable explanation and substantial evidence for its finding on washed coal inputs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>3. The Department\u2019s Use of Adverse Inferences Based on the Non-cooperation of Producers is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">a. Defendant Has Applied Adverse Inferences Despite A Clearly Good Faith Effort on The Part of Plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Plaintiffs argue that Commerce improperly applied adverse inferences for their failure to obtain documentation on the coke producers\u2019 shut-downs. According to Plaintiffs, \u201cDOC cannot take adverse inferences where it has asked for information, been told that it does not exist, and there is nothing on the record to contradict that absence of data.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Memo at 23. Plaintiffs maintain there was \u201cno list of closed companies... at the time of questionnaire and supplemental responses.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 7. While they \u201cmade every effort possible to provide information to DOC,\u201d they could not \u201cforce these independent companies to cooperate with [Commerce]\u201d as \u201cthe producers were independent and unrelated to the exporters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs further point out that during verification, Chinese government officials offered to provide Commerce with a list of companies that had shut down due to environmentally-objectionable equipment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but that the latter rejected this information as \u201cnew information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Plaintiffs claim Commerce improperly rejected this information because one of the purposes of verification is to \u201ccorroborate[ ], support[], or clarifiy] information already on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that Commerce\u2019s imposition of adverse facts available was unwarranted and that it should instead resort to non-adverse facts available for determining the normal values of Chinese producers who had informed Commerce of their shutdowns.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendant, in turn, argues that Commerce\u2019s decision to apply adverse facts available was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law. According to Defendant, Commerce needed \u201cusage rate information from the actual PRC producers\u201d in order to \u201caccurately calculate normal value based upon the factors of production methdology.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memo at 20. To achieve this objective, Commerce requested that Plaintiffs \u201csubmit a Section D questionnaire response from each of their suppliers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While some of the suppliers \u201cexpressed a clear lack of interest in participating in this investigation,\u201d others had simply been shut down due to environmentally related hazards. <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Defendant claims that adverse inferences were warranted in the case of non-cooperating suppliers because \u201cCommerce reasonably found that Sinochem, CITIC, and Shanxi did not act to the best of their ability in urging their suppliers to comply with Commerce\u2019s request for information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. For the other non-responsive suppliers, Defendant similarly argues that Plaintiffs did not act to the best of their ability in submitting information that would either list or identify the specific companies that had been shut down. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs were never limited to compiling a list of shut down plants, but rather could submit any documentation that would substantiate the closures. Consequently, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs had no basis for claiming that a list could not be compiled within time constraints, as any other evidence would have sufficed. On this basis, Defendant concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination on adverse facts available was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">b.

Subject to the conditions in Subsection (e), the remedy or explanation provided by the party may be disregarded in favor of facts available if the information is found to be \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d or untimely. <em>See Borden, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 1245 (\u201cSubsection (e) may require use of the respondent\u2019s information notwithstanding that a remedy or explanation is unsatisfactory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">If Commerce makes an additional finding that \u201can interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,\u201d Commerce may resort to adverse facts available under 19 USC \u00a7 1677e(b)(1999). However, a failure to respond is only a basis for facts available, as Commerce must make the additional finding that the party \u201cfailed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability\u2019 in order to draw adverse infer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>enees. 19 USC \u00a7 1677e(b); see <em>also Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG v.

A party can therefore \u201cfail to respond because it was not able to obtain the requested information, did not properly understand the question asked, or simply overlooked a particular request,\u201d without having adverse inferences drawn against it. <em>Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG, </em>77 F. Supp. 2d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Moreover, Commerce may not simply provide the conclusory statement that a party \u201chas failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability,\u201d or repeat its findings with regards to facts available, in order to draw adverse inferences against it. <em>Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG, </em>77 F.

During the investigation, Plaintiffs submitted notices from the Qingxu County government and from the Shanxi Province demonstrating that the local governments had ordered the shutdown of factories not in compliance with the environmental emission standards.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also notified Commerce that they were unable and could not force the producers to provide information substantiating their shutdowns because the producers were unrelated and independent entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Although Plaintiffs never submitted evidence specifically identifying the producers that were forced to shut down, they did submit information clearly demonstrating that massive shutdowns had been ordered by the PRC government. These producers were completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>independent from Plaintiffs and neither Defendant nor Defendant-Intervenors point to evidence in the record that would demonstrate that Plaintiffs actually were in a position to obtain such evidence. As Plaintiffs correctly state, \u201c[t]here ... is no factual challenge to the record evidence that the producers were independent and unrelated to the exporters and that the exporters in any way could force these independent companies to cooperate with DOC.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Reply Brief at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">While Commerce does state in the Final Determination that \u201cthere is no evidence on the record to determine whether the specific suppliers at issue were among those shut down by the government,\u201d Commerce fails to articulate any reason as to why it concluded Plaintiffs have failed to act to the best of their ability. Decision Memorandum at Comment 9. In other words, Commerce did not explain the basis for its conclusion that Plaintiffs\u2019 best abilities included obtaining the necessary information from the producers. To conclude that Plaintiffs somehow could have obtained this information amounts to pure speculation. As Commerce provides no reasoning, this court finds Commerce\u2019s decision to apply adverse inferences against Plaintiffs unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In regard to Plaintiff\u2019s list submission, Commerce determined it constituted \u201cnew information\u201d which was untimely submitted. Untimeliness alone, however, will not necessarily bar the admission of new information during verification. Commerce has often accepted new information when \u201c(1) the need for that information was not evident previously, (2) the information makes minor corrections to information already on the record, or (3) the information corroborates, supports, or clarifies information already on the record.\u201d <em>See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Structural Steel Beams From Luxembourg, </em>67 Fed. Reg. 35488, at Comment 1 (May 20, 2002); <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Structural Steel Beams from Germany, </em>67 Fed. Reg. 35497, at Comment 5 (May 20, 2002); <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products From India, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 50406, at Comment 4 (Oct. 3, 2001). In fact, Commerce specifically told one of the respondents in the case that new information corroborating, supporting or clarifying the record would be accepted during verification. The list offered by Plaintiffs would fulfill that precise purpose for statements on the record regarding plant shutdowns.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Consequently, this court finds Commerce\u2019s decision to reject Plaintiffs\u2019 list submission unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Accordingly, a remand is necessary so that Commerce may include Plaintiffs\u2019 list submission in the record and use non-adverse facts available for determining the normal values of non-responding producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">4. The Department\u2019s Refusal to Use Surrogate Values From Related Coal Mines is Unsupported by the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">a. Defendant-Intervenors and Plaintiffs Dispute Commerce\u2019s Use of Surrogate Values from Unrelated Companies</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Plaintiffs argue that Commerce improperly failed to include values from related coal mines in its surrogate value calculations. According to Plaintiffs, Commerce\u2019s determination not to include these values because \u201c[n]one of the mines are members of any of the respondents\u2019 group,\u201d is unsupported by the evidence. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo at 25. They argue that since the companies are related, their coal is self-produced and their costs should be calculated based on their actual inputs. To support this contention, Plaintiffs cite to 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(33)(E)(1999) which provides that an affiliated party includes \u201cany person directly or indirectly owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization and such organization.\u201d As \u201cDOC verified the related nature of the sampled coal mine and found that the producer owned [10] percent of the shares of the mine,\u201d Plaintiffs maintain that Commerce should have used actual inputs rather than surrogate values from a comparable market economy. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On this basis, Plaintiffs conclude that a remand is necessary so that Commerce may use the factors of production information from related coal mines rather than surrogate values from unrelated companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Defendant-Intervenors, in turn, argue that Commerce\u2019s use of the same methodology to determine the surrogate value for coal inputs purchased from both related and unrelated coal mines is supported by substantial evidence. They argue that, \u201c[i]n determining the normal value of subject merchandise in a nonmarket economy, the Department uses factors of production which are based on the best available information regarding the values of those factors in a market economy surrogate country.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 20; 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(l). According to Defendant-Intervenors, \u201cthe valuation of factors in a surrogate country should not be based upon circumstances peculiar to the state-controlled economy.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In addressing Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, Defendant-Intervenors argue that Plaintiffs failed to \u201cprovide a sufficient factual basis to support valuing the coal input any differently from the coal purchased from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>unaffiliated mines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. Defendant-Intervenors maintain that a 10 percent ownership interest or family interest in the coal mines is not sufficient to demonstrate that the coal is self-produced. <em>Id. </em>In addition, Defendant-Intervenors claim that Plaintiffs have also \u201cfailed to provide any legal support in their brief providing a basis for having the Department calculate separately the actual inputs for the production of coal from the related coal mines in a nonmarket economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, they maintain that there is no Department practice, nor any statutory authority, supporting Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. <em>Id. </em>at 21-23. On this basis, Defendant-Intervenors conclude that the court \u201cshould affirm the Department\u2019s use of Indian Import Statistics for the surrogate value for coal used in producing the subject merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Defendant candidly states that, upon review of the record, Commerce can no longer support its finding and consequently, \u201ca remand is appropriate to allow Commerce to fully consider the issue of whether applying a factors of production methodology to the coal produced by the purportedly related coal mines is appropriate.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memo at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">b. Commerce Failed to Provide an Adequate Explanation for its Decision to Use Surrogate Values from Unrelated Companies</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As previously discussed, section 773(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 directs Commerce to base normal value on the non-market economy producer\u2019s factors of production. 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(4). Commerce must base these surrogate values on the best available information and they must reflect the cost of producing goods \u201cin one or more market economy countries that are: (A) at a level of development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and (B) significant producers of the comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677b(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">While the statute specifically provides for factors of production, Commerce is not restricted to the exclusive use of surrogate values in comparable market economies. As this court previously noted, \u201cnothing in the [statute] or its legislative history mandates that Commerce must derive foreign market values exclusively from either actual prices paid by the nonmarket economy, or from surrogate-based values.\u201d <em>Lasko Metal Products, Inc. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 1079, 1082 (1992) (quoting <em>Tianjin Mach. Import &amp; Export Corp. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 931, 940 (1992)). Accordingly, \u201cCommerce may use evidence of prices paid by the nonmarket economy country to market-economy suppliers in combination with surrogate country information when valuing factors of production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1081 (quoting <em>Tianjin Mach. Import &amp; Export Corp., </em>16 CIT at 941). The agency has often resorted to this mix and match methodology in order to achieve greater accuracy in the calculation of dumping mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>gins.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, Commerce has similarly relied on self-produced inputs rather than surrogate values where it could value the materials, energy, and labor employed to manufacture the input. <em>See Silicomanganese From the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 31514 (May 18, 2000); <em>Certain Cut to Length Carbon Steel Plates from PRC, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 61964 (Nov. 20, 1997). These methodologies are all reflective of the statute\u2019s overriding requirement for accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In reaching its Final Determination on the issue of related coal mines, Commerce provided the following reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Based on the record facts, we do not consider that coal is a self-produced input for any of the respondents, Shanxi Dajin International (Group) Company, Minmetals Townlord Technology Co., Ltd,, and Sinochem International Company, Ltd.. None of the mines are members of any of the respondents\u2019 group. Therefore, we did not value coal using the factors of production for coal from the coal mines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Decision Memorandum at Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Commerce provides no explanation of what constitutes \u201crespondents\u2019 group,\u201d nor does it explain why membership in such a group signifies that Plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise is self-produced.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, a remand is necessary so that Commerce may properly determine whether applying a factors of production methodology to the coal produced by the related coal mines is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">5. The Department\u2019s Use of Adverse Inferences Against Sinochem is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence and Not in Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">a. The Parties are in Dispute as to the Correct Interpretation of the Scope Language</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Plaintiffs argue that Commerce incorrectly interpreted the scope of the investigation, and accordingly that the agency\u2019s resort to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>verse facts available is unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law. The petition limits the scope of the investigation to \u201ccoke larger than 100 mm (4 inches) in maximum diameter and at least 50 percent of which is retained on a 100 mm (4-inch) sieve, of a kind used in foundries.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo at 11. Plaintiffs maintain that the correct interpretation is that a shipment is subject to the order only if 50% or more of the sale contains coke that is larger than 100 mm in diameter. As the Sinochem shipment under review had only 11.50 percent of coke over 100mm, Plaintiffs argue that it was not subject to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Plaintiffs further claim that \u201cadverse inferences against Sinochem [are] unjustified because the product that Sinochem did not report was not subject merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Plaintiffs point out that in its Preliminary Determination, the ITC determined that industrial coke fell outside of the scope of this case due to its smaller size. Accordingly, Plaintiffs conclude that Sinochem\u2019s undersized coke is not within the order since it properly constitutes industrial coke rather than foundry coke.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that this court should remand the Final Determination so that Commerce may recalculate the dumping margins of Sinochem after removing adverse inferences that were drawn against that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Defendant, in turn, argues that the correct interpretation of the scope of the investigation is whether 50% or more of the portion of the shipment sold as being over 100mm is retained on a 100 mm sieve. According to Defendants, \u201cthe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d) lends guidance\u201d in interpreting the language of this investigation. Defendant\u2019s Memo at 25. Under the 2000 version of the HTSUS subheading 2704.00.00.10, foundry coke is defined as \u201clarger than 100 mm (4 inches) in maximum diameter and at least 50 percent of which is retained on a 100 mm (4-inch) sieve after drop shatter testing pursuant to ASTM D 3038.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. Defendants argue that \u201cso long as fifty percent of the coke, sold over 100 mm, passes the drop shatter testing (i.e. is retained on a 100mm sieve), it is within the scope of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. Accordingly, they conclude Commerce \u201cproperly determined that the portion of [Sinochem\u2019s] sale that was made up of coke over 100 mm was within the scope of the antidumping investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Defendant points out that \u201c[a]\u00a1though Commerce did apply adverse facts available to this sale in the Preliminary Determination, . . . for the Final Determination, Commerce collected information on this sale at verification, and actually performed a \u2018margin analysis\u2019 on the portion of the sale that was sold as being over 100mm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24; Decision Memorandum at Comment 12. Consequently, Defendant argues that the issue is not whether Commerce properly resorted to adverse facts available but whether Commerce correctly interpreted the scope of the investigation and order. On this basis, they conclude that Commerce\u2019s determination that the portion of Sinochem\u2019s sale over 100 mm was within the scope of the investigation is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Finally, in addressing Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Sinochem\u2019s merchandise is industrial coke rather than foundry coke, Defendant-Intervenors add that \u201cthere is no basis for Sinochem to assume that its labeling of subject merchandise as \u2018industrial coke\u2019 necessarily avoids application of the order: the ITC determination excluded \u2018industrial coke\u2019 from its like product finding because it defined \u2018industrial coke\u2019 as coke less than 100 mm in maximum diameter.\u201d Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Brief at 28. Defendant-Intervenors therefore conclude that \u201c[t]he ITC\u2019s like product determination did not in any way limit the applicability of the order to merchandise within the scope, i.e., coke of 100 mm or greater in maximum outside diameter and fifty percent of which is retained on a 100-mm sieve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">b. Commerce\u2019s Interpretation of the Scope Language Conflicts With its Application</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The petition filed by the domestic industry limits the scope of the investigation to \u201ccoke larger than 100 mm (4 inches) in maximum diameter and at least 50 percent of which is retained on a 100-mm (4-inch) sieve, of a kind used in foundries.\u201d A.R. (Public) Doc. No. 1, Petition at 3. This language is consistently used throughout the proceedings and forms the basis for Commerce\u2019s Final Determination. <em>See </em>Final Determination, 66 Fed. Reg. at 39489. It is also further defined by reference to several headings within the HTSUS, namely subheading 2704.00.00.10 (as of Jan. 1, 2000) and subheading 2704.00.00.11 (as of July 1, 2001). <em>Id. </em>While these subheadings are cited as a reference, the Final Determination specifically provides that \u201c[a]\u00a1though the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In its Decision Memorandum, Commerce determined that Sinochem had misread the scope language and that its shipment of foundry coke straddling the scope size definition included merchandise that fell squarely within the proceedings. Commerce also provided an interpretation of the scope language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">[T]he first condition of the scope is that the scope applies to coke \u201clarger than 100mm,\u201d the second being \u201cand at least fifty percent of which is retained on a 100-mm sieve.\u201d By including the modifier \u201cof which\u201d immediately after the fifty percent threshold, and with both statements following the initial condition of 100mm, the most reasonable understanding is that the test is to determine whether fifty percent or more of the coke sold as being larger than 100mm is retained on the 100mm sieve. The result of this conclusion is that the respondents\u2019 application of the fifty percent threshold to the entire volume of the portion of the sale straddling the scope is inapposite; the test should only be applied to coke above 100mm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Decision Memorandum at Comment 12. Based on this analysis, Commerce concluded that each sale \u201cis best conceived as being in effect two sales, one for merchandise within the scope and one outside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Commerce performed a \u201cmargin analysis\u201d on the portion of Sinochem\u2019s straddling shipment that exceeded the 100mm scope limit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">This result, however, is wholly inconsistent with Commerce\u2019s treatment of Sinochem\u2019s other shipments, as well as the shipments of other respondents involved in the proceedings. Commerce\u2019s articulation of the scope language in the Final Determination essentially leads to the conclusion that where a shipment contains a percentage of merchandise below 100mm, the shipment in its entirety could never be considered as falling within the scope. Similarly, where a shipment is labeled as containing only merchandise over 100mm, but testing reveals that less than 100% of the merchandise is over 100mm, Commerce would also be unable to include the entire shipment as within scope. As plaintiff correctly argues, however, Commerce repeatedly resorted to a \u201cbright line test\u201d whereby an entire shipment is considered within scope if more than 50% of the sale is above 100mm, and outside of scope if less than 50% is below 100mm. Plaintiff\u2019s Reply Brief at 10. For instance, Commerce included as within scope one hundred percent of Sinochem\u2019s 100-300 mm ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ment containing 88.13 percent of merchandise over 100 mm.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under the standards articulated in the Decision Memorandum, Commerce could only include up to 88.13 percent of that shipment as within scope since the test would allegedly only be applicable to merchandise over 100 mm. Under a \u201cbright line\u201d interpretation, however, Commerce could properly include one hundred percent of the merchandise because over fifty percent of it was over 100mm. Its decision to perform a \u201cmargin analysis\u201d on the portion of Sinochem\u2019s straddling shipment containing 11.50 percent of coke over 100mm is consequently in direct contradiction with its prior application of the scope of the investigation, i.e. the \u201cbright line test.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Commerce provides no reasoning for its contradictory interpretation of the scope language, so a remand is necessary for it to either provide such a reasoning or resort to its previous interpretation of the language consistent with its prior practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">V.
