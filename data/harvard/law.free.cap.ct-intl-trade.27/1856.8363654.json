No Discernible Adverse Impact</p>\n<p id=\"b1877-4\">In determining whether imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry, the ITC, as this Court has explained, engages in a dual inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1877-5\">[A]n affirmative finding of discernible impact is only part of the answer to the question of whether cumulation is precluded. In other words, the first question is whether the imports [from a particular country] are likely to have any [discernible] impact. If not, the ITC is precluded from cumulating. If yes, then the question remains whether that impact is also adverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1877-6\"><em>Neenah Foundry Co., </em>25 CIT at_, 155 F. Supp. 2d at 775; <em>Chefline Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT_,_, 170 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1331 (2001) (quoting <em>Neenah Foundry, </em>25 CIT at_, 155 F. Supp. 2d at 775). The likely \u201cdiscernible impact\u201d determination is not limited to an analysis of volume, as evidenced by Congress\u2019s use of the word \u201cimpact\u201d in the statute, which, \u201cin the context of U.S. unfair trade law, by any definition, encompasses more than volume of imports.\u201d <em>Neenah Foundry Co., </em>25 CIT at_, 155 F. Supp. 2d at 776. That the discernible impact also must be adverse requires that the imports cause some harm. For cumulation to be warranted, however, this harm need not rise to the level of \u201cmaterial injury.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1877-12\">The ITC stated its discernible adverse impact determination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1877-13\">Because of the conditions of competition and the current condition of the domestic industry,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> exports from Italy and Japan<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1862\">*1862</page-number>likely would have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1878-4\">Subject imports from Italy and Japan have remained in the U.S. market in the years since the orders were imposed, albeit at substantially reduced levels. The continuing presence of these subject imports in the domestic market indicates that subject foreign producers continue to have contacts and channels of distribution necessary to compete in the U.S. market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1878-5\">Industry capacity in Japan has remained large (greater than annual U.S. consumption) and industry capacity in Italy has grown since the original investigations. The GOES industries in both Italy and Japan devote considerable resources to export markets. In 1999, the share of total shipments of GOES exported from Italy was [[ ]] percent while the share of total shipments of GOES exported from Japan was [[ ]] percent. For the reasons discussed below,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we believe that subject imports from each country would enter the U.S. market <em>in sufficient quantities and at sufficiently low prices </em>such that they would have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1878-8\">Final Determination at 9 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs take issue with the ITC\u2019s findings as to the Japanese and Italian imports\u2019 \u201ccontinuing presence\u201d in the U.S. market, the size of GOES industry capacity in Japan and Italy, and the Japanese and Italian GOES industries\u2019 export orientation. They argue that \u201c[none] of these findings ... is sufficient to show that GOES imports from Italy and Japan <em>likely </em>would have any discernible impact \u2014 let alone a discernible <em>adverse </em>impact \u2014 upon the domestic industry.\u201d Pis.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1863\">*1863</page-number>Mem. Supp. Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cPis.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 15 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1879-4\">First, Plaintiffs argue that \u201crecord evidence does not, in fact, show that the subject producers have had such a \u2018continuing presence\u2019 [in the U.S. market] that they \u2018continue to have contacts and channels of distribution necessary to compete in the U.S. market.\u2019 \u201d Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 15 (quoting Final Determination at 9). With respect to Japan, Plaintiffs argue that the record shows that Nippon and Kawasaki exported little or no GOES to the United States between 1997 and 2000 (the \u201cReview Period\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>With respect to Italy, Plaintiffs contend that the record shows that \u201cItalian producer AST had very few sales in the U.S. over the period of investigation,\u201d i.e., \u201cless than 85 tons of Italian imports over a 45-month period, with no sales during the first nine months of 2000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Staff Report, tbl. 1-4). Second, Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s findings that Japanese GOES industry capacity is \u201clarge\u201d and that Italian GOES industry capacity \u201chas grown,\u201d without more, do not support the finding that Japanese and Italian subject imports would likely cause a discernible adverse impact. <em>Id. </em>at 16. According to Plaintiffs, the evidence shows that the Japanese and Italian producers \u201care operating at or near full capacity and will be for the foreseeable future. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. Third, Plaintiffs contend that the ITC\u2019s finding that the Japanese and Italian GOES industries are export-oriented \u201cis not predictive of what the size, make-up or impact of their U.S. exports <em>likely </em>would be if the orders were revoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1879-5\">The ITC responds to each of these arguments in turn. First, the ITC contends that, with respect to \u201ccontinuing presence,\u201d \u201c[i]t is not the amount of sales but the continuation of sales that is of relevance.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. Opp\u2019n Pis.\u2019 Mot. Summ. J. Agency R. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mem.\u201d) at 18. The ITC explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1879-6\">The continued sales indicate subject producers did not altogether abandon the U.S. market but continued to maintain ties with U.S. customers after the orders were imposed. As such, subject producers had maintained the commercial links which would allow them to increase imports to the U.S. market with relative ease if the orders were lifted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1879-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 18-19. Second, the ITC contends that the size of GOES industry capacity in Japan and Italy must be viewed against the backdrop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1864\">*1864</page-number>of the prevailing conditions of competition in the industry. The ITC highlights that \u201cGOES steel production is relatively capital intensive\u201d and requires manufacturers to \u201csustain relatively high capacity utilization rates to stay profitable.\u201d M at 19. Therefore, the ITC posits, \u201cincreases of the volume of subject imports from each country would be likely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, the ITC argues that the Japanese and Italian GOES industries\u2019 export orientation must also be evaluated in the context of the conditions of competition. The ITC claims that where an industry such as the GOES industry is reliant on exports to maintain its capacity utilization rates, there exists \u201ceconomic incentive for subject producers to increase levels of subject imports to the higher-priced U.S. market<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> upon revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. The ITC argues that its finding \u201cthat subject imports from Japan and Italy would likely increase and be sold at price depressing levels resulting in a discernible adverse impact. . . are both reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1880-4\">The court does not agree that substantial evidence supports the ITC\u2019s finding that GOES imports from Japan and GOES imports from Italy would likely have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry upon revocation of the Subject Orders. The court shall examine the record evidence with respect to Japan and Italy separately, to determine whether it supports the ITC\u2019s determinations \u2014 i.e., whether \u201ca reasonable mind might accept [the evidence] as adequate to support [the ITC\u2019s] conclusion[s].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Consol. Edison Co., </em>305 U.S. at 229. In conducting its review, however, the court \u201ccannot evaluate the substantiality of evidence supporting an ITC determination \u2018merely on the basis of evidence which in and of itself justified it, without taking into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 978, 985 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 487 (1951)). Rather, to determine the substantiality of the evidence, the court must also take into account \u201cwhatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 488; <em>Suramerica, 44 </em>F.3d at 985 (citing <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1880-5\">With respect to the Japanese GOES imports\u2019 \u201ccontinuing presence\u201d in the U.S. market, the evidence reveals that Japanese GOES was, in fact, sold in the United States during the Review Period, \u201calbeit at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1865\">*1865</page-number>substantially reduced levels.\u201d Final Determination at 9. Indeed, the evidence cited by Plaintiffs shows the reduced levels of Japanese imports after imposition of the Subject Orders. <em>See supra </em>n.19. This evidence supports the ITC\u2019s finding that Japanese producers have maintained commercial contacts with U.S. customers such that the subject imports have a \u201ccontinuing presence\u201d in the U.S. market. Second, with respect to the size of GOES industry capacity in Japan, the record reasonably supports the finding that industry capacity was \u201clarge,\u201d compared to annual U.S. consumption, during the Review Period. <em>Compare </em>Staff Report, tbl. 1-1 (annual U.S. consumption figures) <em>with </em>tbl. IV-6 (annual Japanese production capacity). Third, the record supports the ITC\u2019s finding that the Japanese producers are export-oriented. <em>See id. </em>at 11-22 (\u201cThe two Japanese producers\u2019 exports of GOES to third-country markets, as a share of. . . their total GOES shipments, averaged [[ ]] by quantity during [the Review] [P]eriod. . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1881-5\">There is, however, evidence that fairly detracts from the ITC\u2019s finding that the Japanese GOES imports would likely have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry, and this evidence must be accounted for on remand. First, the most recent data with respect to capacity utilization suggests that, because the Japanese producers are operating at high capacity utilization rates, increases in volume are not at all likely. Staff Report at 11-21 (stating \u201cthe currently high level of capacity utilization suggests <em>no ability </em>of the Japanese producers to increase GOES exports to the United States in response to an increase in demand.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Usinor, </em>slip op. 02-70 at 24-25 (finding, <em>inter alia, </em>ITC\u2019s failure to address most recent capacity utilization data rendered decision to cumulate German imports unsupported by substantial evidence).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Second, according to the Staff Report, [[ ]], i.e., their European, Asian, Mexican and Canadian customers, reduce the likelihood that these producers would be able to significantly increase their imports to the United States in a reasonably foreseeable time.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Staff Report at 11-22. Specifically, the ITC staff concluded that the existence of such contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1866\">*1866</page-number>indicated that exports \u201cmay not be readily available in the short run to increase GOES shipments to the United States in response to an increase in GOES demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-23. Third, the ability to expand capacity was found to be limited, and the ITC itself concluded on remand that \u201csubject producers indicate [d] that they have no plans to increase capacity within the foreseeable future.\u201d Remand Determination at 9. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1882-4\">With respect to Italy, the record supports the ITC\u2019s finding that the Italian imports have maintained a continuing, although minimal, presence in the U.S. market. Staff Report at 11-19 (indicating that exports of GOES from Italy to the United States during the Review Period accounted for [[ ]] by quantity of total Italian shipments). The record also supports the ITC\u2019s finding that industry capacity in Italy has grown since the original investigation. Id., tbl. IV-2. Further, the court agrees that the record substantially supports the finding that AST is export-oriented. The evidence indicates that during the Review Period, \u201c[e]xports of GOES to third-country markets as a share of total shipment quantities averaged [[ ]] . . . <em>\u25a0\u201d Id. </em>at II-19-II-20 &amp; tbl. IV-2. The share of the total quantity of shipments shipped in the home market during the Review Period was [[ ]]. <em>See id., </em>tbl.

First, AST\u2019s capacity utilization rate during the most recent period remained high, and according to the Staff Report, this \u201csuggests that there is <em>little ability </em>of AST to increase exports to the United States in response to an increase in demand.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Staff Report at 11-19 (emphasis added). Second, evidence on the record suggests that the Italian producer would not likely increase its GOES production capacity due to the high costs and length of time required to do so. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as with Japan, the ITC found on remand that the Italian producer \u201cindicate [d] that [it has] no plans to increase capacity within the foreseeable future. . . .\u201d Remand Determination at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1882-8\">While substantial evidence is \u201csomething less than the weight of the evidence,\u201d the court is not convinced that the ITC has sufficiently supported its discernible adverse impact findings and thus must remand the matter. <em>Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620; <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v.

The court is mindful that \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence\u201d; however, the ITC must explain its findings and support them with substantial evidence in the first instance. <em>Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620. Here, the evidence must support a conclusion of \u201clikely\u201d consistent with the court\u2019s earlier ruling on this issue, i.e., that likely means probable. In light of the evidence of record that detracts from the ITC\u2019s findings with respect to the likely discernible adverse impact of Japanese GOES imports and the likely discernible adverse impact of Italian GOES imports, the court cannot find that substantial evidence supports these determinations. <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 488; <em>Suramerica, </em>44 F.3d at 985.

In addition, as discussed <em>supra </em>in footnote 18, the ITC shall state with specificity which of its findings with respect to likely volume, price effects, and impact it took into consideration in arriving at its discernible adverse impact determination, including specific citation to any documents taken into consideration, and explain clearly its reasons for relying on such document and its analysis in arriving at its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1883-6\">B. Likely Reasonable Overlap of Competition Between Imports from Japan and Imports from Italy</p>\n<p id=\"b1883-7\">Cumulative assessment of imports, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7), involves not only a determination of whether GOES imports from Japan and GOES imports from Italy would each likely have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry, but also an examination of whether \u201csuch imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1883-8\">The question the ITC is required to ask, when deciding whether to cumulate imports from different countries in the context of a sunset review, is whether a reasonable overlap in competition between the subject imports, and between subject imports and the domestic like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1868\">*1868</page-number>product, likely would exist if the orders under review were revoked. <em>See Wieland Werke, AG v. United States, </em>13 CIT 561, 563, 718 F. Supp. 50, 52 (1989); <em>Indorama Chems. (Thail.) v. United States Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>26 CIT_,_, slip op. 02 \u2014 105 at 17 (Sept. 4, 2002). In making this determination, the ITC has generally considered (1) the degree of fungibility between imports from different countries and between those imports and the domestic like product, (2) the presence of sales or offers to sell imports from different countries and the domestic like product in the same geographical markets, (3) the existence of common or similar channels of distribution for imports from different countries and the domestic like product, and (4) simultaneous presence in the market. <em>See </em>Final Determination at 8 n.34 (citing <em>Wieland Werke, </em>13 CIT at 563, 718 F.

As the decision to cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports from different countries is made prospectively, in the context of a sunset review determination, the ITC also considers \u201cother significant conditions of competition that are likely to prevail if the orders under review are revoked.\u201d Final Determination at 8; <em>see also Usinor Industeel, S.A., </em>26 CIT at_, slip op. 02-152 at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1884-8\">Here, Plaintiffs challenge the ITC\u2019s finding that \u201cthere likely would be a reasonable overlap of competition . . . between the subject imports [from Japan and Italy] ... if the orders are revoked.\u201d Final Determination at 10. In its review, the ITC examined the four factors set forth in <em>Wieland Werke. </em>First, the ITC considered the degree of fungibility between imports from Japan and imports from Italy. The ITC recalled its findings in the original investigation leading to its conclusion that a reasonable overlap of competition between imports did not exist. The ITC originally found that \u201call imported Italian GOES was conventional, and all but a very small percentage was M-6 grade. By contrast, . . . most Japanese GOES was high-permeability steel, with some conventional, primarily M-3 grade, GOES.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. This finding was important to the ITC\u2019s finding of a lack of competition between the imports in its original investigation \u201cbecause purchasers often substituted only one grade up or one grade down, and. . . very few purchasers bought both the Italian and Japanese product.\u201d Id. Second, with respect to channels of distribution, the ITC noted that it had originally found that \u201cJapanese GOES was sold directly to transformer manufacturers, whereas Italian GOES was sold to stampers who laminated the product and then sold it to makers of small transformers or appliances.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1884-9\">Noting that the \u201cdifferences in product type and channels of distribution between recent subject imports have not changed since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1869\">*1869</page-number>original determination,\u201d for purposes of the sunset review,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the ITC nonetheless \u201c[did] not find them significant enough to prevent [it] from concluding that there [was] likely to be a reasonable overlap of competition\u201d between Japanese and Italian imports of GOES. Final Determination at 9-10. The ITC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1885-4\">In a five-year review, the proper focus is on the likely post-revocation behavior, and the composition of current imports, affected by the discipline of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, is not necessarily indicative of likely post-revocation competition. While current imports may be specialized or limited to a particular grade, subject producers in both Italy and Japan <em>can and do produce a broad range of GOES products. </em>Over [[ ]] of its shipments to both Canada and Mexico were of conventional GOES in 2000. For example, while Japan sells primarily high permeability GOES to the U.S. market, it also sells significant amounts of conventional GOES grades to other markets. Similarly, while Japanese producers currently sell directly primarily to end-users in the United States, <em>this pattern of sales is likely to change with an alteration in the product mix shipped to the United States. </em>Indeed, Japanese subject producers sell to laminators/slitters for subsequent sale of the GOES in Mexico and presumably could do so in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1885-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Thus, the ITC reversed its position from the original investigation, and concluded that a likely overlap of competition would exist between imports from Japan and Italy if the Subject Orders were revoked.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1885-7\">1. Fungibility</p>\n<p id=\"b1885-8\">Plaintiffs argue that it is unlikely that the Japanese and Italian producers will sell similar products in the U.S. market. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Japanese producers do not make the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1870\">*1870</page-number>conventional GOES used in the United States \u2014 a thin gauge GOES for use in wound core transformers \u2014 and that the record indicates that the Japanese producers do not intend to start exporting conventional GOES to the United States. Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 11-12. Rather, Plaintiffs contend that the Japanese producers \u201conly sought to have the subject orders removed so as to better serve their existing customers for <em>high-end, high-permeability GOES.\u201d Id. </em>at 12 (emphasis in original) (citing ITC Hearing Tr.

Plaintiffs contend that at all times, GOES imported from Italy was conventional, and while AST is capable of producing high permeability GOES, the record suggests that it would not export high permeability GOES to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>AST\u2019s Posthearing Br., List 1, Doc. 60, List 2, Doc. 29 at A-1 (\u201cAST has not shipped high-permeability GOES to Mexico or Canada, even though it had the ability to do so. . . . AST has not sold high-permeability GOES outside of Europe.\u201d). Plaintiffs assert that merely because \u201cAST theoretically may be capable of changing its product mix and competing against Nippon Steel and Kawasaki for high-permeability sales in the United States (or vice-versa), [this,] without more, is an insufficient basis upon which to deem such competition likely.\u201d Id. at 14 (citing <em>Chefline Corp., </em>26 CIT at_, 170 F. Supp. 2d at 1333). In sum, Plaintiffs argue that, the fact that both Japanese and Italian GOES producers \u201ccan and do produce a broad range of GOES products,\u201d Final Determination at 10, \u201csays very little . . . about what these producers either <em>intend to do or </em>actually <em>could </em>do with respect to sales in the U.S. market if the orders were lifted.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Mem. at 10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1886-6\">The ITC contends that its fungibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, arguing that \u201csubject producers would likely produce similar types of GOES for sale in the U.S. market,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 23, and that the conditions of competition make it likely that \u201cItalian and Japanese producers will. . . ship both high-permeability and conventional GOES to satisfy U.S. demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The ITC further argues that competition between conventional and high permeability GOES will grow. According to the ITC, GOES purchasers will increase their \u201cuse of lower, less efficient, and less costly grades of GOES in transformer manufacture\u201d as a result of the deregulation of the electric utilities in the United States. Final Determination at 14. In addition, \u201c[Relative decreases in prices of higher-grade GOES would likely result in a purchaser switching to a better grade in order to produce a low-efficiency transformer, as core performance could be significantly enhanced, thus heightening competition between high-permeability and conventional GOES.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1871\">*1871</page-number>In evaluating the substantiality of the record evidence, the court looks at the record as a whole, taking into account any evidence that fairly detracts from its weight. <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 488; <em>Suramerica, </em>44 F.3d at 985 (citing Atl. <em>Sugar, Ltd., </em>744 F.2d at 1562).

Specifically, the following evidence detracts from such a finding. First, according to questionnaire responses submitted by the Japanese producers with respect to demand factors, the type of conventional GOES they export to third country markets is a thicker gauge than the GOES favored by U.S. purchasers, and \u201cnot compatible with the [conventional GOES] used in the United States.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 11; Japanese Producers\u2019 Prehearing Br., List 1, Doc. 50, List 2, Doc. 14 at 32; [[ ]] Foreign Producer Questionnaire Resp., List 2, Doc. 59 at 44 (indicating [[ ]]).

With respect to Japan, it is clear that prior to the imposition of the Subject Orders, the Japanese producers exported high permeability GOES and \u201csome conventional, primarily M-3 grade, GOES.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. It is also clear that after the imposition of the Subject Orders, the Japanese producers exported almost exclusively high permeability GOES to the United States. <em>Id. </em>With respect to Italy, imports consisted entirely of conventional (M-6 grade) GOES both before and after the imposition of the Subject Orders. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1888-4\">While the ITC indicates that it took pre-order sales of conventional GOES into consideration, it is unclear how these past sales of \u201csome conventional, primarily M-3 grade, GOES\u201d favor a finding that Japanese and Italian conventional GOES would export a fungible product to the United States. Final Determination at 9. One of the conditions of competition found to exist was an increase in the \u201cuse of lower, less efficient, and less costly grades of GOES in transformer manufacture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. However, the ITC made no finding as to whether the Japanese producers would likely produce and sell M-3 grade conventional GOES, or another grade of conventional GOES, for export to the United States. Plaintiffs argue that the Japanese producers do not make the type of conventional GOES used in the United States, and that it is the Japanese producers\u2019 intention to \u201csell small quantities of high-permeability products, particularly domain refined, that are not available from the U.S. industry.\u201d Tr. at 159; Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 12.

Without more, the ITC has merely shown that it is now possible for AST to export high permeability GOES to the United States, which, of course, is insufficient to satisfy the likely standard. <em>Nippon III, </em>26 CIT at_, slip op. 02-153 at 16.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1889-7\">Even considering the prospective nature of a sunset review and the difficulty with which the ITC is faced in gathering concrete evidence of likely future events, the court is not convinced, in light of the detracting evidence, that the ITC has substantially supported, and adequately explained, its determination that the Japanese and Italian producers will likely sell a fungible GOES product in the United States. On remand, the ITC shall explain in detail why it is probable that the Japanese producers will export a type of conventional GOES, M-3 grade or otherwise, that would likely compete with Italian conventional GOES, taking into account the following: (a) evidence that the type of conventional GOES produced by the Japanese producers for export to third country markets is different in thickness than the GOES favored by U.S. purchasers, and (b) evidence that the Japanese producers intend to \u201csell small quantities of high-permeability products, particularly domain refined, that are not available from the U.S. industry.\u201d Tr. at 159. In addition, the ITC shall explain in detail how it is probable that the Italian producer will export high permeability GOES such that it would likely compete with Japanese high permeability GOES. The ITC shall address its evidence in the context of an explanation as to whether it is likely, not merely possible, that the subject producers will change their respective product mixes such that Japanese GOES and Italian GOES will likely compete in the U.S. market. <em>Nippon III, </em>26 CIT at_, slip op. 02-153 at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1874\">*1874</page-number>2. Channels of Distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b1890-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s channels of distribution finding is flawed because it is based on unsupported assumptions. Plaintiffs contend that the ITC incorrectly (1) assumed that Japanese producers \u201care <em>likely </em>to alter their U.S. product mix if the subject orders are revoked,\u201d in order to sell conventional GOES to the United States and (2) assumed \u201cthat the Japanese producers\u2019 distribution patterns would change, such that the Japanese and Italian producers would both sell to laminators/distributors.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 13, 12. Plaintiffs argue the record supports neither of these assumptions and contends that the ITC\u2019s findings are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1890-5\">devoid of any analysis or record support as to <em>why </em>... a change in the Japanese producers\u2019 product mix would cause them to sell more GOES through laminators/slitters, or why such a change would increase competition with Italian imports. Rather, the ITC\u2019s findings rest simply on <em>speculation </em>that the Japanese producers would carry over their Mexican sales practices to the United States \u2014 a fact that the Commission itself seems to recognize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1890-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 13 (emphasis in original) (citing Final Determination at 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1890-7\">The ITC argues in favor of the conclusion that the Japanese producers\u2019 pattern of sales (to end users) and thus, channels of distribution, is likely to change with an alteration in the product mix shipped to the United States. As the ITC stated in the Final Determination, \u201cJapanese subject producers sell to laminators/slitters for subsequent sale of the GOES in Mexico and presumably could do so in the United States.\u201d Final Determination at 10. In support of this conclusion, the ITC argues that \u201cthe record shows that both Japanese and Italian subject producers sell to laminators/slitters in Mexico.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 28. The ITC stresses that \u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019] sales practices (selling GOES to laminators/slitters) in Mexico hinge] ] on what type of GOES is sold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. The ITC concludes that \u201c[g]iven that Japanese subject producers would likely sell appreciable quantities of conventional GOES in the United States,\u201d due to, <em>inter alia, </em>the increase in U.S. demand for conventional grades of GOES, \u201cit would be likely that Japanese subject producers would sell to end users <em>and </em>laminators/slitters in the United States as <em>well.\u201d Id. </em>at 28 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1890-8\">The court finds that the ITC\u2019s conclusion that Japanese and Italian producers are likely to sell in the same or similar channels of distribution is unsupported by substantial evidence. Here, the ITC determined that the Japanese producers would \u201cpresumably\u201d start to sell to laminators/slitters in the United States based on an anticipated change in the product mix sold by the Japanese producers in the United States, i.e., \u201cthat Japanese subject producers would likely sell appreciable quantities of conventional GOES in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1875\">*1875</page-number>States. . . Def.\u2019s Mem. at 28. However, as discussed above, the ITC has not demonstrated that such a change in product mix sold in the United States would be likely. The ITC\u2019s finding that the Japanese producers would sell conventional GOES in the United States, such that Japanese and Italian GOES would likely compete, is unsupported by substantial evidence. Therefore, the basis on which the ITC\u2019s determination with respect to channels of distribution rests is questionable. Moreover, while it may not be logistically impossible, concluding that the Japanese producers \u201cpresumably\u201d could sell conventional GOES to laminators/slitters in the United States because it has been doing so in Mexico and Canada is not enough to satisfy the likely standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1891-4\">While the ITC has discretion in the area of cumulation, it must nonetheless support its decisions with substantial evidence. It has not done so here. On this second remand, the ITC shall, taking into account its finding on remand with respect to fungibility, revisit its finding that the Japanese and Italian producers of GOES will change their patterns of sale, such that \u201ccommon or similar channels of distribution\u201d for imports from Japan and Italy exist, and an overlap of competition between Japanese and Italian GOES imports would be likely. <em>Wieland Werke, </em>13 CIT at 563, 718 F.

These other factors include: (1) the nature of supply and demand in the GOES industry, (2) the export orientation of the subject producers, (3) the range of GOES products offered by Japanese and Italian producers, (4) pricing practices in the United States and other countries during the original and the review periods of investigation (including the incentive of higher prices in the U.S. market as compared with other markets), and (5) patterns of shipments to other markets into which the subject imports are sold. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1893-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the record does not support the ITC\u2019s conclusion that likely volume would be significant in terms of U.S. production and consumption.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> To the contrary, Plaintiffs maintain that \u201cthe facts, information and data concerning each of [the four factors set out in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2)] provide substantial evidence that the volume of subject imports likely would <em>not </em>be \u2018significant\u2019. . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1878\">*1878</page-number>Pis.\u2019 Comments at 7 (emphasis in original); Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 23-25.

The ITC further argues that, given the nature of the GOES industry, it properly found that the lack of inventories, the absence of barriers to entry of the subject merchandise into third country markets, and the limited potential for the Japanese and Italian producers to product shift, were \u201cnot dispositive or indeed particularly meaningful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1895-4\">As to the finding that the Japanese and Italian GOES producers had \u201csignificant production capacity,\u201d the ITC argues that \u201cthat the aggregate capacity for both countries was [[ ]] of total U.S. consumption and U.S. production capacity of GOES for [1999].\u201d Def.\u2019s Comments at 5; <em>see </em>Conf.

With respect to other evidence that Plaintiffs argue shows that subject import volume would likely not be significant, i.e., that the demand for GOES among the subject producers\u2019 existing customers was projected to grow rapidly, the ITC contends that \u201cthe ITC did not ignore this evidence but came to a different conclusion than did plaintiffs.\u201d Def.\u2019s Comments at 7. Specifically, the ITC found that shipments to other markets have been \u201cerratic\u201d and that GOES sells at higher prices in the U.S. market than in other markets. <em>Id. </em>The ITC claims that this led to its conclusion that \u201cdespite increased demand in subject producers\u2019 other export markets, the U.S. market would be a far more attractive market for subject producers seeking the highest price for their product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In defense of its finding that GOES commands a higher price in the United States than in third country markets, the ITC insists that \u201cthe record contains numerous examples that subject producers\u2019 prices for the various grades of the subject product sold in Canada and Mexico are below current domestic prices for competing grades.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (citing Petitioners\u2019 Prehearing Br., List 2, Doc. 16, Ex. 1 at 64-66; Remand Determination at 6 n.24).</p>\n<p id=\"b1895-7\">The court finds that the ITC has complied with the instruction in <em>Nippon III </em>to \u201cdemonstrate ... (a) that it. . . consider[ed] each of the four factors outlined in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2)(A)-(D); and (b) that it considered whether, were the Subject Orders revoked, the likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1880\">*1880</page-number>volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1675a(a)(2).\u201d Nippon III, </em>26 CIT at_, slip op. 02-153 at 16. It is evident in the Remand Determination that the ITC considered the factors enumerated in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2)(A)-(D) and explained why it considered each factor relevant or not. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 3 &amp; nn.22, 54, 55. Furthermore, the ITC considered the significance of likely volume if the Subject Orders were revoked relative to U.S. production and consumption. <em>See, e.g., </em>Conf. Remand Determination at 10, 11 (\u201cIn 1999, the last full year for which data were available, the total capacity for both countries was [[ ]] total U.S. consumption and U.S. production of GOES for the same period.\u201d With respect to unused capacity, the ITC found that \u201c[i]n 1999, subject producers . . . had [[ ]] short tons of unused capacity, which was equivalent to [[ ]] percent of U.S. production and [[ ]] percent of U.S. apparent consumption for the same year.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1896-9\">The court notes the following with respect to whether substantial evidence supports the ITC\u2019s finding that GOES prices in the U.S. market are higher, and therefore would likely attract imports. Affidavits submitted by petitioners reveal that the prices at which GOES was sold in the United States are higher than the prices at which it was sold in third country markets. <em>See </em>Petitioners\u2019 Prehearing Br., List 2, Doc. 16, Exs. 11 (Aff. of Robert D. Ross) &amp; 12 (Aff. of Robert I. Psyck). With respect to Japan, this evidence indicates that the purchase price for Japanese GOES was lower than comparable products sold in third country markets. <em>See id., </em>Ex. 12 at 2 ([[ ]]). With respect to Italy, the evidence supports a finding that Italian GOES was purchased at a lower price in third country markets than in the U.S. market. <em>Id., </em>Ex. 11 at 1-2 (\u201c[T]he actual purchase price for AST\u2019s M-6 slit product delivered to [Canada] [was] at [[ ]].... The typical domestic price of Allegheny Ludlum\u2019s M-6 product is [[ ]]. Allegheny Ludlum\u2019s cost to produce M-6 product is [[ ]] Thus, AST is selling its M-6 product at a price [in Canada] that is [[ ]] our cost to produce.\u201d). This evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that GOES commands a higher price in the U.S. market than in other markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1896-16\">However, in light of the questions to be addressed on remand with respect to likely discernible adverse impact and likely reasonable overlap of competition, the court remands the ITC\u2019s likely volume determination for further consideration. In particular, the ITC is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1881\">*1881</page-number>structed to revisit and explain in detail, with specific citations to the record, its determination that likely volume would be significant in light of the following evidence: (1) with respect to Japan: (a) high capacity utilization rates data reported for 2000,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (b) [[ ]], (c) the evidence relating to whether the Japanese producers would likely export conventional GOES to the United States such that it would compete with Italian conventional GOES, and (d) whether it is likely that the Japanese producers\u2019 patterns of sale will change; and (2) with respect to Italy: (a) whether it is likely that AST will sell high permeability GOES to the United States such that it would compete with Japanese high permeability GOES, and (b) whether it is likely that the Italian producer\u2019s patterns of sale will change. The ITC shall also reconsider the above in light of the increase in U.S. demand and domestic production capacity, and strong worldwide demand for GOES, and explain whether these conditions of competition would prevent significant quantities of GOES sales to the United States. Should the ITC decide not to cumulate the subject imports from Japan and Italy, it shall amend its likely volume determination accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1897-5\">B. Likely Price Effects</p>\n<p id=\"b1897-6\">Title 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(3) governs the ITC\u2019s determination with respect to likely price effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1897-7\">In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked . . ., the Commission shall consider whether\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1897-8\">(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1897-9\">(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1897-10\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(3)(A)-(B). According to the SAA, \u201cin considering the likely price effects of imports in the event of revocation . . ., the Commission may rely on circumstantial, as well as direct, evidence of the adverse effects of unfairly traded imports on domestic prices.\u201d SAA at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b1898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1882\">*1882</page-number>Here, the ITC concluded that \u201cif the orders were revoked, significant volumes of subject imports likely would significantly undersell the domestic like product to gain market share and likely would have significant depressing or suppressing effects on the prices of the domestic like product within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d Remand Determination at 15; Final Determination at 18-19. The ITC noted several conditions of competition that it found relevant to its underselling and price depression/suppression findings. First, \u201cthe domestic like product and subject imports are substitutable.\u201d Remand Determination at 11. Second, \u201cprice is an important factor in purchasing decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, \u201cdomestic prices have fallen during these reviews and are at lower levels than prices during the original investigations\u201d as a result of \u201cdownstream competition from increased U.S. imports of both transformers and laminated/stamped GOES, declining average unit costs of U.S. GOES producers, and increased U.S. imports of GOES from non-subject countries compared with the original investigations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. The decrease in prices was notable because \u201cit occurred at a time of increasing demand.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1898-4\">Based on these conditions of competition and the pricing data available on the record, the ITC affirmatively determined that there would likely be significant price underselling, and price suppression, by imports of GOES, should the Subject Orders be revoked. The ITC noted that \u201cseveral large purchasers have manufacturing facilities in both Canada and Mexico as well as the United States,\u201d and that these purchasers \u201care buying subject GOES from Italy and Japan for [these facilities] at prices that are lower than prevailing U.S. prices.\u201d Remand Determination at 12. Further, the ITC stated that these purchasers \u201care currently seeking to obtain prices from domestic producers [o\u00ed] GOES for their U.S. facilities comparable to prices for the subject product shipped to their Canadian and/or Mexican operations.\u201d Id. at 12-13. Moreover, \u201cheightened competition between domestic GOES purchasers and their competitors in Canada and Mexico\u201d would cause U.S. customers to seek lower-priced subject imports if the Subject Orders were revoked. <em>Id. </em>at 13. The ITC found that pressure on U.S. GOES producers to reduce prices, along with the \u201cincentive for the low-priced, subject imports to return to the U.S. market since subject producers would receive a higher price for the product in the U.S. market relative to third country markets,\u201d would result in negative price effects from subject imports if the orders were revoked. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1898-5\">Plaintiffs argue the record evidence does not support the ITC\u2019s price effects determination. First, with respect to the importance of price, Plaintiffs assert that questionnaire responses show that \u201cavailability, delivery time, product consistency, product quality, and reliable supply were actually <em>more frequently </em>identified as Very important\u2019 purchasing factors for GOES than was price.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Comments at 20 (emphasis in original). Second, with respect to the \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1883\">*1883</page-number>pectations of several responding importers and purchasers,\u201d Remand Determination at 12, Plaintiffs argue that \u201ca close review of [the purchaser questionnaire responses with respect to Japanese GOES cited by the ITC] shows that these [responses] are generally directed at competition in product quality and availability with respect to high-permeability GOES, and not at narrow price competition.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Comments at 20; <em>see also id. </em>at 21 (examining particular questionnaire responses with respect to AST and arguing that these responses indicate that \u201crevocation would have little or no effect\u201d). Third, with respect to the pressure being exerted on U.S. producers to reduce their GOES prices so as to compete with lower-priced imports, Plaintiffs contends that the record is devoid of any evidence \u201cthat [large manufacturers with facilities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico] are aggressively pressuring their U.S. suppliers to reduce their prices to supposedly lower levels prevailing in Canada or Mexico.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. Plaintiffs also take issue with the evidence cited by the ITC to show that \u201cprevailing U.S. GOES prices were higher than those charged by the subject producers in Canada or Mexico.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. In particular, Plaintiffs challenge the propriety of the ITC\u2019s use of average unit values of GOES imports temporarily brought into the United States for subsequent export to Canada and Mexico (so called \u201ctemporary importation under bond,\u201d or \u201cTIB,\u201d entries) as evidence of likely underselling.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1899-4\">Finally, Plaintiffs fault the ITC for allegedly \u201cnot addressing record evidence that weighs against its finding of \u2018likely\u2019 significant adverse price effects.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Comments at 23. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue the ITC did not consider: (1) evidence that \u201cdomestic producers are shielded from import competition through their fixed-price contracts and long-term relationships\u201d; and (2) evidence which Plaintiffs argue shows that \u201cany effect subject imports may have on U.S. prices is <em>already </em>being felt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24 (emphasis in original). With respect to the latter evidence, Plaintiffs highlight the increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1884\">*1884</page-number>levels of U.S. imports of finished transformers and that \u201cGOES from Japan and Italy is currently available from laminator[s]/stampers in Canada and Mexico, who are able to ship stamped GOES to the United States without having to pay dumping duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1900-4\">The ITC characterizes Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments with respect to the ITC\u2019s likely price effects determination as \u201cmerely improper attempts to have the Court reweigh the evidence.\u201d Def.\u2019s Comments at 12. First, with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the ITC exaggerated the importance of price, the ITC argues that \u201cprice need not be the most important factor in purchasing decisions to be an important factor in purchasing decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Acciai Speciali, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>19 CIT 1051, 1059 (1995)). Second, the ITC argues that the questionnaire responses it cited in the Remand Determination indicate \u201cthat customers expect the return of lower-priced subject imports following revocation... .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. Third, the ITC argues that \u201cthere are numerous examples that prices in Canada and/or Mexico are lower than U.S. prices . . . and the evidence cited ... is replete with examples of price pressure exerted on domestic producers.\u201d/!/, (citing ABB\u2019s Posthearing Br., List 1, Doc. 59, List 2, Doc. 28 at A-1; Petitioners\u2019 Posthearing Br., List 2, Doc. 27, Ex. 1 at 61-68). Finally, with respect to the relevance of fixed-price contracts in the U.S. market, the ITC found that \u201cthe majority are short term contracts (less than a year in duration) and likely would afford little protection to domestic producers from low-priced imports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14 (citations omitted). As for Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the price effects of the imports are already being felt, the ITC argues that this proposition \u201crests on the fact that low-priced imports are available to those transformer manufacturers operating outside the United States,\u201d and Plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201cignores the direct price effect that would likely result if those same subject imports return to the U.S. market once the orders are lifted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1900-5\">After having reviewed these arguments, and in light of the court\u2019s decision that remand is appropriate in order to afford the ITC the opportunity to revisit, and, if necessary, revise, its likely volume determination, the court concludes that its likely price effects determination should be remanded as well. This is because it is clear from the Remand Determination that the ITC\u2019s finding that likely volume would be significant affected the ITC\u2019s price effects determination. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 13-14 (\u201c[I]f the orders were revoked, significant volumes of subject imports likely would significantly undersell the domestic like product to gain market share and likely would have significant depressing or suppressing effects on the prices of the domestic like product within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d). The court notes the following, however, with respect to substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1885\">*1885</page-number>First, with respect to substitutability, the evidence demonstrates that the domestic like product and subject imports of GOES from Japan and Italy are substitutable. According to questionnaire responses, \u201cquality, price, and availability, in descending order of importance, were considered to be the top three purchase factors.\u201d Staff Report at 11-34. With respect to these purchase factors, the U.S. product, Italian (M-6 grade) GOES, and Japanese high permeability products were rated comparably. <em>See id., </em>tbl. II-2. U.S. GC*ES was rated superior to Japanese GOES in the categories of availability and lowest price. <em>Id. </em>It was rated superior to Italian GOES in the categories of delivery time and reliable supply. <em>Id. </em>According to the Staff Report, the ease with which purchasers switch from the U.S. product to subject imports, or vice versa, when prices change, \u201clargely depends upon the degree to which there is an overlap of competition between U.S.-produced and imported GOES, and product differentiation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-41 &amp; n.93. In light of the GOES purchasers\u2019 questionnaire responses and the ITC\u2019s undisputed finding that there likely would be an overlap of competition between the domestic like product and Japanese GOES, and between the domestic like product and Italian GOES, the court finds substantial evidence supports the ITC\u2019s substitutability finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1901-4\">Second, the court finds that substantial evidence supports the ITC\u2019s finding that price is an important factor in purchasing decisions. As discussed above, price was reported to be one of the top three factors taken into consideration by purchasers. Ten out of fourteen questionnaire responses ranked price as \u201cvery important,\u201d and the remaining four ranked price as \u201csomewhat important.\u201d Staff Report, tbl. II \u2014 1. The court finds this evidence is such that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the ITC\u2019s finding that price was an important factor in purchasing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1901-5\">Third, with respect to the expectations of several responding importers and purchasers as to the effects of revocation, the court finds that the questionnaire responses cited by the ITC are varied, but generally support the proposition that greater competition in the U.S. GOES market would likely result. <em>See </em>Staff Report at 11-43, D-5-D-20; <em>see, e.g., </em>[[ ]] Purchaser Questionnaire Resp., Ques. IV \u2014 1, <em>reprinted in </em>Staff Report at D-13 (with respect to Italy) (\u201c[[ ]]); [[ ]] Purchaser Questionnaire Resp., Ques. IV-1, reprinted in Staff Report at D-18 (with respect to Japan) ([[ ]]). The court finds this evidence generally supports the ITC\u2019s finding that there would be heightened price competition if the Subject Orders were revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1886\">*1886</page-number>Fourth, with respect to the ITC\u2019s use of the average unit values of TIB entries as indicators of the \u201caggressive low prices at which the unfairly traded imports likely would be sold in the U.S. market if the orders were revoked,\u201d Remand Determination at 12 n.67, the court finds further explanation is required. The TIB entries are \u201c \u2018not-for-consumption\u2019 imports [that] are either slit to a narrower width in the United States and then shipped to Canada or Mexico or . . . simply shipped through the United States to Canada or Mexico.\u201d Staff Report at IV-2. Japan reportedly exported \u201csemi-finished GOES products, for which some kind of further processing [was] required\u201d to laminators/slitters in Mexico and Canada in 1999, the year for which the ITC examined AUV data. Japanese Producers\u2019 Posthearing Br., List 1, Doc. 58, List 2, Doc. 26 at App. A. That same year, Japan exported only \u201chighly specialized GOES products to a very limited number of purchasers in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>AST reportedly sold unfinished GOES products to Canada and Mexico. <em>See </em>AST\u2019s Posthearing Br., List 2, Doc. 29 at A-2. It has been held that the use of AUVs \u201cmay be reliable indicators of general price trends, provided the \u2018product mix\u2019 comprising an AUV does not significantly change over time.\u201d <em>Allegheny Ludlum, </em>24 CIT at 880, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 1297 (discussing <em>United States Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). This holding is designed to ensure an accurate, \u201capples to apples\u201d assessment of price comparisons in making a price underselling determination. <em>Id. </em>In this case, remand is appropriate on the issue of whether the use of AUVs as an indicator of price underselling produced an accurate comparison of price differences, given the questions that exist with respect to whether the grade of GOES likely to be exported to the United States from Japan and that from Italy are fungible. Cf. <em>Indorama Chems. (Thail.), </em>26 CIT at_, slip op. 02-105 at 15 (\u201cThe Commission reasonably relied upon average unit value . . . data for the domestic and Thai product, explaining that average unit value data provide a reliable basis for price comparisons because [the subject merchandise] is a fungible commodity product sold in a single grade.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1902-5\">Fifth, with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the \u201cdomestic producers are shielded from import competition through their fixed-price contracts and long-term relationships,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Comments at 24, the court finds that the ITC considered the record evidence of short- and long-term contracts and nonetheless found that heightened price competition was likely. <em>See </em>Final Determination at 19 (\u201c[Although domestic sales are generally made through short- and long-term contracts, the contracts will afford little protection to the domestic producers as contract terms are often re-negotiated during the life of the contract.\u201d) (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Staff Report at V-6).

Staff Report at V-6. Plaintiffs have merely urged a different interpretation of the evidence. Similarly, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the domestic industry is already experiencing the price effects subject imports would likely have if the Subject Orders were lifted proposes a different interpretation of the evidence, but does not convince the court that the ITC committed any error in its finding. It is true that the evidence indicates an increase in imports of finished transformers from Canada and Mexico, which may have been made with Japanese and Italian GOES imported by transformer producers in those countries. The ITC discussed that evidence in the context of its finding that the U.S. GOES purchasers with facilities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico would likely pressure U.S. GOES producers to lower their prices in order to compete with the prices at which Japanese and Italian GOES could be purchased in Canada and Mexico. Conf. Remand Determination at 7 n.31. A review of the U.S. customers\u2019 questionnaire responses cited by the ITC reveals such evidence reasonably supports this conclusion. <em>See, e.g., </em>[[ ]] Importers Questionnaire Resp., Ques. II-4a &amp; b, <em>reprinted in </em>Staff Report at App. D-6 ([[ ]]). While it is possible to interpret the evidence of increased imports of transformers made with Japanese or Italian GOES as indicating that any impact the subject imports might have on the domestic industry is already being felt, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the record evidence does not, in itself, prevent the ITC\u2019s determinations from being supported by substantial evidence. <em>Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620.

Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(4), the ITC \u201cshall consider all relevant economic factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1888\">*1888</page-number>which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1904-4\">(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and .utilization of capacity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1904-5\">(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1904-6\">(C) likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1904-7\">The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1904-8\"><em>Id. </em>In accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l), the ITC is instructed to consider the effect of the Subject Orders, including whether improvement in the state of the domestic industry is linked to the imposition of the orders and the vulnerability of the domestic industry in the event the orders were revoked. <em>See </em>SAA at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b1904-9\">The ITC concluded that \u201cif the countervailing and antidumping duty orders were revoked, subject imports from Italy and Japan would be likely to have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d Remand Determination at 16-17. The ITC concluded this after considering its original affirmative material injury determination and the effect of the Subject Orders on the state of the industry. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The ITC found that after imposition of the orders \u201cthe domestic industry\u2019s performance improved significantly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ITC further determined that \u201cthe domestic industry has returned to a relatively healthy state and is not currently in a vulnerable condition as contemplated by the statute\u2019s vulnerability criterion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. In light of its findings with respect to likely volume and price effects, however, the ITC concluded that a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on the domestic industry would result and \u201cwould likely cause the domestic industry to lose market share.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16 (noting also that \u201cthe loss in market share and subsequent decrease in capacity utilization would be more severe in this capital intensive industry, in light of the need to maintain high capacity utilization to recoup investment.\u201d). Moreover, the ITC found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1904-10\">[I]t [is] likely that the effect of revocation on domestic prices, production, and sales would be significant. The price and volume declines would likely have a significant adverse impact on the production, shipment, sales, and revenue levels of the domestic industry. This reduction in the industry\u2019s production, sales, and revenue levels would have a direct adverse impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1889\">*1889</page-number>the industry\u2019s profitability as well as its ability to raise capital and make and maintain necessary capital investments. In addition, we find it likely that revocation of the orders will result in employment declines for domestic firms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1905-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 16. Thus, the ITC made an affirmative determination of likely significant adverse impact if the Subject Orders were revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1905-5\">Plaintiffs assert that the ITC\u2019s impact determination \u201crests entirely upon the \u2018significant\u2019 volume and price effects that it found \u2018likely,\u2019 \u201d and that because those determinations cannot withstand judicial scrutiny, the impact determination must also fail. Pis.\u2019 Comments at 25. Plaintiffs further claim that the ITC\u2019s finding that the domestic industry was not vulnerable to material injury is irreconcilable with its likely adverse impact determination. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. While Plaintiffs do not argue that a finding of non-vulnerability necessarily precludes a finding of likely material injury, Plaintiffs\u2019 view is that \u201c[a] finding that an industry is not even \u2018susceptible\u2019 to material injury \u2018by reason of dumped or subsidized imports\u2019 seemingly makes it highly nn-likely that subject imports would \u2018likely\u2019 cause material injury to that same industry within a reasonably foreseeable time, absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1905-6\">The ITC takes issue with Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that it cannot reconcile its finding that the domestic industry is not vulnerable under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l)(C), with its finding that revocation of the Subject Orders would be likely to lead to material injury. The ITC claims that \u201c[t]his argument is meritless since the statutory scheme itself reconciles the two.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 44. According to the ITC,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1905-7\">a vulnerability finding relates to whether the domestic industry is in a weakened state as a result of economic factors <em>other than </em>subject imports and thus susceptible to injury as a result. The SAA further explains that if the industry is in a weakened state, [the ITC] should consider whether it will deteriorate further as a result of subject imports. Whether or not an industry is in a weakened state, the Commission musts still determine whether that industry would likely be harmed by subject imports if the order is revoked. Consequently, a finding of no vulnerability does not preclude a finding of likely recurrence of material injury. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1905-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citing SAA at 885).

Remand Determination at 15. That is, it found that the domestic industry was not susceptible \u201cto material injury by reason of dumped or subsidized imports.\u201d SAA at 885. While a finding that the domestic industry is not vulnerable may not preclude a finding that material injury is likely to continue or recur, \u201c[a] robust industry, as indicated by such factors as increasing production, increasing capacity utilization rates, increasing shipments and strong profits is less likely to become materially injured in the near future than an industry characterized by declining production and negative profit margins.\u201d <em>Calabrian Corp., </em>16 CIT at 354, 794 F.

Here, the ITC found that the do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1891\">*1891</page-number>mestic industry had added new capacity, modernized existing capacity, and increased production and capacity utilization rates.

While these factors, in some cases, may account for the injury to the domestic industry, they also may demonstrate that an industry is facing difficulties from a variety of sources and is vulnerable to dumped or subsidized imports. In threat determinations, the Commission must carefully assess current trends and competitive conditions in the marketplace to determine the probable future impact of imports on the domestic industry and whether the industry is vulnerable to future harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1906-6\">If the Commission finds that an industry is vulnerable to injury from subject imports, it may determine that injury is likely to continue or recur, even if other causes, as well as future imports, are likely to contribute to future injury.
