(\u201cPAM\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a USCIT R. 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon an Agency Record, challenging certain aspects of the Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cDe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>partment\u201d) determinations in the antidumping administrative review that it conducted concerning PAM. <em>See Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation of Anti-dumping Duty Order in Part: Certain Pasta From Italy, </em>67 Fed. Reg. 300 (Jan. 3, 2002) <em>(\u2018Final Results\u201d). </em>This Court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On July 24, 1996, Commerce published in the Federal Register an antidumping duty order on certain pasta from Italy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Notice of Antidumping Duty Order and Amended Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Pasta From Italy, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 38,547 (July 24, 1996). On July 20, 2000, Commerce published in the Federal Register notice of the \u201cOpportunity to Request an Administrative Review\u201d of this order for the period covering United States sales between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000. <em>See Antidump-ing or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity To Request Administrative Review, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 45,035 (July 20, 2000). Borden, Inc. and New World Pasta requested an administrative review on September 6, 2000 and that same day, Commerce initiated the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on pasta from Italy. <em>See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Requests for Revocation in Part, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 53,980 (Sept. 6, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On September 13, 2000, Commerce sent its questionnaire to PAM and the other respondents. PAM submitted its responses to sections A through C of the questionnaire by November 15, 2000. Commerce sent. PAM a supplemental questionnaire requesting information about pasta cuts and their production on December 14, 2000. PAM submitted its section D responses pursuant to the Department\u2019s instructions by January 16, 2001. <em>See Def.-Int.\u2019s App. </em>Ex. 3. On February 21, 2001, Commerce sent PAM another supplemental questionnaire seeking information concerning, among other things, a new production line at its D\u2019Apuzzo facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In its section D response, PAM claimed a startup adjustment pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00cd677b(f)(l)(C) (1999), related to the installation of a \u201cnew production line\u201d in its existing D\u2019Apuzzo facility and stated that it had \u201cremodeled an existing facility by addition of new machinery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. The Department\u2019s questionnaire also requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>that PAM \u201cexplain how the production levels were limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. PAM responded that the question \u201cdoes not apply\u201d because its new line did not begin to operate during the period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">On June 28, 2001, Commerce preliminarily determined that PAM sold the subject merchandise at less than normal value (\u201cNV\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a dumping margin of 4.48 percent and denied PAM\u2019s requested startup adjustment. <em>See Notice of Preliminary Results and Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Intent To Revoke Antidumping Duty Order in Part: Certain Pasta From Italy, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 34,414 (June 28, 2001) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In its supplemental questionnaire to PAM, Commerce noted that PAM had \u201cfailed to provide all the information requested in the original questionnaire regarding these startup costs.\u201d <em>Def-Int.\u2019s App. </em>Ex. 4 at 1. PAM responded it had added \u201cnew machinery\u201d in the form of a \u201cnew long cut production line,\u201d which required periodic closures of the plant. <em>Id. </em>at 2. PAM maintained that \u201cproduction levels were limited because the new line was not yet ready to produce pasta and the existing lines could not produce pasta because the installation of the new line made it impossible for the old line to operate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Commerce denied the request in the <em>Preliminary Results, </em>determining that PAM did not meet the criteria for a startup adjustment pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii). <em>Preliminary Results </em>at 34,419. Specifically, Commerce concluded that the new line did not constitute a \u201cnew production facility\u201d or a \u201cnew product\u201d that required substantial additional investment, and the new line did not constitute a \u201csubstantial retooling\u201d of its existing facility. Commerce determined the addition of a new production line within an already existing facility was a \u201cmere improvement,\u201d which, as the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Statement of Administrative Action (\u201cSAA\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> states, does not qualify for a startup adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On August 7, 2001, Commerce received PAM\u2019s administrative case brief. In a December 5, 2001 letter, PAM supplemented its brief with a request that Commerce combine shape categories 5 (short cuts), 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>(specialty short cuts), and 7 (soupettes), asserting that Commerce acknowledged that it erred with respect to this issue in the judicial review of the third administrative review. <em>See Final Results </em>at 300 n.2. In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce declined to combine shape categories, explaining that Commerce\u2019s remand request in the prior judicial review, which PAM claimed to be a \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d admission of error, was simply a request for an opportunity to \u201creview the record with regard to shape categories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On January 3, 2002, Commerce published the final results of the administrative review, again denying the startup adjustment and determining PAM\u2019s dumping margin to be 4.10 percent. <em>Id. </em>at 302. Commerce rejected PAM\u2019s request that its margin be calculated by comparing the weighted average of normal values to entire invoices and, instead, followed the standard methodology of comparing the weighted average of normal values to individual transactions. <em>See Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Fourth Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Final Results of Review </em>(Jan. 3, 2001) <em>(\u201cIssues and Decision Memo\u201d) </em>at 12 (citing 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(c)(2)). Commerce also declined to permit PAM\u2019s non-dumped sales to be used to offset the dumping margins on sales that had been dumped. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On February 28, 2002, PAM filed a complaint with this court, alleging that the Department\u2019s determination was unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and was otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(B)(l)(B)(i). On October 7, 2002, PAM moved for Judgment upon an Agency Record pursuant to USCIT R. 56.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">PAM challenges four separate issues in this case: first, whether Commerce\u2019s denial of a startup adjustment for PAM\u2019s new production line is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law; second, whether the Department\u2019s calculation of PAM\u2019s dumping margin using the average-to-transaction method is in accordance with law; third, whether the Department erred by \u201czeroing\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> negative margins on individual transactions when calculating PAM\u2019s dumping margin; and fourth, whether the Department erred in its classification of certain pasta shapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>This court must evaluate whether the findings in question are supported by substantial evidence on the record and are otherwise in accordance with law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. of New York v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938); <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">A. COMMERCE\u2019S DETERMINATION TO DENY A STARTUP ADJUSTMENT FOR PAM\u2019S NEW PRODUCTION LINE IS SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND IS OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">PAM claimed a startup adjustment for its new pasta production line at its D\u2019Apuzzo facility equal to the amount of the fixed overhead attributed to the period of time during which the D\u2019Apuzzo facility was closed for the installation of the production line. In the <em>Final Results, </em>Commerce denied PAM\u2019s request for a startup adjustment, finding that the statutory criteria had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">To qualify for a startup adjustment, a producer must satisfy two requirements under the statute. In particular, Commerce will make an adjustment for startup costs when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">I) a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">II) production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii) (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The statute does not define \u201cnew product\u201d and \u201cnew production facility.\u201d <em>See Pohang Iron and Steel Co. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 778, 782 (1999). However, the Department looks to the SAA for the interpretation of these terms. \u201c \u2018New production facilities\u2019 include! ] the substantially complete retooling of an existing plant. Substantially complete retooling involves the replacement of nearly all production machinery or the equivalent rebuilding of existing machinery. A \u2018new product\u2019 is one requiring substantial additional investment.\u201d SAA at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Consistent with the SAA\u2019s requirements, Commerce determined that the addition of a pasta production line to an already existing facility is a \u201cmere improvement,\u201d and not a \u201cnew facility\u201d or \u201csubstantially complete retooling.\u201d <em>See Preliminary Results </em>at 34,419. \u201cMere improvements to existing products or ongoing improvements to existing facilities will not qualify for a startup adjustment.\u201d SAA at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>On the other hand, PAM contends that the addition of a new production line does not constitute a \u201cmere improvement,\u201d but rather constitutes a \u201csubstantial improvement tantamount to the opening of a new factory.\u201d <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 6. In support, PAM argues that because \u201cmere\u201d is not assigned a statutory definition, a dictionary must be consulted to ascertain its plain meaning. However, the Supreme Court has consistently held, and this Court has followed its lead as it must, that when the statute is ambiguous on an issue, the court will uphold Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the statute. <em>See </em>Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843. Commerce limits the definition of a new production facility to include only those involving substantially complete retooling whereas PAM contends that a substantial investment alone will qualify as a \u201cnew production facility.\u201d Commerce\u2019s interpretation, consistent with the SAA, is clearly reasonable. PAM\u2019s interpretation would make any substantial investment tantamount to a \u201cnew production facility\u201d and essentially render that phrase in \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii)(I) superfluous. Such an interpretation is contrary to the intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">To support its claim for a startup adjustment, P\u00c1M cites its financial data as evidence of a \u201csubstantial improvement.\u201d PAM reiterates that the increase in its production capabilities, [[ ]]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> times that of the old line, is \u201csubstantial and significant.\u201d <em>PI. \u2019s Reply </em>at 4. In addition, PAM allegedly increased total production capacity by nearly [[ ]]%, more than [[ ]] the value of the old plant. <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 7. Even if these assertions are assumed to be true, such statistics are,not a basis for a startup adjustment pursuant to the statute. That PAM greatly expanded capacity or incurred significant costs in establishing the new line does not affect its eligibility for a startup adjustment \u201cwithout a showing that the sizeable investment was geared toward the production of a new product or a new production facility.\u201d <em>Pohang, </em>23 CIT at 783.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">PAM must show that the new pasta line constitutes a \u201cnew production facility\u201d under \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii). A foreign producer may qualify for a startup adjustment if its investment was \u201cgeared toward\u201d a new production facility. In the initial investigation, the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>partment sent PAM two questionnaires intended to clarify how PAM qualified for a startup adjustment. Because the first reply was not clear, the Department sent PAM a supplemental questionnaire. Based on these responses, the Department made a determination that PAM did not meet the statutory requirements for the adjustment. PAM argues that it has made a \u201csubstantial improvement to a production facility\u201d and has created a \u201cnew production line,\u201d but it has not shown that the improvement was \u201cgeared toward\u201d the establishment of a \u201cnew production facility\u201d amounting to a complete retooling or a replacement of nearly all existing machinery. <em>Cf. Certain Cold-Rolled and Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products From Korea: Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Reviews, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 13,170, 13,200 (Mar. 18, 1998) (disallowing a startup adjustment because the foreign producer failed to demonstrate that the production line in question constituted a \u201cnew facility\u201d or manufactured a \u201cnew product\u201d). Therefore, PAM failed to meet the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Plaintiff failed to show that it established a new production facility or made a substantial investment geared towards a new production facility. It was reasonable for Commerce to conclude that PAM\u2019s addition of machinery to its existing facility did not qualify for a startup adjustment within the meaning of \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii)(I).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the court affirms Commerce\u2019s denial of PAM\u2019s requested startup adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">B. THE DEPARTMENT PROPERLY CALCULATED PAM\u2019S MARGIN OF DUMPING USING THE AVERAGE-TO-TRANSACTION METHOD.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">PAM challenges the Department\u2019s use of the average-to-transaction method in this case. The average-to-transaction method is described as \u201ca comparison of the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(b)(3) (2000). PAM primarily argues that the Department ignored the plain language of the statute when it failed to calculate antidumping duties on an \u201centry by entry\u201d basis pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A). <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 9. In addition, PAM argues that Commerce should have offset positive and negative dumping margins on an invoice by invoice basis, resulting in a lower calculation of its dumping margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Section 1675(a)(2)(A) is a general provision concerning the calculation of the antidumping duty margin in administrative reviews. PAM relies on the language which states that \u201c[f]or the purpose of paragraph (1)(B), the administering authority shall determine-(i) the normal value and export price (or constructed export price) of each entry of the subject merchandise, and (ii) the dumping margin for each such entry.\u201d \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A). Because the provision contains the word \u201centry,\u201d PAM argues that this provision dictates the method employed by Commerce.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Commerce counters that the statute permits the employment of its methodology in this case and it is necessary to read 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2) within the context of the other sections of the statute and in conjunction with 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414 in order to comprehend the full meaning of the statute. <em>See Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 14; <em>see also Marcel Watch Co. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 474, 477, 795 F. Supp. 1199, 1202 (1992) (\u201cIt is fundamental that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole Act, and in fulfilling [its] responsibility in interpreting legislation, [the court] must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but [should] look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy\u201d) (internal quotes and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The statute expressly states that in a review, \u201cwhen comparing export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual <em>transactions,\u201d </em>the Department will use \u201cthe calendar month of the individual export sale\u201d as a base. \u00a7 1677f-l(d)(2) (emphasis added). Moreover, this Court has repeatedly upheld the Department\u2019s use of the \u201caverage-to-transaction\u201d method in administrative reviews. <em>See Ad Hoc Comm. of S. Calif. Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, </em>19 CIT 1398, 914 F. Supp. 535 (1995); <em>NSK Ltd. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 590, 825 F. Supp. 315 (1993); Am. <em>Silicon Technologies v. United States, </em>23 CIT 237, 240-41 (1999). PAM argues that in prior cases where the use of \u201csales\u201d as opposed to \u201centries\u201d was endorsed in dumping margin calculations, the calculation used the \u201cconstructed export price\u201d (\u201cCEP\u201d) as opposed to \u201cexport price\u201d (\u201cEP\u201d). <em>See, e.g., NSK Ltd. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 590 (1993). This argument, however, was properly rejected by this Court in <em>American </em>Silicon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The problem with plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that if the Court were to require an entries-based methodology based upon the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A), Commerce would subsequently be required to utilize an entries-based approach not only for EP transactions, but also CEP transactions. Under a plain language reading of \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A), the term \u201centry\u201d appears to apply equally and without distinction to both CEP and EP transactions. Any ruling by this Court as to the meaning of the term \u201centry,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A), would, therefore, also apply equally and without distinction to both CEP and EP margin calculations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">The parties agree that it is oftentimes impossible for Commerce to tie sales to entries for CEP transactions. If Commerce were required to limit its \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A) margin analysis solely to entries made during the POR, Commerce would then be presented with two options, either attempt to perform the impossible or cease calculating dumping margins for CEP transactions. Either result would significantly impede Commerce\u2019s ability to effectively enforce the antidumping law and could not have been intended by Congress. Therefore, the Court finds that once \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A) is read in the context of the an-tidumping law as a whole, it becomes apparent that Commerce is not limited to entries made during the period of review when calculating dumping margins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>American Silicon, </em>23 CIT at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In addition, PAM\u2019s reliance on the term \u201centry\u201d in the statue is ill-founded because there is a specific regulation which enumerates the methods Commerce may employ in determining the antidumping duty margin, namely \u00a7 351.414. \u201cIn a[n administrative] review, the [Department] normally will use the average-to-transaction method\u201d in calculating the antidumping duty margin. \u00a7 351.414(c)(2). Further, the SAA describes the average-to-transaction method as \u201cthe preferred methodology in reviews.\u201d SAA at 843. Since it is an administrative review (as opposed to an initial investigation) that is under review here, Commerce was within its discretion to employ the average-to-transaction method in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The use of the average-to-transaction method in administrative reviews is in conformity with the statute, the SAA, and the Department\u2019s regulations. Therefore, the court sustains the use of the method in PAM\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">C. THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT ERR IN USING \u201cZEROING\u201d WHEN CALCULATING PAM\u2019S DUMPING MARGIN.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">PAM challenges Commerce\u2019s methodology for calculating its weighted average dumping margin, a practice referred to as \u201czeroing.\u201d In zeroing, Commerce calculates the dumping margin by as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>signing a zero value to all sales where the U.S. price exceeds NV, thus effectively excluding all non-dumped sales or sales with \u201cnegative\u201d margins. At the same time, Commerce includes the value of dumped sales in the dumping margin, which are therefore referred to as sales with a \u201cpositive\u201d margin. Commerce next determines the percentage of the weighted average dumping margin \u201cby dividing the aggregate dumping margins determined for a specific exporter or producer by the aggregate export prices and constructed export prices of such exporter or producer.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(B). Thus, while the sales with negative margins are excluded in the numerator of this formula, they are nevertheless taken into account in the denominator.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Here, PAM\u2019s main argument is that if positive margins were \u201coffset\u201d with negative margins, the result would have been a lower overall dumping margin. <em>See Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 11. PAM asserts that the Department should calculate a \u201cnet\u201d dumping margin, rather than disregarding negative margins or non-dumped sales - a methodology that would produce a more accurate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology in its calculation of dumping margins is grounded in long-standing practice. <em>See, e.g., Timken Co. v. United States, </em>26 CIT_, 240 F. Supp. 2d 1228 (2002); <em>Bowe Passat Reinigungs-Und Waschereitechnik GMBH v. United States, </em>20 CIT 558, 570, 926 F. Supp. 1138, 1149-50 (1996); <em>Serampore Indus. Pvt. Ltd. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 866, 873-74, 675 F. Supp. 1354, 1360 (1987).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Commerce justifies its position by arguing that if Congress intended that negative margins be offset by positive.margins, \u201cthe statute would require Commerce to calculate a \u2018net\u2019 dumping margin, rather than \u2018aggregate\u2019 individual \u2018dumping margins.\u2019 \u201d <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 21. Commerce explains that the statutory basis for its zeroing methodology is found in \u00a7 1677(35)(A) and (B), and when taken together, direct Commerce to aggregate all individual dumping margins and to divide this amount by the value of all sales. The statute defines the dumping margin as \u201cthe amount by which the normal value <em>exceeds </em>the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.\u201d \u00a7 1677(35)(A) (emphasis added). On the other hand, a \u201c \u2018weighted average dumping margin\u2019 is the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate dumping margins determined for a specific exporter or producer by the aggregate export prices and constructed export prices of such exporter or producer.\u201d \u00a7 1677(35)(B). Commerce interprets these provisions to permit the inclusion of only positive margins in the calculation of the aggregate dumping margin. <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 20. \u201cWhere normal value fails to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ceed the export price or constructed export price,\u201d Commerce assigns no dumping margin because there is \u201cno dumping.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(34) (defining \u201cdumping\u201d as \u201cthe sale or likely sale of goods at less than fair value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In determining whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the antidumping statute are in accordance with law, the applicable standard of review is prescribed by <em>Chevron. </em>The first step is to investigate as a matter of law \u201cwhether Congress\u2019s purpose and intent on the question at issue is judicially ascertainable.\u201d <em>Timex V.I., Inc. v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43). If the Court determines that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the issue, the Court proceeds to the second step. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843. This is essentially an inquiry into the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s decisions, and, accordingly, the Court sustains Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the statute. <em>See Fujitsu General Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \u201cIn determining whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, the Court considers, among other factors, the express terms of the provisions at issue, the objectives of those provisions [,] and the objectives of the an-tidumping scheme as a whole.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Heavy Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 541, 545, 15 F. Supp. 2d 807, 813 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe statute is silent on the question of zeroing negative dumping margins.\u201d <em>Bowe Passat, </em>20 CIT at 572, 926 F. Supp. at 1150. This gap or ambiguity in the statute requires the application of the <em>Chevron </em>step-two analysis and compels this court to inquire whether Commerce\u2019s methodology of zeroing in calculating dumping margins is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The underlying purpose for the practice of zeroing is articulated in <em>Serampore Industries. </em>The <em>Serampore Court </em>found that Commerce, in applying a zeroing methodology, had interpreted the statute \u201cin such a way as to prevent a foreign producer from masking its dumping with more profitable sales.\u201d 11 CIT at 874, 675 F. Supp. at 1360-61. By offsetting positive and negative margins into a net margin, foreign producers could undermine U.S. law by strategically dumping merchandise in the United States. For instance, companies could purposefully dump but escape antidumping duties by setting the prices of their other sales to a level such that they offset the margin, thus averaging out the margins to a level of no dumping. <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 21 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Section 1677(35)(A) of the statute states that dumping occurs when NV exceeds the export price and does not refer to a \u201cnet\u201d margin. An \u201caggregate dumping margin\u201d is therefore reasonably interpreted to refer to the sum of margins of only the dumped sales. In addition, section 1677(35)(B) specifies that the aggregate dumping margin is divided by \u201caggregate export prices,\u201d including the prices of all sales. Accordingly, Commerce\u2019s exercise of including only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>dumped sales in the aggregate while including all sales in the division does conform to the statute and cannot be pronounced an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">PAM next argues that because the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) Appellate Body has ruled against the EC\u2019s practice of zeroing, Commerce\u2019s zeroing methodology is inconsistent with the United States\u2019 international obligations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 11. In <em>European Communities - Antidumping Duties on Imports of Cotton-Type Bed Linen from India, </em>WT/DS141/AB/R (Mar. 1, 2001) <em>(\u201cBed Linen\u201d), </em>the WTO Appellate Body ruled that the zeroing methodology employed by the EC was inconsistent with the Article 2.4.2 of the WTO Anti-Dumping (\u201cAD\u201d) Agreement because it did not take into account the entirety of prices of those export transactions where negative margins were found, resulting in inflated calculations of dumping margins. Commerce counters that the WTO decision does not affect the Department\u2019s zeroing methodology because that case involved a dispute between India and the EC and did not comment on U.S. practice. <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 22. Although the exact mathematical method of the EC zeroing is not available, the fundamental practice of zeroing, as summarized in the WTO decision, is similar to the U.S. practice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The fact that the U.S. submitted third party briefs to the WTO litigation in support of the EC\u2019s zeroing methodology also lends credence to the argument that the two practices are comparable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Despite these similarities, <em>Bed Linen </em>is not a basis for striking the Department\u2019s zeroing methodology. <em>See Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>slip op. 03-25 at 18, 27 CIT_,_(2003). WTO panel and appellate decisions are non-binding on third parties and do not serve as precedent before this Court. <em>See, e.g., Hyundai Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 302, 311, 53 F. Supp. 2d 1334, 1343 (1999); SAA at 1032 (\u201cReports issued by panels or the Appellate Body under the [WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding] have no binding effect under the law of the United States.\u201d); <em>see also Corus, </em>slip op. 03-25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>at 18 (observing that WTO decisions have no <em>stare decisis </em>effect in the zeroing issue also being litigated here) (citation omitted). However, the reasoning of such decisions may help to inform the court\u2019s decision. <em>Hyundai, </em>23 CIT at 311, 53 F. Supp. 2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Moreover, \u201c[i]t has also been observed that an act of [Cjongress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible construction remains.\u201d <em>Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, </em>6 U.S. 64, 118 (1804) (articulating the well-known Charming Betsy doctrine); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 114 (1987) (recommending enjoinment of violations of international law \u201c[w]here fairly possible.\u201d). As stated in <em>Timken, </em>this court \u201cmust determine if the Department\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, as informed by <em>Chevron </em>step-two and <em>Charming Betsy.\u201d Timken, </em>240 F. Supp. 2d at 1240. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that <em>Chevron </em>is not absolute and may yield to other rules of interpretation. \u201cWhere an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg., </em>485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (citing <em>NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 U.S. 490, 499-501 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The <em>Bed Linen </em>panel did in fact find that the EC should have included the negative margins or non-dumped sales in the aggregation of dumping margins (in the numerator of the formula). <em>Bed Linen </em>at 16. Therefore, <em>Bed Linen </em>may fairly be said to call into question Commerce\u2019s methodology which excludes such margins. However, the <em>Bed Linen </em>decision was only one interpretation of the WTO AD Agreement and its precedential application is restricted to the facts and parties involved in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The WTO AD Agreement on its face does not preclude Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the U.S. law. In particular, the WTO AD Agreement does not explicitly prohibit zeroing, and, indeed, does not even use the term zeroing. Article 2.4.2 of the Agreement requires that the calculation of the dumping margins be based upon \u201ca comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices of <em>all </em>comparable export transactions.\u201d Article 2.4.2 of the WTO AD Agreement (emphasis added). Consistent with this mandate, in calculating the weighted average, the Department in fact divides aggregate margins (of only dumped sales) by all sales (including both the dumped and non-dumped sales). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677(35)(A) &amp; (B). Since the zeroing methodology employed by Commerce is not in such direct contradiction with an international obligation of the United States, the application of the Charming Betsy Doctrine to the facts of this case is not warranted. <em>Cf. </em>Jane A. Restani &amp; Ira Bloom, <em>Interpreting International Trade Statutes: Is the Charming Betsy </em>Sinking?, 24 Fordham Int\u2019l L.J. 1533, 1545 (2001) (arguing that faced with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ambiguous statutory provision and contrary WTO decision, the agency\u2019s decision may nevertheless be entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference when the agency considered the WTO decision and the agency decision developed with attendant due process safeguards). The court\u2019s task is limited to evaluating Commerce\u2019s interpretations of the statute on the basis of reasonableness. Therefore, under the facts of this case the court continues to uphold the Department\u2019s zeroing methodology, finding it reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">D. THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT ERR IN MERGING PASTA SHAPES IN PAM\u2019S CASE.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">This issue has carried over from a previous administrative review of pasta from Italy. PAM challenged Commerce\u2019s classification of pasta shapes in <em>Prodotti Alimentari Meridionali, S.r.l. v. United </em>States, slip op. 02-68, 26 CIT_,_(July 16, 2002) <em>(\u201cPAM F). </em>Subsequently, Commerce voluntarily remanded on the classification issue. PAM brought the present suit before the Court ruled on the remand. Recently, the Court, upheld Commerce\u2019s remand determination that affirmed its earlier findings. <em>See Prodotti Alimentari Meridionali, S.r.l. v. United States, </em>slip op. 03-37, 27 CIT_, _(April 1, 2003) <em>(\u201cPAM IF).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">PAM\u2019s sole argument here is that \u201cthe <em>[PAM II\\ </em>decision . . . should control in this matter and that when [the Court] properly holds that shape categories 5 and 7 should have been merged in the third review, [ ] this court should also order the Department [to] do so in this matter.\u201d <em>Pl.\u2019s Br. </em>at 13. However, the <em>PAM II </em>did not hold that shape categories 5 and 7 should have been merged, instead it found \u201cno inherent error in Commerce\u2019s model match methodology, a methodology developed with the parties and used from the outset of the investigation.\u201d <em>PAM II </em>at 5. <em>PAM II </em>articulated that \u201ca methodology seeking to compare pasta products based upon shape, ingredients used, and method of production is a reasonable one\u201d despite the fact that they may be \u201cproduced on the same machines at similar speeds\u201d and \u201cused in a similar m\u00e1nner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>PAM makes no argument and points to no fact that would help this court to distinguish <em>PAM II. </em>On the contrary, PAM urges this court to follow <em>PAM II. </em>Since this court in its independent judgment finds no reason to depart from <em>PAM II, </em>Commerce\u2019s decision not to merge PAM\u2019s pasta shape categories <em>5 </em>and 7 in this review is accordingly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment upon an Agency Record is denied, and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s determination in <em>Notice of Final Results of Antidump-ing Duty Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order in Part: Certain Pasta From Italy, </em>67 Fed.

Section 1484 is the Tariff Act provision concerning \u201centry of merchandise\u201d for Customs purposes. PAM argues that the definition of \u201centry\u201d contained in \u00a7 1484 requires Commerce to treat assorted merchandise contained on a single invoice \u201cas a single unit\u201d for dumping calculation purposes. In drawing on this provision for support, PAM ignores the distinction between \u201centry\u201d for purposes of Customs duties, as opposed to \u201centry\u201d for purposes of the Department\u2019s antidumping duty calculation methodology. <em>See Def.-Int.\u2019s Br. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> PAM had sales with both negative and positive margins in the POR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> The court notes that some of the cited cases upholding zeroing precede the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) Anti-Dumping (\u201cAD\u201d) Agreement, effective as of January 1, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> Commerce and the Defendant-Intervenor argue that PAM does not have standing under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c) to introduce WTO cases in support of its argument that the Department\u2019s methodology is inconsistent with its international obligations. <em>Def.\u2019s Br. </em>at 22; <em>Def-Int.\u2019s Br. </em>at 19.
