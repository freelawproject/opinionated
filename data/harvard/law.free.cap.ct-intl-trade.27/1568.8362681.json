By their motion, the Companies contest certain aspects of the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d or the \u201cDepartment\u201d) ninth administrative review of heavy forged hand tools (\u201cHFHTs\u201d) from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d), <em>see </em>Heavy Forged Hand Tools From the P.R.C., 66 Fed. Reg. 48,026 (ITA Sept. 17, 2001) (final det.) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d), covering the period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d) February 1, 1999, through January 31, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 48,026. The court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000) and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (2000). For the reasons set forth below the court remands this matter for further action in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-12\">On February 14, 2000, Commerce published a notice of opportunity to request administrative reviews of the antidumping order covering HFHTs from the PRC. <em>See </em>Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation, 65 Fed. Reg. 7348, 7349 (ITA Feb. 14, 2000) (opportunity request admin, rev.). In response, several PRC entities \u2014 including the Companies \u2014 requested administrative reviews. <em>See </em>HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the P.R.C., 65 Fed. Reg. 66,691, 66,692 (ITA Nov. 7, 2000) (prelim, results and prelim, partial rescission of anti-dumping duty admin, revs.) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>Huarong \u201crequested that the Department conduct an administrative review of its exports of HFHTs within the bars/wedges class or kind of merchandise,\u201d and LMC \u201crequested that the Department conduct an administrative review of its exports of HFHTs within the bars/ wedges class or kind of merchandise. . . <em>Id. </em>at 66,692.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Commerce then commenced its investigation and distributed standard nonmarket economy (\u201cNME\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> country antidumping questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">LMC timely filed its initial questionnaire response. <em>See </em>LMC Sections A &amp; C Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 22, Conf. R. Doc. 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, LMC provided sales data and information about its sales process. As to sales, LMC claimed that it sold all of its bars/wedges to a single United States customer (\u201cthe Buyer\u201d). <em>See </em>Conf. R. Doc. 2, Ex. 1 (sales quantity); <em>id., </em>Ex. 14 (customer identity).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to its sales process, LMC stated the following: \u201cCustomers provide purchase orders and LMC confirms these orders,\u201d Pub. R. Doc. 22 at A-10; it \u201c[did] not use resellers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at A-ll; all of its sales \u201care based on purchase orders,\u201d <em>id.; </em>\u201cno affiliate was involved in the sale of the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POR,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and although its PRC supplier<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u201cthe Supplier\u201d) of the subject merchandise \u201cknew the ultimate destination [of the subject merchandise] because it arranged the shipments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at A-15, \u201c[t]here was no understanding restricting, discouraging, or prohibiting sales in the home market or elsewhere. The supplier does not have the right to review LMC\u2019s sales records and the supplier does not provide after-sales service in the United States, participate in U.S. sales calls or activities. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In support of these statements, LMC supplied representative samples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>of invoices, packing lists, and other documentation. <em>See, e.g., id., </em>Ex. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">Commerce then directed LMC to complete Section D, the \u201cFactors of Production Questionnaire,\u201d and to provide data about the factors of production for the subject merchandise LMC sold. <em>See </em>LMC Section D Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 29, Conf. R. Doc. 8. In its response, LMC stated that it \u201cis a trading company and did not produce any subject merchandise.\u201d Pub. R. Doc. 29 at D-2. LMC further stated that \u201cinformation relating to [the manufacturer of the subject merchandise] is on the record in this proceeding and is not being reproduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at D-2 \u2014 D-3. LMC further stated that its Supplier of the subject merchandise \u201cproduced [all of the bars] shipped by LMC to the US market and entered during the POR.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at D-3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">After reviewing LMC\u2019s Sections A, C, and D responses, Commerce asked LMC to provide additional information, which LMC did in a timely fashion. <em>See, e.g., </em>LMC Supp. Questionnaire Resps. of: Aug. 23, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 40, Conf. R. Doc. 12; Sept. 18, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 57, Conf. R. Doc. 20; Sept. 29, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 70, Conf. R. Doc. 32; Feb. 26, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 88, Conf. R. Doc. 45; Apr. 9, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 96, Conf. R. Doc. 52; May 11, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 108, Conf. R. Doc. 62; and May 30, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 116, Conf. R. Doc. 69. In general, these supplemental questionnaires focused on information relating to the various factors of production used in the manufacture of the subject merchandise. In addition to this material, in the questionnaire response submitted on September 18, 2000, LMC indicated that it had reported all of its U.S. sales. <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 57 at 3 (Q: \u201cPlease confirm that you have reported all sales to the United States entered during the period of review (TOR\u2019).\u201d A: \u201cLMC confirms that it has reported all sales of the subject merchandise that were exported by LMC and entered U.S. customs during the POR.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-7\">For its part, Huarong also timely filed its initial questionnaire response. <em>See </em>Huarong Sections A &amp; C Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 23, Conf. R. Doc. 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As with LMC, Huarong provided sales data and information dealing with its sales process. <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 23. Huarong was instructed to \u201cstate the total quantity and value of merchandise under review that you sold during the period of review (TOR\u2019) in the United States\u201d and to \u201c[e]xclude your U.S. sales to affiliated resellers. Report instead the resales to the first unaffiliated customer.\u201d Pub. R. Doc. 23 at A-1. In response, Huarong stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>it \u201chad no affiliated resellers\u201d and submitted data as to its claimed U.S. sales. <em>See id.; id., </em>Ex. 1 (quantity and value of sales).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to its sales process, Huarong was instructed to provide information about how it structured certain sales to the United States. <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 28 at A-10 \u2014 A-12. In response, Huarong stated that \u201c[f]or sales made through resellers during the POR, Huarong arranged the sale for export. Huarong does not restrict any reseller\u2019s volume or geographic area for distribution. Huarong neither provides customer lists to resellers nor makes joint sales calls with resellers.\u201d Pub. R. Doc. 28 at A \u2014 11. <em>See id. </em>at A-18; id., Ex. 5 (contract). Included with Huarong\u2019s questionnaire response was a copy of what it identified in its questionnaire response as a \u201csales contract\u201d between it and what it identified as a \u201creseller\u201d (the \u201cExport Agent\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the questionnaire stated that \u201c[i]f you are aware that any of the merchandise that you sold to another company in your country was ultimately shipped to the United States, or was at the time [of] the sale intended to be shipped to the United States, please contact the official in charge within two weeks of receipt of this questionnaire.\u201d Pub. R. Doc. 23 at A-16. In response, Huarong stated that it \u201csold some subject merchandise\u201d through the Export Agent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Conf. R. Doc. 3 at A-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\">Commerce then directed Huarong to submit a response to Section D of the questionnaire. <em>See </em>Huarong Section D Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 28, Conf. R. Doc. 7. Section D requested information concerning the various factors of production used to manufacture the subject merchandise. In response, Huarong stated that it was not providing actual data for the factors of production but, rather, data based on \u201ccaps.\u201d <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 28 at D-6. Huarong further stated that it was providing data based on \u201ccaps\u201d for the factors of production of steel billet, paint, labor, electricity, and coal. <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 28 at D-6 \u2014 D13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-5\">Thereafter, in order to clarify certain information, Commerce asked Huarong to submit answers to several supplemental questionnaires. <em>See, e.g., </em>Huarong Supp. Questionnaire Resps. of: Sept. 18, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 59, Conf. R. Doc. 22; Sept. 29, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 68, Conf. R. Doc. 30; Apr. 9, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 102, Conf. R. Doc. 50; and May 30, 2001, Pub. R. Doc. 117, Conf. R. Doc. 70. As with LMC\u2019s supplemental questionnaire responses, most of the information solicited by Commerce dealt with various factors of production. However, in the questionnaire response submitted on September 18, 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>Huarong also stated that it had reported all of its U.S. sales. <em>See </em>Pub. R. Doc. 59 at 5 (Q: \u201cPlease confirm that you have reported all sales to the United States entered during the period of review (TOR\u2019).\u201d A: \u201cHuarong confirms that it has reported all sales of the subject merchandise that were exported by Huarong and entered Customs during the POR.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\">Commerce then published the Preliminary Results. Based on information provided by the Companies in their original and supplemental questionnaire responses, Commerce determined that they were each preliminarily entitled to company-specific antidumping duty margins separate from the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin. <em>See </em>Prelim. Results, 65 Fed. Reg. at 66,693. Commerce calculated Huarong\u2019s preliminary company-specific antidumping duty margin for bars/wedges to be 0.44 percent, and calculated LMC\u2019s preliminary company-specific antidumping duty margin for bars/ wedges to be 0.01 percent. <em>Id. </em>at 66,696. The PRC-wide antidumping duty margin for bars/wedges was preliminarily calculated to be 139.31 percent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">Commerce then notified the Companies that it would conduct verification of their submitted sales and factors of production information. <em>See </em>Letter from Commerce to law firm of Hume &amp; Assoc, of 4/9/ 01, Pub. R. Doc. 100 (\u201cLMC Sales Agenda\u201d); Letter from Commerce to law firm of Hume &amp; Assoc, of 4/9/01, Pub. R. Doc. 98 (\u201cHuarong Sales Agenda\u201d). Included with this notification was an outline of the information Commerce intended to review at verification. <em>See generally </em>LMC Sales Agenda; Huarong Sales Agenda.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-6\">Commerce conducted verification of LMC\u2019s questionnaire responses from April 23 through April 26, 2001. <em>See </em>Verification in Dalian, Liaoning, the P.R.C, of the Questionnaire Resps. of LMC in the Antidumping Duty Admin. Rev. of HFHTs from the P.R.C., Conf. R. Doc. 73 (\u201cLMC Verification Report\u201d). In its verification report, Commerce noted that [[ ]]. <em>Id. </em>Commerce also made the following \u201csignificant findings\u201d: (1) \u201c[u]pon arrival at verification [the Department] observed that LMC had prepared none of the documentation requested in the [verification] outline\u201d; and (2) that the \u201coverwhelming majority of sales activities of subject merchandise sales reported by LMC were actually performed by [[ ]].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, it was only at verification, and not before, that Commerce learned the actual nature of these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-9\">At sales verification, Commerce found that LMC was not the \u201cseller\u201d of the bars/wedges but, rather, that \u201c[flor bar sales LMC\u2019s role is largely one of processing documents for shipment and processing receipt of payment.\u201d LMC Verification Report at 5. After reviewing LMC\u2019s records, Commerce found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1588-10\">LMC used U.S. importer records to prepare its sales listings to the Department and thus did not have the database used as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>source of its response. However, it did have sales invoices for each sale of subject merchandise reported to the Department and these reconciled closely to the amounts reported to the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">Commerce then conducted verification of Huarong\u2019s questionnaire responses from May 2 through May 9. <em>See </em>Verification in Dongping Town, Shandong Province, the P.R.C., of the Questionnaire Resps. of Shandong Huarong Gen. Group Corp. in the Admin. Rev. of HFHTs from the PRC, Conf. R. Doc. 74 (\u201cHuarong Verification Report\u201d). Again, as with LMC, Commerce made certain \u201csignificant findings,\u201d including that \u201c[t]he overwhelming majority of sales activities for subject merchandise sales reported by [[ ]].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1. Indeed, Commerce determined that the [[ ]] were actually Huarong\u2019s. <em>See </em>Application of Adverse Facts Available to Shandong Huarong General Group Corp., Conf. R. Doc. 84 at 3 (\u201c[T]he information reviewed at verification clearly demonstrates that Huarong records these sales in its books and records [them] as sales to the U.S. customer in question.\u201d). Finally, Commerce determined that once the sales [[ ]], there were no significant discrepancies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>in total sales quantity and value of reconciliation data, or sales completeness, based on Huarong\u2019s sales database. <em>See id. </em>at 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">Commerce also discussed with Huarong officials the various factors of production for the subject merchandise and its use of \u201ccaps.\u201d Commerce stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1590-5\">[a] ccording to company officials, the consumption amounts reported for the factors of production were based on what company officials call \u201ccaps,\u201d which are the company\u2019s closest approximation of the inputs used based on years of production experience manufacturing the subject merchandise. Company officials stated that they no longer had the worksheets showing how they computed the \u201ccaps\u201d; however, . . . the company supported their reported \u201ccaps\u201d with actual production and work records from the POR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">Huarong Verification Report at 10-11. Although Commerce stated Huarong was unable to supply the worksheets it used to calculate all of the \u201ccaps,\u201d some data was available for the inputs of electricity, paint, and coal. Using these data as its starting point, Commerce tested the reasonableness of each reported \u201ccap\u201d for these factors of production. For the factor of production \u201cpaint,\u201d Commerce stated that \u201c[t]he average consumption rates based on the worksheets were significantly different and much greater than the amounts reported to the Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. For the factor of production \u201celectricity,\u201d Commerce stated that the \u201cconsumption rates based on company records all exceeded the consumption rates reported by Huarong to the Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. For the factor of production \u201ccoal,\u201d Commerce stated that the \u201cconsumption rates based on company records all exceeded the consumption rates reported by Huarong to the Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, Commerce stated that it was unable to \u201creconcile certain factors of production to company cost records . . . due to time constraints. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">After review and analysis of the questionnaire responses and the information gathered at verification, Commerce determined that the use of facts available and adverse facts available was warranted to determine the antidumping duty margins for both LMC and Huarong. <em>See </em>Final Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 48,028; <em>see also </em>Issues and Decision Mem. for the Admin. Revs, of HFHTs from the RR.C. \u2014 February 1, 1999 through January 31, 2000, Pub. R. Doc. 144 (\u201cDecision Memo\u201d). As to LMC, Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1590-8\">Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A) and (C)], the Department has determined that it is appropriate to apply the facts available for purposes of determining the dumping margin for LMC in the instant review. Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A)], we have determined that LMC has withheld significant information that was requested by the Department such that the Department is unable to calculate a dumping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>margin with respect to this company. Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(C)], we further determined that LMC has significantly impeded the Department\u2019s ability to accurately determine a margin of dumping for LMC in the instant administrative review. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-4\">Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(i)], the Department conducted an on-site verification of the information submitted by LMC at its sales headquarters in the PRC. In analyzing LMC\u2019s record information pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)], we have determined significant portions of LMC\u2019s reported data could not be verified in accordance with [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)(2)]. Upon arrival at verification, the Department discovered that LMC had prepared <em>none </em>of the documentation requested in the April 9, 2001 sales verification outline. Moreover, during verification, it became evident that LMC could not provide the information necessary to verify its own submissions. As a consequence of our findings at verification, pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)(4)], we determined that LMC did not act to the best of its ability in responding to the Department\u2019s requests for information. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-5\">For the reasons discussed above, the application of [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)] does not overcome [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)]\u2019s direction to use facts otherwise available to determine a margin of dumping for LMC in this administrative review. Thus the use of facts available is warranted for LMC in this case. Moreover, we determine that, due to the nature of LMC\u2019s verification failures, and the inadequacy of its cooperation, the integrity of LMC\u2019s company reported data on the whole is compromised. Therefore, we determine that LMC has not adequately demonstrated its entitlement to rates separate from the government entity. As a consequence LMC will receive the PRC-wide entity rates. Moreover, . . . the Department has determined, pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)], that LMC did not cooperate by acting to the best of its ability to comply with the Department\u2019s requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-6\">Final Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 48,028 (emphasis in original). In support of its determination that LMC \u201cwithheld\u201d information, Commerce explained that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-7\">[t]he Department discovered at verification that LMC had reported U.S. sales of bars in its sales database which were in fact sales by another PRC company to the United States. . . . Because these misreported sales constituted the bulk of LMC\u2019s reported U.S. sales, we have determined that LMC\u2019s database is inadequate for purposes of calculating a dumping margin for this respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>Decision Memo at 6-7. In support of its determination that LMC \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d the investigation, Commerce explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-5\">LMC demonstrated at verification that it was fully aware of its lack of any meaningful involvement in these sales from the beginning of this review. Yet. . . LMC misreported the sales as its own in its initial questionnaire response and in the ensuing supplemental responses. As a consequence of LMC\u2019s failure to accurately describe the true nature of these sales in its questionnaire and supplemental responses, the Department was unable to determine that the sales were misreported until verification. As a direct result of LMC misreporting its sales, the Department: 1) issued a verification outline to LMC for purposes of reviewing the data relevant to these transactions; 2) did not anticipate the need to verify these- transactions at another company\u2019s facilities in the PRC; and 3) incorrectly included these sales in the preliminary dumping margin analysis for LMC. Thus, LMC\u2019s mischaracterization of these sales significantly impeded the Department\u2019s ability to accurately determine a margin of dumping for LMC in the instant administrative review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10. As to Huarong, Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-7\">Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A) and (C)], the Department has determined that it is appropriate to apply the [flacts available for purposes of determining the dumping margin for Huarong in the instant review. Specifically, Huarong failed to report the great majority of its U.S. market sales to the Department. Thus, pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A)], the Department has determined that Huarong has withheld information that was requested by the Department. ... In addition, pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(C)], we have determined that Huarong has significantly impeded this review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-8\">We further determine that Huarong has failed to satisfy several of the requirements enunciated by [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)]. Pursuant to [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(i)], the Department conducted an on-site verification of Huarong\u2019s data at Huarong\u2019s headquarters in China. Upon arrival at verification, the Department found that Huarong had prepared almost no documents requested of it in the Department\u2019s verification outline. As a result of the verification team having to devote extensive amounts of time to examining issues pertaining to the unreported U.S. sales, and difficulties in verifying the accuracy of the reported factors of production input levels, there was insufficient time for the verifiers to conduct a full factors of production verification.

Thus, Huarong\u2019s mischaracterization of these sales significantly impeded the Department\u2019s ability to accurately determine a margin of dumping for Huarong in the instant administrative review. With respect to the verification, we note that Huarong\u2019s failure to report these sales in its data<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>base and its mischaracterization of them as sales to a PRC reseller resulted in the Department having to spend an inordinate amount of the scheduled verification at Huarong on sales issues, thus reducing the amount of time left and impeding the progress of the factors of production portion of the verification. . . . This, compounded by the failure of Huarong to adequately prepare for verification, led to the Department\u2019s inability to reconcile factors of production to the company\u2019s cost records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">Commerce then determined that the use of adverse facts available was warranted as the Companies did not cooperate by acting to the best of their abilities to comply with the Department\u2019s requests for information. <em>See </em>Final Results, 66 Fed.

The court examines each company in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-7\">a. LMC</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-8\">The record shows that Commerce solicited information about LMC\u2019s sales data and sales process. In response to questions about its sales process, LMC stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-9\">[t]he supplier knew the ultimate destination [of the subject merchandise] because it arranged the shipments. There was no understanding restricting, discouraging, or prohibiting sales in the home market or elsewhere. The supplier does not have the right to review LMC\u2019s sales records and the supplier does not provide after-sales service in the United States, participate in U.S. sales calls or activities, or provide sales incentives to LMC\u2019s customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1599-10\">LMC Section A Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 22 at A-15. This explication of LMC\u2019s sales process is accurate as far as it goes, but it is not fully responsive to the question asked. For instance, the statement \u201cthe supplier knew the ultimate destination [of the subject merchandise] because it arranged the shipments\u201d fails to mention that the Supplier arranged all the terms of the sale, including pricing, and that the Supplier ultimately received payment for the subject merchandise. The statement \u201c[tjhere was no understanding restricting, discouraging, or prohibiting sales in the home market or elsewhere\u201d is misleading in that, while there is no evidence that the Supplier could generally control LMC\u2019s sales process, LMC had absolutely no control over the transactions here at issue. The statement \u201c[t]he supplier does not have the right to review LMC\u2019s sales records\u201d may, again, be accurate as it relates to LMC\u2019s own sales, but for the transactions here at issue, LMC had no involvement with the sales process and did not, in fact, have the relevant records of the sales in its own sales database. Finally, the statement that the Supplier \u201c[did] not participate in U.S. sales calls or activities\u201d is simply false as the Supplier completely arranged the sales. In other words, although LMC identified the transactions at issue as its own sales in its questionnaire responses, they were, in fact, not its own sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>b. Huarong</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-3\">As to Huarong, the record is clear that it did not accurately provide information in its responses in several important respects. First, Huarong claimed that certain transactions were not \u201csales\u201d to the Buyer because it \u201cresold\u201d some merchandise \u201cthrough\u201d the Export Agent; yet the Export Agent did not pay Huarong for the merchandise, and Huarong neither reported these \u201csales\u201d to Commerce nor recorded them as sales to the Export Agent on its sales ledgers. Second, Huarong stated that it was uninvolved with the sales process of certain transactions; yet the record shows that not only was the Buyer a pre-existing customer of Huarong\u2019s, but the terms of the sales were agreed upon directly by the Buyer and Huarong. In other words, although Huarong did not identify certain transactions as its own sales to the Buyer, they were, in fact, its own sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">2. Commerce\u2019s determination that it need not consider data submitted by the Companies at verification to remedy missing information was proper</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-5\">The court finds proper Commerce\u2019s determination that it need not consider information relating to the Companies\u2019 sales data gathered during verification. Specifically; Commerce found that it need not consider this information because, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)(4), the Companies were unable to show that they had acted to the best of their abilities in providing the information prior to verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-6\">The Companies argue that they were acting to the best of their abilities to comply with Commerce\u2019s requests for information because: (1) pursuant to the statute, Commerce\u2019s regulations, and the antidumping questionnaire instructions they accurately identified who the \u201cseller\u201d was for the transactions here at issue and, in any event, the identity of the \u201cseller\u201d was inconsequential; (2) even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it was relevant as to who the \u201cseller\u201d was in the transactions here at issue, Commerce eventually came into possession of all relevant information and was able to calculate an anti-dumping duty margin from that information; and (3) they otherwise \u201ccooperated\u201d with Commerce\u2019s requests for information. The court does not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-7\">Where two entities each apply for company-specific treatment, the actual seller of the subject merchandise is relevant. With respect to the time at which Commerce came into possession of the relevant information, the court finds <em>Florex v. United States, </em>13 CIT 28, 705 F. Supp. 582 (1989), instructive. In <em>Florex,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1600-8\">[t]he questionnaire response was replete with other errors. In such a situation [Commerce] is justified in finding a failure of verification. Such a finding is essentially the same as a finding of failure to respond at all. In fact, it may be worse because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1585\">*1585</page-number>[Commerce] had to expend time at verification to discover the errors made in the response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1601-4\"><em>Florex, </em>13 CIT at 32, 705 F. Supp. at 588; <em>see Maui Pineapple Co. v. United States, </em>25 CIT_,_, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1244, 1259 (2001) (discussing <em>Florex, </em>13 CIT at 32, 705 F. Supp. at 588). In the instant investigation Commerce was placed in a similar position. Specifically, at verification \u2014 and not before \u2014 it became evident that the Companies, by their questionnaire responses, did not accurately provide information about their sales and sales processes. As a result, Commerce was compelled to expend a considerable amount of time discovering and correcting these critical errors. Indeed, because of the amount of time spent correcting errors Commerce was unable to complete the Companies\u2019 verification within the scheduled dates. Therefore, as the Companies misstated the seller for certain transactions of subject merchandise in their questionnaire responses, they cannot show that they were acting to the best of their abilities to supply requested information in those responses. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-7\">As to the Companies\u2019 argument that Commerce eventually came into possession of all the relevant documentation and should, therefore, have calculated individual margins based on such collected data, it is incumbent upon parties that choose to participate in an antidumping duty investigation to accurately provide information to Commerce in the first instance. <em>Reiner Brach, </em>26 CIT at_, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 1333 (\u201cIt is the interested party\u2019s obligation to create an accurate record and provide Commerce with the information requested to ensure an accurate dumping margin.\u201d). Indeed, verification is not an opportunity to submit new answers to previously posed questions, but is more like an audit of information previously submitted. <em>See Bomont Indus. v. United States, </em>14 CIT at 208, 209, 733 F. Supp. 1507, 1508 (1990) (\u201c[V]erification is like an audit, the purpose of which is to test information provided by a party for accuracy and completeness.\u201d). Because the Companies did not accurately supply requested information about their sales and sales processes in their questionnaire responses, presentation of this data to Commerce at verification cannot serve as proof that they \u201cacted to the best of their abilities\u201d to supply this information in their questionnaire responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-10\">Finally, the record does not support the Companies\u2019 argument that they \u201ccooperated\u201d with Commerce\u2019s requests for information. Specifically, the Companies make much of their alleged cooperation with Commerce during verification. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. at 14 (\u201cThe record reflects . . . that Plaintiffs fully cooperated during verification. . . .\u201d). However, the Companies misstate Commerce\u2019s determination in this regard. The record shows that Commerce found the use of facts available was warranted because the Companies failed to provide requested information and impeded the investigation prior to verifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1586\">*1586</page-number>tion, not that the Companies may or may not have \u201ccooperated\u201d with Commerce at verification. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 7 (stating use of facts available was warranted as to LMC because \u201c[t]he Department\u2019s questionnaire specifically asks respondents to \u2018[s]tate the total quantity and value of the merchandise under review that you sold during the period of review in the United States. . . .\u2019\u201d (bracketing and emphasis in original)); <em>id. </em>at 4 (stating use of facts available was warranted as to Huarong because \u201c[t]he Department\u2019s Section A questionnaire specifically asks respondents to provide \u2018[t]he total quantity and value of the merchandise under review that <em>you sold </em>during the period of review in the United States. . . .\u2019 \u201d (emphasis and second bracketing in original)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, that the Companies may have cooperated with Commerce at verification cannot be evidence that they acted to the best of their abilities to supply requested information in their questionnaire responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-3\">3.

Specifically, LMC stated in its questionnaire responses that it sold bars/wedges to a U.S. customer. At verification, however, it became evident that LMC was not the actual seller. Indeed, at verification LMC at first continued to maintain that it was the seller but, eventually, admitted it was not. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 9 (\u201cLMC acknowledged that it had not purchased bars for resale to the United States; rather it acted more along the lines of a processing agent for the relevant sales to the U.S. customer.\u201d). Thus, because LMC did not accurately provide requested sales information, Commerce\u2019s determination that it \u201cwithheld\u201d information is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-6\">b. LMC significantly impeded the investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-7\">As noted above, the record shows that LMC claimed to have certain sales when it had none and did not accurately describe [[ ]]. Based on this inaccurate information, Commerce scheduled LMC\u2019s verification with the expectation that LMC was the seller of subject merchandise to a U.S. customer. At verification Commerce reasonably expected LMC to be in possession of the relevant original sales documents as to these transactions. At verification, however, it became evident that LMC did not possess these documents, and did not record the relevant sales in its sales database. Thus, because LMC did not reveal its role in these sales until verification, and because it did not possess the requisite sales information, Commerce\u2019s determination that LMC \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d the investigation is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-9\">4. Commerce\u2019s determination that the use of facts available was warranted for Huarong\u2019s missing sales data was proper</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-10\">Commerce determined that the use of facts available was warranted for establishing Huarong\u2019s sales data because (1) Huarong did not accurately provide that information in any of its questionnaire responses, and (2) because Commerce was required to spend nearly all of its scheduled verification time tracking down sales data, the verifiers were unable to address matters related to the factors of production data. In support of its determination, Commerce stated that it was using facts available because, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a)(2) and (a)(4), Huarong both \u201cwithheld\u201d information and \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d the investigation. <em>See </em>Final Results, 66 Fed.

Huarong withheld information</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-4\">The record shows that the questionnaires sent to Huarong specifically asked it to supply information about \u201cyour\u201d sales to the United States. In its responses, however, Huarong never included information regarding the transactions here at issue even though Commerce specifically requested this information. Thus, since Huarong had the information in its possession and did not provide it, Commerce\u2019s determination that it \u201cwithheld\u201d information is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-5\">b. Huarong significantly impeded the investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-6\">Commerce was likewise justified in its determination that the use of facts available was warranted as to Huarong\u2019s sales data based on its finding that Huarong \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d the investigation. The record shows that Commerce, based on the information provided in Huarong\u2019s questionnaire responses, scheduled verification with the expectation that it would only be verifying a small quantity of bar sales and various factors of production. However, because of the inaccuracies in Huarong\u2019s submitted sales data, Commerce spent its verification time collecting this missing information. Therefore, because Commerce was unable to complete verification of Huarong\u2019s submitted data with respect to factors of production due to Huarong\u2019s actions, Commerce\u2019s determination that Huarong \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d Commerce\u2019s investigation is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-7\">5. Commerce\u2019s determination that the use of facts available was warranted for Huarong\u2019s factors of production data was proper</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-8\">Commerce was justified in its determination that the use of facts available was warranted as to Huarong\u2019s factors of production data based on its finding that Huarong \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d the investigation. As noted above, the record shows that Commerce scheduled verification with the expectation that it would only be verifying a small quantity of bar sales and various factors of production. However, because of the inaccuracies in Huarong\u2019s submitted sales data, Commerce spent its verification time collecting this missing information, and was thus unable to verify completely Huarong\u2019s factors of production data. Final Results, 66 Fed. Reg. at 48,028 (\u201cAs a result of the verification team having to devote extensive amounts of time to examining issues pertaining to the unreported U.S. sales, and difficulties in verifying the accuracy of the reported factors of production input levels, there was insufficient time for the verifiers to conduct a full factors of production verification.\u201d). In addition, Commerce\u2019s preliminary review of Huarong\u2019s factors of production, based on \u201ccaps,\u201d found that there were significant discrepancies between Huarong\u2019s questionnaire responses and the data it provided at verification. See Huarong Verification Report at 13 (stating \u201c[t]he average consumption rates [for paint] based on the worksheets were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1589\">*1589</page-number>significantly different and much greater than the amounts reported to the Department.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 15 (\u201cThese consumption rates [for electricity] based on company records all exceeded the consumption rates reported by Huarong to the Department.

Therefore, because Commerce was unable to complete verification of Huarong\u2019s submitted data with respect to factors of production due to Huarong\u2019s actions, Commerce\u2019s determination that the use of facts available was warranted as to Huarong\u2019s factors of production data because Huarong \u201csignificantly impeded\u201d Commerce\u2019s investigation is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-4\">6.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated that \u201c[t]he focus of [1677e(b)] is respondent\u2019s <em>failure to cooperate to the best of its ability, </em>not its failure to provide requested information.\u201d <em>Nippon Fed.

Second, Commerce must then make a subjective showing that the respondent under investigation not only has failed to promptly produce requested information, but further that the failure to fully respond is the result of the respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation in either: (a) failing to keep and maintain all required records, or (b) failing to put forth its maximum efforts to investigate and obtain the requested information from its records. An adverse inference may not be drawn merely from a failure to respond, but only under circumstances in which it is reasonable for Commerce to expect that more forthcoming responses should have been made; i.e., under circumstances in which it is reasonable to conclude that less than full cooperation has been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1606-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 1382-83 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1606-4\">Here, the Companies argue that Commerce\u2019s determination to use adverse facts available was improper because they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1606-5\">fully cooperated [with Commerce\u2019s investigation] and that their responses in nearly all instances reconciled to their books and records.

First, there can be no doubt that reasonable and responsible sellers that request an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1591\">*1591</page-number>review of an antidumping order will have accurate records of their sales. Indeed, the administrative record shows that Huarong had such records and eventually produced them. There can also be no doubt that a reasonable and responsible producer, seeking an administrative review, will have accurate records of its factors of production. Second, the record shows that LMC and Huarong did not make the maximum effort to produce the sales records in order to respond to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire requests. Rather, the information contained in the questionnaire responses was inaccurate. In addition, it cannot be said that Huarong did the maximum it could do to substantiate its use of \u201ccaps,\u201d as it did not retain the worksheets upon which the caps were based or make any effort to replicate them. As a result, Commerce has satisfied the statutory showings for the use of adverse facts available as articulated by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>See Nippon Fed. Cir., </em>337 F.3d at 1382. Thus, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s determination that the use of adverse facts available was warranted as to the Companies\u2019 sales data and Huarong\u2019s factors of production data.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-4\">II. Commerce\u2019s determination that the Companies should receive the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin based on their failure to provide evidence of their independence from state control</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-5\">Where an antidumping duty investigation involves an NME country, all exporters within that country are presumed to be subject to government control. <em>See Sigma Corp. v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 1401, 1405-06 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (\u201c[I]t was within Commerce\u2019s authority to employ a presumption of state control for exporters in a nonmarket economy, and to place the burden on the exporters to demonstrate an absence of central government control. . . . Moreover, because exporters have the best access to information pertinent to the \u2018state control\u2019 issue, Commerce is justified in placing on them the burden of showing a lack of state control.\u201d (citing <em>Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 1573, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1993)); <em>see also Fujian Mach. &amp; Equip. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT _, _, 178 F.

While all NME exporters are presumed to be subject to government control, an exporter may request and receive an antidumping duty margin separate from the NME-wide antidumping duty margin by providing evidence of its independence from government control. <em>See Transcom, Inc. v. United States, </em>294 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Sigma, </em>117 F.3d at 1405-06) (\u201cUnder the NME presumption, a company that fails to demonstrate independence from the NME entity is subject to the countrywide rate, while a company that demonstrates its independence is entitled to an individual rate as in a market economy.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Huarong Section A Questionnaire Resp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1592\">*1592</page-number>Pub.

The Department may, however, consider requests for separate rates from individual exporters.\u201d); LMC Section A Questionnaire Resp., Pub. R. Doc. 22 at A-l (same). Where an NME exporter successfully rebuts the NME presumption by providing evidence of its independence from state control, Commerce may assign such NME exporter a company-specific antidumping duty margin. However, where an NME exporter fails to either: (1) rebut the nonmarket economy presumption of state control, or (2) otherwise cooperate with the investigation<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> by failing to \u201crespond to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire for that review,\u201d Commerce may then apply the NME-wide antidumping duty margin to such exporter\u2019s merchandise. <em>See Sigma, </em>117 F.3d at 1411 (citing <em>D&amp;L Supply Co. v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 1220, 1222 (Fed.

Thus, an NME exporter may qualify for a company-specific antidumping duty margin where it participates in the investigation, and: (1) requests a company specific anti-dumping margin; and (2) provides evidence of its independence from government control in both law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-3\">Here, the Companies participated in the administrative review and had, by their questionnaire responses: (1) requested company-specific antidumping duty margins; and (2) submitted evidence of their independence from government control with their questionnaire responses.

Facts available</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-9\">The court does not find proper Commerce\u2019s determination to reject the Companies\u2019 separate rates evidence and, thus, assign them the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin based on the presumption of state control. In support of its determination that the Companies would receive the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin based on facts available, Commerce stated that \u201cdue to the nature of [the Companies\u2019] verification failures, and the inadequacy of [their] cooperation, the integrity of [the Companies\u2019] reported data on the whole is compromised.\u201d <em>See </em>66 Fed. Reg. at 48,028 (Huarong); <em>id. </em>(LMC) (same). This reasoning, however, cannot be the basis for assigning the Companies the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin based on facts available, as it is clear the Companies did provide evidence of their entitlement to separate rates and there is no indication that any necessary information was missing or incomplete. <em>See Nippon Fed. Cir., </em>337 F.3d at 1381 (\u201cThe focus of subsection (a) is respondent\u2019s <em>failure to provide information.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)). In other words, the findings that justified the use of facts available and a resort to adverse facts available with respect to the Companies\u2019 sales data and factors of production, cannot be used to accord similar treatment to issues relating to the Companies\u2019 evidence of independence from state control. Specifically, the record shows that the Companies each submitted evidence of their entitlement to separate rates with their questionnaire responses, and at verification Commerce found such evidence was not \u201ccompromised.\u201d In addition, while the record shows that the Companies, by their questionnaire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1595\">*1595</page-number>responses, represented that they were in possession of all of the relevant documentation but at verification were unable to produce all of the documents necessary to establish their entitlement to separate rates, Commerce neither pressed them to produce such evidence nor otherwise requested that the Companies rectify this \u201cdeficiency.\u201d <em>See </em>LMC Verification Report at 2; Huarong Verification Report at 2. Furthermore, the record also shows that Commerce seemingly determined that the lack of such documentation was not dispositive with respect to the separate rates determination. <em>See </em>LMC Verification Report at 2-3 (\u201cLMC officials confirmed that [the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation] allowed it to operate independent from the government. However, when asked, LMC officials were unable to produce the document that allowed it to operate independently. The Department notes, however, that this document has been cited in previous periods of review for this case.\u201d); Huarong Verification Report at 2-3 (\u201cHuarong confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) allowed it to operate independent from the government. However, when asked, Huarong was unable to produce the document that allowed it to do so. The Department notes, however, that this document has been cited in previous periods of review for this case.\u201d). Thus, because the Companies did provide evidence of their independence from government control and Commerce: (1) verified such information; (2) did not request the Companies to remedy any deficiencies in their separate rates information; and (3) did not find the lack of such information dispositive with respect to the separate rates determination, the court cannot sustain Commerce\u2019s determination that the Companies should be assigned the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin based on facts available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\">B. Adverse facts available</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\">For the Final Determination, Commerce determined that the use of adverse facts available was warranted as to the Companies\u2019 separate rates information and, therefore, they would receive the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin. In support of its determination, Commerce reasoned that because the integrity of the Companies\u2019 data was \u201ccompromised,\u201d they \u201c[had] not adequately demonstrated [their] entitlement to a rate separate from the PRC-wide entity.\u201d Decision Memo at 11 (LMC); <em>id. </em>at 6 (Huarong). The court cannot sustain Commerce\u2019s determination in this regard. Specifically, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b), Commerce must make certain showings before it may resort to adverse facts available. <em>See Nippon Fed. Cir., </em>337 F.3d at 1382. Here, the record shows that the Companies apparently kept records sufficient to satisfy Commerce of their independence from state control and supplied such records to Commerce in a timely fashion. Because findings with respect to data Commerce found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1596\">*1596</page-number>\u201ccompromised\u201d \u2014 i.e., the Companies\u2019 sales data and Huarong\u2019s factors of production data \u2014 are distinct from those related to state control, it is difficult to see how Commerce\u2019s determination with respect to the sales and factors of production data can form the basis for the use of adverse facts available with respect to independence from state control. Historically, Commerce has exercised its ability to parse respondents\u2019 questionnaire responses and apply adverse facts available only to a portion of a determination. <em>See Kao Hsing Chang Iron &amp; Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>26 CIT _, _, slip op. 02-142 (Dec. 6, 2002) (sustaining use of partial adverse facts available for \u201cmissing production quantity data for . . . [cost of production and constructed value] databases.\u201d (bracketing in original)); <em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>25 CIT_,_, 146 F. Supp. 2d 845, 885 (2001) (remanding action where determination was based on partial adverse facts available as to the factor of production \u201cpacking expenses\u201d and it was \u201cunclear\u201d what action Commerce took in arriving at that determination). Commerce has exercised this ability in the context of NME investigations. <em>See Pac. Giant, Inc. v. United States, </em>26 CIT_,_, slip op. 02-140 at 4 (Dec. 2, 2002) (sustaining application of \u201cpartial adverse inference\u201d to NME company\u2019s \u201clabor\u201d factor of production). Similar treatment would appear to be appropriate here. The Companies supplied the requested information and Commerce has not adequately demonstrated a sufficient reason to disregard the Companies\u2019 submissions of evidence of their entitlement to separate antidumping duty margins and resort to adverse facts available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-9\">On remand, Commerce shall revisit, in a manner consistent with this opinion, its determination that the Companies were to receive the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin. Specifically, Commerce shall: (1) consider the separate rates evidence submitted by the Companies, (2) determine whether the assignment of separate rates for the Companies is warranted, i.e., that the Companies have demonstrated an absence of state control both in law and in fact, and (3) if Commerce finds that the assignment of separate rates is warranted, calculate separate antidumping duty margins for Huarong and LMC. In the event Commerce continues to find that the Companies should receive the PRC-wide antidumping duty margin, it shall make specific showings with explicit and complete references to the record with respect thereto.
