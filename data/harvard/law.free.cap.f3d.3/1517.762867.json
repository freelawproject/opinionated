Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-2249V (Cl.Ct. Aug. 7, 1992) (Saxton/CFC). The Saxtons, petitioners-appellees, filed a petition for compensation that was later voluntarily withdrawn. The special master granted their attorneys\u2019 request for fees and costs but awarded only half the amount requested. On appeal, the Court of Federal Claims found the fee award to be arbitrary because the special master had relied on his prior experiences with these attorneys, and the court awarded the full amount requested. We reverse because the Court of Federal Claims committed legal error, and remand for entry of judgment in accordance with the special master\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">On October 1, 1990 attorneys Rodney A. Klein and Michael R. Skow filed a petition for compensation on behalf of Nathaniel Sax-ton under the provisions of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Vaccine Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> October 1, 1990 was the statutory deadline for filing all cases related to vaccinations occurring before October 1, 1988. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(l) (1988). The petition alleged that Nathaniel Saxton had suffered encephalopathy and seizures as a result of a DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccination on June 16, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">After consulting two different medical experts, Klein and Skow filed a petition to dismiss the Saxtons\u2019 case on October 3, 1991. The experts declined to testify because the medical records could not support a conclusion of either table injury or causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">On October 31, 1991 Klein and Skow applied for $10,832 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred during preparation of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HHS objected to the award of fees, and Klein and Skow responded. Klein and Skow then requested an additional $2987.84 for responding to HHS\u2019 objections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">On May 18,1992 the special master awarded Klein and Skow $5982.48 under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l), which authorizes the award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs even when the petitioner does not prevail. All that is required is that the petition be brought in good faith and upon a reasonable basis. Although Klein and Skow voluntarily dismissed the petition for lack of proof, the special master found that they had brought the petition in good faith because they could not have fully evaluated the claim in October of 1990, during the rush to file claims before the impending statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">The special master did not award the full amount requested; he reduced the attorneys\u2019 fees by about 50 percent. He found the number of hours billed overall to be unreasonable, and pointed to specific examples of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>overbilling. He also stated that, in his prior experience with these same attorneys, his impression was that \u201cMessrs. Klein and Skow <em>typically </em>bill far more hours in Vaccine Program cases than other counsel, who, like Messrs. Klein and Skow, have handled multiple numbers of Program eases.\u201d <em>Sax-ton v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-2249V, slip op. at 3 (Cl.Ct. Spec. Mstr. May 18, 1992). The special master also found that, in his experience, Klein and Show\u2019s additional hours did not produce a superior performance in comparison to the other vaccine program attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">To confirm his subjective impression, the special master surveyed every fee award made since the beginning of the vaccine program. He found that the five other law firms that handled multiple vaccine cases averaged 62.3 hours per case, while Klein and Skow averaged 143 hours per case\u2014 roughly twice as many hours. In the special master\u2019s opinion, reducing Klein and Show\u2019s hours by 50 percent would still \u201cprovide a generous amount of time for a competent [Vaccine] Program attorney, in a typical Program case, to put together a Program petition, send the case to medical experts, and review and discuss such experts\u2019 responses, before electing to dismiss the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Klein and Skow filed a motion for review with the Court of Federal Claims, and requested an additional $1000 in fees and costs incurred while preparing the motion for review. On August 7, 1991 the court vacated the special master\u2019s decision. It ruled that the special master\u2019s experience with counsel in the past was an irrelevant factor, and that his reliance on that factor rendered his entire decision arbitrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">Although a special master is not required to perform a line-by-line evaluation of the fee application, this is the preferred method. If a study of some sort is deemed necessary to describe the special master\u2019s general experience, it must be based on a comparison of the fee request at issue with other representative data. It is completely arbitrary to decide that some particular firm or attorney has had no billing judgment in past cases so that the firm or attorney\u2019s present fee application must necessarily be inflated. Although the special master arguably relied on some relevant factors in reaching his decision, we conclude that his reliance on an irrelevant factor rendered arbitrary the entire decision concerning attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayj6\"><em>Saxton/CFC, </em>slip op. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The Court of Federal Claims awarded Klein and Skow the full amount of fees requested, finding the fee request to be reasonable because it \u201cis documented and all of the items seem realistic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The government appealed that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">On review of the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, \u201c[w]e may not disturb the judgment of the [court] unless we find that judgment to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Munn v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 (Fed.Cir.1992); <em>see also Phillips v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>988 F.2d 111, 112 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">The issue before us is this: Was the Court of Federal Claims correct in holding that the special master erred in determining the fee award because he took into account his previous experiences with these attorneys in the vaccine program? We review this question <em>de novo </em>because it is a legal determination that a special master may not consider his prior experience with a vaccine program attorney and that attorney\u2019s history of overbill-ing. <em>See Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">If we conclude that the court was correct in its analysis, then it properly set aside the special master\u2019s decision under the applicable statutory standard \u2014 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law \u2014 and properly substituted its own findings and conclusions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B). At this point, we would review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 new findings \u201cunder the same standard by which we review trial court fact findings in other contexts ... clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 871-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">The government argues that the Court of Federal Claims, by specifying what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>factors a special master may or may not consider, has encroached on the discretion given to the special master by statute to award fees and costs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). The statute authorizes \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). According to the government, determining what is \u2018reasonable\u2019 requires the special master to use his prior experiences to compare attorneys across cases. Such prior experiences are particularly relevant in the context of the vaccine program because a small group of attorneys repeatedly appears before the small group of special masters.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Klein and Skow argue that the court did not unduly interfere with the special master\u2019s discretion; it merely instructed special masters on how to properly apply their prior experience. Klein and Skow charge that the special master\u2019s fee award was arbitrary because he failed to perform an independent evaluation of the fee request \u2014 he merely relied on his uncontrolled \u2018study1 of previous fee awards and his belief that Klein and Skow had inflated their fees in the past. His 50 percent reduction of the fees was made without explanation; according to Klein and Skow, decisions employing this \u2018meat-axe\u2019 technique should be subject to heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Because of the no-fault nature of the vaccine program, its simplified procedures, and its elimination of the need to prove fault or causation in every case, legal fees and costs in the vaccine program were not expected to be high:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">The Committee has assumed that costs under a no-fault, non-adversarial system will be significantly lower. With most evi-dentiary requirements specified in the legislation, with prohibitions on traditional discovery and courtroom procedure, and with no obligations to demonstrate negligence or product defectiveness, the costs of legal services will more closely approximate those incurred in such systems as the Black Lung benefits program or workers\u2019 compensation programs. In these systems, legal costs rarely rise above $10,000 per case. The Committee has, therefore, assumed that legal costs may be as much as $15,000 per case in the compensation Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">H.R. Report No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 36, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 C.C.A.N. at 6287, 6377-78; <em>cf. Zeagler v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Sens., </em>19 Cl.Ct. 151, 153 (1989) (\u201cA suit under the Act was meant to be, and is, a straightforward proposition. ... we do not think that suits under the statute can be viewed as litigation in the traditional sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The section of the Vaccine Act which authorizes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">In awarding compensation on a petition filed under section 300aa-ll of this title the special master or court shall also award as part of such compensation an amount to cover\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">(A) reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-12\">(B) other costs,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-13\">incurred in any proceeding on such petition. If the judgment of the United States [Court of Federal Claims] on such a petition does not award compensation, the special master or court may award an amount of compensation to cover petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs incurred in any proceeding on such petition if the special master or court determines that the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">If the petition for compensation is successful, the special master is required to award reasonable fees and costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). The determination of the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees is within the special master\u2019s discretion. <em>See Hines v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Sens., </em>22 Cl.Ct. 750, 753 (1991). If the petition for compensation is denied, the special master \u201cmay\u201d award reasonable fees and costs if the petition was brought in good faith and upon a reasonable basis; the statute clearly gives him discretion over whether to make such an award. <em>See Ferreira v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Sens., </em>27 Fed.Cl. 29, 31 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>When a statute provides for recovery of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, the trial forum must determine what fee is \u2018reasonable.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">[A] reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate____ The [trial forum] also should exclude from this initial fee calculation hours that were not \u201creasonably expended.\u201d---- Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. \u201cIn the private sector, \u2018billing judgment\u2019 is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>client </em>also are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>adversary </em>pursuant to statutory authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-9\"><em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433-34, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939-40, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The trial forum \u201chas discretion in determining the amount of a fee award. This is appropriate in view of the [trial forum\u2019s] superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941; <em>see also Commissioner, Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 161, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 2320, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Trial courts routinely use their prior experience to reduce hourly rates and the number of hours claimed in attorney fee requests. <em>See Bemardi v. Yeutter, </em>951 F.2d 971, 974 (9th Cir.1991) (district court\u2019s reduction of hourly rates and reduction of hours billed by one-half was not an abuse of discretion; \u201c[t]he district court is in the best position to determine in the first instance the number of hours reasonably expended\u201d); <em>Coulter v. State of Tennessee, </em>805 F.2d 146,150-52 (6th Cir.1986) (district court\u2019s reduction of hourly rates and reduction of hours billed was proper; \u201cWhen the issue is a question of the lawyer\u2019s judgment in billing for a particular number of hours on a piece of work, we must depend in larger measure on the fairness of the District Court ... we dp not believe the District Court acted arbitrarily or irrationally in reducing the pretrial preparation hours from 62 to 31.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">Vaccine program special masters are also entitled to use their prior experience in reviewing fee applications. <em>See Farrar v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>1992 WL 336502, at *2-3, 1992 U.S.Cl.Ct. LEXIS 512, at *7-8 (Cl.Ct.Spec.Mstr.

The Court of Federal Claims erred in prohibiting the special master from considering his past experiences with attorneys in the vaccine program \u2014 this past experience is a relevant factor and should be taken into account. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 430 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 n. 3 (awards in similar eases and coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>sel\u2019s experience and ability are two of twelve factors relevant to a fee determination); <em>Slimfold Mfg.
