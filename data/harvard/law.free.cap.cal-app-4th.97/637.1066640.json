Roseville imposes an \u201cin-lieu franchise fee\u201d (in-lieu fee) of 4 percent on each of the utilities\u2019 annual budgets; this fee is paid by the utility ratepayers and transferred to Roseville\u2019s general fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">This appeal presents us with two principal questions: whether Proposition 218\u2014a descendant of Proposition 13 that covers local government fees and charges\u2014applies to Roseville\u2019s in-lieu fee; and, if so, whether the in-lieu fee violates Proposition 218. We answer yes to both questions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Private utilities pay public authorities \u201cfranchise fees\u201d to use government land such as streets, or for rights-of-way to provide utility service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roseville similarly imposes the in-lieu fee on its municipal utilities; \u201cin-lieu\u201d is the term of choice since the utilities are not private entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The accounting for Roseville\u2019s municipal utilities is maintained in enterprise accounts that are separate from Roseville\u2019s general fund. The in-lieu fee was conceived in 1968, and has existed in various forms since then. The in-lieu fee at issue here began in 1992, when Roseville began transferring from the utilities\u2019 enterprise accounts to its general fund a fee of 4 percent of the utilities\u2019 annual budgets.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, together with two other groups and two individual ratepayers (collectively referred to as plaintiffs), sued Roseville over the in-lieu fee. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and a writ of mandate; they claimed the in-lieu fee violated Proposition 218 by imposing a fee for a property-related service that was not tied properly to the cost of providing that service. Plaintiffs initially had also sought a refund, but they abandoned that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Preliminarily, Roseville argues that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a suit in equity because plaintiffs had the adequate legal remedy of a refund. Similar to the situation presented in the recent high court decision in <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>however, the legal validity of the in-lieu fee is a question properly raised through an action seeking declaratory, injunctive and mandate relief; to the extent the complaint seeks a judicial determination of the legal validity of the in-lieu fee, it does not involve an issue subject to determination through the administrative refund remedy available to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Roseville sought to counter plaintiffs\u2019 view of the in-lieu fee (i.e., as one not tied properly to the cost of providing the utility service) by characterizing the fee as compensation or rent paid to its general fund by each of the municipal utilities for the costs of Roseville\u2019s streets, alleys and rights-of-way used to provide utility service; or as a reasonable economic return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to the general fund which supports or pays for those streets, alleys and rights-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Plaintiffs and Roseville filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs emerged with the judgment. The trial court concluded: \u201cAssuming without deciding that [Roseville] has the right to charge the budgets of the municipal utilities with the cost of using [Roseville\u2019s] rights[-]of[-]way, the in-lieu franchise fee as presently imposed does not appear to bear any relationship to the actual cost of maintenance of those rights[-]of[-]way, or the utilities\u2019 proportional share of that cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We will turn now to the first issue, whether Proposition 218 applies to the in-lieu fee. We will weave the pertinent facts into the fabric of our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">1. <em>Proposition 218 Applies to the In-lieu Fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In November 1996, California voters adopted Proposition 218, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In adopting this measure, the people found and declared \u201c \u2018that Proposition 13 was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases. However, local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax, assessment, fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases, but also threaten the economic security of all Californians and the California economy itself. This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Proposition 218 added articles XIII C and XIII D to the California Constitution. Article XIII C concerns voter approval for local government general taxes and special taxes. Article XIIID sets forth procedures, requirements and voter approval mechanisms for local government assessments, fees and charges. We are concerned here with article XIII D, specifically certain provisions concerning fees and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The relevant California Constitution, article XIIID provisions on fees and charges are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>\u201cSection 1.

The relevant code provisions are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">For water:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cThe owner of the real property served by the city shall be charged with, and shall be personally responsible for, the water bills incurred for water service to such property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cThe water division shall install service connections and lay service pipes up to the coterminous of the public easement or interest in land and the property of the applicant . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cThere shall be due and payable the following monthly charges, upon submission of the bill by the City to the owner of the property supplied with service, for all treated water measured by meters for residential, commercial, industrial and manufacturing or other purposes: [H] . . . [f] . . . The total amount due and payable shall be the sum of the monthly service charge plus the quantity rate. The monthly service charge is due and payable regardless of whether water has been consumed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cThe following service charges shall apply to flat rate [residential] consumers [based on property lot size] that the Environmental Utilities Director determines are not cost effective to assign metered rates.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cAll consumers, whether owners or not, shall maintain and keep in good repair the water pipes on the interior and exterior of the property served.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">For sewer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">\u201cIf a lot or other parcel of property has had an existing connection to the public sewer system . . . , the connection fees . . . shall not be required</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>. . . .\u201d \u201c. . . The city shall construct all laterals necessary to make connections from the main sewer to the line of the property of the adjoining owner[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, a monthly unit sewer service charge [not dependent upon discharge volume] shall be paid by each [property-based residential (i.e., depending on dwelling type)] user connected to the City-owned public sewer. ...[![]... The monthly sewer charge shall be $15.50/sewer unit.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Commercial and industrial users are property-based too, depending upon business or activity; some of these users are tied to discharge volume, and some are not.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">And for refuse collection:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201cEach and every householder or tenant occupying any dwelling, house, or residence, shall pay to the city ... a fixed minimum charge . . . as a refuse fee. Such fixed minimum is based upon service of one (1) call per week, irrespective of whether there is any refuse to remove from any premises.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cEvery proprietor of each and every store, shop, apartment, house, roominghouse, or factory shall pay to the city ... a fixed minimum charge . . . as a refuse fee. Such fixed minimum is based upon service of (1) call per week, irrespective of whether there is any refuse to remove from any premises.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">These municipal code sections direct the provision of water, sewer, and refuse services to (owned) property. These services are first necessarily delivered to property, and then, and only then, to those living or working on the property. This recognized dichotomy discounts any argument that water, sewer, and refuse services delivered to a tenant are not property-related, that is, not directly tied to property ownership. Furthermore, California Constitution, article XHI D, section 2, subdivision (g), states that \u201c \u2018[property ownership\u2019 shall be deemed to include tenancies of real property where tenants are directly liable to pay\u201d the fee or charge. In light of these observations, we conclude that the in-lieu fee for Roseville\u2019s water, sewer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and refuse services, a fee not dependent upon the quantity of service used, is a fee imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership for Proposition 218 purposes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Our specific conclusion is buttressed by general language in California Constitution, article XIII D and in the ballot materials for Proposition 218, and by a recent state Supreme Court decision mindful of that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Under California Constitution, article XIII D, section 3, subdivision (b), \u201cfees for the provision of electrical or gas service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of property ownership.\u201d More importantly, article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (c), states that \u201c[e]xcept for fees or charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services, no property-related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased\u201d unless submitted for voter approval. There would be no point in specifically exempting sewer, water and refuse collection fees and charges from this one requirement of article XIII D, and in characterizing these fees and charges in this grammatical way, if they were not subject, at least in some respects, to article XIII D\u2019s other requirements for property-related fees or charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In the ballot materials for Proposition 218, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis bears out this view. That analysis observes: \u201cLocal governments charge fees to pay for many services to their residents. Some of these fees pay for services to property, such as garbage collection and sewer service. . . . [H] . . . ffl] . . . Fees for water, sewer, and refuse collection service probably meet the measure\u2019s definition of a property-related fee. Gas and electric fees and fees charged to land developers are specifically exempted. [H] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [H] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The most likely fees . . . affected by these provisions would be those for: [among others], water service.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Our state high court, in <em>Apartment Assn., </em>recently noted that this analysis from the Legislative Analyst \u201cexplained that Proposition 218 \u2018would constrain local governments\u2019 ability to impose fees, assessments, and taxes,\u2019 meaning \u2018property-related\u2019 fees, including fees for water, sewer and refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>collection, but excluding gas and electricity charges [citation] and development fees [citation]. [Citation.] It did not refer to levies linked more indirectly to property ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Roseville emphasizes two passages from <em>Apartment Assn. </em>There the court concluded that Proposition 218 did not apply to an inspection fee that a city imposed on apartment landlords for code compliance inspections.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The inspection fee, said the court, was \u201cimposed on landlords not in their capacity as landowners, but in their capacity as business owners\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the two passages that Roseville emphasizes, the <em>Apartment Assn. </em>court stated that Proposition 218 \u201conly restricts fees imposed directly on property owners in their capacity as such,\u201d and \u201capplies only to exactions levied solely by virtue of property ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This reading was based on the plain language of Proposition 218\u2019s article XIII D, section 2, subdivision (e), which defines a fee or charge as one imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d rather than \u201con an incident of property ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The inspection fee in <em>Apartment Assn. </em>was imposed because the property there was being rented; here, as we have seen, the in-lieu fee was imposed because the property was being owned. As the <em>Apartment Assn. </em>court reiterated, the inspection fee was \u201cmore in the nature of a fee for a business license than a charge against property.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Furthermore, article XIII D, section 2, subdivision (e)\u2019s definition of fee or charge includes \u201ca user fee or charge for a property-related service\u201d; a property-related service \u201cmeans a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The relationship between the inspection fee in <em>Apartment Assn. </em>and property ownership was indirect\u2014it was \u201coverlain by the requirement that the landowner be a landlord.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Here, as we have seen, the relationship between the in-lieu fee and property ownership is direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Roseville also cites to <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. v. City of Los Angeles </em>to claim that the in-lieu fee is not subject to Proposition 218 <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That case is distinguishable. There, the appellate court faced the question whether certain municipal water usage rates were imposed as an incident of property ownership, and therefore, required voter approval. The court noted that fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>or charges for water services are specifically exempted from the voter approval requirement by California Constitution, article XIH D, section 6, subdivision (c). The court also noted that under the ordinances setting water rates, the supply and delivery of water did not require that a person own or rent the property where the water was delivered; and that the charges for water service were usage rates\u2014basically, commodity charges\u2014based primarily on the amount consumed. Therefore, the water usage rates were not incident to or directly related to property ownership within the meaning of Proposition 218.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">By contrast, the ordinances at issue here governing the initial delivery of water, sewer, and refuse collection services are necessarily tied to property ownership. And the in-lieu fee is not a commodity charge based primarily on the amount consumed; rather, it comprises a flat 4 percent of the yearly budgets of the water, sewer, and refuse utilities, and is a blended component of the rates charged by those utilities irrespective of the amount consumed. We do not suggest that measured or metered consumption determines, on its own, whether a fee is property related within the meaning of Proposition 218; it is simply a factor to consider in an analysis like that undertaken in <em>Jarvis-L.A. </em>We also reiterate that the evidence shows, and the parties have treated, the in-lieu fee, for Proposition 218 purposes, as a separate, independent fee for water, sewer, and refuse collection services, and not simply as a component part of another fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We conclude that Proposition 218 applies to the in-lieu fee for Roseville\u2019s water, sewer, and refuse collection services.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">2. <em>The In-lieu Fee Violates Proposition 218</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Plaintiffs contend the in-lieu fee violates Proposition 218, specifically some of the cost and usage requirements set forth in section 6, subdivision (b) of California Constitution, article XIII D (hereafter section 6(b), or section 6(b) of Proposition 218). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Section 6(b)(1) states that \u201c[Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property-related service.\u201d Section 6(b)(2) compatibly states that \u201c[Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.\u201d And section 6(b)(5), in part, adds for emphasis, \u201c[n]o fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including, but not limited to, police, fire, ambulance or library services, where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The theme of these sections is that fee or charge revenues may not exceed what it costs to provide fee or charge services. Of course, what it costs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>provide such services includes all the required costs of providing service, short-term and long-term, including operation, maintenance, financial, and capital expenditures. The key is that the revenues derived from the fee or charge are required to provide the service, and may be used only for the service. In short, the section 6(b) fee or charge must reasonably represent the cost of providing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In line with this theme, Roseville may charge its water, sewer, and refuse utilities for the street, alley and right-of-way costs attributed to the utilities; and Roseville may transfer these revenues to its general fund to pay for such costs (the general fund supports or pays for Roseville\u2019s streets, alleys, and rights-of-way). Here, however, there has been no showing that the in-lieu fee reasonably represents these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Roseville sets the in-lieu fee at a flat 4 percent of each of the three utilities\u2019 annual budgets. On its f\u00e1ce, this fee does not represent costs. It is a flat fee. It is imposed on the utilities\u2019 budgets, presumably after their total costs have been accounted for in the budget process. If the budget of a utility increases because of a cost increase unrelated to the in-lieu fee, the in-lieu revenues, as a flat percentage of that increased budget, increase as well. The in-lieu fee is the same percentage applied to each budget, regardless of varying uses of streets, alleys and rights-of-way by the individual utilities. It cannot be said that this flat fee on budgets coincides with these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Roseville concedes that the in-lieu fee was set at 4 percent \u201cof utility expenses by a process that considered (1) what [Roseville] collects as franchise fees from private enterprises, (2) what other communities collect as franchise fees, and (3) what would be a reasonable rate of return for use of [Roseville\u2019s] rights[-]of[-]way.\u201d As plaintiffs point out, however, not one of these factors aligns with an identified cost of providing utility service, as required by Proposition 218; instead, they all ask, \u201c \u2018What will the market bear?\u2019 \u201d While Roseville may be free to impose franchise fees on private utilities on the basis of contractual negotiation rather than costs, it is not free, under section 6(b) of Proposition 218, to impose franchise-like fees on a noncost basis regarding its municipal utilities.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Relying on a valuation analysis it commissioned regarding the in-lieu fee (the Sierra West Report), Roseville notes the fee constitutes \u201c[reasonable] compensation or rent paid to the General Fund by each of the municipal utilities as an expense for the costs of [Roseville\u2019s] streets, alleys, and rights-of-way used by such utilities in providing each separate utility service\u201d; this report also characterizes the fee \u201cas a reasonable economic return to the General Fund on the investment made by General Fund support of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>contributions to each municipal utility.\u201d While the Sierra West Report may provide a theoretical foundation for imposing the in-lieu fee\u2014at least with respect to compensation paid for the street, alley and right-of-way costs attributed to the utilities\u2014the report fails to show those costs. Under section 6(b) of Proposition 218, the fee or charge must reasonably represent the cost of providing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Furthermore, the reliance by Roseville and by the Sierra West Report on aspects of the state Supreme Court\u2019s 1986 decision in <em>Hansen v. City of San Buenaventura </em>is problematic.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Hansen </em>observed that a municipal utility is entitled to a reasonable rate of return and that utility rates need not be based purely on costs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To support these observations, <em>Hansen </em>noted that nothing in the California Constitution forecloses a local governmental entity from \u201c \u2018using the <em>net proceeds </em>of enterprises such as municipal utility systems for the benefit of its own general fund.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Hansen's </em>observations, however, were made 10 years before Proposition 218 added article XIII D to the state Constitution. Although the <em>Jarvis-L.A. </em>court relied on <em>Hansen </em>for part of its analysis, the decision in <em>Jarvis-L.A. </em>concluded that Proposition 218 did not apply to the water usage rates at issue there.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We previously granted Roseville\u2019s request to take judicial notice of two local ballot measures that purported to amend Roseville\u2019s charter. These measures were approved by Roseville\u2019s electorate at a general municipal election held on November 7, 2000, after the trial court proceedings in this case. The two measures are Measure K, which received a majority vote; and Measure U, which received greater than a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Measure U amended the charter to state that \u201cEach city-owned utility shall be financially self-sufficient, and shall fully compensate the city general fund for all goods, services, real property and rights to use or operate on or in city-owned real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Measure K purportedly amended the charter to provide that for purposes of accounting for the use of the public right-of-way, Roseville\u2019s utilities may pay to Roseville\u2019s general fund an in-lieu franchise fee not to exceed 4 percent of total utility operating and capital expenditures, which shall be budgeted and appropriated solely for police, fire, parks and recreation, or library services. The impartial ballot analysis for Measure K, written by Roseville\u2019s city attorney, stated that the measure, \u201cif enacted, would validate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the in[-]lieu franchise fee concept as representing an element of the actual cost of providing utility services to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">These measures do not turn the tide for Roseville by displaying the costs the in-lieu fee covers. Measure U simply states that Roseville\u2019s utilities will pay Roseville for what the city provides the utilities, including real property and rights to use or operate on or in city-owned real property. Proposition 218 has no quarrel with Measure U in theory, but the measure does nothing to show what the actual costs of that real property, usage or operation are. And Measure K suffers from a similar deficiency. It states that the utilities may pay an in-lieu fee \u201cnot to exceed four percent (4%) of total operating and capital expenditures\u201d\u2014again, this measure does nothing to show actual costs. The city attorney\u2019s analysis of Measure K is couched similarly in theoretical terms: the measure \u201cwould validate the in[-]lieu franchise fee <em>concept </em>as representing an element of the actual cost of providing utility services . . . .\u201d (italics added); moreover, the in-lieu revenues under Measure K are to be spent solely on police, fire, parks and recreation, or library services, rather than on actual costs of providing utility service. Because it is unnecessary to do so, we express no views regarding the validity of Measure K.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Last, but not least, the in-lieu fee violates section 6(b) of Proposition 218 in a more direct way. Roseville concedes that \u201c[rjevenue from the in[-]lieu franchise fee is \u2018placed in [Roseville\u2019s] general fund to pay for general governmental services. It has not been pledged, formally or informally[,] for any specific purpose.\u201d This concession runs afoul of section 6(b)(2) that \u201c[Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.\u201d It also contravenes section 6(b)(5) that \u201c[n]o fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services . . . .\u201d As noted, Roseville may place in its general fund the revenues derived from a cost-based in-lieu franchise fee to pay for the street, alley and right-of-way costs attributed to the water, sewer and refuse utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We conclude the in-lieu fee violates section 6(b) of Proposition 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Scotland, P. J., and Callahan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 13, 2002, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
