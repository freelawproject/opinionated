We take the opportunity presented by appellant Steven Anthony Garcia\u2019s petition for rehearing to confirm the propriety of memorandum opinions in unpublished cases and to signal the bar that it will likely see an increase in the frequency of such opinions, civil and criminal, from this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Review by the Courts of Appeal can serve three purposes\u2014the determination of the legal correctness of the challenged trial court action, the progressive development of the law, and, to some degree but less so than review by the Supreme Court, the uniformity of the law in the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>(See <em>People v. Rojas </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 278, 289 [173 Cal.Rptr. 64]; Aldisert, Opinion Writing (1990) \u00a7 2.9, p. 21; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 976(b).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The publication of an opinion of the Court of Appeal is warranted only when one or both of the latter two goals are advanced. Thus, rule 976(b) authorizes publication of those opinions which establish a new rule of law, apply an existing rule to a set of facts significantly different from the facts involved in a published opinion, modify or criticize an existing rule of law, resolve or create an apparent conflict in the law, address a legal issue of continuing public interest, or make a significant contribution to the legal literature by reviewing either the development of a common law rule or the legislative or judicial history of a provision of a constitution, statute, or other written law. (See also U.S. Cir. Ct. Rules (9th Cir.) (Ninth Circuit Rules), rule 36-2.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">An opinion which has none of these attributes furthers only the \u201creview for correctness\u201d function of the Court of Appeal, and, as such, does not merit extensive factual or legal statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Rojas, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 289.) A meticulously crafted but unpublished legal essay, replete with extended analyses of law and expositions of reasoning and which distinguishes authorities and responds to every nuance of argument in the parties briefs, requires the devotion of a share of the Court of Appeal\u2019s limited human and material resources far out of proportion to the utility of the effort. (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 682, pp. 715-716.) An unpublished opinion has a limited audience, for the most part only the parties, and, beyond the ultimate disposition, is of little worth even to the parties. The parties already know (or should know) the facts of the case and its procedural history, and it is likely the winner does not care about how the court arrived at the favorable result and the loser probably would not be convinced by the reasoning no matter how long or specific it is, or, more to the point, how persuasive the court might think it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">To the extent an unpublished opinion may have a lingering legal significance to the parties or other affected persons or entities (see rule 977(b)), a comprehensive decision is still unneeded. Whether a prior memorandum opinion establishes the law of the case can be resolved by reference to the issues and reasons expressed in the opinion as dispositive of the appeal; any unmentioned issues would arguably be unbinding dicta. <em>(Kowis v. Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 892-893 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250]; <em>Olson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>Cory </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 399 [197 Cal.Rptr. 843, 673 P.2d 720] [applying doctrine to issues \u201cimplicitly decided\u201d in prior case]; <em>Quackenbush v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 867, 874 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 282] [doctrine does not apply to dicta]; <em>Muktarian </em>v. <em>Barmby </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 966, 968 [70 Cal.Rptr. 903] [doctrine does not apply to facts]; see Ninth Circuit Rules, rule 36-3(b).) If more information is necessary, resort can be had to the trial and appellate records. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Appeal, \u00a7 906, p. 942 [records in the two trial court proceedings may be compared]; see <em>People v. Woodell </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 448, 456 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 950 P.2d 85] [the record of conviction for the purposes of determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a serious felony includes but is not limited to the appellate opinion].) Substantially the same is true where the question involves the application of the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. (See 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 292, p. 837; Ninth Circuit Rules, rule 36-3(b).) When a memorandum opinion is \u201crelevant to criminal or disciplinary action or proceeding because it states reasons for a decision affecting the same defendant or respondent in another such action or proceeding,\u201d either the opinion, if it includes the pertinent information, or the records underlying the opinion, can be consulted. (Rule 977(b); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodell, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Whatever interest an appellate opinion may have to the parties or persons or entities legally affected by the decision, it has essentially no value beyond them, because it provides no useful\u2014or perhaps more accurately, no usable\u2014guidance to the bench, bar, or public. (Rule 977(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The late Bemie Witkin long ago said what is even more compelling today: \u201cWhy do appellate courts write opinions in nearly all the appeals that come before them? Judges and lawyers have been asking this question with increasing concern, and no one has come up with a satisfactory answer. We plow and replow the fields of precedent, burying leading cases in an incredible mass of repetitive churnings of settled law, exhausting the appellate justices and the appellate lawyers, because it has always been done this way. But we are now faced with the realization that the individually prepared legal essay, the product of countless hours of precious judicial time, is an impossible procedure for handling today\u2019s monstrous caseload, and in the majority of appeals it serves no useful social purpose. [H] . . . [H]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u201cThis is the heart of the problem: There is no reason and no time for legal essays to be written on all appealed cases, whether the essays are long or short. The full-scale opinion, stating the nature of the action, the issues, the facts, the law, and the reasoning that leads to the decision, should be reserved for cases in which that opinion will add something of significance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>to the law\u2014new principles or rules, or new applications of old principles or rules.\u201d (Witkin, Manual on Appellate Court Opinions (1977) \u00a7 131, pp. 255-256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Memorandum opinions may vary in style, from a stereotyped checklist or \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d form to a tailored summary of the critical facts and the applicable law. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 681, pp. 714-715; Witkin, Manual on Appellate Court Opinions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 142, 143, pp. 265-266; Aldisert, Opinion Writing, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.8, p. 20.)  The briefest formats are appropriate in cases where the result is controlled by an admittedly constitutional statute and which present no special question of interpretation or application, cases where the result is controlled by an opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of California, or, in the absence of either, where the result is consistent with an intermediate federal or state appellate decision with which the court agrees, cases where the factual contentions are subject to the routine application of the- substantial evidence rule, cases decided by applying the authority of a companion case, cases in which the result is mandated by the United States Supreme Court, and cases where the appeal is not maintainable. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 684, pp. 717-718; Witkin, Manual on Appellate Court Opinions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 135, p. 260.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">A memorandum decision does not automatically violate the constitutional mandate that appellate opinions state the reasons for the disposition. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1232, 1264 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 970 P.2d 872]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rojas, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at pp. 288-289; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 681, p. 714; Witkin, Manual on Appellate Court Opinions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 132, p. 256.) \u201c[A]n opinion sufficiently states \u2018reasons\u2019 if it sets forth the \u2018grounds\u2019 or \u2018principles\u2019 upon which the justices concur in the judgment.\u201d <em>(Lewis v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1262.) An appellate court is not required to address all of the parties\u2019 respective arguments, discuss every case or fact relied upon by the parties, distinguish an opinion just because a party claims it is apposite, or express every ground for rejecting every contention advanced by every party. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1263-1264; <em>People v. Rojas, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at pp. 288-289.) The California Supreme Court has not been reluctant to give short shrift to deserving issues. (See, e.g., <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>v. <em>Mendoza Tello </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 264 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134]; <em>Linhart v. Nelson </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d. 641, 645 [134 Cal.Rptr. 813, 557 P.2d 104] [\u201cHaving examined defendants\u2019 other contentions, we find them of insufficient merit to warrant discussion\u201d]; <em>County of Nevada v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 663 [111 Cal.Rptr. 568, 517 P.2d 832]; <em>Alfred B. v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 718 [91 Cal.Rptr. 605, 478 P.2d 37]; <em>In re Chargin </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 617 [87 Cal.Rptr. 709, 471 P.2d 29]; <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 332 [85 Cal.Rptr. 136, 466 P.2d 680]; <em>Cline v. Credit Bureau Of Santa Clara Valley </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 908 [83 Cal.Rptr. 669, 464 P.2d 125]; <em>County of San Diego v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 677 [83 Cal.Rptr. 607, 464 P.2d 63]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Seals </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 574 [82 Cal.Rptr. 873, 462 P.2d 993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Of course, an adequate abbreviated opinion must not mask an inadequate abbreviated appellate review. A memorandum opinion, no matter its format, should represent the end product of an internal evaluation by the court and its staff sufficient to ensure that the disposition reflects the correct legal result. Ordinarily, the process will include substantiation of the material facts cited by the parties and confirmation of the controlling law, whether or not cited by the parties, and a thorough analysis of the arguments of the parties based upon the material facts and the applicable law. (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 682, p. 716.) When appropriate, the court always has the option of requesting supplemental briefing on any issue, raised or not by the briefs, the court believes might be dispositive. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 68081; <em>Public Resources Protection Assn. v. Dept. of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 111, 117, fn. 6 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 11, 865 P.2d 728].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Finally, a memorandum opinion does not impede a party\u2019s ability to secure review by the California Supreme Court. First, the Supreme Court generally acts only where necessary to secure uniformity of decision or to settle an important question of law in matters of statewide impact. (Rule 29(a); <em>In re Marriage of Assemi </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 912 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 265, 872 P.2d 1190] (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>Southern Cal. Ch. of Associated Builders etc. Com. v. California Apprenticeship Council </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 422, 431, fn. 3 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 491, 841 P.2d 1011].) Issues of this scale are not appropriate for memorandum dispositions, and thus likely will not be candidates for Supreme Court attention. <em>(Lewis v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1264; <em>People v. Groves </em>(1935) 9 Cal.App.2d 317, 321-324 [49 P.2d 888, 50 P.2d 813].) Second, if a party disagrees with the Court of Appeal\u2019s selection of the material facts or identification of the applicable law, the party can petition for a rehearing and point out the deficiencies in the court\u2019s opinion. (Rule 29(b)(2); see <em>Torres v. Parkhouse Tire Service, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 995, 1000, fn. 2 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 30 P.3d 57]; <em>People v. Slayton </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1076, 1083, fn. 6 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 32 P.3d 1073]; <em>Lewis v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1264; <em>Artiglio v. Corning, Inc. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 604, 608, fn. 2 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 479, 957 P.2d 1313]; <em>People v. Groves, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.2d at pp. 321-324.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The sentence as to count 8 is vacated, and the matter is remanded for resentencing on that count alone.

Appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing questioned whether our limited factual references illegally hampered his right to petition for review in the California Supreme Court. In a subsequent letter brief, however, appellant acknowledged that our opinion did not prejudice his right to seek review because California Rules of Court, rule 29(b)(2) permitted him to point out, in a petition for rehearing in this court, any omitted fact he claimed was critical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent citations to a rule shall be to the identified rule of the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> All unpublished decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit are memorandum dispositions.
