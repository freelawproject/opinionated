J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQo\">In this water law action, the State Water Resources Control Board (the Board) seeks a writ of mandate to vacate the order of respondent superior court disqualifying the California Attorney General\u2019s Office from further representing the Board because the Attorney General also is representing the Department of Fish and Game (DF&amp;G) in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The disqualification order was based on Water Code section 186 (hereafter section 186), which provides in part: \u201cThe Attorney General shall represent the board and the state in litigation concerning affairs of the board unless another state agency, represented by the Attorney General, is a party to the action. In such case the legal counsel of the board shall represent the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">As we will explain, respondent superior court correctly held that section 186 precludes the Attorney General from simultaneously representing the Board and DF&amp;G, another state agency, in litigation concerning affairs of the Board. However, the court incorrectly concluded that DF&amp;G may not choose to retain separate counsel, thus avoiding the prohibited dual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Hence, we shall issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its order disqualifying the Attorney General from representing the Board and to reconsider the motion, taking into account whether DF&amp;G obtains counsel to substitute for the Attorney General in the underlying superior court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">In 1991, DF&amp;G completed a fisheries management plan for the lower Yuba River and asked the Board to conduct an administrative hearing to review and revise stream flow and temperature requirements on the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>The Board conducted hearings in 1992 and 2000, during which DF&amp;G was represented by deputy attorneys general assigned from the Sacramento office of the Attorney General\u2019s natural resources section.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In March 2001, the Board adopted its Water Right Decision No. 1644, which amends several water right permits and licenses and requires other actions to protect fish in the lower Yuba River.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Yuba County Water Agency (YCWA) and the Browns Valley Irrigation District (Browns Valley) then commenced litigation challenging Water Right Decision No. 1644. YCWA and Browns Valley filed two petitions for writs of mandate each in the respondent superior court (the court); one of the petitions was combined with a complaint for inverse condemnation. All four of the petitions named DF&amp;G as a real party in interest. Other parties filed three additional petitions challenging Water Right Decision No. 1644. The court ordered the seven cases consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In May 2001, YCWA and Browns Valley separately filed motions to disqualify the Attorney General from representing the Board in the consolidated cases. They argued section 186 precludes the Attorney General from representing the Board because deputy attorneys general had entered appearances on behalf of both the Board and DF&amp;G. YCWA and Browns Valley also argued section 186 requires the Board\u2019s legal counsel to represent the Board in the consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The Board, represented by deputy attorneys general from the Attorney General\u2019s San Francisco Office, filed opposition to the motion. Among other things, the Board asserted that the Attorney General had advised the Board and DF&amp;G of the potential conflicts of interest which might arise as a result of the Attorney General\u2019s representation of both agencies; that both agencies had consented to continued representation by the Attorney General; and that the \u201cconsent agreements\u201d memorializing the agencies\u2019 agreement would be provided to the court during the hearing on the motion to disqualify. The Board further asserted that, even if section 186 disqualifies the Attorney General from simultaneously representing DF&amp;G and the Board, it does not require disqualification \u201c[i]f [DF&amp;G] obtains outside counsel to represent it in these cases . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">DF&amp;G, represented by deputy attorneys general from the Attorney General\u2019s Sacramento Office, also opposed the motion to disqualify the Attorney General DF&amp;G supported its opposition with a declaration stating that, since 1991, the deputy attorneys general from the Attorney General\u2019s Sacramento Office assigned to represent DF&amp;G and the deputy attorneys general from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>the Attorney General\u2019s San Francisco Office assigned to represent the Board \u201chave not had any discussions nor exchanged or circulated any document relating to the Board\u2019s lower Yuba River adjudicatory proceedings that reflect any attorney-client or work-product materials or that would have resulted in any <em>ex parte </em>communications as described in section 11430.10 of the Government Code.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">During the hearing on the motion to disqualify, the court allowed the Board to file under seal a copy of the consent agreement between the Board and the Attorney General\u2014although the court stated it would not admit the agreement into evidence and did not intend to look at it. DF&amp;G then asked to file under seal a copy of the consent agreement between DF&amp;G and the Attorney General, but the court did not rule on DF&amp;G\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">After hearing argument, the court granted the motion to disqualify the Attorney General from representing the Board. DF&amp;G and the Board then asked the court to allow DF&amp;G to obtain separate counsel in order to permit the Attorney General to continue to represent the Board. The court replied that it would not change the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The Board has challenged the court\u2019s order by filing both a notice of appeal and a petition for writ of mandate. We stayed further superior court proceedings in the consolidated cases pending filing of opposition and further order of this court. The appeal is pending in <em>Browns Valley Irrigation Dist. v. State Water Resources Control Bd., </em>C039613.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">While an order disqualifying an attorney is appealable (e.g., <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1050, 1052-1053, fn. 1 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 228]), the order also is subject to review by an extraordinary writ petition <em>(Chambers v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 893, 896-897 [175 Cal.Rptr. 575]). Indeed, \u201c[a] petition for extraordinary relief on the merits accompanied by a request for an immediate stay is preferable, because generally extraordinary writs are determined more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>speedily than appeals. The specter of [improper] disqualification of counsel should not be allowed to hover over the proceedings for an extended period of time for an appeal.\u201d <em>(Reed v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 448, 455 [92 Cal.App.4th 1346b, 111 Cal.Rptr.2d 842].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Accordingly, this case is appropriate for extraordinary writ review. It also is appropriate for issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance. <em>(Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 178 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893] <em>(Palma); </em>see <em>Ng v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 29, 35 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 856, 840 P.2d 961] <em>[Palma </em>procedure proper when \u201cthere has been clear error under well-settled principles of law and undisputed facts ... or when there is an unusual urgency requiring acceleration of the normal process\u201d].) Not only is the disqualification issue resolved by application of an unambiguous statute, a delay caused by protracted consideration of the issue may cause substantial harm to YCWA and Browns Valley.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">After receiving opposition to the writ petition, we notified the parties that we were considering the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance. We have now received the joint supplemental opposition filed by YCWA and Browns Valley. Thus, we have complied with the procedures delineated in <em>Palma, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 171.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The Board begins by contending the order must be reversed because YCWA and Browns Valley lacked standing to seek the Attorney General\u2019s disqualification pursuant to section 186. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">In general, a party has standing to challenge governmental action if the party is adversely affected by the action. <em>(Carsten </em>v. <em>Psychology Examining Com. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 793, 796-797 [166 Cal.Rptr. 844, 614 P.2d 276], citing Davis, 3 Administrative Law Treatise (1958) Standing, \u00a7 22.18, p. 291.) \u201cThe purpose of a standing requirement is to ensure that the courts will decide only actual controversies between parties with a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the dispute to press their case with vigor.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number><em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 439 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, 777 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">This court recently addressed the requirements for personal standing in the analogous context of a mandamus action brought to compel a governmental entity to comply with a statute. <em>(Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 740] <em>(Waste Management).) </em> \u201cThere are two prongs to the test for the beneficial interest required to pursue an action in mandamus. The first . . . is whether the plaintiff will obtain some benefit from issuance of the writ or suffer some detriment from its denial. The plaintiff\u2019s interest must be direct . . . , and it must be substantial. . . . Also, it generally must be special in the sense that it is over and above the interest held in common by the public at large. . . . ft[] The second prong of the beneficial interest test is whether the interest the plaintiff seeks to advance is within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the legal duty asserted. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1233-1234, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In <em>Waste Management, </em>a corporation in competition with an existing landfill facility filed a petition for writ of mandate, challenging the county\u2019s decision to allow the rival facility to accept certain nonhazardous solid wastes without first undergoing review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). <em>(Waste Management, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1229-1232.) However, the corporation lacked personal standing to maintain the action because the corporation\u2019s \u201ccommercial and competitive interests are not within the zone of interests CEQA was intended to preserve or protect and cannot serve as a beneficial interest for purposes of the standing requirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Assuming the same test for beneficial interest applies here, YCWA and Browns Valley have standing to move to disqualify the Attorney General pursuant to section 186. As litigants challenging the Board\u2019s administrative decision, YCWA and Browns Valley have a direct and substantial interest in ensuring that the decision maker is neutral. This interest is greater than that of the public at large, which is not embroiled in the litigation involving the Board\u2019s decision. Indeed, if YCWA and Browns Valley had not brought to the court\u2019s attention the failure to comply with section 186, it is doubtful that anyone else would have done so. Moreover, this interest is within the zone of interests which section 186 is designed to protect by ensuring that separate counsel represent the decision maker, i.e., the Board, and any other state agency also involved in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Nevertheless, the Board asserts that YCWA and Browns Valley lack standing because \u201conly a present or former client can move a court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>disqualify an attorney based on an alleged conflict.\u201d We need not decide whether this assertion of law is correct. YCWA and Browns Valley did not move to disqualify the Attorney General based on a claim of an actual conflict of interest; rather, their motions were premised on the Attorney General\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory mandate of section 186. YCWA and Browns Valley alluded to the purported conflict of interest between the Attorney General and its two clients only in support of its argument under section 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that YCWA and Browns Valley have standing to raise the violation of section 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Next, the Board argues that \u201cthe superior court abused its discretion in interpreting Water Code[] section 186[] to completely deprive the [Board] of its right to employ cqunsel of its choice in these cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Section 186 states in pertinent part: \u201cThe board shall have such powers, and may employ such legal counsel and other personnel and assistance, as may be necessary or convenient for the exercise of its duties authorized by law. [1[] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [f] <em>The Attorney General shall represent the board and the state in litigation concerning affairs of the board unless another state agency, represented by the Attorney General, is a party to the action. In such case the legal counsel of the board shall represent the board. </em>Sections 11041, 11042, and 11043 of the Government Code are not applicable to the State Water Resources Control Board. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">This is a simple, straightforward directive.  Because there is no ambiguity in its language, we \u201cpresume the Legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.\u201d <em>(People v. Snook </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1210, 1215 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 947 P.2d 808]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 107, 119 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 90].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Section 186 unambiguously requires the Board\u2019s legal counsel, not the Attorney General, to represent the Board when another state agency, represented by the Attorney General, is a party to the action. The application of this rule leads to two obvious conclusions: First, as long as DF&amp;G is represented by the Attorney General, the Board may not be represented by the Attorney General and must be represented by the Board\u2019s legal counsel. Second, if DF&amp;G obtains outside counsel to substitute in the place of the Attorney General, the Board may be represented by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Despite the plain meaning of the statute, the Board argues that section 186 should not be interpreted in this manner because it (1) denies the Board the \u201cright to choose counsel\u201d in derogation of the policy set out in the first sentence of the statute, and (2) achieves the \u201cabsurd result\u201d that the Board is denied the \u201cright. . . to be represented by counsel of [its] choice even if it is the same counsel as another party in the litigation,\u201d thereby \u201cput[ting] the [Board] at a disadvantage to all other litigants\u201d by making it \u201crely on counsel with limited experience in litigation.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The first paragraph of section 186 expresses the general rule that the Board may employ legal counsel \u201cas may be necessary or convenient for the exercise of its duties authorized by law.\u201d But that general rule is limited by the more specific provision in the third paragraph of the statute, to wit, when the Attorney General represents another state agency in litigation concerning affairs of the Board, the Board cannot be represented by the Attorney General and, instead, must be represented by the Board\u2019s legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">This does not mean, and the court did not direct, that the Board must be represented <em>exclusively </em>by its general counsel. To the extent it is authorized by law to do so, the Board also may retain outside counsel; but that additional counsel may not be in the service of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Nor does the plain language of section 186 achieve an absurd result. The Legislature may well have been concerned about the possibility or appearance of impropriety in the Attorney General\u2019s simultaneous representation of the Board, an administrative decisionmaking body, and another state agency involved in litigation concerning affairs of the Board. The plain language of section 186 allows no exception based on a waiver by the Board and the other state agency of any conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">However, we agree with the Board that the court erred by, in the Board\u2019s words, \u201crefus[ing] to allow the [Attorney General] to represent the [Board] even if [DF&amp;G] employed counsel other than the [Attorney General], thereby removing the case from the prohibition of . . . section 186 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">The statutory prohibition of simultaneous representation by the Attorney General applies solely where \u201canother state agency, <em>represented by the [Attorney </em>General], is a party to the action.\u201d (\u00a7 186, italics added.) If DF&amp;G retains outside counsel in substitution for the Attorney General, the statutory prohibition no longer will apply. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 11040, subds. (a) &amp; (c); <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Fish &amp; Game </em>v. <em>Attransco, Inc. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>1926, 1930-1937 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 661] [DF&amp;G may hire outside counsel if written consent is obtained from the Attorney General].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Lastly, we reject the argument of YCWA and Browns Valley that the doctrines of unclean hands and laches preclude us from granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">YCWA and Browns Valley argue the doctrine of unclean hands applies because the Board acted illegally in violating section 186, and the Attorney General improperly raised a \u201cjoint defense privilege\u201d when the deputy attorney general representing the Board asserted the consent agreement between DF&amp;G and the Attorney General was privileged even after he had reviewed it. The contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Although incorrect, the Board\u2019s challenge to the language of section 186 is not frivolous. And, when challenged for its failure to comply with section 186, the Board sought to achieve a legitimate outcome under the statute, i.e., DF&amp;G\u2019s representation by substitute counsel and the Board\u2019s continued representation by the Attorney General At worst, the Board\u2019s assertion of a joint defense privilege could be construed as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to the consent agreements by DF&amp;G and the Board. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 912, subd. (a).) In any event, the Board and DF&amp;G have filed in this court unsealed copies of the consent agreements. Thus, the unclean hands contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">As to laches, YCWA and Browns Valley complain that the Board unreasonably delayed proposing that the Attorney General withdraw as DF&amp;G\u2019s counsel. But our review of the record reveals the Board suggested the remedy of substitute counsel for DF&amp;G at its earliest opportunity, i.e., when the Board filed its opposition to the motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its order of October 3, 2001, granting the motion to disqualify the Attorney General; to reconsider the motion, taking into account whether DF&amp;G has retained counsel to substitute for the Attorney General to represent DF&amp;G in the underlying proceedings; and to take further action consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Upon finality of this opinion, the stay of further proceedings in respondent superior court is vacated. The parties shall bear their own costs in this writ proceeding. (Cal.
