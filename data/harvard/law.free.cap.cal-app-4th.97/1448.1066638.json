Duran was also convicted of evading a police officer. The jury found firearm and street gang enhancements true, and the trial court sentenced Duran and Fonseca to prison terms of 23 years and 33 years, 4 months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we consider and reject appellants\u2019 contentions that the evidence was insufficient to prove the robberies were undertaken for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that a certified minute order documenting a third gang member\u2019s conviction for a predicate offense was not inadmissible hearsay. The minute order, coupled with a gang expert\u2019s testimony, was sufficient to establish one predicate offense. We also conclude that the People presented sufficient evidence to prove that the gang\u2019s primary activities were statutorily enumerated criminal offenses within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we address Fonseca\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by imposing a sentence enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (b) on count 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because this enhancement had previously been stricken. We also consider Duran\u2019s contentions that the evidence was insufficient to prove he was an aider and abettor in one of the robberies, and insufficient to support the firearm enhancement alleged against him. The People contend the abstract of judgment must be corrected to accurately reflect the sentence imposed on Fonseca. We correct the abstract of judgment as requested by the People. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">A. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">1. <em>Robbery of Benjamin Beckum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\"><em>On </em>December 1, 1999, Benjamin Beckum was standing outside a flower shop where he was employed. Duran and Fonseca drove past in a gold Nissan; Fonseca was driving. Beckum made eye contact with both appellants. Appellants gave Beckum a \u201cweird look.\u201d The Nissan turned and pulled behind the flower shop, and Beckum lost sight of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">Approximately five minutes later, Beckum saw Fonseca at a pay telephone outside the flower shop. Fonseca indicated he was having difficulty with the telephone and asked whether Beckum had a calling card. Beckum said he did not, and approached to examine the telephone. Fonseca hung up and asked, \u201cDo you see those chains right there,\u201d referring to two gold chains Beckum was wearing. Beckum looked down at the chains. When he looked up again, Fonseca was displaying a black, pearl-handled revolver. Beckum observed the gold Nissan stopped in the middle of the street, approximately 300 feet away. After grabbing the chains from Beckum\u2019s neck, Fonseca ran to and entered the gold Nissan. Duran, who was driving, \u201ctook off.\u201d Beckum later identified both Duran and Fonseca from a photographic lineup and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">2. <em>Robbery of Julio R. and Duran\u2019s evasion of police officers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">On December 3, 1999, appellants robbed 16-year-old Julio R. as he walked home from school. Appellants were passengers in a car that pulled up alongside Julio R. Fonseca approached Julio R. with a baseball bat and asked, \u201c[Wjhere are you from?\u201d Julio R. understood this as a request to identify his gang affiliation. Julio R. replied, \u201cNowhere,\u201d meaning he was not a gang member. Fonseca motioned at Julio R. with the bat. Duran pointed a gun at Julio R. during the robbery, forcing him to surrender his watch. Julio R. testified that Fonseca had \u201cF13\u201d tattooed at the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-11\">On December 6, 1999, Duran, driving the gold Nissan, led Los Angeles police officers on a brief high-speed chase that ended when Duran crashed into a van. Fonseca had exited the car and fled from officers at the outset of the chase. Officers found a handgun lying on the ground outside the car at the crash scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>3. <em>Evidence relating to the criminal street gang enhancement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Officer Steve Burciaga, a KF/z-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department who was assigned to an antigang unit, testified as an expert on gangs in the Los Angeles area. Burciaga\u2019s duties included gathering gang intelligence and documenting information on gang members. Burciaga had interviewed hundreds of gang members, including over 100 members of the Florencia 13 gang, in the Los Angeles area. He had also arrested gang members associated with narcotics activity, investigated gang-related homicides, and had worked as a gang detective investigating gang-related crimes. According to Burciaga, the Florencia 13 was a large, well-established Hispanic gang with over 200 members; it claimed as its territory the area around Harvard Park, among other areas. The Florencia 13 was identified with distinctive hand symbols and graffiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">Burciaga opined that the Florencia 13 gang had \u201cseveral\u201d primary activities; the \u201cmain one\u201d was \u201cputting fear into the community\u201d by committing robberies, assaults with deadly weapons, and narcotics sales. Community intimidation serves a gang\u2019s interests by causing witnesses to refuse to testify against gang members. Robberies serve a gang\u2019s interests because the robbery proceeds are often distributed among the gang\u2019s members. The perpetrators of a robbery gain stature in the gang by showing their willingness to commit crimes for the gang. Narcotics sales benefit a gang by providing a source of income for gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">Burciaga had spoken with Duran and Fonseca on numerous occasions. Both had admitted to membership in the Florencia 13 gang. Burciaga explained that the Florencia 13 used \u201cFI 3\u201d as a symbol identifying the gang. Tattoos represented a commitment to one\u2019s gang, and an \u201cF13\u201d on the face was an outward statement claiming Florencia 13 gang membership. Burciaga testified that appellants both had tattoos related to gang membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">When given a hypothetical based upon the facts of the case, Burciaga opined that the robberies were committed for the benefit of the Florencia 13 gang. Such robberies would benefit the gang by providing financial support, controlling the gang\u2019s territory, and generally intimidating local residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">Burciaga had personally spoken with Octavio Aldaco and had reviewed Aldaco\u2019s \u201crap sheet\u201d and other records. Aldaco was a Florencia 13 gang member and had been a member in 1997. Burciaga\u2019s opinion was based upon his personal experiences and dealings with Aldaco, his discussions with other officers who had had contacts with Aldaco, and Aldaco\u2019s personal admissions to Burciaga that he was a Florencia 13 member. A certified court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>minute order dated May 18, 1998, documented that Aldaco had pleaded guilty and had been convicted of felony possession of cocaine base for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5) in case No. BA164005 on that date. Over appellants\u2019 hearsay objections, the People introduced the minute order into evidence. Burciaga believed, based upon his contacts with Aldaco, his experience, and his review of the minute order, that the Octavio Aldaco referenced therein was the same Octavio Aldaco he knew to be a Florencia 13 gang member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">B. <em>Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Trial was by jury. Appellants were convicted of the second degree robberies of Beckum and Julio R. (\u00a7 211). The jury found true allegations that the robberies were committed on behalf of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)); that a principal personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)); that Duran personally used a firearm in the robbery of Julio R. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b), 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)); and that Fonseca personally used a firearm during commission of the robberies (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1), 12022.53, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury further found Duran guilty of evading a police officer with willful disregard (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a)). The trial court found true an allegation that Fonseca had suffered a conviction for robbery, a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and section 667, subdivision (a)(1). It sentenced Fonseca to a term of 33 years, 4 months in prison pursuant to the Three Strikes law, and Duran to a total term of 23 years in prison. It also imposed various fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence to prove the gang enhancements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">Appellants contend the evidence was insufficient to support the true findings on the gang enhancements, because the People failed to prove that (1) the Florencia 13 gang engaged in a pattern of criminal activity; and (2) one of the gang\u2019s primary activities was a statutorily enumerated criminal offense. We conclude the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to prove both challenged elements of the gang enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">1. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">When determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>to the judgment to determine \u201c \u2018whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014 that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 496 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754]; <em>People v. Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 667 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213].) \u201cWe draw all reasonable inferences in support of the judgment.

Reversal is not warranted unless it appears \u201c \u2018that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the conviction].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 331 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">2. <em>The evidence was sufficient to prove the robbery of Beckum was committed on behalf of a criminal street gang.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) imposes additional punishment when a defendant commits a felony for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. To establish that a group is a criminal street gang within the meaning of the statute, the People must prove: (1) the group is an ongoing association of three or more persons sharing a common name, identifying sign, or symbol; (2) one of the group\u2019s primary activities is the commission of one or more statutorily enumerated criminal offenses; and (3) the group\u2019s members must engage in, or have engaged in, a pattern of criminal gang activity. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sengpadychith </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 316, 319-320 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 27 P.3d 739]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 616-617 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713]; <em>People v. Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 8 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">A \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d is defined as gang members\u2019 individual or collective \u201ccommission of, attempted commission of, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of, sustained juvenile petition for, or conviction of two or more\u201d enumerated \u201cpredicate offenses\u201d during a statutorily defined time period. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 617.) The predicate offenses must have been committed on separate occasions, or by two or more persons. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e); <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 9-10.)  The charged crime may serve as a predicate offense <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>at p. 625; <em>People v. Olguin, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383), as can \u201cevidence of the offense with which the defendant is charged and proof of another offense committed on the same occasion by a fellow gang member.\u201d <em>(People v. Loeun, supra, </em>at p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>a. <em>The evidence was sufficient to prove a pattern of criminal gang activity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Appellants assert that the evidence was insufficient to prove the required two predicate offenses.  Appellants do not dispute that the charged offense, the robbery of Beckum, counted as one predicate offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 625; <em>People v. Olguin, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383.)  However, they urge that the prosecution failed to prove a second predicate offense. They contend: (1) the Julio R. robbery could not be a predicate offense in regard to the gang enhancement charged on the Beckum robbery, because the Julio R. robbery occurred <em>after </em>the Beckum robbery; and (2) the certified minute order documenting the Aldaco conviction was inadmissible hearsay. Duran further argues that, even assuming the minute order was admissible, there was an insufficient showing that the Octavio Aldaco reflected in the minute order was the same Octavio Aldaco whom Burciaga knew to be a Florencia 13 gang member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">Contrary to the People\u2019s contention, appellants are correct that the Julio R. robbery could not be used as a predicate offense to prove the gang enhancement alleged in connection with the Beckum robbery. The Beckum robbery occurred on December 1, 1999; the Julio R. robbery occurred on December 3, 1999. Crimes occurring <em>after </em>the charged offense cannot serve as predicate offenses to prove a pattern of criminal gang activity. <em>(People v. Godinez </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1365, 1368-1370 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 164]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olguin, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">However, the People adequately proved the second predicate offense through evidence of the Aldaco conviction. Burciaga\u2019s testimony, coupled with the minute order, was sufficient to prove Florencia 13 member Aldaco pleaded guilty to violation of Health and Safety Code section 11351.5, possession of cocaine base for sale, on May 18, 1998. This offense is one of the statutorily enumerated offenses (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e)(4)) and occurred within the specified time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>(i) <em>Admission of the certified minute order was not barred by the hearsay rule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention that the certified minute order documenting the Aldaco conviction was hearsay and thus inadmissible to prove a predicate offense. Appellants point to <em>People v. Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938], for the proposition that a court record of conviction is hearsay when offered to prove that the person adjudged guilty actually committed the crime. Appellants\u2019 argument, however, fails to take into account intervening changes in the law since <em>Wheeler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\"><em>Wheeler </em>did not address section 186.22; it concerned whether witnesses in a criminal proceeding might be impeached with misdemeanor convictions. The court held that after passage of Proposition 8\u2019s Truth-in-Evidence amendment to the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d)), evidence of past misdemeanor conduct bearing on a witness\u2019s veracity was admissible in a criminal proceeding subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion. (P<em>eople v. Wheeler, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 295.) However, <em>Wheeler </em>held that the conviction itself was inadmissible hearsay when offered to prove that the witness committed the misconduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 297.) The court relied upon a statement of the California Law Revision Commission that, \u201c \u2018Analytically, a judgment that is offered to prove the matters determined by the judgment is hearsay evidence. [Citations.] It is in substance a statement of the court that determined the previous action [i.e., other than by a testifying witness] . . . that is offered \u201cto prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d [Citation.] Therefore, <em>unless an exception to the hearsay rule is provided, </em>a judgment would be inadmissible if offered in a subsequent action to prove the matters determined.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298, quoting Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1966 ed.) foll. \u00a7 1300, pp. 342-343, italics added.) <em>Wheeler </em>rejected the argument that the fact of conviction alone was relevant to a witness\u2019s credibility; instead, \u201ca witness\u2019s prior convictions are relevant for impeachment, if at all, only insofar as they prove criminal <em>conduct </em>from which the factfinder could infer a character inconsistent with honesty and veracity. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>at p. 299.) Accordingly, the court held, \u201cevidence of a misdemeanor <em>conviction, </em>whether documentary or testimonial, is inadmissible hearsay when offered to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300.) The court also rejected arguments that misdemeanor convictions were admissible under the business or official records exceptions to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1271, 1280), because such a record is \u201ccompetent only to prove the <em>act it records. </em>Thus, while the documentary evidence of a conviction may be admissible to prove that the conviction occurred, the business or official records exceptions do not make the abstract of judgment admissible to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>that the witness committed the underlying criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>at p. 300, fn. 13.) <em>Wheeler </em>noted, however, that the Legislature was not precluded from creating a hearsay exception that would allow the use of misdemeanor convictions for impeachment in criminal trials. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">In <em>People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at page 624, footnote 11, the court referenced <em>Wheeler </em>and expressly declined to address whether a section 186,22 predicate offense could be proved through \u201cinformations and other official court records\u201d <em>(Gardeley, </em>at p. 624) documenting a conviction, or whether such records would constitute inadmissible hearsay when offered to prove \u201cmatters determined by that judgment (namely, that [a gang member] committed the crime of which he was convicted) . . . .\u201d The court found it unnecessary to address the issue because the defendants in <em>Gardeley </em>had not raised a hearsay objection at trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">In 1996, the Legislature enacted Evidence Code section 452.5, which provides the type of hearsay exception contemplated in <em>Wheeler. </em>Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (a) provides that the official records of which a court may take judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d)) include certain computer-generated official court records. Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b), the provision more directly pertinent to the question before us, states, \u201cAn official record of conviction certified in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 1530 is admissible pursuant to Section 1280 <em>to prove the commission, attempted commission, or solicitation of a criminal offense, prior conviction, service of a prison term, or other act, condition, or event recorded by the </em>record.\u201d (Italics added.) Evidence Code section 452.5 was enacted as part of the Criminal Convictions Record Act (CCRA). (Stats. 1996, ch. 642, \u00a7 3; <em>People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 118 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563].) The Legislature\u2019s stated purpose in enacting the CCRA was to \u201csimplify recordkeeping and admission in evidence of records of criminal convictions by establishing a central computer data base of that data, and by authorizing admission in evidence of this computer data.\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 642, \u00a7 2; see also <em>People v. Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">We conclude that Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b) creates a hearsay exception allowing admission of qualifying court records to prove not only the fact of conviction, but also that the offense reflected in the record occurred.  In construing a statute, we attempt to ascertain and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 621.) \u201cWe turn first to the words of the statute themselves, recognizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>that \u2018they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Here, the language of Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b) is clear and unambiguous. By its terms, certified records of conviction fall within the definition of official records contained in Evidence Code section 1280 (the official records exception to the hearsay rule), and are per se admissible as such. Moreover, a certified official record of conviction is admissible to prove not only the <em>fact </em>of a conviction, but also that the offense reflected in the record occurred. We can conceive of no other meaning for Evidence Code section 452.5\u2019s declaration that a certified official record of conviction is admissible to prove, not only a prior conviction, but also \u201cthe commission\u201d of a criminal offense, and an \u201cact\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d recorded by the record. This understanding of the statute is reflected in the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest for the bill enacting the CCRA, which stated that the CCRA would, among other things, \u201cauthorize the admission in evidence of these [computer-generated] records to prove specified facts.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1387 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.), Stats. 1996, ch. 642.) While the Legislature\u2019s statement of purpose and the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest directly reference the computer-generated records, the underlying legislative goals of simplifying and facilitating the admission of evidence of records of criminal convictions are equally effectuated by subdivision (b). Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b) does not limit the statute\u2019s purview to computer-generated court records, but broadly includes \u201can official record of conviction\u201d certified as specified in Evidence Code section 1530.  Thus, we conclude that Evidence Code section 452.5 states a new hearsay exception for certified official records of conviction, which may be offered to prove not only the fact of a conviction, but the commission of the underlying offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>Evidence Code section 452.5 does not define the term \u201cofficial record of conviction,\u201d but a certified minute order clearly falls within this definition. In an analogous context, courts have considered \u201cwhat comprises the record of conviction to which the trier of fact may look to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a serious felony. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Woodell </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 448, 454 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 950 P.2d 85].) Those authorities have generally held that the record of conviction includes the trial court record. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 455-456; e.g., <em>People v. Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193, 1195 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301] [\u201cthe trier of fact may consider the entire record of the proceedings leading to imposition of judgment on the prior conviction\u201d to determine whether foreign conviction is serious felony for purposes of enhancement statute]; see also <em>People v. Houck </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 350, 355 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 837].) The trial court record includes, inter alia, all minutes of the court relating to the action. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 33(a)(1); <em>People v. Abarca </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1347, 1350 [285 Cal.Rptr. 213] [record of prior conviction includes \u201call items that could have been used on appeal of that prior conviction, specifically, any items considered a normal part of the record under California Rules of Court, rule 33 or by which it could be augmented pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 12.\u201d].) While courts have noted that \u201c[t]he exact parameters of \u2018record of conviction\u2019 are yet to be defined\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Houck, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 355), there seems little doubt that a minute order reflecting a guilty plea must fall within any definition of the record of conviction. Here, the prosecutor represented, and the parties did not challenge, that the minute order was properly certified. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1530.) There is no question that the minute order reliably reflects the judgment imposed by the trial court. Therefore, pursuant to Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b), the certified minute order was admissible as an official record to prove the Aldaco conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>(ii) <em>The evidence was sufficient to prove Aldaco was a Florencia 13 gang member.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Finally, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to establish that the Octavio Aldaco referenced in the certified minute order and the Octavio Aldaco known to Officer Burciaga as a Florencia 13 member were one and the same person. Duran argues the evidence was insufficient because Burciaga did not testify to his personal knowledge or observation of proceedings against Aldaco in case No. BA164005 (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1456), nor did the minute order contain a photograph from which Burciaga could have confirmed Aldaco\u2019s identity. Therefore, he urges, Burciaga\u2019s testimony was \u201cpure speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">We conclude the evidence was sufficient. The minute order established the date and nature of Aldaco\u2019s conviction. This evidence was unlike the conclusionary, nonspecific hearsay and arrest information deemed insufficient to establish a predicate conviction in other cases. (E.g., <em>In re Leland D. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 251, 259 [272 Cal.Rptr. 709].) Appellants did not challenge Burciaga\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert. Burciaga was properly allowed to testify as an expert regarding the gang enhancement, and the question of the requisite predicate offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 619-620, 624-626 [gang expert\u2019s testimony, which provided much evidence necessary to establish that gang met definition of criminal street gang under \u00a7 186.22, subd. (f), was properly admitted]; <em>People v. Villegas </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] [predicate offense was sufficiently established by testimony of gang expert and documentary evidence]; <em>People v. Valdez </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 494, 506 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 135] [where a gang enhancement is alleged, \u201cexpert testimony concerning the culture, habits, and psychology of gangs is permissible because these subjects are \u2018sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gamez </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 957, 965-966 [286 Cal.Rptr. 894] [expert testimony regarding gang\u2019s activities may often be required to establish gang\u2019s past criminal conduct and ongoing criminal nature], overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>at p. 624, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Expert testimony may be founded on material that is not admitted into evidence and on evidence that is ordinarily inadmissible, such as hearsay, as long as the material is reliable and of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions. <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 618.) Thus, a gang expert may rely upon conversations with gang members, his or her personal investigations of gang-related crimes, and information obtained from colleagues and other law enforcement agencies. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 620; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olguin, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>1384-1385; <em>People v. Gamez, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 967-968.) Likewise, an individual\u2019s membership in a criminal street gang is a proper subject for expert testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at pp. 506-507; <em>People v. Gamez, supra, </em>at p. 965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Burciaga unequivocally testified that the minute order reflected the conviction of the Octavio Aldaco he knew. Burciaga personally knew Aldaco, had seen Aldaco\u2019s records and \u201crap sheet,\u201d and had reviewed the certified minute order. Burciaga\u2019s expert testimony was based upon his field experience, his conversations with Aldaco, and the information contained in the minute order. Appellants cite no authority persuading us that this basis for Burciaga\u2019s testimony was improper. Burciaga\u2019s testimony, coupled with the minute order, was thus sufficient to prove the predicate offense. <em>(People v. Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 613, 624 [expert\u2019s testimony that individual was a gang member, coupled with evidence of the gang member\u2019s conviction for statutorily enumerated offense, was sufficient to prove predicate offense].) Accordingly, we find the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to reasonably find the Florenica 13 gang engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">b. <em>Evidence of the gang\u2019s primary activities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Appellants next urge that there was insufficient evidence to prove the Florencia 13\u2019s primary activity was one of the statutorily enumerated criminal offenses, as required for a true finding on the gang enhancement. Evidence regarding the gang\u2019s primary activities was adduced through the testimony of Officer Burciaga. Appellants point out that Burciaga stated the gang\u2019s primary activity was \u201cputting fear into the community,\u201d an activity not listed as one of the statutorily enumerated criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">\u201cTo trigger the gang statute\u2019s sentence enhancement provision [citation], the trier of fact must find that one of the alleged criminal street gang\u2019s primary activities is the commission of one or more of certain crimes listed in the gang statute.\u201d <em>(People v. Sengpadychith, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 322.)  \u201cThe phrase \u2018primary activities,\u2019 as used in the gang statute, implies that the commission of one or more of the statutorily enumerated crimes be one of the group\u2019s \u2018chief\u2019 or \u2018principal\u2019 occupations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 323.) Proof that a gang\u2019s members consistently and repeatedly have committed criminal activity listed in section 186.22, subdivision (e) is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>establish the gang\u2019s primary activities. On the other hand, proof of only the occasional commission of crimes by the gang\u2019s members is insufficient. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 323-324.) Past offenses, as well as the circumstances of the charged crime, have some tendency in reason to prove the group\u2019s primary activities, and thus both may be considered by the jury on the issue of the group\u2019s primary activities. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 320, 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the Florencia 13\u2019s primary activities were statutorily enumerated criminal offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and narcotics sales are all enumerated offenses. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e)(1), (2), &amp; (4).) As explained <em>ante, </em>Burciaga testified as an expert, based in part upon his personal experience in the field gathering gang intelligence, contacting gang members, and investigating gang-related crimes. The testimony of a gang expert, founded on his or her conversations with gang members, personal investigation of crimes committed by gang members, and information obtained from colleagues in his or her own and other law enforcement agencies, may be sufficient to prove a gang\u2019s primary activities. <em>(People v. Sengpadychith, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 324; <em>In re Nathaniel C. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 990, 1005 [279 Cal.Rptr. 236] [primary activities element is a proper subject of expert opinion].) Viewed in context, Burciaga\u2019s testimony does not bear the characterization suggested by appellants. When asked what the Florencia 13\u2019s primary activities were, Burciaga replied, \u201cThere\u2019s several. The main one is putting fear into the community. [H] <em>Now, when I say that, what I mean is </em>often these gang members are committing robberies, assault with deadly weapons, narcotics sales, and they\u2019re doing it as a group. [H] And in doing so, they start claiming certain territories within the city . . . . [H] And they\u2019re controlling either the narcotics sales in that area, they\u2019re committing the robberies in this area, all for the purpose of fear and intimidation of the community.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">This testimony supported a jury finding that members of the Florencia 13 were engaged in more than the occasional sale of narcotics, robbery, or assault. Burciaga testified that the Florencia 13 members engaged in these activities \u201coften,\u201d indeed often enough to obtain \u201ccontrol\u201d of the narcotics trade in a certain area of Los Angeles. Evidence of the Beckum robbery and the Aldaco conviction further corroborated Burciaga\u2019s testimony, providing specific examples of Florencia 13 members\u2019 commission of robbery and narcotics offenses. We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>jury\u2019s true finding on the section 186.22 gang enhancement alleged as to the Beckum robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">B.-D<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">The judgment for appellant Fonseca is modified as set forth herein. The clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment for Fonseca consistent with the opinions set forth herein and to forward a copy to the Department of Corrections. In all other respects, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Klein, P. J., and Kitching, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">Appellants\u2019 petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied July 24, 2002. Werdegar, J., and Brown, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1165-10\"> Hereinafter, all statutory references shall be to the Penal Code, unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1165-11\"> The counts charged in the information were renumbered during the proceedings.

Duran was tried as an aider and abettor. The combined activity of a defendant and an aider and abettor to the crime results in only a single offense. <em>(People v. Zermeno (1999) 21 </em>Cal.4th 927, 928-929, 931 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 863, 986 P.2d 196].) Thus, the convictions of both the defendant and the aider and abettor can establish only one predicate offense for purposes of section 186.22. (Zermeno, at pp. 932, 933.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1173-6\"> We also note that, in this case, the certified minute order would have been admissible even apart from Evidence Code section 452.5. When <em>Gardeley </em>was decided, section 186.22, former subdivision (e) defined \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d as \u201c \u2018the commission, attempted commission, or solicitation of two or more\u2019 \u201d of the offenses enumerated therein. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 625.) In 1996, however, the Legislature amended the relevant portion of section 186.22 to read, \u201ccommission of, attempted commission of, or solicitation of, <em>sustained juvenile petition for, or conviction of </em>two or more\u201d predicate offenses. (Italics added; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 12; Stats. 1996, ch. 982, \u00a7 1.) This change in language plainly indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent that the section 186.22 predicate offenses may be proved by a showing of the fact of the convictions, rather than proof of the underlying conduct, if the People so choose. Were it otherwise, the amended language would have served no purpose. (E.g., <em>People v. Loeun, supra, </em>at p. 9 [we avoid statutory interpretations that render words surplusage].) Moreover, even if the statutory language could be considered ambiguous, support for our reading of the amendment to section 186.22 is found in a summary prepared for an April 16, 1996 hearing before the Assembly Committee on Public Safety. That summary explained that the addition of the language to section 186.22 would \u201c \u2018make it more practical for prosecutors to apply the [Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention] Act by allowing the use of previous court records as proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>the predicate acts instead of requiring witnesses to the original crime to testify anew,\u2019 \u201d in order to \u201c \u2018provide[] for a more efficient and expeditious delivery of justice to the victims of criminal street gang violence.\u2019 \u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2035 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 8, 1996, p. 2.) Even before enactment of Evidence Code section 452.5, <em>Wheeler </em>observed, \u201cdocumentary evidence of a conviction may be admissible to prove <em>that the conviction </em>occurred. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 300, fn. 13, italics added; e.g., <em>People v. Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1295, fn. 36 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1] [the official records exception to the hearsay rule \u201cpermits use of the record only to establish that a judgment was entered, not to establish that guilt has been determined. [Citations.]\u201d.) The minute order would have qualified as an official record even absent Evidence Code section 452.5, subdivision (b). The minute order was made within the scope of a public employee\u2019s duty. (E.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 69844 [requiring clerk of superior court to keep minutes and other records of the court].) The minute order stated it was printed on May 18, 1998, the same date Aldaco pleaded guilty, establishing that it was created at or near the time of the plea. Likewise, the trustworthiness requirement was met. We presume the official duty has been regularly performed (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664), and this presumption applies to the actions of trial judges and court clerks. <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 125.) This presumption is sufficient to satisfy the trustworthiness requirement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1176-8\"> Because we conclude the evidence of the Beckum robbery and the Aldaco conviction was sufficient to establish the predicate offenses, we do not reach appellants\u2019 contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish that assault with a deadly weapon was a predicate offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1177-7\"> We assume arguendo that the gang\u2019s goal of \u201cputting fear into the community,\u201d as stated by Burciaga, was not equivalent to a statement that the gang engaged in the victim and witness intimidation prohibited by section 136.1, an offense enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e)(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1178-9\"> Duran contends that because there was insufficient evidence the robbery of Beckum was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, he could not be charged and sentenced as a principal on count 4.
