J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">By way of its petition for extraordinary relief defendant Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (Mass Mutual) challenges the trial court\u2019s order certifying as a plaintiffs\u2019 class 33,000 people who, over a course of 15 years, purchased a particular type of life insurance product from Mass Mutual. We issued an order to show cause and have received a response from the plaintiffs and real parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The product the plaintiffs purchased not only provided insurance coverage and a guaranteed return on accumulated premium, but also permitted plaintiffs to share in dividends which the company declared on a discretionary basis. In theory and as suggested by Mass Mutual\u2019s agents in sales presentations, over time the principal amount of accumulated premiums would be large enough so that the amount of the discretionary dividend would pay the annual premium due on the policy. In the insurance industry these products are genetically referred to as \u201cvanishing premium\u201d policies. Mass Mutual offered its customers what it called an N-Pay premium payment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Plaintiffs contend that at the time they purchased policies Mass Mutual was paying a discretionary dividend rate which Mass Mutual had no intention of maintaining. The plaintiffs believe they have evidence which shows Mass Mutual in fact developed plans to \u201cratchet down\u201d its dividend over time. Plaintiffs believe Mass Mutual\u2019s failure to disclose to purchasers its own conclusions about its high discretionary dividend rate and its plans to lower the rate give rise to liability for violations of California\u2019s unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) (UCL) and Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.) (CLRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">Mass Mutual contends plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not suitable for class treatment because Mass Mutual believes that each plaintiff will be required to make an individual showing of the representation he or she received. We disagree. In order to establish liability for a nondisclosure under either the UCL or the CLRA, plaintiffs need not present individual proof that each class member relied on particular representations made by Mass Mutual or its agents. Accordingly, we deny Mass Mutual\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 382 authorizes the maintenance of a class action \u201cwhen the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.\u201d  Class treatment is permissible under Code of Civil Procedure section 382 when the plaintiffs have established the existence of an ascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest. <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27].) \u201cThe community of interest\u201d requirement embodies three factors: \u201c(1) predominant common questions of law or fact; (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470 [174 Cal.Rptr. 515, 629 P.2d 23].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">A class action under the CLRA is governed exclusively by the terms of Civil Code section 1781, rather than the more general provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 382. <em>(Caro </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 655, fn. 6 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 419] <em>(Caro); Hogya v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 122, 140 [142 Cal.Rptr. 325].) However, Civil Code section 1781, subdivision (b), like Code of Civil Procedure section 382, permits a class action only when there are questions of law or fact which predominate over questions affecting individual members. <em>(Caro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 666-669.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">An appellate court \u201cwill \u2018not disturb a trial court ruling on class certification which is supported by substantial evidence unless (1) improper criteria were used [citation]; or (2) erroneous legal assumptions were made [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Caro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 655.) Where a certification order turns on inferences to be drawn from the facts, \u201c \u2018the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. 6, quoting <em>Shamblin </em>v. <em>Brattain </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 474, 478-479 [243 Cal.Rptr. 902, 749 P.2d 339].) In its order granting certification the trial court made no specific findings and no request for findings appears in the record. Thus we may also resort to the familiar rule that permits us to imply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>any findings which are necessary to support the trial court\u2019s order, so long as any such implied findings are themselves supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>In re Marriage of Cohn </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 923, 928 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 866].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">By its terms the UCL prohibits as unfair competition \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) The statute has been found to prohibit \u201cwrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.\u201d <em>(Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 111 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817], fn. omitted.)  Importantly, California courts have repeatedly held that relief under the UCL is available without individualized proof of deception, reliance and injury. <em>(Fletcher v. Security Pacific National Bank </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 442, 452-453 [153 Cal.Rptr. 28, 591 P.2d 51] (Fletcher); <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v.

Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1105 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 229], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 187 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527] and fn. 12; <em>Prata v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1144 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 296]; see also <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 134 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d 718].) Although the UCL plaintiffs do not bear the traditional burden required of victims of common law fraud, by the same token relief under the UCL is limited to injunctive relief and restitution. <em>(Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 129; <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 179.) The UCL does not provide for the recovery of damages or attorney fees. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1266-1267; <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">The leading case on what a plaintiff must establish in order to prevail on a statutory unfair trade practice claim is <em>Fletcher. </em>In <em>Fletcher, </em>a class representative alleged he and other customers of the defendant bank had been deceived by the bank\u2019s practice of calculating \u201cper annum interest\u201d on the basis of a 360-day year. The bank argued class treatment was not appropriate because it believed its liability under the false advertising law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>Business and Professions Code section 17500,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could not be established without individual proof as to the impact its activities had on each customer. <em>(Fletcher, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 450.) In rejecting the bank\u2019s argument, the court stated: \u201c[0]ur concern with thwarting unfair trade practices has been such that we have consistently condemned not only those alleged unfair practices which have in fact deceived the victims, <em>but also those which are likely to deceive them. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 451, italics added.) Thus the court concluded that under the statute \u201cthe court retains the authority to order restitution without an individualized showing on the knowledge issue if the court determines that such a remedy is necessary \u2018to prevent the use or employment\u2019 of the unfair practice at issue in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Since <em>Fletcher </em>was decided, our courts have not departed in any manner from the principle that liability for restitution under either the specific false advertising provisions of Business and Professions Code section 17500 or the broader provisions of the UCL may be found without any individualized proof of deception and solely on the basis a defendant\u2019s conduct was likely to deceive consumers. In <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>the court relied on this principle in finding that alleged misleading statements about the nature of sugared cereals were sufficient to maintain a UCL cause of action against cereal manufacturers. <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 197.) In an insurance coverage case, <em>Bank of the West, </em>the court again relied on the principle that individualized proof of deception, reliance and injury are unnecessary under the UCL. The court found this aspect of the UCL demonstrated the important deterrent purpose of the statute and concluded the statute\u2019s utility as a deterrent would be undermined if defendants were able to obtain insurance coverage for UCL claims. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The court in <em>Day v. AT &amp; T Corp. </em>considered the issue in the context of plaintiffs who alleged the defendant\u2019s practice of rounding up to the next full minute the charges incurred on prepaid phone cards was deceptive. In finding the practice was sufficient to support a claim for injunctive relief under the UCL, the court stated: \u201cBy their breadth, [(\u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17500)] encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled <em>because </em>they are untrue, but also those which may be accurate on some level, but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive. ... A perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer, such as by failure to disclose other relevant information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>is actionable under these sections.\u201d <em>(Day v. AT &amp; T Corp., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at pp. 332-333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">In <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>the court considered allegations insurers had engaged in deceptive practices in altering the manner in which earthquake coverage was offered to consumers and in handling earthquake claims. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102-1105 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 229].) In finding the insurers were subject to the remedies provided by the UCL, the court stated: \u201c[T]he \u2018fraud\u2019 contemplated by section 17200[] . . . bears little resemblance to common law fraud or deception. The test is whether the public is likely to be deceived. [Citation.] This means that a section 17200 violation, unlike common law fraud, can be shown even if no one was actually deceived, relied upon the fraudulent practice, or sustained any damage. [Citation.] No discussion is required to demonstrate that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding State Farm\u2019s allegedly fraudulent acts easily satisfy this test.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\"> More recently in <em>Praia v. Superior Court </em>the court found that a plaintiff could bring a representative action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under the UCL against a bank which promised to provide consumers 90-day \u201csame as cash\u201d financing but in fact required installment payments. The bank argued the plaintiff was not a proper representative because his experience, which involved oral statements made by a stereo salesman, was unique. Relying again on the principle that liability under the UCL depends upon whether a defendant\u2019s practices are <em>likely </em>to deceive, the court rejected the bank\u2019s contention as one which focused \u201con individual matters of proof irrelevant to liability under the UCL.\u201d <em>(Prata v. Superior Court, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>Given the wide variety of procedural and substantive contexts in which it has been applied, we are in no position to either abandon or ignore the principle set forth in <em>Fletcher </em>that relief under the UCL, including restitution, is available without proof of individual deception, reliance and injury. Rather, as the cases make clear, the power to impose a remedy under the UCL will arise whenever a defendant\u2019s business practice is likely to deceive consumers. California\u2019s UCL jurisprudence, to which we are clearly bound, distinguishes this case from the host of out of state authorities cited by Mass Mutual which have found vanishing premium claims are not suitable for class action treatment. None of the cases Mass Mutual has cited involve the UCL and its unique scope.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here plaintiffs have presented evidence Mass Mutual withheld from its customers and agents its own view of the amount of discretionary dividend it was paying. A trier of fact could find Mass Mutual\u2019s recognition that its dividend rate was excessive would have been important to prospective N Pay purchasers and that Mass Mutual\u2019s failure to disclose its own conclusions was misleading. Such a determination would in turn support a restitution order under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The record here can be readily distinguished from the circumstances we confronted in <em>South Bay Chevrolet </em>v. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 861 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 301] <em>(South Bay). </em>In <em>South Bay </em>the trial court made a factual finding that the defendant\u2019s calculation of interest on a 365/360 basis on financing the defendant provided to sophisticated automobile dealers was not likely to mislead the dealers and hence did not violate Business and Professions Code section 17200. We found substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding and affirmed its judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>(South Bay, </em>at pp. 888-890.) Unlike the record in <em>South Bay, </em>here there is not yet any factual finding members of the class were aware of Mass Mutual\u2019s assessment of its discretionary dividends and its determination to lower them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>In this regard we note that Mass Mutual has presented evidence that it warned purchasers and agents that its dividend rate was likely to be reduced. Plainly, the trial court will have to determine whether these warnings were sufficient under the UCL in light of what Mass Mutual had determined about its dividend rate. Resolution of that question, which goes solely to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, is not appropriate in determining whether a class should be certified. <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 439-441.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Similarly, evidence Mass Mutual made annual dividend decisions based on advice it received from its actuaries and evidence that prospective purchasers received differing representations from Mass Mutual\u2019s agents will not satisfy the requirements of the UCL. Under the UCL the trial court will be required to determine whether the information Mass Mutual possessed should have been disclosed given the characteristics of the N-Pay product the company was selling and other information it commonly provided policyholders. Thus plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim presents common legal and factual issues which were plainly suitable for treatment as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">The CLRA is set forth in Civil Code section 1750 et seq. Unlike the UCL, under the CLRA a consumer may recover actual damages, punitive damages and attorney fees. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1780, subds. (a)(1), (5), (d).) However, relief under the CLRA is limited to \u201c[a]ny consumer who suffers any damage <em>as a result </em>of the use or employment by any person of a method, act, or practice\u201d unlawful under the act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1780, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">As Mass Mutual argues, this limitation on relief requires that plaintiffs in a CLRA action show not only that a defendant\u2019s conduct was deceptive but that the deception caused them harm. (See <em>Caro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 667-668.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Contrary to Mass Mutual\u2019s contention, the causation required by Civil Code section 1780 does not make plaintiffs\u2019 claims unsuitable for class treatment. \u201cCausation as to each class member is commonly proved more likely than not by materiality. That showing will undoubtedly be conclusive as to most of the class. The fact a defendant may be able to defeat the showing of causation as to a few individual class members does not transform the common question into a multitude of individual ones; plaintiffs satisfy their burden of showing causation as to each by showing materiality as to all.\u201d <em>(Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 891, 907, fn. 22.) Thus, \u201c[i]t is sufficient for our present purposes to hold that if the trial court finds material misrepresentations were made to the class members, at least</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>an inference of reliance would arise as to the entire class.\u201d <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 814 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964]; see also <em>Occidental Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 355, 363 [134 Cal.Rptr. 388, 556 P.2d 750]; <em>Varacallo v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 332 N.J.Super. 31 [752 A.2d 807, 817] [finding causation in N-Pay case provable on classwide basis].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>a representative plaintiff brought a fraud action on behalf of consumers who had purchased frozen food and freezers on installment contracts. The representatives alleged that, using a memorized script, the defendants had materially misrepresented the quality and value of the food and freezers the plaintiffs had agreed to purchase. With respect to reliance, the court stated: \u201cThe rule in this state and elsewhere is that it is not necessary to show reliance upon false representations by direct evidence. \u2018The fact of reliance upon alleged false representations may be inferred from the circumstances attending the transaction which oftentimes afford much stronger and more satisfactory evidence of the inducement which prompted the party defrauded to enter into the contract than his direct testimony to the same effect.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">In <em>Occidental Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>the plaintiffs brought a fraud action on behalf of 155 purchasers of homes in a subdivision. They alleged that in a written estimate of the cost of maintenance of common areas and facilities, the defendant developer failed to include substantial costs the developer had subsidized. The court held that class treatment of claims growing out of the failure to disclose the subsidy was appropriate: \u201cAs we held in <em>Vasquez, </em>an inference of reliance arises if a material false representation was made to persons whose acts thereafter were consistent with reliance upon the representation. That principle controls the present case. Because the purchases made by plaintiffs were acts consistent with their reliance on the subdivision report, we conclude that the trial court did not err in inferring that justifiable reliance may be established on a common basis.\u201d <em>(Occidental Land, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Like the circumstances discussed in <em>Vasquez </em>and <em>Occidental, </em>here the record permits an inference of common reliance. Plaintiffs contend Mass Mutual failed to disclose its own concerns about the premiums it was paying and that those concerns would have been material to any reasonable person contemplating the purchase of an N-Pay premium payment plan. If plaintiffs are successful in proving these facts, the purchases common to each class member would in turn be sufficient to give rise to the inference of common reliance on representations which were materially deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>We recognize that in determining whether the inference of reliance arises, the trial court will have to consider whether other information which Mass Mutual disclosed about its dividend rate provided buyers with all the material information they needed in making a decision to purchase Mass Mutual\u2019s product. However, the information Mass Mutual provided to prospective purchasers appears to have been broadly disseminated. Given that dissemination, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the ultimate question of whether the undisclosed information was material was a common question of fact suitable for treatment in a class action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Contrary to Mass Mutual\u2019s argument, nothing we said in <em>Caro </em>undermines the general rule permitting common reliance where material misstatements have been made to a class of plaintiffs. Rather, our holding in <em>Caro </em>merely stands for the self-evident proposition that such an inference will not arise where the record will not permit it. In <em>Caro </em>the plaintiff brought a class action under the CLRA, alleging the defendants had represented and marketed as fresh and without additives orange juice which in fact was reconstituted from frozen concentrate and contained additives. In finding these claims were not appropriate for class treatment under the CLRA, we stated: \u201cOn this record the court properly concluded individual issues involving the existence and nature of any material misrepresentation would predominate over common issues. \u201cA misrepresentation of fact is material if it induced the plaintiff to alter his position to his detriment. [Citation.] Stated in terms of reliance, materiality means that without the misrepresentation, the plaintiff would not have acted as he did. [Citation.] . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] [Plaintiff] alleged defendants\u2019 primary advertising and labeling misrepresentations were that [defendant\u2019s] orange juice was \u2018fresh\u2019 and contained \u2018no additives.\u2019 However, as the superior court properly noted, there was no material misrepresentation to [plaintiff] because he did not believe def\u00e9ndants\u2019 product to be \u2018fresh.\u2019 Whether other class members believed the juice was \u2018fresh\u2019 would be a matter of individual proof. Further, although [plaintiff\u2019s] deposition testimony might be construed as suggesting he personally was misled into believing the juice contained \u2018no additives,\u2019 it would be a matter of individualized proof whether the claim of \u2018no additives\u2019 constituted a material misrepresentation to class members who\u2014unlike [plaintiff]\u2014read the portions of the label stating \u2018from concentrate.\u2019 Indeed, at deposition [plaintiff] himself testified if he had read the bottom part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>three sides of the carton saying \u2018from concentrate,\u2019 he would have concluded it did not contain \u2018premium\u2019 juice. Moreover, from examining the carton the superior court could reasonably infer only a limited number of consumers would believe they were buying something other than \u2018from concentrate\u2019 juice. Thus, the court properly concluded the issue whether any asserted misrepresentation induced the purchase of [defendant\u2019s] orange juice would vary from consumer to consumer.\u201d <em>(Caro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 668-669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Here, unlike the situation we considered in <em>Caro, </em>there is no evidence any significant part of the class had access to all the information plaintiffs believe they needed before purchasing N-Pay premium payment plans. Indeed, there is nothing in the record which shows that Mass Mutual\u2019s own assessment of the discretionary dividends was disclosed to any class member. If the undisclosed assessment was material, an inference of reliance as to the entire class would arise, subject to any rebuttal evidence Mass Mutual might offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">In sum then the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that as to plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claim common questions of law or fact would predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Finally, we reject Mass Mutual\u2019s contention that its statute of limitation defenses will require individual determinations of fact. As plaintiffs point out, the respective statutes of limitation, Business and Professions Code section 17208 (four years) and Civil Code section 1783 (three years), will probably run from the time a reasonable person would have discovered the basis for a claim. (See <em>April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805, 828, 832 [195 Cal.Rptr. 421]; <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Mix </em>(1999) 22 Cal.4th 1, 9 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 273, 989 P.2d 701].) Given the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based on a nondisclosure, the objective determination of when the nondisclosure should have been discovered seems readily amenable to class treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Moreover, we note that \u201c[c]ourts have been nearly unanimous ... in holding that possible differences in the application of a statute of limitations to individual class members, including the named plaintiffs, does not preclude certification of a class action so long as the necessary commonality and . . . predominance are otherwise present.\u201d <em>(In re Energy Systems Equip. Leasing Sec. Litigation </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1986) 642 F.Supp. 718, 752-753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The petition is denied. Real parties in interest to recover costs.</p>\n<p id=\"ANX3\">McDonald, J., and McIntyre, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 29, 2002, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Petitioner\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 24, 2002. Werdegar, J., and Brown, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\"> Unlike a plaintiff proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 382, a plaintiff moving to certify a class under the CLRA is not required to show that substantial benefit will result to the litigants and the court. <em>(Hogya </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d at pp. 134-135.) Thus, unlike Code of Civil Procedure section 382, the CLRA does not require that a plaintiff show a probability that each class member will come forward and prove his separate claim to a portion of the recovery. <em>(Hogya, </em>at pp. 134-135.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1075-7\"> Any act proscribed by Business and Professions Code section 17500 is also an unfair business practice within the meaning of the UCL. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\"> As Mass Mutual points out, a representative action under the UCL is different from a class action. In a representative action under Business and Professions Code section 17204 a private plaintiff is permitted to pursue the injunctive and restitution relief provided by the UCL on behalf of the public without showing that he was directly harmed by the defendant\u2019s business practices. <em>(Saunders v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) In a class action a plaintiff sues on his own behalf as well as on behalf of members of the class and the class must be certified under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 382. (See <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 126, fn. 10.) The court in <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., </em>stated: \u201cBoth consumer class actions and representative UCL actions serve important roles in the enforcement of consumers\u2019 rights. Class actions and representative UCL actions make it economically feasible to sue when individual claims are too small to justify the expense of litigation, and thereby encourage attorneys to undertake private enforcement actions. Through the UCL a plaintiff may obtain restitution and/or injunctive relief against unfair or unlawful practices in order to protect the public and restore to the parties in interest money or property taken by means of unfair competition. These actions supplement the efforts of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. This court has repeatedly recognized the importance of these private enforcement efforts.

(See <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 821.) At this point, however, the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s determination Mass Mutual\u2019s failure to disclose its own conclusion presents an issue common to class members.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
