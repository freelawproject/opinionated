J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYj\">Plaintiff Marilyn Bagatti appeals from the judgment of dismissal entered following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend to her second amended complaint for damages allegedly caused by defendants\u2019 failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability as required by the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). We shall conclude that, although some allegations in the complaint do not state a cause of action, other allegations do state a cause of action. We shall therefore affirm the judgment in part and reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint pleads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">\u201c1. Plaintiff, Marilyn Bagatti, is and at all times hereinafter mentioned was a resident of Sacramento County, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\u201c2. Defendant, California Department of Rehabilitation, is and at all times hereinafter mentioned was an agency of the State of California and existed within the State of California, with its principal place of business located in Sacramento, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">\u201c3. Defendant, Michael D. Fuentes, is and at all times hereinafter mentioned was employed by and acting within the course and scope of his employment as an agent of the California Department of Rehabilitation and the State of California in the position of Chief Office of Civil Rights. [^] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 m</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">\u201c6. Plaintiff began her employment with the California Department of Rehabilitation on July 1, 1987. Plaintiff worked for the California Department of Rehabilitation for nearly twelve years. She worked in various jobs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>including Senior Accounting Clerk and Supervising Accounting Clerk for the last eight years. In this position she was responsible for supervising and overseeing the work of five employees and the hiring of some employees. Over the years, Plaintiff received merit pay increases, which are accompanied by a signed statement stating Plaintiff was fulfilling her job duties, and Plaintiff was generally given favorable performance evaluations [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201c7. The public policy of the State of California set forth within Government Code section 12940 supports employment and utilization of persons with a medical condition or physical handicap. If it is within the ability of the employer to make a reasonable accommodation to such medical condition, such as job restructuring, reassignment or transfer, part-time or a modified work schedule, such reasonable accommodation must be made by the public entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201c8. As a result of severe polio and post polio, Plaintiff is a disabled individual who is unable to walk long distances. Plaintiff was substantially impaired in her ability to move around her work site as needed and to transport herself from her car to her work station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201c9. Beginning on or about February, 1998, plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation of her disability in the form of motorized transportation from her parked car to her work station and motorized transportation within her work site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201c10. Her job duties required her to transport herself long distances within the work site and to travel to and from the work site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201c11. Plaintiff\u2019s immediate supervisor, Betty Jong, refused on or about June, 1998, to provide any accommodation. Jong denied Plaintiff\u2019s accommodation request for a motorized vehicle and even refused to provide hand railing or chairs along the hallways of the job site to aid Plaintiff in transporting herself around the site. Jong told Plaintiff and Plaintiff\u2019s coworkers that Plaintiff should just retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">\u201c12. On July 15, 1998, Michael D. Fuentes, Chief Office of Civil Rights and A.A. officially denied Plaintiff\u2019s request for a reasonable accommodation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201c13. On November 30, 1998, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing stating that she was discriminated against based on her disability and wrongfully denied a reasonable accommodation of her disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201c14. On December 21, 1998, as a direct result of Defendants\u2019 discrimination and refusal to accommodate Plaintiff\u2019s disabilities, Plaintiff suffered a severe industrial injury that has prevented her from returning to work. Because of Defendants\u2019 discriminatory practices, Plaintiff was forced to walk a distance in excess of her physical capabilities. As a result, Plaintiff was injured and suffered physical and emotional injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">\u201c15. As a consequence of Defendants\u2019 discrimination, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, which included a broken right fibula, tibia, and ankle, as well as bruising and swelling in her left leg. As a result of these injuries, Plaintiff had to undergo a series of surgeries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201c16. Plaintiff became substantially limited in her daily life activities as a result of these injuries. Plaintiff is unable to return to work due to the physical and emotional injuries she suffered because of the Defendants\u2019 discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\u201c17. On January 13, 1999, Defendants offered to provide Plaintiff the reasonable accommodation she requested. Since this offer was after Plaintiff\u2019s severe industrial injury on December 21, 1998, Plaintiff was not able to accept Defendants\u2019 offer at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201c18. On April 6, 1999, Plaintiff received a right to sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing relating to her disability discrimination complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201c19. Defendants discriminated and retaliated against Plaintiff based on her disability. Defendants refused to provide her a reasonable accommodation, when such accommodations had been made for the other employees, and this denial caused Plaintiff severe physical and emotional injury. Defendants created an unbearable and hostile work environment by singling out Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff to just retire when she would request an accommodation, and circulating an inflammatory and libelous e-mail to at least 47 employees impugning Plaintiff. Defendants failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff\u2019s known disability and this directly led to her December 21, 1998 injury. Defendants limited, segregated or classified the Plaintiff in a way that adversely affected her opportunities for employment. Defendants also excluded or otherwise denied equal jobs or benefits or opportunities to the Plaintiff as a qualified individual because of known disabilities of the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u201c20. As a result of the employment discrimination as above alleged, Plaintiff has suffered general damages in the form of pain and suffering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>physical injury, emotional distress, humiliation and embarrassment. Plaintiff is therefore requesting general damages in an amount to be proven at time of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">\u201c21. As a result of the above-mentioned employment discrimination, Plaintiff has suffered special damages in that Plaintiff has lost wages and has incurred other damages and costs in an amount to be proven at the time of trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u2018if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aubry </em>v. <em>Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u201cIf the complaint states a cause of action under any theory, regardless of the title under which the factual basis for relief is stated, that aspect of the complaint is good against a demurrer. \u2018[W]e are not limited to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of their complaint against a demurrer, but instead must determine if the factual allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory. The courts of this state have . . . long since departed from holding a plaintiff strictly to the \u201cform of action\u201d he has pleaded and instead have adopted the more flexible approach of examining the facts alleged to determine if a demurrer should be sustained.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Quelimane Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38-39 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff Has Pleaded a Valid Cause of Action for Damages Caused by an Unlawful Employment Practice Under the FEHA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Plaintiff contends she has stated a cause of action for damages under the FEHA because defendants engaged in an unlawful employment practice that caused her damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Plaintiff relies on subdivision (m) of Government Code section 12940.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.) Section 12940 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California: tin... <em>m</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\u201c(m) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee.

At oral argument, the Department of Rehabilitation (the Department) conceded plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of section 12926, subdivision (k).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Plaintiff also contends she adequately pleaded that the Department did not make reasonable accommodation to her disability. An employer\u2019s duty of reasonable accommodation is defined in section 12926, subdivision (n) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201c(n) \u2018Reasonable accommodation\u2019 may include either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201c(1) <em>Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">\u201c(2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, <em>acquisition </em>or modification <em>of equipment or devices, </em>adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cReasonable accommodation\u201d is also defined in a regulation promulgated by the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission (Cal.

To comply with Section 7293.9(a), the design, construction or alteration of premises shall be in conformance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>standards set forth by the Division of the State Architect in the State Building Code, Title 24, pursuant to Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 4450), Division 5 of Title 1 of the Government Code and Part 5.5 (commencing with Section 19955) and Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Plaintiff pleaded that, \u201c[a]s a result of severe polio and post polio, Plaintiff is a disabled individual who is unable to walk long distances. Plaintiff was substantially impaired in her ability to move around her work site as needed and to transport herself from her car to her work station.\u201d Plaintiff contends that her request for motorized transportation from her parked car to her work station, for motorized transportation within her work site, and for handrailings or chairs along the hallways of the jobsite, constitute requests for reasonable accommodations in that these requests were for the purpose of \u201c[mjaking existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and useable by, individuals with disabilities\u201d and constituted the \u201cacquisition or modification of equipment or devices\u201d as described in subdivision (n) of section 12926 and in the aforementioned regulation. We agree that plaintiff\u2019s complaint adequately pleads a request for accommodation of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Moreover, plaintiff has pleaded that the accommodations she sought were \u201creasonable\u201d within the meaning of the FEHA statutes. Although subdivision (m) of section 12940 does not require an employer to provide an accommodation that would produce \u201cundue hardship to its operation,\u201d a plaintiff need not initially plead or produce evidence showing that the accommodation would not impose an undue hardship on the employer; rather, the burden is on the employer to make a showing of undue hardship. <em>(County of Fresno v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1541, 1553 [277 Cal.Rptr. 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Finally, we note that the complaint pleads that plaintiff\u2019s physical disability was \u201cknown\u201d by the employer as required by subdivision (m) of section 12940. Thus, plaintiff has pleaded that the Department knew that she suffered from polio, that she requested reasonable accommodation, that the Department denied her request for reasonable accommodation, and that she was injured \u201cas a direct result\u201d thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In sum, plaintiff has adequately pleaded that the Department engaged in an unlawful employment practice under subdivision (m) of section 12940 and that she suffered injury and damages as a result of the unlawful employment practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">As we shall explain, these allegations suffice to allow plaintiff to bring a civil action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Remedies for violation of the FEHA are set out in section 12965. Section 12965 states in relevant part in subdivision (a) that \u201c[i]n the case of failure to eliminate <em>an unlawful practice under this part </em>through conference, [etc.] ... the director in his or her discretion may cause to be issued in the name of the department a written accusation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Subdivision (b) of section 12965 provides in relevant part, \u201cIf an accusation is not issued within 150 days after the filing of a complaint, or if the department earlier determines that no accusation will issue, the department shall promptly notify, in writing, the person claiming to be aggrieved that the department shall issue, on his or her request, the right-to-sue notice. This notice shall indicate that the person claiming to be aggrieved may bring a civil action under this part against the person, employer, labor organization, or employment agency named in the verified complaint within one year from the date of that notice. If the person claiming to be aggrieved does not request a right-to-sue notice, the department shall issue the notice upon completion of its investigation, and not later than one year after the filing of the complaint. . . . The superior and municipal courts of the State of California shall have jurisdiction of those actions, and the aggrieved person may file in any of these courts. Such an action may be brought in any county in the state <em>in which the unlawful practice is alleged to have been committed, </em>in the county in which the records relevant to the practice are maintained and administered, or in the county in which the aggrieved person would have worked or would have had access to the public accommodation <em>but for the alleged unlawful practice, </em>but if the defendant is not found within any of these counties, an action may be brought within the county of the defendant\u2019s residence or principal office.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Section 12965 authorizes the filing of a civil action based upon \u201can unlawful practice.\u201d Nothing in section 12965 limits such an unlawful practice to the unlawful practice of disability discrimination found in subdivision (a) of section 12940. As we have explained, subdivision (m) of section 12940, outlawing the failure to provide reasonable accommodation, is statutorily defined as a separate unlawful employment practice. Section 12965 therefore authorizes the filing of a civil action based on that unlawful practice provided a plaintiff has obtained a right-to-sue notice. (See <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 256 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 55] <em>(Jensen).) </em>In paragraph 18 of her complaint, plaintiff pleads she has obtained such a notice. The instant civil action for damages is therefore authorized by section 12965. (See <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 221 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912]; <em>Jensen, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We therefore conclude that plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and the trial court erred in sustaining the Department\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>IH</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\n<em>The Department\u2019s Arguments in Support of the Demurrer Are Unpersuasive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>A. An interpretive statement of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), interpreting the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) should not be used to interpret the FEHA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The Department relies principally on <em>Brundage v. Hahn </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 228 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 830] <em>(Brundage), </em>where the court applied an interpretive statement of the federal EEOC, construing the ADA, to define the scope of reasonable accommodation under the FEHA. Thus, in <em>Brundage, </em>the court said: \u201cThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s interpretive statement explains that \u2018[tjhere are three categories of reasonable accommodation. These are (1) accommodations that are required to ensure equal opportunity in the application process; (2) accommodations that enable the employer\u2019s employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired; and (3) accommodations that enable the employer\u2019s employees with disabilities to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by employees without disabilities.\u2019 (29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, appen. to \u00a7 1630.2(c) (1996).)\u201d <em>(Brundage, supra, </em>at p. 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The Department argues the plaintiff\u2019s complaint cannot satisfy the requirements of this interpretive statement because she has not pleaded that she was denied equal opportunity in the application process, that she could not perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, or that she failed to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by employees without disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">For reasons that follow, we shall conclude that this interpretive statement of the EEOC, interpreting the federal ADA should not be applied to California\u2019s FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The operative principle is that a federal regulation may be \u201cuseful\u201d to guide the construction of the FEHA <em>where the state statute or an interpretive state regulation are modeled on the ADA. (Cassista </em>v. <em>Community Foods, Inc., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1063.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Here, however, the interpretive statement of the EEOC is based upon ADA provisions that differ in important material respects from the applicable FEHA provision. As we shall explain, the applicable FEHA provision is not sufficiently \u201cmodeled on\u201d the ADA provision to allow the EEOC regulation to control the meaning given the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Thus, read in its entirety, the interpretive statement of the EEOC provides as follows: \u201cAn individual is considered a \u2018qualified individual with a disability\u2019 if the individual can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired with or without reasonable accommodation. In general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities. There are three categories of reasonable accommodation. These are (1) accommodations that are required to ensure equal opportunity in the application process; (2) accommodations that enable the employer\u2019s employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired; and (3) accommodations that enable the employer\u2019s employees with disabilities to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by employees without disabilities.\u201d (29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, appen to \u00a7 1630.2(g) (2001).)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The interpretive statement therefore makes clear that the categories of reasonable accommodation are derived from a federal ADA statute defining \u201ca qualified individual with a disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The federal statute at issue is 42 United States Code section 12112, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201c(a) General rule R[] No covered entity shall discriminate <em>against a qualified individual with a disability </em>because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201c(b) Construction [H] As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term \u2018discriminate\u2019 includes\u2014 [^] . . . [^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201c(5)(A) [N]ot making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations <em>of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability </em>who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity; . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Title 42 United States Code section 12112 must be read in conjunction with the definition of \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d found in 42 United States Code section 12111, as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018qualified individual with a disability\u2019 means an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The important things to note about these ADA provisions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">1. The duty of reasonable accommodation under 42 United States Code section 12112 is defined as an instance of discrimination \u201cin regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">2. Under 42 United States Code section 12112, an employer has a duty to make reasonable accommodation only to a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d which is defined in 42 United States Code section 12111 as someone who can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">These statutory provisions lead to the conclusion that, \u201c[tjo state a prima facie case under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove that he is a qualified individual with a disability who suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sanders v. Arneson Products, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 91 F.3d 1351, 1353; see also <em>Doe v. Dekalb County School Dist. </em>(11th Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 1441, 1445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">These statutory provisions also animated the interpretive statement of the EEOC, discussed above, and applied to the FEHA in <em>Brundage, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at page 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">However, the FEHA provision requiring reasonable accommodation is markedly different from the ADA. Thus, subdivision (m) of section 12940, defining the duty to make reasonable accommodation, does not require that an employee be \u201ca qualified individual with a disability\u201d as does the federal statute. Rather, subdivision (m) of section 12940 applies simply to \u201can applicant or employee.\u201d Moreover, subdivision (m) of section 12940 does not link the failure to make reasonable accommodation to discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment, as does the ADA. Thus, the FEHA prohibition on discrimination in employment is found in section 12940, subdivision (a). (See appen. A, <em>post.) </em>The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is set forth in a separate subdivision (m) of equal dignity under section 12940. There is a linguistic link between subdivision (m) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>subdivision (a) of section 12940, but the link concerns only the question whether an accommodation constitutes a hardship: \u201cNothing in this subdivision [m] or in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer or other covered entity to produce undue hardship to its operation.\u201d (See appen. A, <em>post.) </em>Subdivision (m) therefore defines a separate and distinct unfair employment practice independent of subdivision (a). (See <em>Jensen, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 256.) Thus, unlike the federal ADA provisions, subdivision (m) does not require that reasonable accommodation for disability be made only where the person is \u201ca qualified individual\u201d able to perform the essential functions of the job as defined in 42 United States Code section 12111, nor is there any requirement in subdivision (m) that the employee has a right to assert the duty of reasonable accommodation only where some kind of adverse employment action is taken against the employee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the California regulation of the Fair Employment and Housing Commission interpreting the duty to provide reasonable accommodation (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9), which we have quoted above, correctly contains none of the limitations on reasonable accommodation found in the EEOC interpretive statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">From the foregoing, it appears that the interpretive statement of the federal EEOC, relied upon by the Department, is derived from federal ADA provisions that contain restrictions and qualifications on the duty to make reasonable accommodation that are not found in the FEHA. In construing the FEHA, our Supreme Court and various courts of appeal have recognized that federal authority interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (title VII)) is not persuasive where the statutory language of the FEHA differs markedly from title VII. (See <em>Romano v. Rockwell Internal, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 498-499 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114]; <em>Page v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1206, 1215-1216 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 529]; <em>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 517, 539-540 [267 Cal.Rptr. 158]; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 606 [262 Cal.Rptr. 842].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This principle applies equally to interpretations of the ADA that are proffered to interpret the FEHA. Here, as we have explained, the ADA provisions defining reasonable accommodation are materially different from the FEHA provision, and the interpretive EEOC statement relied on by the Department incorporates statutory restrictions on the duty to accommodate that are simply not found in the FEHA. Consequently, we respectfully disagree with <em>Brundage, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at page 239, to the extent that court adopted the interpretive EEOC statement to define reasonable accommodation under the FEHA. Rather, the duty of reasonable accommodation under the FEHA should be construed according to our own state regulation, adopted by the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, which we have described above. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we have said, the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint meet all the requirements of the applicable state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">This means that the duty of an employer to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability is broader under the FEHA than under the ADA. This is entirely consistent with the intent of the Legislature. Thus, for example, section 12926.1 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares as follows: (a) The law of this state in the area of disabilities provides protections independent from those in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336). Although the federal act provides a floor of protection, this state\u2019s law has always, even prior to passage of the federal act, afforded additional protections.\u201d Moreover, the language related to reasonable accommodation, now found in subdivision (m) of section 12940, was added (as subd. (k) of \u00a7 12940) by section 23.1 of chapter 913 of Statutes 1992 at page 4316. Section 1 of that chapter (913) provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to strengthen California law in areas where it is weaker than the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) and to retain California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>law when it provides more protection for individuals with disabilities than the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (At p. 4282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Finally, we are reminded that section 12993, subdivision (a) commands that, \u201cThe provisions of this part [the FEHA] shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes of this part.\u201d While the result we reach in this case may satisfy the aim of this statute, we do not think our method of statutory construction of the FEHA is \u201cliberal.\u201d Rather, we are simply applying the language of the FEHA and the applicable state regulation as they are written according to their ordinary meaning.  In the words of Justice Scalia, \u201cI thought we had adopted a regular method for interpreting the meaning of language in a statute: first, find the ordinary meaning of the language in its textual context; and second, using established canons of construction, ask whether there is any clear indication that some permissible meaning other than the ordinary one applies. If not\u2014and especially if a good reason for the ordinary meaning appears plain\u2014we apply that ordinary meaning. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chisom v. Roemer </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 380, 404 [111 S.Ct. 2354, 2369, 115 L.Ed.2d 348, 369] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We recognize that this result will leave employers uncertain with respect to when they must provide reasonable accommodation to disabled employees. However, section 12935, subdivision (a) empowers the Fair Employment and Housing Commission \u201c[t]o adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind suitable rules, regulations, and standards ... to interpret, implement and apply all provisions of this part [the FEHA] . . . .\u201d Regulatory action to clarify employers\u2019 duties is plainly appropriate here. (See <em>Samura v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1298, fn. 5 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 20].) We think that this solution\u2014calling upon the agency designated by the Legislature to clarify the FEHA\u2014is a better one than importing into the FEHA provisions from the ADA that the Legislature has not seen fit to put there.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">B. <em>Plaintiffs lawsuit is not barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The Department contends plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit is barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Thus, in its brief, the Department argues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u201cSubject to certain narrowly defined exceptions, the WCA provides an employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against her employer for injuries arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>within the course of employment. <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 467-68 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758].) Labor Code section 3600, a part of the Act, states the exclusive remedy and conditions of compensation that must occur before an employer is liable for an employee\u2019s injury: \u2018Liability for the compensation provided by this division, in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person . . . shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for <em>any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the </em>employment... in those cases where the . . . conditions of compensation occur.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) (See also <em>Bell v. Macy\u2019s California </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1442, 1448-49 [261 Cal.Rptr. 447].) Where these conditions occur, workers\u2019 compensation is \u2018the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee . . . against the employer.\u2019 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3620; <em>Pichon </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1980) 212 Cal.App.3d 488, 494-495 [260 Cal.Rptr. 677].) It is also the exclusive remedy against fellow employees acting within the scope of their employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u201cThus, when the conditions of compensation exist, an employee\u2019s sole remedy for the acts of his employer or fellow employees is a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Superior courts are without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain causes of action based on such injuries. <em>(Dixon </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 499, 506 [125 Cal.Rptr. 872]; <em>Williams v. State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 116 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201cLabor Code sections 3600(a)(2) and (3) provide that injuries which arise \u2018Where, at the time of the injury, the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment\u2019 and \u2018Where the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence,\u2019 are subject to workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u201cAppellant alleges that the injury at issue occurred while she was acting within the course and scope of her employment. Accordingly, the conditions of compensation exist here, in so far as they relate to appellant\u2019s broken leg and subsequent inability to return to work, therefore, appellant\u2019s claims are barred by the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">However, we shall conclude that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act does not bar plaintiff\u2019s FEHA lawsuit for reasons discussed by our Supreme Court in <em>City of Moorpark v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1143 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 959 P.2d 752]. Although plaintiff cited and discussed <em>City of Moorpark </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in her brief, the Department has not discussed the case in its respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In <em>City of Moorpark, </em>an administrative secretary had knee surgery and was released by her doctor to return to work. The city manager terminated her employment, informing her that a residual disability prevented her from performing her essential job functions. As pertinent, the plaintiff sued the City of Moorpark alleging a cause of action for disability discrimination in violation of the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The City of Moorpark contended the plaintiff\u2019s civil lawsuit was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In particular, the city contended that the remedy for discrimination provided by Labor Code section 132a was exclusive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Supreme Court held that Labor Code section 132a did not provide an exclusive remedy and did not preclude an employee from pursuing her FEHA claims in court. <em>(City of Moorpark </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1158.) As we shall explain, some of the court\u2019s reasoning does not support plaintiff\u2019s position in this case; however, most of the court\u2019s analysis favors plaintiff\u2019s right to bring this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The <em>City of Moorpark </em>court first explained that the exclusive remedy provision of Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a) is limited to \u201c \u2018[liability for the compensation provided <em>by this division . </em>. . .\u2019\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1154.) The court continued, \u201cWhen section 3600 refers to \u2018this division,\u2019 it refers to division 4 of the Labor Code. Section 132a, on the other hand, is in division 1 of the Labor Code. . . . Thus, the plain language of the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law apparently limits those provisions to division 4 remedies. Remedies that the Legislature placed in other divisions of the Labor Code are simply not subject to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provisions.\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1154-1155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>This reason for avoiding the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not favor plaintiff. The FEHA cause of action at issue in <em>City of Moorpark </em>was for <em>discrimination </em>based on disability. It was plaintiff\u2019s claim for <em>discrimination </em>that placed the claim ostensibly within the confines of Labor Code section 132a. And it was Labor Code section 132a that was held to be not an exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In this case, and contrary to the assertions of her brief, plaintiff does not fairly allege a cause of action for disability discrimination. Disability discrimination is defined by subdivision (a) of section 12940 (see appen. A, <em>post) </em>and, as pertinent, outlaws discrimination against the person \u201cin compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d Plaintiff has not alleged such discrimination, because she has not properly pleaded that she was denied compensation or that an adverse employment action was taken against her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, as we have discussed, plaintiff has fairly pleaded a claim for damages premised on failure to make reasonable accommodation in violation of subdivision (m) of section 12940. Because plaintiff has not pleaded a disability discrimination claim, her lawsuit is not ostensibly subject to the antidiscrimination provisions of Labor Code section 132a but is rather for physical injuries suffered in the course of her employment. Consequently, to the extent that our Supreme Court rested its decision in <em>City of Moorpark </em>on the statutory construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that we have recited above, that ground of the decision does not aid plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">However, the statutory construction of Labor Code section 132a was not the entire basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Moorpark. </em>Rather, it was just the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Thus, in <em>City of Moorpark, </em>the court went on to explain that disability discrimination \u201cfalls outside the compensation bargain and workersLcompensation is not the exclusive remedy.\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1155.) As we have-expl-ained,. -in.section l29.40 the Legislature has made the failure to accommodate a disability equally as important as disability discrimination. We see no reason to do otherwise. Just as discrimination on the basis of disability falls outside the compensation bargain, so too the employer\u2019s commission of another statutory unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>employment practice, as defined by subdivision (m) of section 12940, falls outside the compensation bargain. This ground 6FTHe~Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Moorpark </em>therefore supports plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">As additional reasons for finding the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act not an exclusive remedy for the plaintiff in <em>City of Moorpark, </em>the court discussed the policies of the FEHA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cThe provisions of the FEHA, and our decisions interpreting it, further support our conclusion that section 132a is not exclusive. The FEHA-broadly announces \u2018the public policy of this state that it is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of . . . physical disability [or] mental disability 7.7? (. . . \u00a7 12920.) The FEHA further provides that \u2018[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice . . . ft[] . . . [f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability [or] mental disability ... of any person, to . . . discrinrihate-against the person . . . .\u2019 (. . . \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).) Nothing^ in these provisions suggests that the FEHA only applies to physical or mental disabilities that are unrelated to work. Moreover, the FEHA declares that its \u2018provisions . . . shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\u2019 (. . . \u00a7 12993, subd. (a).) A construction of section 12940, subdivision (a), that narrows the term \u2018disability\u2019 to disabilities unrelated to work seems inconsistent with the principle of liberal construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cFurthermore, our decisions have consistently emphasized the breadth of the FEHA. In <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 422 [217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354], we considered whether the FEHA covered state civil service employees despite similar antidiscrimination provisions in the Civil Service Act. (See ... \u00a7 19702, subd. (a).) We concluded that \u2018[t]he FEHA was meant to supplement, <em>not . . . be supplanted by, </em>existing antidiscrimination remedies, in order to give employees the maximum opportunity to vindicate their civil rights against discrimination . . . .\u2019 <em>(State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 431, italics added.) Similarly, in <em>Rojo </em>[v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d. 65 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373]], we considered whether victims of sex discrimination could bring common law wrongful discharge claims in addition to FEHA claims. We concluded that the Legislature intended the FEHA \u2018to amplify\u2019 <em>(Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 75) other remedies and \u2018to expand\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at p. 80) the rights of persons who are victims of employment discrimination. (See also <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 135 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074] [The Legislature intended \u2018to create new rights within the FEHA statutory scheme while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>leaving existing rights intact . . . .\u2019].) None of these cases suggests that non-FEHA remedies circumscribe the scope of the FEHA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u201cFinally, the public education provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law support our conclusion that section 132a is not exclusive. Labor Code section 139.6 provides: \u2018(a) The administrative director shall establish and effect within the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation a continuing program to provide information and assistance concerning the rights, benefits, and obligations of the workers\u2019 compensation law to employees and employers subject thereto. The program shall include, but not be limited to, the following: [H] . . . [H] (2) The preparation, publishing, and as necessary, updating, of a pamphlet advising injured workers of their basic rights under workers\u2019 compensation law, <em>and informing them of rights under ... the provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act relating to individuals with a </em>disability.\u2019 (Italics added.) This legislative mandate to inform \u2018injured workers\u2019 of their FEHA rights would make little sense if section 132a provided an injured worker\u2019s exclusive remedy for disability discrimination.\u201d <em>(City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1156-1158.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">This discussion by our Supreme Court of the FEHA applies strongly in plaintiff\u2019s favor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On balance, we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>City of Moorpark </em>shpports the view that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not provide the exclusive remedy for plaintiff\u2019s FEHA claim. (See also <em>Fretland </em>v. <em>County of Humboldt </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1484-1486 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 359].) The Department\u2019s argument to the contrary is not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">C. <em>It cannot be determined on demurrer whether plaintiff\u2019s requested accommodation is unreasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The Department argues that plaintiff\u2019s requested accommodation is not reasonable on its face. The Department asserts \u201cAppellant\u2019s request for a motorized wheelchair is a request for a personal item not required to be provided by the Department.\u201d However, plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged, \u201cHer job duties required her to transport herself long distances within the work site and to travel to and from the work site.\u201d She also alleged, \u201cplaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation of her disability in the form of motorized transportation from her parked car to her work station and motorized transportation within her work site.\u201d These allegations suffice to plead that plaintiff\u2019s requested accommodation was not personal but was work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>related. And, as we have recounted, the applicable state regulation includes \u201cacquisition ... of equipment or devices\u201d as an example of a reasonable accommodation. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.9.) Moreover, plaintiff pleaded that the Department refused to provide handrailing or chairs along the hallway of the job site to aid plaintiff in transporting herself around the site. These latter items are not personal items.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">As we have mentioned, the burden is on the employer to show that a requested accommodation would constitute a hardship. <em>(County of Fresno v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1553.) It cannot be determined on demurrer whether plaintiff\u2019s requested accommodations were reasonable, on the one hand, or constituted an undue hardship to the employer, on the other. The Department\u2019s argument to the contrary is not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Other Allegations in Paragraph 19 of Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint Do Not State a Cause of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In paragraph 19 of her complaint, plaintiff alleges: \u201cDefendants created an unbearable and hostile work environment by singling out Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff to just retire when she would request an accommodation, and circulating an inflammatory and libelous e-mail to at least 47 employees impugning Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In her brief, plaintiff does not show how these allegations state a cause of action. Rather, she says, \u201cThe crux of Ms[.] Bagatti\u2019s complaint is that respondents failed to provide reasonable accommodation of her disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The burden is on an appellant of affirmatively showing error by the trial court. <em>(Santa Clara County Environmental Health Assn. v. County of Santa Clara </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 74, 83-84 [218 Cal.Rptr. 678].) Plaintiff has not shown how the aforementioned allegations of paragraph 19 state a cause of action. Consequently, we presume the demurrer was properly sustained as to those allegations, and plaintiff shall not proceed on those claims in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that some allegations in paragraph 19 of plaintiff\u2019s complaint do not state a cause of action. However, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>allegations in the complaint show that plaintiff has pleaded a valid claim for damages under the FEHA and that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to her second amended complaint without leave to amend.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of this conclusion, we have no need to address plaintiff\u2019s requests to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">To the extent the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend to the allegations of paragraph 19 described in part IV of the opinion, the judgment is affirmed. The judgment is otherwise reversed. Plaintiff shall recover her costs on appeal. (Cal.

(m)) of section 12940. With this much of <em>Jensen </em>we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">However, the <em>Jensen </em>court also said, \u201c[t]he elements of a failure to accommodate claim are similar to the elements of a . . . section 12940, subdivision (a) discrimination claim, but there are important differences. The plaintiff must, in both cases, establish that he or she suffers from a disability covered by FEHA and that he or she is a qualified individual. For purposes of a section 12940, subdivision (k) claim, the plaintiff proves he or she is a qualified individual by establishing that he or she can perform the essential functions of the position to which reassignment is sought, rather than the essential functions of the existing position. (See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Midland Brake, Inc. </em>(10th Cir. 1999) 180 F.3d 1154, 1161-1162; <em>AKA </em>v. <em>Washington Hosp. Center </em>(D.C.

The two federal cases cited by <em>Jensen </em>do not mention the FEHA but are rather interpretations of the ADA where, as we have seen, \u201ca qualified individual with a disability\u201d is given express statutory definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although not relied upon by the Department, we note that a federal regulation of the EEOC (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(d) (2002)) contains language defining \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d that closely tracks the EEOC interpretive statement.
