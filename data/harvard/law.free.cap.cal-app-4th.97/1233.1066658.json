Counts 1 through 3 accused defendant of committing a lewd or lascivious act upon A. II, a child under the age of 14, on or about March of 1997; count 4 accused him of committing a lewd or lascivious act upon C., a child under the age of 14, on or about July 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">After trial, a jury convicted defendant on counts 1 through 3 and acquitted him on count 4. Relying on section 1203.066, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s application for probation and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of six years (the midterm on count 1, with concurrent terms on counts 2 and 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Defendant contends: (1) The trial court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 by admitting evidence of sexual offenses allegedly perpetrated by defendant against two adult women. (2) The admission of this evidence under Evidence Code section 1108 deprived defendant of due process and a fair trial. (3) The trial court erred prejudicially by instructing the jury with the 1999 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01. (4) The prosecutor committed Griffin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> error in closing argument. (5) The cumulative effect of these errors and prejudicial acts compels reversal. (6) Defendant\u2019s sentence must be vacated because the trial court applied the wrong statute (\u00a7 1203.066) in determining that defendant was ineligible for probation. (7) Defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court\u2019s use of the wrong statute in denying probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">In the published portion of the opinion, we agree with defendant that the trial court erred in relying on section 1203.066 to deny probation. We shall vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and remand the matter so that the trial court may consider defendant\u2019s eligibility for probation under the correct statutes. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s other contentions and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">\n<em>Prosecution case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Atp\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">Until the summer of 1996, defendant, his wife (Wife) and their three daughters, A. I, A. II, and C., lived in Sacramento. In 1996, A. I, the oldest daughter, was 10 or 11 years old; A. II was 9 or 10 years old; C. was 7 or 8 years old. Defendant, Wife, and Wife\u2019s mother jointly owned a family business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>In July 1996, A. n, upset and crying, told her mother in C.\u2019s presence that defendant had made A. II touch him inappropriately. A. II said she \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to do that anymore.\u201d When Wife asked what she meant, A. II replied: \u201c[W]ashing her dad\u2019s private parts in the shower.\u201d Wife confronted defendant, who denied wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">According to A. II\u2019s trial testimony, earlier that day she and C. had been showering together in the bathroom of the master bedroom. A. II had just finished washing C.\u2019s hair and C. had left the shower. As A. II prepared to start washing her own hair, defendant, naked, unexpectedly entered the shower and told A. II to wash his body. He handed her a bar of soap and had her \u201cwash his penis along with the rest of his body.\u201d As she did so, his penis became hard. He told her at one point to continue because his penis was not clean enough. She could not recall whether he moved his body or made any sounds as she washed his penis. Afterward, he told her not to tell anyone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">About three weeks later, Wife left the family home and moved to Foresthill;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A. II went into counseling. Wife had been reluctant to leave defendant earlier because she loved both defendant and A. II and wanted to believe them both; however, when A. II asked why Wife did not love her and believe her, Wife decided she had to make a choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Because divorce proceedings were underway and A. II had reported molestation, the children did not visit defendant without supervision from October 1996 through February 1997. During February 1997, the children began alternate weekend visitation with defendant at the Sacramento home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">\n<em>Evidence relating to counts 1-3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">During their visits, according to A. II\u2019s testimony, the girls all slept in defendant\u2019s bed, which was the only available bed in the house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A. II usually wore a shirt to bed; defendant slept either in underwear or naked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>One night in March 1997, A. II woke up in defendant\u2019s bed to find him moving her thumb around his penis; A. II\u2019s sisters continued to sleep.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His penis was hard and felt as though it had lotion on it. Telling her to be quiet, he directed her into the bathroom. In the bathroom, he grabbed a towel and \u201cdid something to his penis that made stuff come out\u201d which was \u201cmilky, watery.\u201d She said \u201cEww\u201d; he told her to keep quiet. Then he turned her around to face away from him, placed lotion in her hands, and had her rub it onto his penis with her hands behind her back. Finally, he directed her back to the bedroom and told her to go back to sleep, adding that she should not tell anyone about this incident because if she did he wouldn\u2019t be able to see them any more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">In her MDIC interview, A. II said that defendant explained he made her do this only because he had not had a massage in a long time. At trial, she recalled something about a massage, but nothing more specific.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Later in March, around Easter vacation, A. II visited defendant again. As before, A. II woke in defendant\u2019s bed, with her sisters still sleeping, to find defendant \u201cmaking [her] do that.\u201d A. II tried to feign sleep as defendant moved her hand on his erect penis. She finally told him she was uncomfortable. He put on clothes and told her not to tell anyone about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">On cross-examination, A. II recalled four incidents, rather than the three she had mentioned on direct. She also recalled that the last two occurred after Easter vacation, but could give no more specific dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">A. II did not immediately tell Wife what had happened because she still wanted to see defendant and she felt uncomfortable thinking about discussing the incidents with people she did not know. But eventually, just before another scheduled visit to defendant, A. II did tell Wife about the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>Wife then had A. II write down what she remembered before Wife confronted defendant and contacted Child Protective Services (CPS).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">A. II\u2019s writing, which was admitted into evidence as an exhibit, stated in a paragraph dated March 1: \u201cMy dad had me rub his private part with my thumb and he put lotion on it.\u201d In a paragraph dated March 29, A. II wrote: \u201cMy dad had me do the same thing.\u201d The writing also included the phrases \u201cThe first time he said it\u2019s only because he hasn\u2019t had a massage in a long time\u201d and \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone or I won\u2019t be able to see you girls.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Wife confronted defendant with A. II\u2019s story. According to her, he replied: \u201cBaby, no, no, no, don\u2019t go there, no, no, no,\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen,\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t do that . . . , don\u2019t accept that, don\u2019t believe that, I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">\n<em>Evidence relating to count 4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">C. testified that one day before her parents separated, she was in the shower alone, preparing to wash her hair, when defendant entered naked and said \u201cWash this,\u201d pointing to his penis. She did so, rubbing her soapy hands together. She said defendant\u2019s penis was \u201cdown\u201d; the skin was \u201cgross\u201d and \u201ccrinkly.\u201d She stopped because she did not like doing this. While she was doing it, defendant washed her hair. Afterward C. left the shower, dressed, and went to her room. Not wanting to get in trouble, C. did not tell anyone about the incident until the night in July 1996 when A. II told their mother about her own molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Wife did not recall that C. told her of this incident at that time. As Wife recalled, C. mentioned her alleged molestation for the first time to Dr. Frank, the counselor in the divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">Wife and A. I admitted at trial that C. lies, makes things up, and tells stories. A. I recalled that C. had said nothing happened to her. In her MDIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>interview, A. II said C. had claimed molestation but that A. II did not know if C. was telling the truth because she lied a lot. In the defense case, Dr. Frank and therapist Alicia Santos-Coy testified that A. I and A. II had made similar statements about C. to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">\n<em>A. I\u2019s evidence of uncharged conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\"><em>A. </em>I testified that one day when she was 10 or 11 years old and living in the Sacramento residence, she was in the shower washing her hair, turned around, and saw defendant behind her. He pointed to his penis and said \u201cWash me.\u201d Frightened, she looked down. He grabbed her hand and placed it on the \u201ctop of [his penis], the front part,\u201d then wrapped her fingers and thumb around it and moved her hand back and forth. His penis became erect. The incident lasted one or two minutes. While it was going on, defendant moved his shoulders back, tilted his head, and rolled his eyes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">A. I did not tell anyone about this incident even after A. II confessed her own molestation, because A. I still loved her father and did not want to make things worse. She disclosed defendant\u2019s conduct for the first time in May 1999.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">\n<em>Other uncharged conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Ann Marie, 31 years old at the time of trial, had worked for defendant\u2019s and Wife\u2019s family business. In 1994, at a housewarming party, Ann Marie was talking with defendant in the backyard of his house. He reached over, took her arm, \u201cjerked\u201d it to his crotch, and placed her hand on top of his jeans on his penis. She jerked it away after about five seconds, then walked away as he smiled at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Debbie, 36 years old at the time of trial, worked for defendant and Wife in their family business for over six years. About five years ago, when Debbie was at their house, defendant approached her from behind, started to rub her shoulders, said he was excited, took her hand, and placed it on his groin; she could feel his erect penis. She pulled it away immediately. Defendant and Debbie were completely clothed at the time. She did not consent to his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">\n<em>Defense case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">Defendant did not testify, but mounted a defense which attacked his daughters\u2019 and Wife\u2019s credibility. He also sought to prove that Wife had two</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>motives for inspiring the girls to fabricate: she was having an affair with the man she later married, and she wanted to take defendant\u2019s share of the daycare business away from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Defendant\u2019s mother, Sandra, testified that defendant attended a family picnic on Easter Sunday, March 30, 1997 (the day after he allegedly molested A. II during her Easter vacation visit), without his children. Sandra recalled that Wife mentioned defendant\u2019s alleged molestation of A. II in a conversation in which Wife also said she was seeing another man and would leave defendant. Wife later said she would not press charges if defendant signed over the daycare business. Finally, Sandra recalled that Wife dropped off a box of defendant\u2019s possessions, which included a copy of A. II\u2019s 1997 Christmas list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Defendant\u2019s sister Donna, who lived near defendant and Wife and visited them regularly, recalled that they often showered with their daughters and that Wife was always home. She admitted, however, that to her knowledge the joint showers ended well before the summer of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Lori R., a customer of Wife\u2019s family business, testified that from 1994 on, the children were not always tended to at Wife\u2019s home as they had been. Wife said someone had reported her to CPS for having too many children in the house and consequently they now had to use numerous locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Marilee Napier, a CPS worker, testified that she took Wife\u2019s call and wrote a report on or about April 16, 1997.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The report stated that according to Wife, on March 1 and March 29, 1997, defendant requested that A. II masturbate him and wash his private area. Wife also stated that the marriage was an \u201copen relationship,\u201d and that when a parent was showering, the children could join him or her. Wife did not report abuse of A. I or C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">Detective Gemandt, the investigating officer, testified that he met with A. I and C. on August 26, 1997. A. I denied that defendant had done anything wrong to her, though she knew of something relating to A. II; C. volunteered, however, that when she was seven years old defendant made her wash his penis in the shower and threatened to spank or ground her if she did not comply. Gemandt next met with A. I on December 30, 1998; this time A. I told him of defendant\u2019s alleged molestation of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">Karen M., who looked after defendant\u2019s children in defendant\u2019s home about seven years ago, became aware then that they sometimes showered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>with him. She also formed the impression that A. II could look you in the eye and lie convincingly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Dr. Frank, the family court mediator, testified that she had met with family members several times, first in November 1996 and then in May and June 1997. In November 1996, during a meeting with Wife and the girls, Wife, A. II, and C. all described defendant\u2019s conduct. Wife recounted a confrontation between herself, defendant, and A. II, in which A. II \u201cbacked down\u201d from her allegation against him (possibly meaning only that A. II dropped the subject). Also in November 1996, A. II described two episodes in which defendant told her to wash his penis. Around the same time, C. also described defendant\u2019s alleged molestation of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">In mid-1997, Wife told Dr. Frank that Wife had given unsupervised visitation to defendant without following through on the court\u2019s counseling recommendation. Wife also told Dr. Frank of two new incidents of defendant\u2019s alleged molestation of A. II. A. II herself told Dr. Frank of those incidents in June 1997. A. II told Dr. Frank, with A. I in the room, that defendant massaged A. II\u2019s back with a massager, then asked A. II to massage his \u201cprivate\u201d; the girls then laughed, giggled, and teased each other. (A. I had just told Dr. Frank that this incident occurred in the afternoon or early evening, but A. II said it occurred at 2:30 a.m.; they giggled after Dr. Frank asked A. II in front of A. I about this discrepancy.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Dr. Alicia Santos-Coy, a family therapist, testified that she counseled A. II in June 1997. Crying, A. II described a series of incidents of sexual touching involving herself and defendant. In the first incident, when A. II was nine years old, defendant came into the shower when A. II and C. were there and told A. II to help him wash himself, or else go to bed early; when she tried to leave, he stopped her. In the second incident, which occurred when the family was camping, defendant asked A. II to rub his \u201cprivate part\u201d so he could sleep, then made her do it, and finally told her not to tell anyone.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The third and fourth incidents involved defendant making A. II rub lotion on his penis when the girls were visiting him; the first of these times they were all sleeping on the floor, while the second time they were all sleeping on the bed. The first time he took her into the bathroom and \u201csqueezed milky-looking stuff out of him\u201d; the second time she told him she did not want to touch him, but he replied that she had soft hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">I-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed repeated <em>Griffin </em>error in closing argument, irreparably prejudicing him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Defendant cites four comments by the prosecutor as attempts to use defendant\u2019s failure to testify against him in violation of <em>Griffin v. California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609 [85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-9\">1. \u201cNobody has even testified for the defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-10\">2. \u201cAnd with respect to [A. I] and [C.] and the other women [sic\\, you know that those children sat in this chair and told you the truth. And the thing the defense can\u2019t answer, that they never can answer[,] is, they have nothing to gain, . . . And they didn\u2019t want to be here, [ft] They\u2019ll never have an answer to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-11\">3. \u201cBut you know it\u2019s true because of the corroboration. And when I was thinking about, you know, who\u2019s going to tell her. That all referred to . . . the reality, of what happens to people when they come to court. The reality of what happened to [Wife], [ft] They\u2019re all liars. All five of them, [ft] What was the next defense[?] [ft] Sinister plan. Defendant was set up. [ft] Not in so many words, but the bottom line is that\u2014\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-12\">4. \u201cIt\u2019s never been suggested to you that, clearly, the burden is on the prosecution. But the defense pointed to their own diagram and in that diagram didn\u2019t say he was innocent. The diagram had [\u2018]not provenf]\u2014 that\u2019s something they wrote in their diagram that does have significance. That\u2019s part of the muck. That\u2019s part of, like that octopus evading capture. The muck of the defense, [ft] And we have [\u2018Wife] put these kids up to it. [Wife] fabricated evidence. And [A. II] memorized her story. [\u2019] And, absolutely, they\u2019re not required to prove a dam thing, [ft] But when you prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>defense through cross-examination, the presentation of witnesses, that evidence and the lack\u2014that evidence is subject to the same scrutiny as any other evidence. [^] Just because they said the same things over and over about those kids and they\u2019ve talked to mom doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s any less guilty. None of that is true. None of that rests on any item of evidence. [^] The direct evidence that you heard was that he put their hands on the penis \u2014and this isn\u2019t commenting only on the evidence, and the state of the evidence is uncontroverted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">To begin with, defense counsel did not object to any of these comments except the third (assuming from the unclear record that that objection went to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and not merely to the visual aid she was using at the time). Therefore, defendant\u2019s claim of <em>Griffin </em>error is waived except as to that comment. <em>(People v. Medina </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 756 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 906 P.2d 2].) Because the trial court sustained counsel\u2019s objection and admonished the jury to disregard the objectionable matter, we do not see how it could have prejudiced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\"><em>People v. Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 154-157 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781], which defendant cites to show that he preserved his claim of error as to all the remarks by objecting to one of them, does not assist him. In <em>Hardy </em>an objection and motion for mistrial were raised and argued at the first instance of alleged <em>Griffin </em>error, and counsel later renewed their mistrial motions. <em>(People v. Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 156-157.) That is a far cry from the single isolated objection raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">But assuming defendant\u2019s claim of error is preserved across the board, it fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Three of the four remarks he complains of do not constitute <em>Griffin </em>error.  A prosecutor may fairly comment on the state of the evidence, including a nontestifying defendant\u2019s failure to proffer material evidence or witnesses to rebut the People\u2019s case. Such comment crosses the <em>Griffin </em>line only if the defendant alone could have given such evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1339 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259]; <em>People v. Medina, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 755.) When read in context, the prosecutor\u2019s second, third and fourth remarks here did not cross that line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">The second and third quoted remarks did not even indirectly refer to defendant\u2019s failure to testify; they simply asserted the children\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">The fourth quoted remark, in which the prosecutor described defendant\u2019s alleged conduct, then said \u201cthe state of the evidence is uncontroverted,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>presents a closer question. It might seem that only defendant could have controverted the children\u2019s accounts of what he did, because he was the only other person who could have known what did or did not happen. In context, however, it appears that the prosecutor was commenting on the entire state of the evidence, including the defense efforts to attack the children\u2019s credibility through cross-examination, the testimony of Drs. Frank and Santos-Coy, and evidence of Wife\u2019s motives to fabricate the charges. Therefore we conclude that this remark was not <em>Griffin </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">This leaves the first remark; \u201cNobody has even testified for the defense.\u201d Contrary to the People\u2019s argument, we believe there is a reasonable likelihood the jury would have understood this remark as a comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify <em>(People v. Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]), because, in fact, the defense had presented various witnesses, including defendant\u2019s mother, defendant\u2019s sister, a CPS worker, a police detective and a family court mediator. The jury would reasonably construe the remark as an indirect comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">However, \u201c \u2018indirect, brief and mild references to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, without any suggestion that an inference of guilt be drawn therefrom, are uniformly held to constitute harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1229, 1340, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 572 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776].) Such is the case here. The remark in question was a brief, single sentence without amplification. The jury was instructed not to draw any inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s exercise of his right not to testify. The prosecutor\u2019s remark was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 447 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously determined him ineligible for probation under section 1203.066, a statute that requires proof of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct,\u201d because no such conduct was charged or found true by the jury. Defendant further contends his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover and point out the correct law to the court. The People concede these points. We shall accept the People\u2019s concessions.  Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>cause the trial court misunderstood the scope of its discretion to grant probation, we remand the matter for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The parties agree that the trial court relied on section 1203.066 to find defendant ineligible for probation. The court stated it was not prepared to find the grant of probation would be in the best interests of the child, one of the findings necessary to grant probation under section 1203.066, and therefore found defendant ineligible for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">As pertinent, section 1203.066 declares a defendant who has engaged in <em>substantial sexual conduct </em>with a victim who is under 14 years of age ineligible for probation unless the trial court makes five findings enumerated in the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Subdivision (b) of section 1203.066 provides: \u201c \u2018Substantial sexual conduct\u2019 means penetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by the penis of the other or by any foreign object, oral copulation, or masturbation of either the victim or the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Subdivision (d) of section 1203.066 provides: \u201cThe existence of any fact that would make a person ineligible for probation under subdivision (a) shall be alleged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the jury trying the issue of guilt or by the court where guilt is established by plea of guilty or nolo contendere or by trial by the court sitting without a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>The information in this case generally pleaded four counts of violation of section 288, subdivision (a); the information did not plead any facts showing substantial sexual conduct as defined by subdivision (b) of section 1203.066.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The jury\u2019s verdict found three violations of section 288, subdivision (a); the verdict did not find any facts constituting \u201csubstantial sexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The jury\u2019s findings that defendant violated section 288, subdivision (a), are not findings that defendant engaged in \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d because a violation of section 288 occurs whenever, to gratify the child\u2019s or the actor\u2019s sexual desires, an actor merely touches a child under the age of 14. <em>(People v. Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 861 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The record in this case demonstrates there was absolutely no compliance with the pleading and finding requirements of subdivision (d) of section 1203.066. Accordingly, section 1203.066 did not apply to limit the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining whether to grant defendant probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">All defendants are eligible for probation, in the discretion of the sentencing court, unless a statute provides otherwise. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aubrey </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 279, 282 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 378].) Here, no statute affected defendant\u2019s eligibility for probation, although section 1203.067 set forth certain prerequisites to a grant of probation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court had full discretion to grant probation, subject to consideration of the criteria listed in rule 414 of the California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">An erroneous understanding by the trial court of its discretionary power is not a true exercise of discretion. <em>(People v. Aubrey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 282.) \u201cDefendants are entitled to sentencing decisions made in the exercise of the \u2018informed discretion\u2019 of the sentencing court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348, fn. 8 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].) A court cannot exercise that \u201cinformed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>discretion\u201d where it is unaware of the scope of its discretionary powers. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Here, the court was misinformed as to the scope of its discretionary powers, erroneously believing that section 1203.066 limited that discretion. Where a trial court imposes sentence without an accurate understanding of its sentencing discretion, remand for resentencing is appropriate. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 257 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 949 P.2d 31]; see also <em>People v. Sherrick </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 657, 661 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 25] [remand for resentencing where trial court erroneously believed \u00a7 1203.066 applied].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Obviously, a remand for resentencing would be an idle act if it would be an abuse of discretion to grant probation in this case. (See <em>People v. Warner </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 678 [143 Cal.Rptr. 885, 574 P.2d 1237] [abuse of discretion to grant probation to defendant convicted of oral copulation on a young boy with three prior convictions for similar conduct].) While we express no opinion as to the propriety of granting probation in this case, the record does not indicate that a decision to grant probation would be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">In requesting probation, defendant argued he was an intrafamilial regressed molester, not a fixated pedophile, and thus the statutory scheme favored rehabilitation on probation. In support of his request for probation, defendant submitted a psychological evaluation that concluded he was suitable for probation and amenable to treatment, as well as numerous letters of support from family and friends. Unlike the defendant in <em>People v. Warner, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 678, defendant has no criminal history. In a letter to the court, he expressed remorse and a willingness to do whatever it took to restore his relationship with his daughters. Until these incidents, defendant had a long and stable work history. \u00abHe worked for 20 years in a family business and 10 years as a correctional officer. He was currently working as a free-lance carpet layer. In short, since there are factors in mitigation, a grant of probation would not be an abuse of discretion. (\u00a7 1203, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Defendant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.

Had the prosecutor included the charge, the jury would have necessarily found it true. This is because the facts underlying each of the three counts defendant was convicted of constitute substantial sexual conduct within the meaning of that statute; namely, having his daughter masturbate him when she was 9 or 10 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">At sentencing, the trial court failed to notice the absence of the special finding. It proceeded as if defendant was presumptively ineligible for probation under section 1203.066 and expressly found that a grant of probation to defendant <em>was not in the best interest of the child. </em>Probation was denied and defendant was sentenced to prison. Defendant suffered no prejudice because it would be an abuse of discretion to release defendant into the community on a grant of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">In deciding whether to grant probation our Supreme Court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Warner </em>that a court is required to exercise discretion that is impartial, guided and controlled by fixed legal principles, exercised with the spirit of the law, and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To grant probation here would violate the spirit of the law and established public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Looking through the blurred pane of our appellate record, my colleagues have crafted a sympathetic view of defendant. In doing so, they portray him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>as a suitable candidate for probation and thereby implicitly endorse a discretionary decision to grant probation on remand. This is unfortunate and the trial court will be wise to decline their invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">There is simply no difference between defendant\u2019s conduct and that of others similarly situated save for the jury\u2019s failure to make a redundant finding. Many child abusers, no doubt, have significantly more sympathetic backgrounds than defendant here. Nonetheless, by enacting Penal Code section 1203.066, our Legislature has determined that it is the public policy of this state that when a defendant has a child masturbate him when she is 9 or 10 years of age, he is not suitable for probation <em>under any circumstances </em>unless, at a minimum, it is shown that the interest of the victim child is best served by such a grant. The majority\u2019s ruling today fails to give proper deference to the Legislature\u2019s express determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Over an extended period of time and on several different occasions, this 240-pound defendant manipulated his own 9- or 10-year-old daughter into masturbating him despite her objections and then threatened her with the all-too-familiar refrain of telling her to keep quiet or else she would not be able to visit him again. In light of the trial court\u2019s determination that it is not in the child\u2019s best interest to have defendant released into the community on probation, it would be an abuse of discretion to do so. I would affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1053-9\"> Penal Code section 1203.066 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding Section 1203 or any other law, probation shall not be granted to . . . any of the following persons: TO ...
