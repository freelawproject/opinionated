The Supreme Court accepted review and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Winters v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>144 Wn.2d 869, 31 P.3d 1164 (2001). We conclude that <em>Winters </em>does not control and therefore decline to amend our earlier opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">The history of this case is set forth in <em>Hamm v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>101 Wn. App. 360, 362, 3 P.3d 761 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-14\">Hamm was injured in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. State Farm paid $8,669.71 in personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>injury protection (PIP) benefits for Hamm\u2019s medical bills. Hamm made a UIM [underinsured motorist] claim. After negotiations between Hamm and State Farm proved unsuccessful, Hamm demanded a UIM arbitration under the policy. Hamm incurred legal expenses by participating in the arbitration. The arbitrator determined that Hamm\u2019s reasonable and necessary medical expenses were $5,481.71 and her total damages were $16,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-3\">Pursuant to the policy, State Farm offset the $8,669.71 it had already paid in PIP benefits and tendered a check for the $7,330.29 balance. The parties agreed that the tender represented an uncontested amount of UIM benefits owed to Hamm but reserved the question whether Hamm was owed more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">Hamm filed an action in superior court for confirmation of the arbitration award. The court confirmed the total award but denied Hamm\u2019s request to enter judgment because of the dispute over the offset amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">Hamm filed the present action seeking declaratory relief regarding the amount of the offset. She also requested that State Farm bear a share of the legal expenses incurred in obtaining the arbitration award. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court found that State Farm was entitled to offset the entire amount paid in PIP benefits. The trial court also found under <em>Mahler </em>[v. <em>Szucs, </em>135 Wn.2d 398, 957 P.2d 632, 966 P.2d 305 (1998),] that State Farm was required to share Hamm\u2019s legal expenses. The court awarded Hamm $3,582.53 in costs and fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">State Farm appealed the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">This court reversed, finding that this matter was controlled by <em>Dayton v. Farmers Insurance Group, </em>124 Wn.2d 277, 876 P.2d 896 (1994), \u201cwhich held that a claimant-insured bears his or her own attorney fees for a UIM arbitration when a UIM insurer stands in the shoes of the uninsured tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Hamm, </em>101 Wn. App. at 361. We distinguished <em>Mahler v. Szucs, </em>135 Wn.2d 398, 957 P.2d 632, 966 P.2d 305 (1998), and <em>Winters v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>99 Wn. App. 602, 994 P.2d 881 (2000), on the basis that, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Mahler </em>and <em>Winters, </em>Hamm had not recovered from the at-fault driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>After this court issued its opinion in <em>Hamm, </em>the Supreme Court accepted review of Division Two\u2019s decision in <em>Winters. </em>Shortly thereafter, Hamm petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court affirmed <em>Winters </em>in October of 2001. <em>Winters v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>144 Wn.2d 869, 31 P.3d 1164 (2001). In April of 2002, the Supreme Court granted Hamm\u2019s petition for review and remanded to this court for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Winters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">As we noted in our earlier opinion in <em>Hamm, </em>the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Winters, </em>because the at-fault driver was uninsured, rather than underin-sured. As a result, Hamm did not expend the considerable time and resources in seeking recovery from the at-fault driver as did the plaintiffs in <em>Winters, </em>nor did she actually recover from the at-fault driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">As in <em>Winters, </em>Hamm\u2019s insurance policy contained a paragraph that stated, \u201c If the insured recovers from the party at-fault and we share in the recovery, we will pay our share of the legal expenses.\u2019 \u201d 101 Wn. App. at 363 (quoting Clerk\u2019s Papers at 192). But in this case, Hamm did not recover from the party at-fault. Under the terms of the insurance policy, State Farm was not required to pay a share of Hamm\u2019s legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Notwithstanding these factual differences, Hamm argues that <em>Winters </em>controls. We recognize that the holding of <em>Winters </em>is not based solely on the policy language. Indeed, the court held that this language,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">simply expresses the long established equitable principles set down by this Court. An insurer is not entitled to recover until its insured is fully compensated and restored to his or her pre-accident position. If the insured were forced to pay the costs associated with the insurer\u2019s recovery, then the insured would be left less than fully compensated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 878-79 (citation omitted). The question before us is whether the principles of equity articulated by the court in <em>Winters </em>dictate that State Farm be required to share in the costs and fees associated with Hamm\u2019s recovery under the UIM (underinsured motorist) policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"> We conclude that State Farm should not be required to pay a portion of Hamm\u2019s costs and fees under the common fund doctrine, which \u201capplies to cases where litigants preserve or create a common fund for the benefit of others as well as themselves.\u201d <em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 877. In determining whether the common fund doctrine applies, \u201cthe proper focus is the benefit received.\u201d <em>Mahler, </em>135 Wn.2d at 427. Under this analysis, Hamm\u2019s UIM carrier received no benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In <em>Winters, </em>the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">The fact that the same insurer provides both UIM coverage and medical payment coverage through PIP coverage should not result in the insured\u2019s bearing a greater amount of legal expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\"><em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 881. Conversely, an insurance carrier should not be penalized simply because it provides both UIM coverage and medical payment coverage through PIP (personal injury protection) coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">As framed by the court in <em>Winters, </em>\u201cThe only issue presented to this court is whether a <em>PIP insurer </em>must pay a pro rata share of its insured\u2019s attorney fees associated with recovering full compensation from an UIM insurer.\u201d <em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 875 (emphasis added). <em>Winters </em>is distinguishable from the situation presented by this case because State Farm as PIP carrier did not receive reimbursement, and therefore received no benefit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And clearly, State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>as UIM carrier was placed in a worse position financially by paying an arbitration award in any amount.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\">This case is factually indistinguishable from <em>Dayton, </em>in which the court held that in UIM proceedings the American rule, under which each party must bear his or her own legal expenses, applies. The <em>Winters </em>court distinguished <em>Dayton, </em>stating that in that case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\">the issue was whether or not a UIM carrier was responsible for paying for its insured\u2019s legal expenses in making a UIM claim. The question presented here is totally different: whether or not the PIP carrier should pay a pro rata share of legal expenses for its insured in recovering PIP benefits from an UIM insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 882. <em>Winters </em>distinguishes but does not overrule <em>Dayton. </em>As such, <em>Dayton </em>is still good law and we are bound to follow it. <em>State v. Gore, </em>101 Wn.2d 481, 681 P.2d 227 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">It appears that Hamm is seeking to have State Farm pay a portion of her fees in its capacity as PIP carrier. But to the extent that she seeks fees from her PIP carrier, <em>Winters </em>is distinguishable because Hamm\u2019s PIP carrier received no reimbursement. And to the extent that Hamm seeks fees from her UIM carrier, <em>Dayton </em>is directly on point. In either event, Hamm is not entitled to reimbursement for the costs and fees she incurred in obtaining the UIM arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Hamm argues that, as in <em>Winters, </em>\u201cIf the insured were forced to pay the costs associated with the insurer\u2019s recovery, then the insured would be left less than fully compensated.\u201d <em>Winters, </em>144 Wn.2d at 879 (citing <em>Mahler, </em>135 Wn.2d at 425 n.17; <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Ritz, </em>70 Wn.2d 317, 322, 422 P.2d 780 (1967); <em>Fisher v. Aldi </em>Tire, <em>Inc., </em>78 Wn. App. 902, 902 P.2d 166 (1995); <em>Pena v. Thorington, </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Wn. App. 277, 281, 595 P.2d 61 (1979)). But unlike in <em>Winters, </em>the PIP carrier here did not \u201crecover.\u201d Moreover, as noted by the court in <em>Dayton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-3\">In fact, providing attorney fees in a UIM arbitration to determine damages would give the insured more than he or she contracted for. We have often repeated the purpose of the UIM statute is to place the insured in the same position as if the tortfeasor carried liability insurance. Thus, the insurance carrier stands in the shoes of the uninsured motorist to the extent of the carrier\u2019s UIM policy limits. The injured party is not entitled to be put in a better position by having been struck by an uninsured motorist as opposed to an insured motorist. Accordingly, UIM carriers are not compelled to pay when the same recovery could not have been obtained from the uninsured tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-4\">When a tortfeasor carries insurance, the claimant insured bears his or her own attorney fees in the arbitration proceeding. Thus, when the UIM insurer stands in the shoes of the uninsured tortfeasor, the claimant insured should likewise bear his or her own attorney fees. Recovery of attorney fees in a UIM arbitration constitutes an amount greater than that available from an insured tortfeasor. This is not consistent with the purpose of UIM insurance, or the statutes governing UIM coverage. Unlike the insured in <em>Olympic </em>Steamship,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Mr. Dayton seeks to compel more than the benefits of purchased coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Dayton, </em>124 Wn.2d at 281 (citations omitted). As in <em>Dayton, </em>Hamm would be in a better position for having been injured by an uninsured driver than an insured driver if State Farm were required to pay a share of her fees and costs. We agree with the <em>Dayton </em>Court that this is inconsistent with the purpose of UIM insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Finally, unlike in <em>Winters </em>and <em>Mahler, </em>it would not be \u201cgrossly inequitable\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for Hamm to bear the entirety of her fees and costs. The plaintiffs in <em>Winters </em>and <em>Mahler </em>incurred substantial fees and costs in obtaining recovery from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the at-fault driver for the benefit of the insurer. Here, in contrast, Hamm did not incur <em>any </em>fees or costs in litigation with the at-fault driver, because she engaged in no litigation with the at-fault driver. We conclude that general principles of equity do not require that State Farm pay a share of Hamm\u2019s costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">We therefore decline to amend our earlier opinion in light of <em>Winters. </em>This order is to be published in the Washington Appellate Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Review granted at 149 Wn.2d 1017 (2003).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\"> Rather, State Farm as UIM carrier received an offset for the PIP payment previously made. Arguably, the trial court erred in awarding State Farm an offset for the entire amount of the PIP payments, rather than for just those expenses which were reasonable and necessary as determined in the UIM arbitration. But that issue is not before us. This case is solely concerned with State Farm\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees. Hamm did not cross appeal on the amount of the offset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> Even if one were to assume that State Farm in its capacity as UIM carrier received a benefit from the PIP payments, these PIP payments clearly do not constitute a \u201ccommon fund.\u201d Nor does it appear from the record that Hamm incurred costs and attorney fees in recovering the PIP payments. The common fund doctrine therefore does not apply. Further, as discussed below, <em>Dayton </em>holds that a UIM carrier is not required to pay the insured\u2019s fees incurred in making a UIM claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> <em>Olympic S.S.
