Trowler; that said Trowler could not be found but plaintiffs discovered certain property belonging to said debtor; that Trowler had executed a trust deed on said property in favor of defendants and a notice of default had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The complaint alleges that, \u201cplaintiffs had notice of said records; and having notice thereof, plaintiffs made offer to defendant to satisfy defendant\u2019s said debt in consideration of defendant\u2019s canceling his said deed of trust and foregoing foreclosure sale thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">\u201cThat in consideration for plaintiffs\u2019 oral promise to pay to defendant the said debt of $600.00, defendant orally agreed and represented that he would cancel his said deed of trust and would forego foreclosure sale thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">\u201cThat plaintiffs believed and relied upon defendant\u2019s said statements and representations, and believing therein and relying thereon, and not otherwise, plaintiffs caused execution to be levied against said real property for the satisfaction of said judgment, and incurred costs and expenses in the amount of $63.61 therefor.\u201d That thereafter defendant refused to settle upon the terms agreed upon and foreclosed the trust deed thus depriving plaintiff of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">The court gave judgment for plaintiff for damages and costs from which defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">The evidence is conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">It is contended on appeal that the transaction comes within the statute of frauds; that no fraudulent inducements were proven and that no damages resulted from the alleged oral promise of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">On the contrary, respondent points out, and the record sustains respondents\u2019 contention, that \u201cno agreement for the sale of a trust deed is involved. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">It would serve no useful purpose to recite all of details; it is sufficient to note th\u00e1t a review of the record reveals suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>cient evidence to support the judgment and the statute of frauds, in the light of the trial court\u2019s view of the evidence, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 20, 1949, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 26,1950.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
