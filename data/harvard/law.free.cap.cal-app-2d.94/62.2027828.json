Botsford, trustee, and two corporations, plaintiffs below, appeal from a written order (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 58Id) dismissing their complaint as against defendants and respondents John R. Pascoe and others, under Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, subdivision (a), for failure to make return of service on the summons within three years after the commencement of the action. Appellants contend that they were excused from complying with section 581a, subdivision (a) because, within the three-year period, respondents made \u201ca general appearance in the action.\u201d We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellants, by complaint filed January 3, 1974, sued Haskins &amp; Sells (an accounting partnership) and fictitiously named defendants for damages, alleging that Haskins &amp; Sells had given appellants certain assertedly erroneous income tax advice. Haskins &amp; Sells cross-complained against respondents (all of whom were lawyers) and others. The cross-complaint, essentially for indemnity, alleged that the tax advice had initially come from the cross-defendants. Respondents demurred to the cross-complaint and their demurrer was sustained. The cross-complaint was amended and thereafter respondents participated actively in proceedings on- the cross-complaint, demurring a second time (unsuccessfully), answering, entering into stipulations, and initiating and responding to discovery. Among other acts respondents entered into three separate written stipulations (in Sept. 1975, in Apr. 1976, and in May 1976) to which appellants were also parties, each of which was prepared by counsel for Haskins &amp; Sells and each of which permitted substitution of a personal representative for a deceased cross-defendant. Also (in Dec. 1975) respondents directed a request for production of documents (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2031) to appellants, who subsequently responded thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Respondents were not named as defendants in the complaint until December 6, 1976, slightly more than 35 months after the complaint had been filed. On that date appellants obtained an order for amendment of the complaint, amended the complaint to substitute respondents for fictitiously named defendants, and effected personal service of the summons and complaint on respondents. On January 6, 1977, three days more than three years after the complaint was filed, appellants filed return of service of the summons on respondents. On the same day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>respondents moved to dismiss the complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion was granted; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">If the summons has not been served <em>and return made </em>within three years after the commencement of the action, and if the case does not come within a statutory or judicially declared exception, dismissal of the complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, subdivision (a), is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>(Slaybaugh </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 216, 221, 224-225 [138 Cal.Rptr. 628]; cf. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 523, 525-526 [122 Cal.Rptr. 432].) It is not necessary to show that the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay. <em>(Elling Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 89, 98 [123 Cal.Rptr. 734].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Appellants do not dispute that return of service of the summons upon respondents was not made until more than three years after the commencement of the action. Nor do appellants contend that there was any written stipulation to extend the time period. Appellants\u2019 main contention on appeal is that within the three-year period respondents \u201cmade a general appearance in the action\u201d within the meaning of section 581a, subdivision (a), and that respondents\u2019 general appearance excused appellants from returning the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Within the meaning of section 581a, \u201c \u2018A general appearance is not necessarily a formal, technical step or act. The term is applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>various acts which, under established principles of procedure, are deemed to confer jurisdiction of the person.\u2019 \u201d <em>(O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 920, 921 [42 Cal.Rptr. 343].) Whether there has been a general appearance will often depend upon an examination of all the circumstances. <em>(General Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 449, 453 [124 Cal.Rptr. 745, 541 P.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u201c<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA \u2018general appearance\u2019 must be express or arise by implication from the defendant\u2019s seeking, taking, or agreeing to some step or proceeding in the cause beneficial to himself or detrimental to the plaintiff, other than one contesting the jurisdiction only.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(RCA Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 1007, 1009 [121 Cal.Rptr. 441].) Without question respondents appeared generally, in proceedings upon the cross-complaint, within the three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">But respondents contend that their general appearance was limited to the cross-complaint. They take the position that for purposes of section 581a, subdivision (a), there were two separate \u201cactions,\u201d one on the complaint and the other on the cross-complaint, and that respondents appeared only on the cross-complaint and did not make \u201ca general appearance in the action\u201d on the complaint. Therefore, respondents argue, their motion to dismiss the complaint was not barred by a general appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We agree with respondents that for purposes of section 581a, subdivision (a), an \u201caction\u201d on a complaint should be distinguished from an \u201caction\u201d on a related cross-complaint and that a general appearance in one such action will not necessarily constitute a general appearance in the other. A complaint and a cross-complaint in a single lawsuit are for most purposes treated as independent actions. <em>(Pacific Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1933) 219 Cal. 179, 182-183 [25 P.2d 983, 90 A.L.R. 384]; <em>National Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Unified School Dist. </em>(1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 418, 422 [9 Cal.Rptr. 864]; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7 990, pp. 2571-2572.) A conclusion that the same distinction should be maintained under section 581a is suggested, if not mandated, by the language of subdivision (a) (relating to an \u201caction . . . commenced by complaint\u201d) and of subdivision (b) (relating to an \u201caction . . . commenced by cross-complaint\u201d) of the section itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellants contend that it should be the general rule that the complaint and related cross-complaints in a single lawsuit should be treated collectively as a single \u201caction\u201d and that the \u201cdoctrinal fiction\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>separate and independent actions on complaint and cross-complaint should be used only for a limited number of \u201cspecific purposes.\u201d This contention appears to be contradicted by the cases; specifically, <em>Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 51-52 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608, 65 A.L.R.3d 878], upon which appellants rely, does not support their generalization. Appellants also point to language in Code of Civil Procedure section 428.60 (relating to service of cross-complaints) which, they argue, supports the conclusion that, in general, a complaint and a related cross-complaint together constitute a single action. We cannot derive so broad an implication from section 428.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Appellants next contend that to \u201capply the doctrinal fiction of . . . separate actions\u201d to these proceedings \u201cwould elevate form over substance and defeat justice.\u201d Appellants\u2019 argument involves the premise that respondents had \u201cappeared and fully participated\u201d; to substantiate their premise appellants point out that the cross-complaint herein is factually and theoretically closely related to the complaint and argue that therefore respondents\u2019 activities upon the cross-complaint necessarily prepared respondents to defend upon the complaint as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">But from the inception of the lawsuit until nearly three years later respondents were not named as defendants in appellants\u2019 complaint. In the interim respondents were compelled (by process on the cross-complaint) to appear and to defend themselves with respect to the cross-complaint. But the law did not require respondents to take any action with respect to the complaint as to which they were neither named nor served. (Cf. <em>Union Tank etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Mammoth Oil Co. </em>(1933) 134 Cal.App. 229, 231-232 [25 P.2d 262].) It cannot realistically be assumed that respondents \u201cfully participated\u201d with respect to the complaint while waiting to learn whether they would or would not be designated as defendants therein. In any event it is clearly the intent of section 581a that neither a defendant (no matter how well prepared) nor the court system should be required to wait indefinitely to <em>litigate </em>a defense. (Cf. <em>Elling Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d atp. 95; <em>General Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We conclude that respondents did not make \u201ca general appearance in the action\u201d on the complaint, within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, subdivision (a), solely by virtue of their activities with respect to the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Appellants next contend that respondents in fact appeared directly as to the complaint itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">(1) After they were served on December 6, 1976, and before the end of the 3-year period 28 days later, respondents stipulated with Haskins &amp; Sells to postpone certain discovery on the cross-complaint and to take the cross-complaint off calendar. Neither stipulation tended to link respondents to the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">(2) As noted above, appellants and respondents signed stipulations prepared by Haskins &amp; Sells to substitute personal representatives for deceased cross-defendants. Each stipulation related solely to the cross-complaint; none was of material benefit to respondents. It was arguably unnecessary to include appellants in any of the stipulations, and there is no showing that respondents participated in the decision to include appellants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">(3) Respondents asked appellants to produce documents, invoking Code of Civil Procedure section 2031. The section 2031 procedure is available only between parties: To maintain the distinction between the action on the complaint and the action on the cross-complaint, and their contention that they were parties to the latter but not to the former, respondents arguably should have used a subpoena duces tecum rather than a request to produce; arguably respondents\u2019 use of the request to produce constituted an implicit acknowledgment that respondents were parties to the action on the complaint. Upon careful consideration, however, we conclude that the use of the section 2031 procedure did not constitute \u201ca general appearance in the action\u201d on the complaint: At the time they used the procedure respondents still had not been designated as defendants in the complaint, and in the request for production respondents clearly and repeatedly identified themselves as \u201ccross-defendants.\u201d Although a fictitiously designated defendant can appear generally, such a general appearance must involve a clear indication that the defendant is appearing and consents to being substituted for the fictitious name. (Cf. <em>Chitwood </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 522, 528 [92 Cal.Rptr. 441].) No such, clear indication was involved in the use of the section 2031 procedure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellants contend that the recent case of <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 762 [145 Cal.Rptr. 814] establishes that <em>return </em>of service within three years is no longer \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and that in light of <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>this court can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and should, in the circumstances of this case, relieve appellants of the express requirement of section 581a that \u201creturn [be] made within three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We disagree. <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>does not, in our view, purport to authorize this or any other court to disregard the Legislature\u2019s mandate that return be made within three years. Rather, <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>simply approves a trial court\u2019s application of the rule (also stated in <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Shumate </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 802, 806 [135 Cal.Rptr. 604], and subsequently in <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 826, 831 [154 Cal.Rptr. 453]) that a <em>timely but formally defective </em>return may be <em>corrected </em>by amendment made, nunc pro tunc, after the three-year period has run.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>service was made by mail, and within the three-year period plaintiff filed in the trial court an original alias summons to which were attached a copy of a letter from plaintiff\u2019s counsel advising defendant of the capacity in which it was served and a certified mail receipt for the letter. This \u201creturn manifestly did not conform to the form prescribed by the Judicial Council\u201d (80 Cal.App.3d at p. 769); a copy of the acknowledgment of service and a declaration of the individual who mailed the service were not filed until after the three-year period had run. The trial court nevertheless denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeal pointed out that \u201cproof of service is required to inform the court that a defendant has received the necessary notice\u201d and quoted the Judicial Council comment to Code of Civil Procedure section 417.10: \u201c \u2018[I]f the process is in correct form, properly issued and served, and the proof of service is timely filed with the clerk, a defective affidavit will not destroy jurisdiction; the court may permit an amendment of the affidavit to conform to the facts.\u2019 \u201d (80 Cal.App.3d at p. 770.) The Court of Appeal concluded that it agreed with plaintiff that \u201cthe court had notice of service of process on [defendant] and that any defects in the proof of service could be cured nunc pro tunc,\u201d and construed the Judicial Council comment to indicate \u201can intent that a defective return of service prevents a dismissal (pursuant to \u00a7 581a) if the service itself is proper.\u201d (80 Cal.App.3d at p. 771.) Thus, the Court of Appeal held, the trial court in denying the motion to dismiss acted within its discretionary powers. (80 Cal.App.3d at p. 771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">If in this action appellants had filed a defective return of service, or otherwise formally notified the trial court that service had been effected, within the three-year period, the language of <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Shumate, M. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>and <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>might be applicable. But here there was no return whatsoever, with respect to service of the complaint on respondents, within the three-year period. <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">We find appellants\u2019 final argument, that since an appearing defendant later designated as a cross-defendant need not be served with summons on the cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 428.60, subd. (2)) the converse should also be true, to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The summons was not returned, and respondents did not make a general appearance in the action on the complaint, within three years after that action commenced. The dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Before Racanelli, P.
