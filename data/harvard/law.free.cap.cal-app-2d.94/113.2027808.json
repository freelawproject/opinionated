J.</author>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">This is an appeal from a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiff, California State Automobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau (hereafter CSAA), determining that it owed no obligation to either defend or indemnify the driver of the insured vehicle with respect to the claimed wrongful death of the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The facts as stipulated to by the parties reveal that Margaret J. Antonelli was issued an automobile insurance policy by CSAA in November 1971. The policy was in full force and effect on January 1, 1975, when Margaret J. Antonelli was killed in a single car collision while riding as a passenger in her own car. At the time of the collision, Thomas N. Tamplin was driving the deceased\u2019s car. In May 1975, Wilbur J. Antonelli and Augustine Antonelli, parents of the deceased, brought an action against Tamplin, seeking damages for the wrongful death of their daughter. Since Tamplin would apparently qualify as an insured under the policy, CSAA brought this action to determine whether it was obliged to defend and/or indemnify Tamplin.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The trial court held that the policy properly excluded from insurance coverage any claims arising by reason of the death of an insured. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">The insurance policy in question provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">\u201cPart I\u2014Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">\u201cBodily Injury Liability; Property Damage Liability [hereafter coverage section].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">\u201c[Insurer agrees] To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, other than punitive damages, because of: [\u00b6] (a) bodily injury, <em>including death </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>resulting therefrom, hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 </em>sustained by any person; . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cExclusions This policy does not apply under Part 1: ... [\u00b6] (k) to liability to bodily injury to any insured;. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Since appellants are attacking the superior court\u2019s interpretation of the insurance policy and its ruling that CSAA was not liable under the policy, it is the duty of this court to make its own independent determination of the meaning of the language used in the contract under consideration <em>(Bareno </em>v. <em>Employers Life Ins. Co. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 875 [103 Cal.Rptr. 865, 500 P.2d 889]).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Appellants\u2019 argument, generally stated, is that since the language of the policy fails to unambiguously exclude \u201cdeath of an insured\u201d from the policy\u2019s coverage, \u201cbodily injury\u201d as used in the policy should be interpreted to mean bodily injury in its narrow sense, i.e., injury not including death. If the exclusion <em>is </em>ambiguous,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> California case law would support this interpretation.  While no California decision appears to have ruled directly on the question of whether \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes \u201cdeath,\u201d it has been held that when a policy excludes liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the insured, such exclusion will not exonerate the insurer from liability where the insured <em>dies (Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hauck </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 293 [110 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>Housh </em>v. <em>Pacific States Life Ins. Co. </em>(1934) 2 Cal.App.2d 14 [37 P.2d 714] (disapproved on another issue in <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 460, 474 [267 P.2d 777])). As such, an insurer must specifically state that \u201cdeath\u201d as well as \u201cbodily injury\u201d are excluded from the policy\u2019s coverage to avoid liability for an insured\u2019s death.  Thus, the issue in the present case becomes: (1) Does the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>stated in the coverage section unambiguously include \u201cdeath of the insured\u201d? and, if so, (2) Does this definition unambiguously <em>extend </em>to the exclusion clause which excludes liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Appellants first argue that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d is, in itself, ambiguous. They claim that since \u201cbodily injury\u201d is given a \u201cspecial, expanded meaning\u201d in the coverage section, such special definition conflicts with what is \u201cnormally understood\u201d by \u201cbodily injury,\u201d and hence an ambiguity is created.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It is well settled that if a clause or term in an insurance policy is ambiguous, such ambiguity is to be resolved against the insurer <em>(State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Elkins </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 534 [125 Cal.Rptr. 139]). Moreover, the existence of an ambiguity will be determined from a layman\u2019s perspective <em>(Crane </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 112 [95 Cal.Rptr. 513, 485 P.2d 1129, 48 A.L.R.3d 1089]). However, such ambiguity cannot be based on a strained interpretation of the policy\u2019s terms. Rather, the court should give a reasonable interpretation to such terms <em>(West </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 562 [106 Cal.Rptr. 486]).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\"><em>In the present case, the definition of \u201cbodily injury \u201d contained in the coverage section is not ambiguous. </em>Although \u201cbodily injury\u201d may have a commonly understood meaning that does not include \u201cdeath,\u201d it does not necessarily follow that a lay person reading the insurance policy in question would confuse this narrower interpretation of \u201cbodily injury\u201d with the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d provided in the policy. The coverage section unequivocally defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d so that it includes \u201cdeath.\u201d Although \u201cbodily injury\u201d so defined may have a broader meaning than other definitions of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d the definition of the term in the coverage section is unambiguous because it adequately excludes any other interpretation of \u201cbodily injury\u201d by defining the term, and using it consistently throughout the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\"><em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Houck, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d 293, a case cited by appellants, is instructive on this point. The controversy in <em>Mid-Century </em>arose out of a water skiing accident when the insured was operating his motor boat and towing his wife. The wife collided with an irrigation pipe protruding above the water surface and died from resulting injuries. The insurer sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether it was obliged to pay for wrongful death claims arising out of the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>wife. The coverage clause of the policy in that case stated that the insurer would \u201c \u2018pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay for bodily injury, including death at any time . . . sustained by any person\u2019 \u201d (p. 295). The policy included an exclusion that stated \u201c \u2018[This policy does not cover ...]... bodily injury . . . sustained by (a) any member of the same household as the insured ....\u2019\u201d (P. 295.) It was undisputed that the insured\u2019s wife was of the same household as the insured. The issue faced by the court was whether the exclusion that spoke only of \u201cbodily injury\u201d also included death. The court held that death was not excluded from the policy\u2019s coverage. The court found that the exclusion was ambiguous because the policy failed to 1) define the term \u201cbodily injuiy\u201d as including \u201cdeath,\u201d and 2) use that term consistently throughout the policy. The court pointed out that aside from failing to define \u201cbodily injury,\u201d other exclusions in the policy used the term in a manner inconsistent with the meaning given \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the coverage section (i.e., \u201c \u2018bodily injury, including death\u2019 \u201d). While one exclusion read \u201c \u2018bodily injuiy or property damage,\u2019 \u201d other exclusions used the terms \u201c \u2018personal injuries or loss of life\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018bodily injuiy, sickness, disease or death.\u2019 \u201d Since bodily injury was reasonably susceptible of two constructions (i.e., \u201cbodily injury, including death\u201d and \u201cnonfatal injuries\u201d\u2014as would be the case if the exclusion for \u201c \u2018bodily injuiy, sickness, disease or death\u2019 \u201d were technically interpreted), the court strictly construed the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the exclusion to mean nonfatal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In the present case, the term \u201cbodily injuiy\u201d is treated quite differently. Here, the term <em>is defined </em>in the coverage section. That section states that the insurer will \u201cpay ... all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, . . . because of: [\u00b6] (a) bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom, <em>hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury\u2019. </em>. (italics added). By quoting the term \u201c \u2018bodily injuiy,\u2019 \u201d the lay reader is put on notice that this term has special significance, and that when such term is used elsewhere in the policy the definition provided in the coverage section applies. Further, \u201cbodily injuiy\u201d is never redefined or used inconsistently with regard to the initial definition. The eight exclusions that use the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d (exclusions a, b, c, d, e, f, k and m) do not substitute or add other phrases to explain or modify the meaning of the term. The instant policy does not leave room for an alternative interpretation of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Bodily injury, as defined in the coverage section, cannot be interpreted to mean anything less than \u201c \u2018bodily injury, including death ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>It should also be noted that the federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected the same ambiguity argument in the context of a service station owner\u2019s liability policy, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Company </em>(1962) 308 F.2d 709. The policy in that case bound the insurer \u201c \u2018To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of: [\u00b6] A. bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, <em>hereinafter called \u201cbodily injury,\u201d </em>sustained by any person . . .\u2019 \u201d (p. 710, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellants next argue that since the term \u201chereinafter\u201d has no precise meaning, the policy is ambiguous because there is no clear indication that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the coverage section extends to any other part of the policy. Appellants claim that use of the term \u201chereinafter\u201d fails to change the meaning of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in exclusion (k). As such, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in exclusion (k) should be interpreted as not including death.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The fundamental rule of construction applicable to contracts of insurance requires the enforcement of a contract according to the policy language read and considered as a whole <em>(Home Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Leo L. Davis, Inc. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 863 [145 Cal.Rptr. 158]).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Although the term \u201chereinafter\u201d has no precise meaning when it is not read in context with the rest of the policy, it is clear from the language and format of the present policy that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d stated in the coverage section extends unambiguously throughout part I of the policy and is applicable to the exclusion in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The policy in issue is divided into five main parts, each part being devoted to a different type of insurance coverage (part I, that part of the policy in issue, covers liability for bodily injury and property damage). Each of these parts is made up of a system of smaller sections, including a coverage section, a definition section and an exclusion section.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">From the layout of the policy, it is quite clear that each part is designed to stand by itself. The part is designed to be a complete statement by the insurer with regard to a particular type of insurance coverage. The sections contained within each part act as subheadings, designating different components of the part. As such, these sections must be read together to determine the type and extent of insurance coverage discussed in each part.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined in the first section of part I (the coverage section), and it is provided that this definition is to apply \u201chereinafter.\u201d Since it is clear from the policy format that all of the sections of the part are to be read together, the only reasonable interpretation is that the \u201cbodily injury\u201d definition applies to all those sections in part 1 which follow the coverage section. As such, the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d provided in the coverage section clearly applies to exclusion (k) which is located in the exclusion section of part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Appellants insist that use of the term \u201chereinafter\u201d.could be interpreted as applying solely to the coverage clause. This position is untenable. Appellants\u2019 argument is based on the assumption that each section of the part stands by itself and does not influence the interpretation of other sections in the part. This assumption is clearly unreasonable since it is obvious from the policy that the purpose of certain sections is to aid the insured in the interpretation of the entire part. Appellants would have this court believe that the definitions section, for example, serves little purpose, since the definitions of the terms therein would not apply to any other section.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Since the policy construed as a whole clearly indicates that the term \u201chereinafter\u201d extends throughout the whole of part I, the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the coverage section extends unambiguously to the exclusion in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Finally, appellants argue that since there is nothing in exclusion (k) itself that expressly includes death, said exclusion is ambiguous. This argument is not well taken. The term bodily injury is unambiguously defined in the coverage section. This definition applies unambiguously to exclusion (k). Since \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the exclusion has been clearly defined to include death, the exclusion is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Further, it should be pointed out (and appellants do not contend otherwise) that the precise language used in exclusion (k) was found unambiguous by the Supreme Court in <em>California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Warwick </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 190 [130 Cal.Rptr. 520, 550 P.2d 1056]. In <em>Warwick, </em>the court observed that subdivision (c) of section 11580.1 of the Insurance Code authorizes insurance carriers to exclude \u201c \\ . . Liability for bodily injury to an insured.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[B]odily injury\u2019 \u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>defined in the Insurance Code as including \u201csickness or disease, <em>including death resulting </em>therefrom.\u201d (\u00a7 11580.06, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The court in <em>Warwick </em>found that the exclusion, using the exact same language as the exclusion in the present case, clearly and unambiguously barred a claim by an insured for \u201cbodily injury.\u201d In the present case, bodily injury is unambiguously defined to include death. As such, death is also unambiguously excluded. Moreover, it would follow that if such provision unambiguously excludes \u201cbodily injury\u201d as the court held in <em>Warwick, </em>it must also unambiguously exclude \u201cdeath,\u201d since death, as defined in the Insurance Code, is within the meaning of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In the superior court proceedings, appellants argued that \u201cwhat the insurance buyer sees is not really what the question is. Because as the Court knows, the insurance buyer probably doesn\u2019t read the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is a general rule, of appellate review that arguments waived at the trial level will not be considered on appeal. This rule is founded on considerations of practical necessity in the orderly administration of the law and of fairness to the court and the opposite party (5 Cal.Jur.3d, Appellate Review, \u00a7 480, pp. 117-118).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">By stating at the trial level that \u201cwhat the insurance buyer <em>sees </em>is not really what the question is\u201d (italics added), appellants have admitted the conspicuousness of the exclusion is not in issue. Nor was the issue of conspicuousness discussed at any other time during the lower court argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Although some cases have held that a new argument may be made on appeal when a question of law only is presented <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736 [336 P.2d 534]), these cases do not involve a situation similar to the case at hand; i.e., where an appellant has <em>expressly rejected </em>the argument in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Nonetheless it is argued by appellants that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d is inconspicuous. Appellants point out that the definition of \u201cbodily injury, including death\u201d is not located in the definitions section. Rather, that definition is found in the coverage section. Appellants reason that since bodily injury is a defined term, it belongs in the definitions section. Since the definition of bodily injury is not placed where a lay reader would reasonably expect to find it, the definition is inconspicuous according to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Appellants base their argument on a statement made by the court in <em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hauck, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d 293, 296: \u201cIf the carrier sought to exclude an action for wrongful death, it should have included in the Special Conditions section a definition of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 which would achieve that goal, and it should draft its exclusions so that a layman reading the policy understands the distinctions made therein.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Appellants have based their argument on dicta. The sole issue in <em>Mid-Century </em>was whether an exclusion for bodily injury included death. That was an <em>ambiguity </em>issue. The court in <em>Mid-Century </em>found that the policy in question <em>was </em>ambiguous because it failed to define the term bodily injury, and used that term inconsistently so that bodily injury was incapable of uniform interpretation. The court never dealt directly with the issue of conspicuousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In the passage quoted above, the court is merely suggesting a reasonable place where a definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d might be included. The above passage cannot be interpreted to mean that placing the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the coverage section rather than in the definitions section will render the definition inconspicuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In the present case, by contrast, the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d is placed conspicuously in the coverage section. Since the coverage section is the <em>first </em>paragraph of part I of the policy, the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d is one of the first matters discussed in that part. As such, it is one of the first things that a layman would read. Moreover, defining bodily injury in the coverage section is reasonable. As previously stated, the subject matter discussed in part I is liability for bodily injury and property damage. Since the coverage section of part I is properly devoted to setting out the general parameters of the insurance coverage with regard to bodily injury and property damage, it is reasonable to define those terms in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Miller, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 8, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Appellant admits that a proper exclusion of liability for wrongful death claims is authorized by subdivision (c) of section 11580.1, and subdivision (c) of section 11580.06 of the Insurance Code.
