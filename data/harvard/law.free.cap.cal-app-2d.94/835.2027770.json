Code, \u00a7 211, counts I, V, IX, X, and XII) and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon upon a police officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (b); counts III and VI). He also admitted having used a firearm in the commission of each of these offenses (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced pursuant to the determinate sentence law to a total term of imprisonment of 16% years. He appeals contending (1) the trial court erred in failing to state any reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, (2) it was error to enhance the sentence on two of the counts (III and V) with a use of a firearm finding (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) inasmuch as those two offenses were committed upon a single occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">At the time it pronounced judgment, the trial court made a detailed statement specifying its selection of the various terms of imprisonment but inadvertently failed to articulate the reason or reasons for its determination that consecutive sentences were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">A recurring theme in the determinate sentence law is that those judicial officers who implement it should orally state the reasons for their sentencing choices on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\u201cThe court shall state the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\u201cSentence choice\u201d is defined as the selection of any disposition of the case not amounting to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 405(f) and Advisory Committee\u2019s corns. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>thereto). The sentencing judge is required to state in simple language the factor or factors that support the exercise of discretion (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 443). The sentencing judge is required to determine whether consecutive sentences should be imposed (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 433(c)(3)). (See also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 619, 622 [148 Cal.Rptr. 66], expressly holding that the decision to impose a consecutive sentence is a \u201csentence choice\u201d and <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosalez </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 789 [153 Cal.Rptr. 65].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The objective is meaningful review of the exercise of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">California Rules of Court, rule 425, sets forth the criteria affecting consecutive sentences as follows; \u201cCriteria affecting the decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201c(a) Facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201c(1) The crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201c(2) The crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201c(3) The crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201c(4) Any of the crimes involved multiple victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">\u201c(5) The convictions for which sentences are to be imposed are numerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">\u201c(b) Any circumstances in aggravation or mitigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Our ability to review the decision here is not impaired by the failure of the trial court to make reference to the above rule. Conversely, a simple recital of the applicable criteria would not have served any useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>We are unwilling to engage in idle gestures or reach ridiculous results by slavish adherence to ritualistic form. A brief glance at the record shows that defendant\u2019s crimes met every criteria listed in the rule and there is a total absence of any mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is also lacking in merit. Initially we observe that the point was never urged nor ruled upon in the court below. Furthermore, it appears that defendant\u2019s ability to raise the issue may be precluded by the terms of the plea bargain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event we conclude that the offenses embraced in counts III and V do not appear to have been committed upon a \u201csingle occasion\u201d as that phrase has been interpreted by other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We have, on motion of defendant, and without objection by the Attorney General, augmented the record on appeal to include the superior court file which contains a copy of the preliminaiy hearing transcript. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 12(a).) In pertinent part, it reveals that on the evening of November 13, 1977, Officer Jerrold Antoon of the Los Angeles Police Department was present at the scene of an accident that was blocking traffic. Defendant, driving a stolen car,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> attempted illegally to drive around a long line of waiting cars. He was stopped by Officer Antoon who approached intending to issue a traffic citation. As the officer was in the process of obtaining defendant\u2019s identification, defendant shot him and fled on foot. Officer Antoon testified that he was shot at approximately 9:30 p.m. This was the offense covered by count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">At approximately 9:45 p.m., Rudolph DeChellis, the driver of another car that had been caught in the traffic jam, was able to avoid the blockade by making a U-tum. As he did so he was \u201cflagged down\u201d by defendant who was walking away from the direction of the accident. Thinking that defendant might be injured, DeChellis stopped to render aid. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>pointed his gun at DeChellis, threatened to \u201cblow [DeChellis\u2019] brains out,\u201d and ordered him to unlock the passenger door. DeChellis complied but then exited the car from the driver\u2019s side. Defendant fled in DeChellis\u2019 car. This was the offense covered by count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In <em>In re Culbreth </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 330 [130 Cal.Rptr. 719, 551 P.2d 23], our Supreme Court held that Penal Code section 12022.5 may be applied only once where multiple crimes of violence have been committed upon a \u201csingle occasion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Culbreth, </em>appellant shot and killed his common law wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law \u201c. . . in a matter of seconds, all part of a single melee.\u201d (At pp. 332, 335.) The court also described the event as a \u201c. . . single frenetic act of violence which, unfortunately, resulted in multiple victims.\u201d (At p. 334.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552], reaffirmed the principle articulated in <em>Culbreth, supra, </em>and applied the \u201csingle occasion\u201d rule in the context of a burglary-robbery-assault with a deadly weapon, since the defendant used a firearm \u201c. . . in the almost simultaneous commission of three crimes.\u201d (At p. 887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In the instant case, enhancing both counts III and V with use of a firearm finding requires a determination of whether defendant entertained separate and identifiable intents and objectives in the commission of these offenses, i.e., a determination that the \u201csingle occasion\u201d rule was inapplicable and that a \u201cdouble occasion\u201d was at hand. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Holly </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App. 3d 797, 803-806 [133 Cal.Rptr. 331]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 552, and accompanying fn. 5 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) Certainly the subject offenses do not appear to us to have been a \u201csingle frenetic act of violence\u201d <em>(Culbreth, supra, </em>at p. 334) nor \u201calmost simultaneous\u201d in point of time. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">It may well be that as appellant urges, his fundamental intent and objective was \u201c. . . to avoid detection and arrest for stealing the car which he was driving as well as his other robberies committed earlier that evening and in the days preceding the incident.\u201d Nonetheless, this possibility would not give him carte blanche to use a firearm on each and every subsequent occasion when he needs either transportation or money to make good his desire to \u201cavoid detection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\u201cTo accept such a broad, overriding intent and objective to preclude punishment for otherwise clearly separate offenses would violate the statute\u2019s [Pen. Code, \u00a7 654] purpose to insure that a defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability. [Citation.] It would reward the defendant who has the greater criminal ambition with a lesser punishment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>at p. 552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">A close reading of <em>Culbreth, supra, </em>compels the conclusion that the propriety of multiple use enhancement should be tested in a manner akin to that traditionally applied to Penal Code section 654 (at pp. 333, 335; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Chi Ko Wong </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 698, 726, fn. 20 [135 Cal.Rptr. 392, 557 P.2d 976]). The trial court\u2019s determination is well supported by the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Fleming, Acting P. J., and Beach, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 25, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-11\">The remaining five counts, with use of firearm allegations appended to four of them, were dismissed in compliance with the negotiated plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-13\">Respondent\u2019s reliance on the Indeterminate Sentence Law case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 796 [135 Cal.Rptr. 411, 557 P.2d 995], is misplaced.

THE DEFENDANT. Yes.\u201d Since appellant thus benefited from his bargain he cannot claim both its fruits and request a diminution thereof at the same time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 208, 214-215 [145 Cal.Rptr. 686, 577 P.2d 1026]; <em>In re Handsome </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 657, 660 [138 Cal.Rptr. 400].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Defendant had obtained this car in a robbery committed on November 12, 1977 (count I).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In so doing, the court cited three Court of Appeal cases which had precluded multiple use enhancement for multivictim robbery offenses committed upon a \u201csingle occasion.\u201d (Culbreth, at p. 334.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
