In 1977, the Community Release Board (hereinafter CRB) calculated his term of imprisonment under the Determinate Sentencing Act (hereinafter DSA) which became operative on July 1, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, respondent petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, contending inter alia that the nonretroactivity of certain good behavior and participation credit statutes under the DSA constitute a denial of equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">After a hearing, the trial court found such prospective limitations to be an invalid denial of equal protection and directed the CRB to ascertain credit due respondent pursuant to said ruling. Appellant moved to stay execution of the order; the motion was denied. Notice of appeal was timely. Subsequently, this court granted appellant\u2019s application for an order staying execution of the trial court\u2019s order pending appeal. Prior to resolution of this case on appeal, respondent was released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">A. Although technically moot, should this case be decided on its merits?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Respondent was released on parole on June 27, 1978. Since he can no longer be benefitted by good behavior or participation credits, the legal question of their retroactive availability is moot as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>When a case presents questions of general public interest that are likely to recur, the court may render a decision on the merits even though the issue has become moot as to the particular litigant involved. <em>(In re Walters </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 738, 744 [126 Cal.Rptr. 239, 543 P.2d 607]; <em>In re Law </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 21, 23 [109 Cal.Rptr. 573, 513 P.2d 621].) The retroactivity of the credit statutes at issue in the present case is a question of general public interest which is likely to recur. Consequently, mootness does not prevent the resolution of the substantial legal questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">B. Did the trial court err in holding that the nonretroactivity of the good behavior and participation credit statutes violates equal protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The DSA contains provisions under which prisoners may receive credit for good behavior or participation in certain programs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The maximum credit available is a four-month reduction of sentence for every eight months served: three months for forbearance from proscribed activities and one month for participation in educational, vocational or other prison programs. (\u00a7 2931, subds. (b), (c).) Denial of this credit must be preceded by a hearing. (\u00a7 2932.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">For prisoners such as respondent who were originally sentenced under the ISL, such credit is available for reduction of their sentence remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>after July 1, 1977.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the entire sentence of a prisoner who began serving time on July 1, 1977, or thereafter may be reduced by one-third, while prisoners who began serving their sentence before that date may only earn one-third reductions of that part of their sentences still to be served after July 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Attorney General argues that it is not a denial of equal protection to refuse to apply the credit provision in question retroactively. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The credit provisions authorize lessening the determinate term of imprisonment to be served as punishment for a particular offense, and it has been held that it is not a denial of equal protection for the Legislature to specify that such punishment-lessening statutes are prospective only. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518, 531-532 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The equal protection standard employed where there are no \u201csuspect classifications\u201d \u2019 \u201d or classifications impinging upon \u201c \u2018 \u201cfundamental interests\u201d \u2019 \u201d is the \u201crational basis\u201d test. This test invests the questioned legislation with a presumption of constitutionality and requires merely that the distinction drawn by a challenged statute bears some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. (See <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 597 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241]; <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 263, 270 [35 L.Ed.2d 282, 288, 93 S.Ct. 1055].)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> We find this standard applicable in the present case. The classification does not involve any \u201csuspect\u201d categories such as race, ancestry or national origin, nor does it encroach upon any fundamental rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>In <em>In re Moreno </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 740 [130 Cal.Rptr. 78], the Court of Appeal denied a prisoner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus, holding that the petitioner was not entitled to the benefit of an amendment mitigating punishment that became effective after the judgment convicting petitioner had become final. The court stated at page 743: (5) \u201cIn the context of equal protection, \u2018[a] refusal to apply a statute retroactively does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518, 532 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265].) Equal protection is not denied where an amendatory statute reducing a penalty is not applied to persons whose convictions were final before the effective date of the ameliorative amendment. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Cupp </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 452 F.2d 1091.) The only requirement is that \u2018classifications between those to whom the state accords and withholds substantial benefits must be reasonably related to a legitimate public purpose.\u2019 <em>(In re Kapperman, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 545; accord, <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 263, 270 [35 L.Ed.2d 282, 288-289, 93 S.Ct. 1055].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">What is the public purpose here? It is the desirable and legitimate purpose of motivating good conduct among prisoners so as to maintain discipline and minimize threats to prison security. Reason dictates that it is impossible to influence behavior after it has occurred. The classification involved is reasonable, and no equal protection violation is indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">C. Did this court err in granting the stay of execution of the trial court\u2019s order?</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">By an order filed on May 15, 1978, this court stayed execution of the trial court\u2019s order pending appeal. This court\u2019s order, made pursuant to section 1506,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contained the following statement: \u201cSince said [trial court] order has the effect of directing that petitioner and respondent be released on parole, it is <em>not an order granting a discharge or release from custody </em>and therefore cannot serve as a basis for bail or other conditional form of release.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Respondent contends that the trial court\u2019s order, which had the effect of granting him release on parole, is an order granting his \u201cdischarge or release\u201d within the meaning of section 1506 (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>and therefore the stay of execution was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Attorney General argues that, under section 1506, when relief <em>\u201cother than </em>a discharge or a release <em>from custody </em>is granted a stay of execution is permissible. (Original italics.) The language of section 1506 supports this interpretation. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Prisoners on parole remain in the legal custody of the Department of Corrections. (\u00a7 3056.) Therefore, release on parole is <em>not </em>release from custody, and a stay of execution is permissible. (See <em>In re Fain </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 376, 387, fn. 9 [135 Cal.Rptr. 543].) Since the trial court\u2019s order in the present case would have had the effect of releasing respondent upon parole, it was within the power of this court to stay its execution. No error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Caldecott, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 1, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">The DSA was enacted in 1976 (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, p. 5061) to \u201cbecome operative on July 1, 1977\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 351.5), and amended in 1977 (Stats. 1977, ch. 165, p. 631), also \u201coperative on July 1, 1977.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>\u00a7 100.) Effective that date, it repealed and superseded the Indeterminate Sentence Law (hereinafter ISL.)

Section 2930 reads as follows: \u201c(a) The Department of Corrections shall inform every prisoner sentenced under Section 1170, not later than 14 days after reception in prison, of all applicable prison rules and regulations including the possibility of receiving a one-third reduction of the sentence for good behavior and participation. Within 14 days of the prisoner\u2019s arrival at the institution to which the prisoner is ultimately assigned by the Department of Corrections, the prisoner shall be informed of the range of programs offered by that institution and their availability at that institution. The prisoner\u2019s central file shall reflect compliance with the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after reception in prison. \u201c(b) The department shall, within 90 days after July 1, 1977, inform every prisoner who committed a felony before'July I, 1977, and who would have been sentenced under Section 1170 if the felony had been committed after July 1, 1977, of all applicable prison rules and regulations, which have not previously been provided, of the range of programs offered and their availability, and the possibility of receiving a reduction for good behavior and participation of one-third of the prisoner\u2019s remaining sentence after July 1, 1977. The inmate\u2019s central file shall reflect compliance with the provisions of this section.\u201d Section 2931. subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn any case in which an inmate was sentenced to the state prison pursuant to Section 1170, or if he committed a felony before July 1, 1977, and he would have been sentenced under Section 1170 if the felony had been committed after July 1, 1977, the Department of Corrections shall have the authority to reduce the term prescribed under such section by one-third for good behavior and participation consistent with subdivision (d) of Section 1170.2. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Section 1170.2, subdivision (d), provides: \u201cIn the case of any prisoner who committed a felony prior to July 1, 1977, who would have been sentenced under Section 1170 if the felony was committed on or after July 1, 1977, the good behavior and participation provisions of Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 shall apply from July 1, 1977, and thereafter.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The trial court concluded that the scheme abridged petitioner\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d in freedom, thus requiring justification under the stricter \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d test. This reasoning cannot be sustained. The challenged statute does not authorize confinement of a prisoner for a longer term than he otherwise would have served. (See, e.g.. <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 242 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375]; <em>In re Moye </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 457, 465 [149 Cal.Rptr. 491, 584 P.2d 1097].) On the contrary, section 1170.2 specifically provides that in no case may a felon be confined for a period longer than he would have been under the old law (subd. (c)). Rather, the \u201cgood time credit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>provision is wholly amelioratory, allowing both classes of prisoners an increased opportunity to shorten their time served. Therefore, the fundamental right to personal liberty is not violated, and the \u201crational basis\u201d level of review is applicable. <em>(In re Kapperman </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 542, 545-546 [114 Cal.Rptr. 97, 522 P.2d 657]; <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Rovster, </em>supra, 410 U.S. 263 at pp. 268-270 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 287-289].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Section 1506 provides: \u201cAn appeal may be taken to the court of appeal by the people from a final order of a superior court made upon the return of a writ of habeas corpus discharging a defendant or otherwise granting all or any part of the relief sought, in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>criminal cases, excepting criminal cases where judgment of death has been rendered, and in such cases to the Supreme Court; and in all criminal cases where an application for a writ of habeas corpus has been heard and determined in a court of appeal, either the defendant or the people may apply for a hearing in the Supreme Court.
