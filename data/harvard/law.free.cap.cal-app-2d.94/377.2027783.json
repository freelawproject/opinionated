Following a contested jurisdictional hearing the minor was found by the juvenile court to have committed the act proscribed by Penal Code section 148 and generally described as obstructing a police officer in the discharge of his duties. The petition had not been amended and the minor remained silent, neither consenting nor objecting to the juvenile court\u2019s determination of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The appeal before us was taken by the minor from an order granting probation which was thereafter entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The Penal Code section 148 offense is concededly, and obviously, not a lesser offense necessarily included in a charge of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The question presented is whether the juvenile court may, without appropriate amendment to the charging petition or previous notice to the minor, find him \u201cguilty\u201d of an <em>uncharged, </em>and <em>unincluded, </em>lesser offense, in cases where the minor remains silent and \u201cmade no objections to the procedure. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Stanley B., </em>17 Cal.App.3d 530, 536 [ 95 Cal.Rptr. 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 33 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 549, 87 S.Ct. 1428], holds that due process requires that \u201cthe child and his parents or guardian be notified, in writing, of the specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing, and that such written notice be given at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation.\u201d And, as is well known, <em>In re Gault </em>and related high authority <em>generally </em>require that such minors otherwise receive the due process protections which are afforded adult persons charged with crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Our Supreme Court has held that: \u201cA person cannot be convicted of an offense (other than a necessarily included offense) not charged . . . , whether or not there was evidence at his trial to show that he had committed that offense.\u201d <em>(In re Hess, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 174-175 [288 P.2d 5], and see authority there collected; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cannady, </em>8 Cal.3d 379, 389-390 [105 Cal.Rptr. 129, 503 P.2d 585]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Puckett, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 607, 611 [118 Cal.Rptr. 884]; <em>In re Ball, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 380, 384 [100 Cal.Rptr. 189]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calder, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 931, 934 [86 Cal.Rptr. 446]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 585, 599-600 [9 Cal.Rptr. 263]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 842, 844 [341 P.2d 851]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 15, 23 [339 P.2d 888].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The court, in such a situation, lacks \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to so convict the accused. <em>(In re Hess, supra, </em>p. 175; <em>People </em>v. <em>West, </em>3 Cal.3d 595, 612 [91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409]; <em>In re Johnny V, </em>85 Cal.App.3d 120, 136 [149 Cal.Rptr. 180]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 60, 62 [76 Cal.Rptr. 195].) And where the court is without <em>jurisdiction, </em>an accused by his \u201csilence,\u201d or \u201cacquiescence,\u201d may not confer it. \u201cLack of jurisdiction may not be waived, nor may jurisdiction be stipulated.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blakeman, </em>170 Cal.App.2d 596, 598-599 [339 P.2d 202]; see also <em>Sampsell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>32 Cal.2d 763, 776 [197 P.2d 739]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Megladdery, </em>40 Cal.App.2d 748, 762 [106 P.2d 84]; <em>In re Garrity, </em>97 Cal.App. 372, 376 [275 P. 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The foregoing authority, we believe, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We are unable to accept the authority, or rationale, of <em>In re Stanley B.\u2019s </em>dicta <em>(supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d, p. 536) that the minor had \u201creceived the benefit of a dismissal of the more serious offense . . . where the evidence supported such conviction [, and that as] a matter of fact, appellant was lucky in that the court was so lenient; ...\u201d A proper interpretation of the proceedings would seem to be that the juvenile court had concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the \u201cmore serious offense\u201d had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the minor was neither \u201clucky,\u201d nor the court \u201clenient.\u201d It will reasonably be presumed that had the charge been properly supported, the juvenile court would have so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The order granting probation is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On July 23, 1979, the judgment was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
