J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acq\">Appellant is the mother of Jacqueline H., a minor born on March 3, 1968. She appeals from a judgment of the superior court entered in June 1976 terminating her parental rights to the minor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grounds on which the superior court acted are those described in Civil Code sections 232, subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">On appeal the mother raises three main issues: (1) the trial court should have appointed independent counsel to represent the minor, (2) the trial court erroneously admitted certain written reports; and (3) the evidence does not support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">An outline of the relevant facts is contained in a probation report filed December 1, 1975, the admissibility of which is conceded. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 233.) Herewith a summary of the report:</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Jacqueline lived with the mother from the time of her birth in March 1968 until February 1969 when she was placed in foster care. At that time the mother herself had been arrested for attempted assault on her own mother. Jacqueline again resided with the mother from May 1969 until April 1972 when she was again placed in a foster home. Jacqueline has not lived with her mother since that time. The natural father of the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>one Robert H. died in 1973. The mother has for some years been married to one John M.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Jacqueline was declared to be a dependent child of the court under former Welfare and Institutions Code section 600, subdivisions (a) and (d) on May 9, 1972. That status has never changed. Contact between the mother and the minor has been token. The mother\u2019s last visit had occurred in November 1974. In the past the mother \u201chas displayed a very explosive behavior and used profane language; . . .\u201d therefore, on one occasion the court ordered her to seek psychiatric care and visitation was suspended. The mother refused to get psychiatric help. At one point the mother had been in Metropolitan State Hospital for drug usage and was diagnosed as \u201cschizophrenic and hypoglycemia.\u201d She also has a history of drug abuse. A Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) worker had visited the mother in the fall of 1975 and suspected that the mother was continuing to use drugs. DPSS also \u201cfelt\u201d that in the past the minor had been molested by John M. According to Jacqueline\u2019s foster mother, the mother was last seen by her in March 1974. She has not sent the child any Christmas cards, birthday cards or any other holiday greetings. The last gifts given to Jacqueline were at Christmas 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The mother told the probation officer that she lived with her husband, Mr. M. who has a janitorial service for which she works as secretary and bookkeeper. She claimed that she had made efforts to regain custody of Jacqueline, but that the social workers had not been cooperative. In particular one Mrs. Davidson had \u201ccut off visitations.\u201d She claimed to have been to see a psychiatrist as ordered but was told \u201cby the social worker that the letter they received was not what they wanted.\u201d She claimed not to have taken any \u201cdangerous drugs without prescription\u201d since June 1969. She feels that both the social worker and the foster mother are hostile to her because while she was white, the child\u2019s father was black.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The probation officer evaluated the mother as \u201ca very intelligent person\u201d and found it inconceivable that she \u201cwould allow such a matter to go for a length of time without taking some action.\u201d It was the probation officer\u2019s \u201cfeeling that the child has been subjected to enough traumatic experiences and should be given this chance to live a normal life. She apparently has a very good potential home and is beginning to stabilize.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>It seems to be understood that if the judgment appealed from is affirmed, proceedings leading to the adoption of Jacqueline by her present foster mother will be initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">One of the two challenged reports was a report dated May 1972, signed by one Herbert W. Lambert, an investigator for the DPSS. This report was filed in connection with the then pending proceedings under former section 600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. It makes the following points: Investigation has \u201crevealed\u201d that the mother has been \u201cextremely heavily habituated to barbituates [\u00bf7c] for a number of years\u201d and, according to Mr. M., other DPSS workers, neighbors and police has been \u201cunable to care for herself much less the minor.\u201d During a prearranged visit by Lambert she was \u201ctotally incoherent with very slurred speech . . . stumbling. . . .\u201d Further investigation showed that the family had been under the supervision of DPSS protective services for over three years, drug addiction being apparent. There is also a reference to the mother\u2019s hospitalization which resulted in the diagnosis of \u201cschizoprenia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Lambert felt that the family had no \u201cidentifiable strengths.\u201d Mr. M. himself was on aid to the totally disabled and \u201creportedly\u201d also an addict. The minor was described as being \u201cvery shy, somber, fearful and withdrawn and possibly retarded as a function of her parents\u2019 chronic social and emotional disfunctioning [sz'c].\u201d She has shown remarkable improvement since being placed in a foster home. The mother\u2019s basic attitude was \u201ctake my child\u2014I don\u2019t care.\u201d While the mother was talking to Lambert she \u201chysterically explained that she was leaving her husband and in fact left.\u201d Later that evening the police had to be called. The Lambert report then summarizes statements from several prospective witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The other challenged report was prepared by the mother\u2019s <em>bete noire, </em>Mrs. Davidson, and was dated December 19, 1974. It recommended continuation of the minor\u2019s status under section 600. Jacqueline had progressed well with her foster family and expressed a desire to stay there. Mrs. Davidson acknowledged that the mother and Mr. M., had taken some positive steps toward improving their situation but felt that they were inadequate. She was much concerned about the \u201cadditional allegations regarding sexual abuse\u201d and the many periods of separation between the mother and Mr. M. They had no realistic plan for looking after Jacqueline. Mrs. Davidson acknowledged that visitation had been suspended since November 1974, \u201cawaiting confirmation of psychological and family counseling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>After these documents had been offered in evidence the mother testified. The mother\u2019s testimony concerned itself to a great extent with her allegedly frustrating and frustrated efforts to obtain counseling which would enable her to resume visits with her daughter. The thrust of Mrs. Davidson\u2019s testimony was that the mother\u2019s efforts to obtain such counseling were not sincere and that greater efforts would have succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Mrs. Davidson also testified to various contacts with Jacqueline. Jacqueline has \u201cconsistently stated her fears of her stepfather.\u201d She did, however, express positive feelings toward her mother, at least \u201cin the beginning stages.\u201d Mrs. Davidson felt that both parents have serious personal problems, as well as a serious marital problem and that before the child could have a secure and stable life with them those problems would have had to be worked out. She felt that the therapy program was a key factor in the reunification of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Mr. M. testified. In essence he denied any problems between himself and Jacqueline. Mrs. Davidson, however, retook the stand to testify that Jacqueline\u2019s feelings that she did not want to be living in a home with Mr. M. and did not want to visit with him, had strengthened. There was also testimony from one Deborah H. Smith, another case worker assigned to Jacqueline, who had had recent contacts with her and discussed the possibility of her living with her mother. Since July 1975 Jacqueline had maintained that she did not want to leave the foster home to live with her mother, however there was a slight change in attitude in November or December 1975. Until then Jacqueline had not objected to visits with her mother, but after she had met with her in court at about that time, she reported that it was unpleasant for her and that she did not want to see her mother again.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\"><em>The Child\u2019s Right to Counsel. </em>As the court explained in <em>In re Dunlap </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 428 at pages 437-440 [133 Cal.Rptr. 310], section 237.5 of the Civil Code has, since 1965, provided that in proceedings of this sort the trial court \u201cmay appoint counsel to represent the minor.\u201d The court also held that while this provision obviously did not mandate the appointment of counsel in every case, \u201cthe burden of persuasion with respect to the trial court\u2019s determination to appoint or deny the child independent counsel [must] be placed upon justifying the decision to deny counsel. Unless the burden is allocated in that fashion, there may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>well be no one involved, except in an adversary position, in the proceedings to assert the right of a child too young to assert it for himself.\u201d In <em>In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495] the Supreme Court appeared to embrace <em>Dunlap </em>wholeheartedly. \u201cThe rule we adopt of course requires counsel be appointed at the commencement of proceedings absent an immediate showing upon which the court can exercise its discretion against making an appointment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 355.) Having said that, however, the court distinguished the situation from the denial of the right to counsel in criminal and quasi-criminal situations and held that failure to appoint counsel for a minor in a section 232 proceeding \u201cdoes not require a reversal in the absence of miscarriage of justice.\u201d Applying that rule to the facts of <em>Richard E., </em>the Supreme Court affirmed because the record disclosed \u201cnothing which independent counsel for the minor might have done to better protect Richard\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">With all deference, we cannot avoid the suspicion that <em>Dunlap </em>and <em>Richard E. </em>in effect cancel each other out. The purpose of the preliminary showing mandated by <em>Dunlap </em>and approved by <em>Richard E. </em>is the ascertainment whether there is something which independent counsel for the minor might have done to protect the minor\u2019s interests. If the preliminary showing is erroneously dispensed with, it is hardly surprising that the record contains no showing of what independent counsel might have done for the minor. Yet unless there is such a showing, the error is not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Be that as it may we have to reconcile and live with <em>Dunlap </em>and <em>Richard E. </em>as best as we can. The solution lies perhaps in the consideration which triggered the <em>Dunlap </em>rule: that in many situations it might not be in the interests of any party to put forward considerations from which the best interests of the child might be determined. Or, to put the matter differently: are the best interests of the child likely to appear from the adversary clash before the court? <em>Dunlap, </em>which was a fight between a foster parent and the natural mother, in which each represented selfish interests, was not such a case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Richard E., </em>in which the adversaries were the natural father and the Los Angeles County Department of Adoptions was. Obviously this case is more like <em>Richard E. </em>than <em>Dunlap. </em> Since no miscarriage of justice appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>resulted from the failure to appoint counsel for the minor, the error is <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>The Challenged Reports. </em>When counsel for the mother objected to the admission of the Lambert and Davidson reports, he did so \u201con the ground of hearsay and irrelevancy.\u201d The court ruled that the reports would be received but that \u201cany portions of either report which are only statements from third persons will be stricken.\u201d It seems to us that the import of the court\u2019s ruling was plain enough: it would receive the reports to the extent that they represented observations of the authors, including statements made by the mother (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220) but would not consider, on their merits, hearsay statements made to the authors by third persons. In effect the reports were received as official records under section 1280 of the Evidence Code in connection with which it has been held that statements from third persons are inadmissible. <em>(Hoel </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1955) 136 Cal.App.2d 295, 309 [288 P.2d 989]; see e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Flaxman </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 20 [141 Cal.Rptr. 799].) The reports do, of course, contain a certain number of opinions and conclusions. This, however, does not affect the admissibility, only their trustworthiness. (Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Bench Book (Cont.Ed.Bar 1972) \u00a7 4.6.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record which would indicate that the trial court overstepped the limits of admissibility when it considered the reports. To be sure, there are certain borderline statements\u2014e.g., Lambert\u2019s enigmatic statement that investigation had \u201crevealed\u201d the mother\u2019s involvement with barbiturates. If counsel had desired a specific ruling with respect to any such statement in either of the challenged reports, he should have asked for one.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\"><em>Sufficiency. </em>Finally counsel attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">It seems clear to us that the record supports the finding under section 232, subdivision (a)(1), generally called \u201cabandonment.\u201d The mother cites <em>In re George G. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 146, 162 [123 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>201] for the proposition that a judicial taking of a child cannot constitute the necessary \u201cleaving\u201d of the child required by section 232, subdivision (a)(1). As we read <em>George G, </em>however, it did not purport to state so general a rule applicable to all situations where a child was initially removed from the home by judicial decree. As the mother herself realizes there are several cases where nonaction of the parent after a judicial decree removing the child may convert a \u201ctaking\u201d into a \u201cleaving.\u201d (E.g., <em>In re Conrich </em>(1963) 221 Cal.App.2d 662, 666-667 [34 Cal.Rptr. 658]; <em>In re Maxwell </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 156, 165 [225 P.2d 87].)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In this case the trial court found that the mother\u2019s failure to engage in psychological and family counseling, which resulted in termination of visitation rights, and her token efforts to regain visitation rights indicated an abandonment of the child. We are bound to agree that the record supports the finding. As the probation officer found, the mother\u2019s intelligence is simply not reconcilable with her minimal efforts to regain some measure of custody of her daughter if she really desired it. In reality the pattern that emerges is pretty obvious: that the mother is unwilling to lift a finger to regain custody of her daughter until she is faced with a moment of truth, when, to be sure, she will fight legal efforts to deprive her of her parental rights with tooth and nail, lapsing again into inertia and lethargy once the moment of crisis has passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">So much for section 232, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">With respect to section 232, subdivision (a)(7) the court made full and complete findings concerning the mother\u2019s failure to provide a home, care and control or an adequate parental relationship for over two years, that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that this situation was not likely to improve in the future and, further, also beyond a reasonable doubt that return of the child to the mother would be detrimental to the child. Finally, the court found that an award of custody to a nonparent would be in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The mother disputes these findings on what she calls the \u201cclear, unrebutted testimony\u201d of the case. She ignores, however, that her testimony did not have to be accepted by the trial court, that it was at odds with legitimate inferences which could be drawn from the other evidence in the case and that these inferences did support the findings and the judgment. In particular the mother\u2019s submissions dodge a most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>delicate issue: regardless of what may or may not have taken place between Mr. M. and the minor, the latter\u2019s fear of Mr. M. is a fact solidly proven in this proceeding. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1250, subd. (a)(1).) As long as he was going to occupy the position of stepfather, the court was amply justified in finding that the mother was simply not about to provide an adequate home for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 29, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The matter has been before this court on a previous occasion when we dismissed the appeal for reasons found to be inadequate in <em>In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 P.2d 683]. The final disposition by the Supreme Court was to retransfer the case to this court with directions to determine the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">It was certainly inferable from the facts of <em>Dunlap </em>that the parties were not fighting over the minor, but about the public assistance money that came with the minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">There is, as noted, some evidence in the record that the minor did not want to be reunited with her mother. The wishes of a seven-year-old minor are, however, hardly conclusive on the issue of her best interests. In any case, the fact that the minor was not represented by counsel of her own, did not prevent either side from producing any available witness who had relevant evidence to give, including, specifically, the minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The objection that the records were irrelevant was, of course, quite inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
