O\u2019Bryant, as trustee, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cshe recognizes that plaintiffs and defendant have interests as tenants in common,\u201d making it necessary that such interests be determined and a partition ordered. The defendant (appellant) claims to be the sole owner and denies that the plaintiffs have any interest whatsoever in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It appears from evidence adduced at the trial, that the three parties involved, Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Bryant, plaintiffs herein, and Mrs. 0\u2019Bryant\u2019s brother, the defendant Gordon Bosserman, came to California from Texas in 1936 and for a time lived in a rented house. In 1938 the defendant purchased the two lots here involved, paying $120 on the purchase price of $300. Thereafter a loan of $1,700 was procured, a house was built on the property and occupied by the parties. Title was taken in the name of the defendant who executed the trust deed, but notes secured by the trust deed were signed by all parties. Later the defendant sold an automobile and applied $350 therefrom on the loan. In May, 1942, the defendant entered the army; after the latter\u2019s discharge in 1945 the balance of the loan, $749, was paid off in a lump sum by the plaintiffs. Appellant\u2019s brief affirms that \u201cAll of the parties testified that there was no conversation as to the interests of the other in the property at the time of the final pay off of the loan. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">According to appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cIn late June, 1946, a difficulty arose among the parties, and the plaintiff Verna V. O\u2019Bryant who had in her possession, unrecorded, a power of attorney from defendant given to her during the period of his service, executed a deed to herself as trustee of the premises\u201d and recorded the power of attorney and deed. This was the condition of the title at the time the present action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The trial court found that all parties hereto had contributed a sum total of $3,237.67 for the purchase, construction, improvement and preservation of the property, of which the plaintiffs had jointly contributed $2,044.81 against which was chargeable the sum of $717.50 \u201cfor rent for the time they occupied the property to the exclusion of defendant,\u201d making plaintiffs\u2019 net contribution $1,327.31; that the defendant had contributed $1,192.86. Plaintiffs were therefore adjudged to be \u201cthe equitable owners of a 52.68 per cent interest in said property and defendant of a 47.32 per cent interest therein.\u201d An interlocutory judgment of partition was accordingly entered, and it is from this judgment that the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brief presents the following points: (1) \u201cThe complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action\u201d; (2) \u201cThe findings of fact, conclusions of law and interlocutory judgment are erroneous and not supported by the evidence\u201d; (3) \u201cThe evidence offered in support of the complaint is so contradictory and uncertain that a judgment based thereon must be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In reference to appellant\u2019s first point, it is urged that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for the reason that one of the plaintiffs, Verna V. O\u2019Bryant is alleged to and does hold the legal title as a trustee, and that a trustee is \u201cnot one of the persons enumerated in Section 752 of the California Code of Civil Procedure who could maintain an action for partition.\u201d In this connection is cited <em>Varni </em>v. <em>DeVoto, </em>10 Cal.App. 304 [101 P. 934], wherein it is said that \u201cOne cannot, of course, by a suit for partition, put an end to an express trust or defeat its lawful purpose, nor usurp the functions of the trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The present situation does not, however, fall within the purview of the above rule, and as respondents\u2019 brief points out, the action was not instituted by the self-appointed Verna V. O\u2019Bryant as a trustee, but was brought by Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Bryant \u201csuing in their individual right as owners of an interest in the property sought to be partitioned.\u201d The appellant\u2019s answer denied that either plaintiff has any interest in the property or that Mrs. 0 \u2019Bryant has any \u201cinterest, right or title . . . either as trustee or otherwise.\u201d And the record discloses that contribution has been made by all parties resulting in an equitable interest in the property requiring partition. Under these circumstances plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeking a determination of the respective interests cannot be deemed insufficient nor the judgment uncalled for.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the findings and judgment \u201care erroneous and not supported by the evidence,\u201d does not find support in the record. It is true that the evidence was in conflict, that the appellant claimed to be the sole owner of the property, and that the trial court determined the respective interests of the parties without referring the matter to a referee. However, as stated in respondents\u2019 brief, \u201cA great deal of time was taken, without objection, in getting at the facts as to the contributions of the respective parties .... The Court appeared to have reached the conclusion that, with conflicting testimony at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>many points, and endless detail involved, that the Court had as clear an idea ... as a referee would probably be able to arrive at after an extensive and expensive investigation.\u201d In all this, there has been pointed out nothing which could in any way justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Nor can it be said, as appellant\u2019s brief avers, that the evidence \u201cis so contradictory and uncertain that a judgment based thereon must be reversed.\u201d As hereinbefore indicated, the evidence was in conflict, but as appellant\u2019s brief admits, \u2018 \u2018 considerable latitude must be given to a trial court in deciding such a question of fact.\u201d The authorities submitted by appellant deal with factual situations dissimilar to those here involved and present nothing requiring a reversal herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 29,1949.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
