J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap1\">The question for decision is whether a judgment denying the rescission of a contract for the conveyance of realty allegedly induced by fraud was also an adjudication of plaintiff's claim of a breach by the grantee of the same agreement to bequeath the property to appellant, such claim being coexistent with that alleged in the former action.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In September, 1946, appellant sued the executor of the estate of Dorothea Thomas alleging (1) that decedent had breached her agreement to devise Lot 83 of Tract 1976 in Los Angeles County; (2) that by such agreement made in October, 1930, appellant had conveyed Lot 83 of Tract 1976 to Dorothea \u201cas consideration\u201d for the latter\u2019s promise to devise it by her last will to appellant; (3) that the consideration for the contract was the deep love that existed between the two, her service to decedent and her own forbearance to sue Dorothea for the lot. The alleged agreement to devise was evidenced by two letters written to appellant by decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The administrator entered a general denial to the fifth amended complaint and pleaded in bar certain statutes of limitation and the statute of frauds requiring an agreement to devise property to be evidenced by a writing. In addition, he pleaded that the findings and judgment in action 494796 of the same court, herein referred to as 494, was res judicata of the issues raised by the fifth amended complaint. The case having come on for trial, the court heard respondents\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings after appellant had requested the court first to try the plea of a former adjudication. Respondents\u2019 motion was granted on the ground that action 494 filed and tried in 1944 had determined the same issues raised by the fifth amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The file in 494 disclosed that Dorothea\u2019s executor recovered a final judgment on the merits of appellant\u2019s suit for rescission. The pleadings in such file show that in such action appellant alleged that she was by decedent fraudulently induced to visit Europe and that while she was residing in Czechoslovakia in 1930, Dorothea fraudulently induced her to convey Lot 83 to Dorothea so that the latter could collect the rents and protect the property, and promised to reconvey the lot to appellant on the latter\u2019s return home; that in reliance upon such representations, without consideration she conveyed the lot to Dorothea. She supplemented her allegations of fraud by a recital of her intimate personal relationship with decedent as one of mother and adopted daughter. The findings in 494 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>disclose also that appellant acknowledged full payment for the deed to Lot 83 and that Dorothea Thomas was \u201cafter the 13th day of October, 1930, the owner of and entitled to the possession of and was in the actual and exclusive possession of this property until her death . . . and that the claim of plaintiff and all others claiming through her are without any right whatsoever in the premises.\u201d Also, respondent introduced in evidence by reference the file in the matter of the estate of Dorothea Thomas showing that she had deceased February 13, 1945, and that her last will had been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">On the trial of the instant action the court had before it (1) appellant\u2019s allegations of her ownership of Lot 83, (2) the two letters alleged to constitute decedent\u2019s last will, (3) her complaint in 494 alleging the agreement of Dorothea to devise the lot to appellant, (4) the same two letters used as exhibits in 494 and (5) the judgment roll in the latter action.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">It was correct procedure to try the issue of res judicata and to enter judgment against the plaintiff after the court had ascertained that the special plea was substantiated. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 597.) After reaching such conclusion it would be sheer nonsense to consume the time of a court by investigating the merits of the alleged contract and claim of appellant.  The documents offered as proof of the plea included, besides the file of 494, the files in the estate of Dorothea Thomas and in the termination of the joint tenancy of Louis Henry Thomas, deceased. All such files were competent proof of a prior adjudication of the issue raised by the fifth amended complaint. <em>(Olwell </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>28 Cal.2d 147, 151 [168 P.2d 972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Appellant deems herself aggrieved by not having had a trial herein on the merits. The fact is that in the former action the merits of all the facts were determined and relief was denied her. Upon presentation of the special plea in the instant action the court had merely to decide whether the facts alleged in the first suit for rescission of the contract were substantially those alleged in the second action for breach of the same contract. In the first amended complaint of 494 it was alleged that from 1928 to 1944 a close, intimate friendship existed between the women; that defendant frequently stated that she had adopted plaintiff; that in 1942 she stated that she had made a will of Lot 83 and other properties to plaintiff; that she intended to leave all her property to plaintiff ; that in 1944 she discovered that decedent had sold Lot 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>and that the promise to leave it. to plaintiff was impossible of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The findings in 494 determined the facts contrary to the allegations of appellant and also that the relationship between the two women did not excuse plaintiff from looking after her own affairs or hinder her from taking legal action for the protection of her asserted rights to Lot 83; that while Dorothea wrote two letters<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> prior to her will purporting to devise her estate to plaintiff, they have not been admitted to probate; but that on March 23, 1945, the last will of Dorothea was duly admitted to probate; that prior to an altercation between plaintiff and Dorothea, the latter frequently stated that she intended to bequeath her property to plaintiff but that after the altercation Dorothea struck and beat plaintiff and the latter then created a disturbance of the peace \u201cnecessitating the calling of police officers to subdue plaintiff\u201d and therefore Dorothea made no bequest to plaintiff. Pinal proof of the identity of the issues is found in the fact that the evidence used to prove her cause in 494 consists of the same documents pleaded by appellant, namely, the two letters written by decedent. While appellant had knowledge of the pendency of the probate proceedings of decedent, she did not herself offer the two letters for probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The judgment therefore was correct in decreeing that 494 was res judicata of the instant action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1908.)  A judgment estops the plaintiff from main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>taming a subsequent action between the same parties, not only as to the issues raised but also as to every other issue that might properly have been litigated. The estoppel is effective not only where the grounds for recovery in the second action are identical with those pleaded in the first which he failed to prove but he is likewise barred where he failed to allege those grounds in his first suit. <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., </em>21 Cal.2d 636, 638 [134 P.2d 242]; <em>Sutphin </em>v. <em>Speik, </em>15 Cal.2d 195, 202 [99 P.2d 652, 101 P.2d 497]; <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>58 Cal.App.2d 864, 868 [137 P.2d 713] ; Rest. Law of Judgments, \u00a7 63a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Not only is a litigant barred by his former allegations and the findings thereon but when having knowledge of all the facts he has elected one of two inconsistent remedies and pursued it to judgment, he cannot thereafter proceed upon the other. <em>(Verder </em>v. <em>American Loan Society, </em>1 Cal.2d 17, 32 [33 P.2d 1081].) His commencement of the first remedy spells a perpetual inhibition against his resort to a second. <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>121 Cal. 115, 120 [53 P. 427].) He is es-topped from asserting repugnant rights. <em>(Mansfield </em>v. <em>Pickwick Stages, </em>191 Cal. 129, 130 [215 P. 389].) If the matter alleged in the second action is within the scope of the first and is so relevant to the issues that it could have been presented in the former action the judgment in the prior bars the maintenance of the second action even though it is not specially pleaded.. Were the rule otherwise, a party might designedly withhold issues and litigate them in consecutive lawsuits. <em>(Sutphin </em>v. <em>Speik, supra.) </em>Therefore, appellant, having chosen to prosecute her action by alleging that decedent\u2019s writings constituted a fraudulent design to cheat appellant out of Lot 83, cannot in a later cause maintain that those same writings constitute a bona fide contract to devise the property to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">It is contended that there can be no res judicata of an issue which appears not to have been determined. Appellant argues that the effect of the finding in 494 is that Dorothea was not guilty of fraudulent representations in inducing appellant to convey Lot 83 and therefore appellant might have been induced to convey the lot by an agreement honestly made at the time to leave it to appellant by last will which could not be broken until Dorothea\u2019s decease. In support of such argument appellant cites <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>23 Cal.App. 363 [138 P. 104], which in no respect is applicable. Jacoby had in a former suit sought recovery of matured installments on a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tract for the sale of merchandise. Although subsequently maturing payments were due at the time of the first trial they were not and could not have been litigated then without a pleading that they were unpaid. The instant issue is settled by Code of Civil Procedure, sections 1908,1962, subdivision 6, 1963, subdivision 18<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and by <em>Price </em>v. <em>Sixth Dist. Agr. Assn., 201 </em>Cal. 502, 511 [258 P. 387], wherein the defendant was barred from asserting defenses which he might have asserted in a former action.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The authorities cited by appellant <em>(Verder </em>v. <em>American Loan Society, </em>1 Cal.2d 17 [33 P.2d 1081]; <em>Mailhes </em>v. <em>Investors Syndicate, </em>220 Cal. 735 [32 P.2d 610] ; <em>Pascoe </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>219 Cal. 54 [25 P.2d 9]; <em>Herdan </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>182 Cal. 538 [189 P. 440]; <em>McGibbon </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>172 Cal. 70 [155 P. 460] ; <em>Papenfus </em>v. <em>Webb Products Co., </em>48 Cal.App.2d 631 [120 P.2d 60]; <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Electric Corp., </em>10 Cal.App.2d 207 [51 P.2d 205]) are not pertinent. The Yerder case is alien to the question here involved. In <em>Mailhes </em>v. <em>Investors Syndicate </em>there was no inconsistency between the unlawful detainer action brought first by the owner and its subsequent defense of its title. <em>Pascoe </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>was an action to reform and enforce an agreement for exchange of properties and in the alternative for damages. Plaintiff\u2019s abortive attempt to obtain an enforcement did not preclude his recovery of damages in the same case. <em>Herdan </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>held that a judgment of non-suit merely leaves the parties \u201cin the same relative position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>as before the action was commenced. \u2019 \u2019 The judgment of non-suit was not res judicata of plaintiff\u2019s subsequent action for damages on account of defendant\u2019s fraud in inducing the exchange. In <em>McGibbon </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>plaintiff had sued to recover money paid on the purchase price of certain property and a nonsuit was entered against him for the reason that no rescission or other termination of the contract was established. He was not estopped by such judgment of nonsuit from later demanding specific performance. In <em>Papenfus </em>v. <em>Webb Products </em>Co.,, plaintiff had in a former action sought rescission of his contract with defendant. Recovery was denied him for the reason that rescission was not available under the circumstances of the case. But because rescission would have been inequitable plaintiff was not to be deprived of an available remedy, to wit, that apparently defendant held plaintiff\u2019s property in trust for him. \u201cAs he mistook his remedy in his former action the doctrine of election of remedies cannot bar his action.\u2019\u2019 His second action was not inconsistent with his first.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">MeComb, J., and Wilson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u201cVera ...
