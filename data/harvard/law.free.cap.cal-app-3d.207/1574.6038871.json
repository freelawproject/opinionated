J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHR\">Appellant, Derrick Hill, was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was further alleged that appellant personally used a firearm and was armed with a firearm within the meaning of sections 12022.5 and 12022, subdivision (a), respectively. On May 7, 1987, a jury trial commenced and the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>the \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d allegation. Appellant was convicted by the jury on all counts and the personal use allegation was found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">The court sentenced appellant to state prison for a total of six years, including an upper term of four years for his assault conviction on count I and a two-year enhancement pursuant to section 12022.5. All other terms were made concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">On July 31, 1987, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. On June 27, 1988, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus which was consolidated with this appeal by order of the court on October 3, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Statement of Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ABW\">I., II.*</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">\n<em>Statement of Reasons in Imposing the Section 12022.5 Enhancement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">After obtaining permission of this court, appellant filed a supplemental brief raising the issue of whether or not the trial court was required to state reasons for imposing the section 12022.5 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">Section 12022.5 provides for a sentence enhancement of two years for felonies committed while the defendant was personally using a firearm. Subdivision (a) of section 12022.5 states that a person convicted of a felony \u201cshall... be punished by an additional term of imprisonment in the state prison for two years, unless use of a firearm is an element of the oifense of which he or she was convicted.\u201d (Italics added.) At all times in question, subdivision (c) of the same section provided that the additional term \u201c. . . <em>may </em>be imposed in cases of assault with a firearm under paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 245 . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>Appellant contends the enhancement of his sentence could only have been imposed under subdivision (c) and could not have been imposed under subdivision (a), since \u201cuse of a firearm\u201d is plainly an element of section 245, subdivision (a)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the distinction between the \u201cshall\u201d of subdivision (a) and the \u201cmay\u201d of subdivision (c) evidences a particular legislative intention that imposition of the sentence enhancement for cases of assault with a firearm would be a discretionary matter for the trial court. On this basis, appellant contends that the permissive language of subdivision (c) of section 12022.5 requires a trial court imposing sentence for conviction for assault under section 245, subdivision (a)(2) to exercise discretion in determining whether to impose a sentence enhancement for use of a firearm and, thus, a statement of reasons is necessary showing the basis for the exercise of that discretion. Appellant acknowledges he cited no specific case on point but analogizes to the requirement to state reasons for the sentencing choice under subdivision (c) of section 667.6 before imposing full, separate, and consecutive terms for certain sex offenses committed through force or fear, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Craft </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 554, 559 [224 Cal.Rptr. 626, 715 P.2d 585].</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Section 1170, subdivision (c) provides that \u201cThe court shall state the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing . . . .\u201d California Rules of Court, rule 405(f) defines \u201csentence choice\u201d as \u201cthe selection of any disposition of the case which does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial. . . .\u201d On the surface it appears that, because the court has the power to impose or to strike an enhancement, the imposition of an enhancement is a selection of one of several possible dispositions of a case and, thus, is a \u201csentence choice\u201d for which a statement of reasons is required. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Manners </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 826, 834 [225 Cal.Rptr. 798].) However, section 1170, subdivision (a)(2) provides that \u201c. . . The court, unless it determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed, shall also impose any other term which it is required by law to impose as an additional term . . . .\u201d Section 1170.1, subdivision (d) provides that \u201c[w]hen the court imposes a prison sentence for a felony pursuant to Section 1170 the court shall impose the additional terms provided in Sections . . . 12022.5 . . . , unless the additional punishment therefor is stricken pursuant to subdivision (h) . . . .\u201d Section 1170.1, subdivision (h) states that \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may strike the additional punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>ment for the enhancements provided in Sections . . . 12022.5 ... if it determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the additional punishment and states on the record its reasons for striking the additional punishment.\u201d These two subdivisions, read together, indicate that the imposition of the enhancement is the general rule for which no reason need be stated, but the striking of the enhancement, being the exception, requires a statement of reasons be given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGreen </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 504, 526 [166 Cal.Rptr. 360], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolcott </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 92, 101 [192 Cal.Rptr. 748, 665 P.2d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">The legislative history of sections 245 and 12022.5 further refutes appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Until January 1, 1983, section 245 divided felonious assault into two categories, assault with a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury committed \u201cupon the person of another,\u201d and such assault committed \u201cupon the person of a peace officer or fireman.\u201d (Former \u00a7 245, subds. (a) and (b).) Because \u201cfirearm use [was] not considered an element of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon,\u201d convictions of either subdivision (a) or (b) of section 245 could be enhanced under section 12022.5 if the defendant personally used a firearm. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 15, 20 [239 Cal.Rptr. 272]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Read </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 900, 905 [191 Cal.Rptr. 305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">Section 245 was amended in 1982 to create four categories of felonious assault: assaults with a firearm; assaults with other deadly weapons or instruments; or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury; assault with a deadly weapon, a firearm or force likely to produce great bodily injury upon the person of a peace officer or fireman. (\u00a7 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Prior to January 1, 1983, section 12022.5 established a two-year enhancement for the personal use of a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony, unless firearm use was an element of the offense. The statute specified the enhancement could be imposed \u201cin cases of assault with a deadly weapon under Section 245.\u201d (Former \u00a7 12022.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\"> Section 12022.5 as it currently exists was added in 1982 and made effective January 1, 1983. A memorandum of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and a separate memorandum of the Senate Republican Caucus regarding the 1982 amendment of section 12022.5 each expressed concern that the creation of separate crimes of assault \u201cwith a firearm\u201d (\u00a7 245, subds. (a)(2), (c)) might interfere with the preexisting practice of allowing firearm use enhancements to be imposed for any section 245 violation in which the defendant personally used a firearm. \u201cThe 1982 amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>section 12022.5 were an attempt by the Legislature to preserve the status quo ante by providing that the use enhancement charge \u2018applies to a deadly weapon which is a firearm.\u2019 (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 3314, Stats. 1982 (Reg. Sess.).)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 15, 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">In reviewing the foregoing legislative history it becomes clear that the permissive language, i.e., the word \u201cmay\u201d of section 12022.5, subdivision (c), is an exception to the prohibitive language of subdivision (a), i.e., \u201cunless use of a firearm is an element of the offense . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">Thus, we conclude the trial court was not required to give an additional statement of reasons to support imposition of the two-year enhancement pursuant to section 12022.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">Best, J., and Ardaiz, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 21, 1989, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 18, 1989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-12\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1304-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1574.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">Section 12022.5, subdivision (c) was amended in 1987, effective September 26, 1987. (Stats. 1987, ch. 1159, \u00a7 1, No. 4 Deering\u2019s Adv. Legis. Service, p. 4194; No. 10, West\u2019s Cal. Legis. Service, pp. 960-961.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1305-7\"> While subdivision (a) of section 12022.5 requires personal use of a firearm in order to impose the enhancement, the final clause of that subdivision excludes offenses where \u201cuse of a firearm\u201d is an element. Section 245, subdivision (a)(2) proscribes \u201cassault upon the person of another with a firearm.\u201d By definition, such an act necessarily involves \u201cuse of a firearm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
