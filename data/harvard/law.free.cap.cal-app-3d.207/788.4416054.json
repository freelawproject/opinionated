J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC9\">Wilfried P. Ziegler (Wilfried) appeals after the trial court ordered him to make monthly payments to maintain the survivor benefit plan offered through his former employer, the United States Air Force, for the benefit of his former wife, Margarete Ziegler (Margarete). Wilfried contends this order is improper. We reject his arguments and affirm the order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Wilfried served in the United States Air Force and retired in 1971. In 1975 he married Margarete. At the time of the marriage, Wilfried was already receiving his military retirement pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Subsequently, during the marriage, the Air Force informed Wilfried that he could apply for a survivor benefit plan based on his retirement interest. Under the plan the Air Force would continue to pay a percentage of Wilfried\u2019s retirement benefits to a surviving spouse or former spouse after his death. Wilfried elected to obtain the survivor benefit plan for the protection of his then-wife Margarete; payments for the plan (which are currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>about $203 per month) are automatically deducted from Wilfried\u2019s retirement pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Wilfried and Margarete separated in November of 1985. After the marriage was dissolved in November of 1986, the court ordered Wilfried to pay temporary spousal support of $650 per month and, pursuant to an earlier stipulation, ordered Wilfried to continue making payments on the survivor\u2019s benefit plan for Margarete\u2019s benefit. These temporary orders were reviewed by the trial court at a hearing in December of 1987. In a brief submitted after this hearing, Wilfried contended the trial court could not order him to continue making payments to keep the survivor\u2019s benefit plan in effect. The court rejected Wilfried\u2019s arguments, and ordered him to \u201cmake the payment required each month to maintain the survivor benefit plan through the United States Air Force for the use and benefit of [Margarete]\u201d and to pay $550 per month directly to Margarete as spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Wilfried contends the order concerning the survivor benefit plan is improper because: (1) it amounts to an award of his separate property to Margarete; (2) it requires that he pay spousal support after his death; and (3) it was not \u201cjust and reasonable in view of the circumstances of the respective parties\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a74801.4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject each of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The court\u2019s order requiring Wilfried to maintain the survivor benefit plan is authorized by Civil Code section 4801.4, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cFor the purposes of Section 4801 [which gives the court power to grant spousal support], where it is just and reasonable in view of the circumstances of the respective parties, the court, in determining the needs of a supported spouse, may include an amount sufficient to purchase an annuity for the supported spouse or to maintain insurance for the benefit of the supported spouse on the life of the spouse required to make the payment of support, or may require the spouse required to make the payment of support to establish a trust to provide for the support of the supported spouse, so that the supported spouse will not be left without means for support in the event that the order for support is terminated by the death of the party required to make the payment of support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number> Both parties agree that the survivor benefit plan is a form of annuity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court had the authority under section 4801.4 to order Wilfried to provide support to maintain that plan.  Nevertheless, Wilfried contends that, for various reasons, the court\u2019s power was not properly exercised in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">A. <em>The Court Did Not Award Wilfried\u2019s Separate Property to Margarete.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Wilfried first contends that the court essentially awarded his separate property (the survivor benefit plan) to Margarete. We disagree. The trial court did find that \u201cthe United States military retirement benefits of the [appellant] and any annuity benefits, including his entitlement to Survivor\u2019s Benefit Plan flowing from the retirement benefits, are his separate property, having been earned by virtue of his being a member of the United States Air Force prior to his marriage to [Margarete] . . . .\u201d However, the trial court did not award the survivor annuity plan to Margarete, but, instead, ordered Wilfried to <em>maintain </em>that plan for her benefit as part of his spousal support obligation. We believe section 4801.4 empowered the court to make this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Only one case <em>(In re Marriage of Gonzalez </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1021 [214 Cal.Rptr. 634, 54 A.L.R.4th 1195]) has thus far even mentioned section 4801.4, and the discussion in that case is not pertinent to the issue before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we find some support for the position we take in the Law Revision Commission comments to section 4801.4. The comments state: \u201cIf insurance is already in force on the life of the support obligor, this section authorizes the court to order that the support obligor maintain some or all of the insurance in force and name the supported spouse as the beneficiary of the insurance.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 12A West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1988 pocket supp.) \u00a7 4801.4, p. 95.) Thus, the comments clearly indicate the court has power to order the obligor to maintain <em>preexisting </em>protection; moreover, there is nothing in the statute or comments which indicates that the character of the preexisting insurance or annuity (whether separate or community property) restricts the court\u2019s power to make orders concerning that property. In sum, we conclude that the court did not award Wilfried\u2019s separate property to Margarete; instead, the court\u2019s order is proper as an award of spousal support under section 4801.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>B. <em>The Support Order Does Not Require Wilfried to Pay Spousal Support After His Death.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Absent a written agreement to the contrary between the parties, an obligation to pay support terminates when the support obligor dies. (\u00a7 4801, subd. (b).) Section 4801.4 does not change this rule. (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 12A West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4801.4, p. 95.) Wilfried contends the support order in this case requires that he provide support payments after his death. The contention is meritless. Under the order, Wilfried\u2019s obligation to provide support (the payments on the annuity) <em>does </em>cease at his death; once he dies, the <em>government </em>will have a contractual obligation to make payments to Margarete. However, Wilfried (or his estate) will have no responsibility for those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In our view, Wilfried completely misunderstands the purpose of section 4801.4. It is true that section 4801.4 does not permit a court to order support payments by the obligor after the obligor\u2019s death. What it does permit is the payment of support to maintain life insurance or an annuity during the obligor\u2019s life; once the obligor dies, his \u201csupport payments\u201d cease and the third-party contractual obligation to make payments begins. This in no way violates the rule that an obligation to make support payments terminates when the obligor dies. (\u00a7 4801, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">C. <em>The Court\u2019s Order Was Just and Reasonable in View of the Circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Finally, Wilfried contends the court\u2019s order was not \u201cjust and reasonable in view of the circumstances of the respective parties\u201d as required by section 4801.4. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Wilfried\u2019s argument is based on a remarkably tortured reading of sections 4801.4 and 4801. Although the logic of the argument is difficult to follow, we attempt to summarize his contention below: Section 4801, subdivision (a) provides with respect to regular support payments that \u201c[t]he court may order the party required to make the payment of support to give reasonable security therefor.\u201d In Wilfried\u2019s view, section 4801.4 merely permits the trial court to order the obligor to provide an annuity as \u201csecurity\u201d for the payment of regular support. This annuity must be payable during the lifetime of the obligor, since, in Wilfried\u2019s view, an annuity payable after the obligor\u2019s death violates the rule that support obligations cease upon the death of either party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Wilfried, it would be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d to require the obligor to provide such an annuity <em>only </em>when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>obligor\u2019s regular support payments are in jeopardy. Since there is no evidence his regular support payments were in \u201cjeopardy,\u201d Wilfried contends the court exceeded its authority by requiring him to maintain the survivor benefit plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Wilfried\u2019s argument is based on a gross misunderstanding of section 4801.4. The stated purpose of the statute is to insure that \u201cthe supported spouse will not be left without means for support in the event that the order for support is terminated by the death of the party required to make the payment of support.\u201d In other words, the statute\u2019s purpose is to insure support is provided for the supported spouse <em>after </em>the obligor dies. It has nothing to do with providing \u201csecurity\u201d for the payment of support owed during the obligor\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In our view, the trial court acted well within its discretion when it concluded it was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d to order Wilfried to continue to make payments on the survivor benefit plan. The parties were married for more than 10 years. Margarete was in her early 50\u2019s at the time of the divorce and Wilfried was in his mid-60\u2019s. Based on the evidence produced at the hearing, the trial court concluded there was a real danger Margarete would not be able to provide for herself without assistance from Wilfried. Moreover, Wilfried had net income of $2,237 per month, while Margarete\u2019s net income (without spousal support) was only $275 per month. Finally, the court noted that the parties themselves believed that the annuity was necessary since they had contracted for it during the marriage. In light of the evidence, the court was amply justified in finding its order \u201cjust and reasonable in view of the circumstances of the respective parties.\u201d (\u00a7 4801.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Merrill, J., and Strankman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 19, 1989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Civil Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> An \u201cannuity\u201d is broadly defined as \u201c[a] right to receive fixed, periodic payments, either for life or for a term of years.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet.
