We conclude that successor liability does not attach, and we affirm a summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>Statement of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Declarations and deposition transcripts filed in the case at bar reveal the following uncontroverted facts. In 1950, while Mary Maloney was a fetus developing in Grace Beckley\u2019s womb, Grace Beckley took a prescription drug, stilbestrol, also known as diethylstilbestrol (DES). The manufacturer of that drug was American Pharmaceutical Company, a Delaware corporation (APC I).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">APC I went through a period of financial difficulty. In 1972, all of the then officers of APC I were fired and William Widerkehr was installed as APC I\u2019s new president, at the behest of the principal stockholders and with the approval of the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company (the bank), APC I\u2019s sole secured creditor, to which APC I owed over $1 million. Widerkehr\u2019s efforts failed to save APC I. The bank called its notes, APC I ceased doing business, and Widerkehr worked for the bank during the early part of 1973 liquidating the assets of APC I. The bank took over APC I\u2019s accounts receivable. Except as noted below, the bank sold APC I\u2019s machinery and equipment and other assets to Keith Machinery Company and to various other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In August 1973, Widerkehr and two other men (who had not been associated with APC I) formed a new corporation called American Pharmaceutical Company (APC II), with Widerkehr as president. APC II was, and is, a New Jersey corporation. In September, 1973, the bank sold the leftover bottles, labels, packaging materials and finished goods which bore APC I\u2019s logo, and were therefore of no use to other companies, to APC II. APC II paid the bank $32,500 for these items and paid $500 for the right to use APC I\u2019s name, APC I\u2019s goodwill, and APC I\u2019s patents and trademarks (limited to nonprescription drugs). The assets of APC I which APC II acquired constituted about 10 percent of the total liquidated assets of APC I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">APC II acquired none of APC I\u2019s machinery, equipment, buildings, inventory, stock, or accounts receivable. APC II never used any of the premises formerly occupied by APC I. APC II did not and does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>or sell prescription drugs, and has never made, sold, or owned any DES. APC II did not agree to assume any of the liabilities of APC I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On January 12, 1982, Mary Maloney filed a complaint in Contra Costa County Superior Court in which she claimed that the DES which her mother had taken had caused Mary Maloney to suffer menstrual irregularities, cysts, ovarian and fallopian tube irregularities, and precancerous vaginal and cervical growths. The complaint further alleged that T. J. Maloney, Mary Maloney\u2019s son, suffers from cerebral palsy as a result of Mary Maloney\u2019s exposure to DES as a fetus. Mary Maloney sued in her own behalf and as guardian ad litem for her minor son. The defendants in this first complaint were four pharmaceutical companies and one hundred does. The defendants in a third amended complaint, filed December 8, 1982, were 171 companies and 250 does. The third amended complaint asserts the following theories of recovery: strict liability for a defective product, negligent manufacture, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">[[]].......................<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">On September 9, 1983, (defendant) APC II filed a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that APC II did not market or manufacture the DES which had allegedly caused plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. (Indeed, as noted above, APC II never marketed or manufactured any DES at all.) Plaintiffs opposed the motion, on the ground that a triable issue of fact existed as to APC II\u2019s successorship status. The trial court denied the motion on November 28, 1983. On February 18, 1986, APC II again moved for summary judgment, on the same ground as that asserted in its first summary judgment motion. The trial court decided to hear the motion anew, and granted APC II\u2019s motion for summary judgment on April 17, 1986. A judgment of dismissal as to APC II was entered June 24, 1986. Plaintiffs appeal that judgment. (No. A037060.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">[[]].......................*</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>APC II Liability for Injuries Caused by Drug Manufactured by APC I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\"> <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1049, 1066, 1072 [245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470] authoritatively establishes \u201cthat a manufacturer of prescription drugs is not strictly liable for injuries caused by . . . a [design] defect that is neither known nor knowable at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>drug is distributed,\u201d and that such a manufacturer cannot be liable for failure to warn of such a defect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<em>Brown </em>further establishes that \u201ca cause of action for breach of warranty does not lie against a prescription drug manufacturer.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1072, fn. 14.)  Plaintiffs make no contention that <em>Brown </em>does not apply to negate their strict liability and breach of warranty theories of recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Instead, plaintiffs contend that APC II is liable as a successor to APC I for negligent manufacture of DES.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The usual rule of successor liability, as stated in <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 22, 28 [136 Cal.Rptr. 574, 560 P.2d 3], is that \u201ca corporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other\u2019s liabilities\u201d only if \u201c(1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller\u2019s debts.\u201d (Citing <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>South Bend Lathe </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 842, 846 [120 Cal.Rptr. 556] and other cases.) Plaintiffs contend that APC II is liable for APC I\u2019s negligent acts because APC II is a mere continuation of APC I (circumstance (3) from the above quote).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>South Bend Lathe, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at page 847 holds, as a matter of law, \u201cBefore one corporation can be said to be a mere continuation or reincarnation of another it is required that there be insufficient consideration running from the new company to the old.\u201d (Citing <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Picacho Gold Min. Co. </em>(1943) 56 Cal.App.2d 765, 779 [133 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>663] which characterizes lack of consideration as an \u201cessential foundation\u201d of the mere continuation theory.) Although <em>Ray </em>disapproves <em>Ortiz, </em>to the extent <em>Ortiz </em>applies the usual rule of successor liability to a situation in which strict tort liability for defective products is an available theory of recovery, nothing in <em>Ray </em>indicates that the holding of <em>Ortiz </em>does not apply in cases like the present one, where strict tort liability for defective products is not available. (See <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 34.) In its respondent\u2019s brief, APC II invites our attention to the fact that <em>Ortiz </em>holds that inadequate consideration is an essential ingredient of mere continuation. Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief ignores <em>Ortiz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">APC II\u2019s purchase of certain assets of APC I was pursuant to a written agreement entitled \u201cJoint Bill of Sale. \u201d  Plaintiffs did not suggest in the trial court, nor do plaintiffs suggest on appeal, that the money which APC II paid for the assets of APC I which it acquired was not an adequate and valid consideration for those assets. Nor has our independent review of the record revealed any evidence of insufficient consideration. In the absence of such evidence, the consideration recited in the bill of sale was presumptively sufficient. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1615.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We additionally note that several other characteristics of a mere continuation to which <em>Ray </em>alludes are missing in the present case. First, one can not reasonably characterize 10 percent of APC I\u2019s total assets as its \u201cprincipal assets.\u201d (Cf. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 28; <em>Kaminski </em>v. <em>Western MacArthur Co. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 445, 457 [220 Cal.Rptr. 895].) Second, a mere continuation contemplates a direct sale of assets from the predecessor corporation to the successor corporation, not a sale from a creditor of the predecessor corporation which has taken over its assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Ray, supra, </em>at p. 28.) Third, a mere continuation typically involves continuity of employees beyond the single officer which APC I and APC II shared in the present case. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 29; cf. <em>Kaminski </em>v. <em>Western MacArthur Co., supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 453 [45 out of 50 employees].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Plaintiffs correctly point out that the relationship between APC I and APC II involved two characteristics which can contribute to a finding that one corporation is a mere continuation of the other. First, APC II did \u201c[hold] itself out to customers and the public as a continuation of\u2019 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>enterprise conducted by APC I. (Cf. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 29.) Widerkehr sent a letter to prospective customers in which he represented that APC II was a reorganization of APC I under new ownership and a continuation of APC I\u2019s business under new management. The letter indicated that the business had moved to New Jersey and asked recipients to note \u201cour new mailing address and telephone number . . . .\u201d Second, \u201cone or more persons were officers, directors, or stockholders of both corporations.\u201d (Cf. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Plaintiffs, however, present no argument as to how the presence of these two characteristics can make up for the absence of the essential ingredient of inadequate consideration. In the absence of that ingredient, APC II is not a mere continuation of APC I, such that liability for APC I\u2019s alleged negligent manufacture of DES might attach to APC II. <em>(Ortiz </em>v. <em>South Bend Lathe, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Ray </em>not only states the usual rule of successor liability. <em>Ray </em>creates and applies an exception to that general rule, applicable in cases where strict tort liability for defective products is an available theory of recovery. The exception is as follows.  \u201c[A] party which acquires a manufacturing business and continues the output of its line of products . . . assumes strict tort liability for defects in units of the same product line previously manufactured and distributed by the entity from which the business was acquired.\u201d (R<em>ay </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Plaintiffs contend, \u201cThe [Ray] Court did not intend that the \u2018product line\u2019 rule apply only to strict liability but to all forms of tort liability, including negligence.\u201d Plaintiffs make this contention in spite of the fact that the <em>Ray </em>court declares that the exception to the general rule which it announces applies only \u201cunder the narrow circumstances [t]here presented\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 25), and indicates that those narrow circumstances include the availability of a strict tort liability theory of recovery <em>{id. </em>at pp. 30, 34). (See the discussion of <em>Ray </em>in 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 1273, subd. (a)(2), p. 718, entitled <em>Special exception for strict products </em>liability.) Likewise, cases on which plaintiffs rely which interpret <em>Ray </em>indicate that the <em>Ray </em>exception applies in product liability cases in which strict tort liability is available as a theory of recovery, and make no effort to extend its applicability beyond the arena of strict liability. <em>(Kaminski </em>v. <em>Western MacArthur Co., supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 454, 456 [strict tort liability for injury caused by asbestos exposure]; <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>D. M. Oliver, Inc. </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 890, 894, 898-901 [159 Cal.Rptr. 119] [strict tort liability for injury caused by allegedly defective kelp dryer].)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Plaintiffs contend that policy considerations should impel this court to expand the scope of the <em>Ray </em>exception beyond the strict liability arena. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>light of the <em>Ray </em>court\u2019s language limiting the scope of its exception, this court is not in a position to effect the expansion which plaintiffs urge, no matter what the court may think of plaintiffs\u2019 policy arguments. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) In light of the uncontroverted facts and the applicable law, APC II cannot be held liable for injuries caused by DES manufactured by APC I, under either of the theories of successor liability asserted by plaintiffs, and the trial court did not err in its grant of summary judgment to APC II.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at page 31 states, \u201cJustification for imposing strict liability upon a successor to a manufacturer under the circumstances here presented rests upon (1) the virtual destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s remedies against the original manufacturer caused by the successor\u2019s acquisition of the business, (2) the successor\u2019s ability to assume the original manufacturer\u2019s risk-spreading role, and (3) the fairness of requiring the successor to assume a responsibility for defective products that was a burden necessarily attached to the original manufacturer\u2019s good will being enjoyed by the successor in the continued operation of the business.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics omitted.) In view of the conclusion reached above, that the <em>Ray </em>exception is limited to cases in which strict tort liability is available as a theory of recovery, we need not deal with the parties\u2019 contentions as to whether the three aspects of <em>Ray </em>quoted above are or are not present in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">[[]].......................<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Racanelli, P.
