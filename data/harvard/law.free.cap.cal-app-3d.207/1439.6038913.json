J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUd\">Defendant and appellant Hulen Timothy Harrell appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda county entered after a jury found him guilty of assault with intent to commit rape. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220.) Appellant, who proceeded in propria persona at trial, contends on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to impeach him with his prior burglary convictions, in improperly instructing the jury, and in failing to issue adequate <em>\u201cFaretta </em>warnings,\u201d <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1976) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, and that enhancements were improperly imposed. We find appellant\u2019s contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">Rosario Zavalza testified that she was living at 1332 East 23rd Street in Oakland with her two children. On October 8, 1982, shortly after noon, as she was preparing lunch in the kitchen, she felt someone come up from behind her, loop a belt around her neck and place a hand over her mouth. She asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d and \u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d Appellant answered repeatedly, \u201cYou shut up,\u201d and \u201cI want to steal,\u201d and \u201cI want sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">Zavalza forced her way into the hallway where appellant knocked her down. He then pushed her up against the wall and started kissing her on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>mouth. She had never seen him before. Appellant was wearing only pants; the zipper was down and his penis was exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Appellant threw Zavalza to the floor, punched her, and attempted to remove her skirt. Throughout the struggle, Zavalza\u2019s one and one-half-year-old daughter clung to her side despite appellant\u2019s efforts to keep her away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Suddenly, Zavalza\u2019s brother, Otis Graham, who also lived at said residence, arrived, and appellant fled. Graham followed in pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Police Officer McCune testified that he observed appellant and Graham in a confrontation and drove toward them. The men resumed their chase and McCune followed. He caught them, handcuffed appellant and ordered him into the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">McCune testified further that appellant was carrying several items including his shoes, belt and boxer shorts in a bundle, and was holding up his pants at the waist and his genitals were in view. The belt was looped through the buckle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">Appellant\u2019s version of the facts is that several days prior to the incident in question, he was severely injured in a bicycle accident. Appellant submitted into evidence his hospital records which showed the extent of the injuries, including a fracture and lacerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Appellant testified that on the day in question, he met Otis Graham at a store owned by Graham\u2019s mother. Graham gave appellant some pills to alleviate his pain. Appellant then asked Graham for permission to lie down at his house and Graham obliged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">Appellant went to Graham\u2019s house. He walked into the kitchen where he met Zavalza; appellant claimed he had previously met Zavalza on \u201cat least five or six occasions.\u201d He decided to take a shower. After getting undressed, appellant heard Zavalza\u2019s daughter screaming. He put on his pants and walked out into the hallway where he saw Zavalza shaking the child \u201cviciously . . . with the belt in her hand.\u201d Appellant and Zavalza were struggling over the belt when Graham arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">Graham yelled at appellant who then scooped up his clothes and left. Graham came after appellant and slashed him with a sharp instrument which prompted him to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">Appellant claims that at the time of arrest he was wearing his belt and that Officer McCune ordered him to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">\n<em>Prior Conviction Enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Appellant received a 16-year sentence. This sentence consisted of a six-year principal term, a five-year prior conviction enhancement under Penal Code section 667 for a 1981 burglary conviction, and another Penal Code section 667 enhancement for four 1975 prior convictions which were tried together. The court found that appellant had been convicted of another burglary in 1980, but ordered that the Penal Code section 667 enhancement for this conviction be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">Appellant contends that the enhancement for the 1981 burglary conviction must be stricken. We rejected this contention the first time we considered it. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Harrell </em>(Mar. 26, 1986) A023011 [nonpub. opn.].) The Supreme Court then granted review and transferred the case to us in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Alfaro </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 627 [230 Cal.Rptr. 129, 724 P.2d 1154], overruled in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150], Our subsequent opinion found that <em>Alfaro </em>barred the imposition of the enhancement and we directed the trial court to strike the enhancements for the 1980 and 1981 convictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrell, supra, </em>A023011.) The Supreme Court again granted review, and it has now transferred the case to this court for \u201creconsideration in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343.\u201d We conclude that imposition of the enhancement for the 1981 conviction is proper under <em>Guerrero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\"><em>Alfaro </em>held that the sentencing court could not look beyond the elements necessarily established by the prior conviction to determine if it involved a burglary of a residence. Thus, unless burglary of a residence was an essential element of the prior burglary conviction, the court could not consider the pleadings and court records in determining whether the burglary was residential. <em>(Alfaro, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 631-635.) In 1981, the crime of second degree burglary could be committed by entering a residence or a nonresidential structure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 830, fn. 2 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736], overruled in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 343.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>In <em>Guerrero, </em>the court concluded that it had wrongly decided <em>Alfaro. (People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 356.) The court announced that \u201cin determining the truth of a prior-conviction allegation, the trier of fact may look to the entire record of the conviction.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 345.) The court did say that while the trier of fact could look at the \u201centire record of the conviction,\u201d it could not relitigate the circumstances of the prior crime. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">The facts and result in <em>Guerrero </em>compel the conclusion that the trial court in this case did not err in imposing a section 667 enhancement for the 1981 burglary conviction. In <em>Guerrero, </em>the trial court imposed an enhancement based on \u201can accusatory pleading charging a residential burglary and defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or nolo contendere, . . .\u201d <em>(Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 345.) The Supreme Court found that the trial court had \u201cacted properly\u201d in imposing the enhancement. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 356.) The Supreme Court remanded to the Court of Appeal \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\u201d <em>{ibid.) </em>thereby implying that the appellate court could affirm the judgment without remanding to the trial court for additional evidence of the residential character of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">In the present case, the information alleged that appellant was convicted of a residential second degree burglary on July 17, 1981. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court permitted the prosecutor to introduce as evidence the information for the prior conviction. It alleged that appellant had entered \u201cthe residence of Stephen Lewis . ...\u201d A minute order relating to the prior conviction, also admitted in evidence, stated that appellant had pled no contest to \u201cBurglary, a violation of Section 459 of the Penal Code as charged in the Information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">The evidence on which the trial court in this case relied was identical to the type of evidence on which the trial court in <em>Guerrero </em>had relied. The Supreme Court in <em>Guerrero </em>concluded the trial court had \u201cacted properly.\u201d We therefore find, under <em>Guerrero, </em>that the trial court in this case did not err in imposing a five-year enhancement under Penal Code section 667 for the 1981 burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">In our view <em>Guerrero </em>clearly disposes of this issue; nevertheless appellant contends that a 1987 amendment to Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(18) renders the evidence submitted in the trial court insufficient to sustain the court\u2019s finding that the 1981 second degree burglary is a serious felony. At the time appellant stood trial, subdivision (c)(18) provided that a \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d was a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 667. However, effective January 1, 1987, this language was deleted and subdivision (c)(18) was amended to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>\u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house ... or inhabited portion of any other building\u201d a serious felony. (Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1.) Appellant contends that burglary of \u201ca residence\u201d is not equivalent to burglary of \u201can inhabited dwelling house.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the use of the word \u201cinhabited\u201d in the amended statute indicates the Legislature intended to punish as serious felonies only those burglaries in which persons are actually inside the dwelling when the crime occurs. According to appellant this contrasts with the former version of the subdivision which permitted the conclusion that burglary of a building used as a residence (but not occupied at the time of the crime) constituted a serious felony. Appellant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.  In our view, the terms \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d are equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">The 1987 amendment to subdivision (c)(18) made it consistent with the current definition of first degree burglary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   In our view, the change was one of clarification\u2014to bring the language in line with the current definition of first degree burglary\u2014not a substantive change. A residence is the same as an \u201cinhabited dwelling house.\u201d The amendment did not narrow the definition of burglary as a serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">As used in the burglary statutes, an \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d is a dwelling which is \u201ccurrently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.) This is precisely the meaning the courts have given to the term \u201cresidence.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Deay </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 280 [239 Cal.Rptr. 406], the trial court found the defendant guilty of \u201cresidential burglary.\u201d In finding that this was sufficient to sustain a conviction for first degree \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house,\u201d the Court of Appeal stated: \u201cWe see no practical difference between burglary of an inhabited dwelling and residential burglary. With the elimination on January 1, 1983, of the requirement that a first degree burglary be committed in the nighttime, all burglaries <em>of residences </em>are first degree pursuant to section 460. [Citation.] Further, courts have consistently analyzed first degree burglary in terms of whether the dwelling was being used as a <em>residence. </em>[Citations.] Even the common understanding of residence, which connotes a place of abode of some permanency [citation], cannot be differentiated from an inhabited dwelling unit for purposes of first degree burglary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.284, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 559, 563 [21 Cal.Rptr. 764], a vacant (unrented) rental unit was burglarized. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>held that this was second degree burglary because \u201cthe dwelling house in [that case], at the time in question, was not the <em>residence </em>of a person temporarily absent. It was not the <em>residence </em>of the new tenant, of the landlord, or of the old tenant. It was not the <em>dwelling </em>house of either of them.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Thus, it can be seen that the courts have interpreted \u201cresidence\u201d to mean an \u201cinhabited dwelling\u201d as that term is defined in the Penal Code; that is, a building which is currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.) Consequently, the 1987 amendment to section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(18) did not narrow the scope of the serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">The legislative history of the amendment also shows that \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cinhabited dwelling\u201d were meant to be equivalent. As originally drafted, the bill which amended subdivision (c)(18) (Assem. Bill No. 3733) defined the serious felony as a \u201cburglary <em>of a residence </em>or inhabited dwelling . . . house . . . .\u201d There was concern that using both definitions implied there was a difference between a \u201cresidence\u201d and a \u201cdwelling house.\u201d Thus the Assembly Committee on Public Safety\u2019s analysis of Assembly Bill No. 3733 recommended that \u201cto conform to the Penal Code, the term burglary \u2018of a residence\u2019 should be stricken.  To retain the reference to residence implies that a residence is somehow different from a dwelling house.\u201d (Assem. Com. On Pub. Safety, Report on Assem. Bill No. 3733, p. 3.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The final version of Assembly Bill No. 3733 deleted the reference to burglary \u201cof a residence,\u201d thereby implying the Legislature believed this term had no independent significance. (Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">In sum, past judicial construction of the term \u201cresidence\u201d and the legislative history of the amendment, show that \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d are equivalent terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">As to the enhancement for the 1980 prior burglary conviction, there is no question that the court had the power to strike the enhancement under Penal Code section 1385. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fritz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 227 [219 Cal.Rptr. 460, 707 P.2d 833].)  On May 6, 1986, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>enacted legislation contrary to <em>Fritz </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a); 1385, subd. (b)); however, this legislation may not constitutionally be applied to crimes committed before its effective date. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1157, 1159-1161 [242 Cal.Rptr. 421]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoze </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 949, 956 [241 Cal.Rptr. 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">However, there is a question whether the court had the power to stay the enhancement. Some courts have stated in dictum that a court has the power to \u201cstrike or stay\u201d a Penal Code section 667 enhancement. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoze, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 956; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whigam </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 1161, 1169 [205 Cal.Rptr. 227], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 343.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Eberhardt </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1112 [231 Cal.Rptr. 387], this view was persuasively criticized. The court pointed out that those cases which state that a section 667 enhancement can be stayed do so without citation to authority and overlook the distinction between \u201c\u2018striking\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018staying.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1122-1123.) The court therefore held that the trial court had imposed an unauthorized sentence by suspending imposition of sentence on the enhancements. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1124.) This holding finds further support in the language of Penal Code section 1385 which provides that a judge may, in the interests of justice, \u201corder an action to be dismissed,\u201d and the mandatory language of section 667 that the defendant \u201cshall receive ... a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">The trial court in this case did not specify whether it was staying the imposition of the enhancement or the execution of the sentence for the enhancement. It appears that the court intended to stay the imposition of the enhancement in declaring: \u201c[T]his enhancement as to the second prior conviction is stayed, and it will be dismissed at such time as all of the time served that I\u2019m about to pronounce, and have pronounced has been served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">It appears that in this case the court may have stricken the enhancement had it known it could not stay the enhancement. Nevertheless, we believe the trial court (and not this court) should make that determination. Consequently, we remand the case to the trial court to allow it to exercise its discretion in determining whether to strike the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The case is remanded to the trial court so that it may exercise its discretion in determining whether to strike the enhancement for the 1980 burglary conviction. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Barry-Deal, J., and Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 23, 1989, and appellant\u2019s petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied May 18, 1989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1181-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1439.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1183-8\"> Penal Code section 460, subdivision 1 defines first degree burglary as \u201c[e]very burglary of an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach as defined by the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited portion of any other building</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1184-8\"> An analysis of a bill prepared for a legislative committee is apparently relevant to show legislative intent.
