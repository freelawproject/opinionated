(Continental), a California corporation, sought the refund of a sales tax which it paid under protest to respondent State Board of Equalization (Board). Continental appeals from the judgment entered in favor of Board following trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">We adopt in essential part the facts set forth by Board in its respondent\u2019s brief which we find are supported by the record. Continental is in the business of selling and servicing water purification tanks. Continental\u2019s customers are industries and hospitals. The tanks contain resins which remove impurities from water by a \u201cdeionization,\u201d or ion exchange process. After repeated use the resins in the tanks become depleted and are no longer usable to remove the impurities. It is then necessary to \u201cregenerate\u201d the resins by flushing them with chemicals. The flushing process is performed at Continental\u2019s plants by trained operators. Typically, Continental removes the depleted tanks from its customers and replaces them with similar tanks which have been regenerated. The customer is charged for each replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The charges for replacing depleted tanks with regenerated tanks (regeneration charges) are separate from the charges Continental\u2019s customers pay either to purchase a tank or to lease one on a monthly basis. Continental paid sales tax on the sales of its tanks to its customers and on the lease payments. It did not pay any sales tax, however, on the regeneration charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">During an audit, the Board discovered that Continental had not paid any sales tax on the regeneration charges. The Board accordingly issued an assessment against Continental in the amount of $88,264.46 on these charges. Continental paid the amount of the assessment and then, after exhausting its administrative remedies, brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the regeneration charges are subject to the sales and use tax under Revenue and Taxation Code section 6001 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board contends that the replacement of depleted tanks with regenerated tanks constitutes a taxable \u201csale\u201d as defined under section 6006. Continental contends that the transaction is predominantly one for services and therefore not taxable as a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Section 6006, subdivision (a), defines a taxable sale as follows: \u201cAny transfer of title or possession, exchange, or barter, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of tangible personal property for a consideration. \u2018Transfer of possession\u2019 includes only transactions found by the board to be in lieu of a transfer of title, exchange, or barter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">To implement section 6006, subdivision (a), the Board has promulgated sales and use tax rules set forth in title 18 of the California Code of Regulations. California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1546, subdivision (b)(4), provides: \u201cIf the method of repairing or reconditioning certain tangible personal property involves commingling property delivered to a repairman or reconditioner with similar property so that the customer receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>repaired or reconditioned property which may not be the identical property delivered to the repairman or reconditioner but which is exactly the same kind of property or derived from exactly the same kind of property as that so delivered, tax applies to the amount charged by the repairman or reconditioner for the repaired or reconditioned property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Continental does not dispute that California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1546, subdivision (b)(4), constitutes a valid interpretation and implementation of section 6006, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Board contends, and we agree, that the provisions of California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1546, subdivision (b)(4), describe the transaction in the instant case. Continental delivered to its customers tangible personal property\u2014the tanks\u2014which were \u201creconditioned,\u201d and which were different but \u201cexactly the same kind\u201d as the tanks which they replaced. The transaction therefore is taxable as a sale under section 6006, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 86 [130 Cal.Rptr. 321, 550 P.2d 593], supports the Board\u2019s position. There, the taxpayer placed water conditioning units in the homes of customers which, like the water purification tanks here, deionized the water with an ion-exchange material which needed to be regenerated periodically. The taxpayer connected the units to the customer\u2019s water system, periodically replaced the ion-exchange material in the unit, and regenerated the exhausted material at its plant. The customer paid an initial installation charge and a monthly charge for water conditioning. At all times the taxpayer retained ownership of the units.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The Board contended that these transactions were taxable leases under section 6006, subdivision (g). The taxpayer disagreed, reasoning that under California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1501,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the water conditioning contracts were not taxable leases because \u201cthe true object\u201d of the contracts was the service per se, even though some tangible personal property was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Our Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that because the customers had the use of and full dominion and control over the units while connected to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>water systems, the use of the units was taxable under section 6006. The court stated: \u201cWe think it quite clear that the true object of the water conditioning contract is the furnishing of the exchange unit which, by itself and without requiring any performance of human labor, softens the water. It is true that human labor or service is involved in regenerating the ion-exchange material, but realistically viewed the customer\u2019s purpose in entering into the contract is to obtain, not personal services, but a properly generated and efficiently functioning water conditioning unit.\u201d <em>(Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d. at p. 96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We conclude that <em>Culligan </em>compels the determination reached by the trial court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">White, P. J., and Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-14\">All further statutory references are to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless indicated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\"> California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1501, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe basic distinction in determining whether a particular transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property or the transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the performance of a service is one of the true objects of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
