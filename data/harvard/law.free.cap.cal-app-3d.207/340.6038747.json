Kakita, from (1) hearing a pending motion for preliminary injunction and (2) presiding over any other proceedings in this action. The real parties in interest, Herzog Contracting Corporation (Herzog), A1 Landes (Landes) and Steve Sutter (Sutter; hereinafter collectively plaintiffs) are the plaintiffs in this action in which they seek damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. They oppose the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Defendants attack the trial court\u2019s rejection of their assertion of a challenge to Judge Kakita under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 (section 170.6) as untimely even though it was made within the 10-day period permitted by the court\u2019s local trial court delay reduction rules. The novel question with which we are presented is whether such local rules control the timing of judicial challenges over the provisions of section 170.6, as construed by recent appellate decisions. We conclude that they do and that defendants had 10 days in which to assert a section 170.6 challenge. We further conclude that such right was not lost by participation during said 10-day period in an ex parte hearing to oppose an application for a temporary restraining order. We therefore issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The defendant Union represents certain employees in the construction industry and the defendant Lanham is its business agent. The plaintiff Herzog is a construction contractor for the Long Beach-Los Angeles Rail Transit Project (RTP) and the plaintiffs Landes and Sutter are two of its employees. On October 7, 1988, plaintiffs filed this action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>defendants seeking both damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that Lanham had unlawfully and repeatedly entered the RTP job site and interfered with Herzog\u2019s employees and their work activities with the intent and purpose of causing Herzog, a nonunion contractor, to lose its contract and be barred from further state work. The record reflects that on September 15, 1988, after a job site incident for which police assistance had been required, Herzog wrote to defendants and informed them that a complaint seeking injunctive relief would be sought if Lanham did not immediately cease further visits to the RTP job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Shortly before noon on October 6, 1988, counsel for plaintiffs informed defendants\u2019 counsel by telephone that plaintiffs would, on the next day, apply for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin defendants\u2019 interference at the RTP job site. At the time the case was filed on October 7, 1988, in the Central District of the Los Angeles Superior Court, it was given an odd file number. This caused it to be immediately assigned to a particular judge in that court\u2019s statutory delay reduction pilot project (project) which had been established in 1987 in accordance with the mandate of the Trial Court Delay Reduction Act of 1986 (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 68600-68619; hereinafter the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The project was implemented by the Trial Court Delay Reduction Rules (Ch. 11, Local Rules of the Los Angeles County Superior Court hereinafter the Local Rules) which had been adopted by a majority of the Superior Court judges in accordance with Government Code section 68612. The Local Rules went into effect on October 15, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Upon filing, this case was assigned to Judge Kakita and it was to him that plaintiffs\u2019 application for a TRO was sent for hearing. Counsel for defendants, alerted by telephone the previous day as to the anticipated time of the TRO hearing, was present at the courthouse when these events took place and there received for the first time plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and moving papers. Defendants\u2019 counsel had 30 to 40 minutes to consider these documents before the TRO hearing was held by Judge Kakita. That hearing lasted approximately 30 minutes. At its conclusion the court issued the requested TRO and set October 19, 1988, as the date for hearing on an order to show cause (OSC) as to why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">On October 13, 1988, the date set by the court for the filing of opposition to the OSC, defendants filed, in addition to their opposition papers, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>motion to disqualify Judge Kakita pursuant to section 170.6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That motion was opposed by plaintiffs and denied by Judge Kakita on October 19, 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then set November 2, 1988, as the date for the hearing on the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Defendants sought a writ of prohibition from this court. On November 2, 1988, we issued an alternative writ and an order staying the hearing on the preliminary injunction, but directing that the TRO remain in effect. We also requested counsel to present the court with further arguments relating specifically to the application of Local Rule 1104.1 and our recent decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>in <em>Landmark Holding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 525 [238 Cal.Rptr. 475].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Issues Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The critical question which we are asked to resolve is whether defendants\u2019 assertion of a challenge to Judge Kakita under section 170.6 was timely. The answer to that depends on our resolution of two issues: (1) Were defendants required by the terms of section 170.6, subdivision (2) , to assert the challenge immediately upon learning of Judge\u2019s Kakita\u2019s identity or were they allowed 10 days to make such challenge as provided in Local Rule 1104.1;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">(2) If Local Rule 1104.1 controls, did defendants waive the 10-day period provided for in that rule by not asserting the challenge <em>before </em>the TRO was heard by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Defendants rely upon Local Rule 1104.1 and argue that they had 10 days from October 7, 1988, the date they appeared in the action by opposing the application for the TRO, in which to assert a challenge to the assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>judge under section 170.6. They further contend that their participation in the TRO hearing did not constitute a waiver of their right to later assert a challenge to the trial judge within said 10-day period. <em>(Landmark Holding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 525.) Plaintiffs claim that Local Rule 1104.1 conflicts with the provisions of section 170.6, subdivision (2), as interpreted and applied in <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 407 [241 Cal.Rptr. 818] and <em>Augustyn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1221 [231 Cal.Rptr. 298], and therefore must yield. In addition, they argue, defendants\u2019 participation in the TRO hearing, after learning 30 minutes before of the trial judge\u2019s identity, constituted a waiver of their right to assert a challenge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">1. <em>The Local Trial Court Delay Reduction Rules Prevail Over the Provisions of Section 170.6, Subdivision (2), as to the Time During Which a Challenge May Be Asserted in Project Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">While it is true that the assignment of the case to Judge Kakita was for all purposes (Local Rule 1103.9),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it was an assignment made immediately upon the filing of the action. This was a \u201cNew Case,\u201d as defined by Local Rule 1101.2 (see fn. 6, <em>ante). </em>Under Local Rule 1104.1, plaintiffs had 10 days in which to assert a challenge under section 170.6. Defendants had 10 days after their first appearance in the action in which to make a determination regarding such a challenge. In providing this fixed 10-day period the drafters of the Local Rules obviously were attempting to adjust the need to give counsel and the parties, <em>on each side, </em>a fair opportunity to reflect and consider on the issue of a challenge to the assigned judge while minimizing the risk that a particular trial judge might invest considerable time in a case only to be subsequently removed by a late-filed challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">This brief 10-day period is particularly important to a defendant who first appears in an action, as did the defendants here, by responding on short (24-hour) notice to an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order. Defendants, aware that the case had been assigned under the project to a particular judge, were charged with knowledge of the duly adopted Local Rules. <em>(Beverly Union Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 40, 43 [253 Cal.Rptr. 359]; <em>Brekhus &amp; Williams </em>v. <em>Parker-Rhodes </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 788, 791 [244 Cal.Rptr. 48].) That knowledge would necessarily include, and induce reliance upon, the provisions of Local Rule 1104.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>which gave them 10 days to assert a challenge to the assigned judge under section 170.6. Defendants received a copy of the complaint and plaintiffs\u2019 moving papers at the same time they learned of Judge Kakita\u2019s assignment. They had only 30 to 40 minutes to review them and prepare their opposition before the judge commenced the hearing which resulted in the issuance of the TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Under the provisions of section 170.6, subdivision (2), there are two separate time limitations relevant to the issues of this proceeding. \u201cGenerally, a motion [asserting a judicial challenge] is permitted any time before the beginning of a trial or a hearing. [Citation.] There are two express statutory exceptions to the general rule set forth in section 170.6, subdivision (2) . . . .\u201d <em>(Waldon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 809, 814 [241 Cal.Rptr. 123].) The first is the <em>10-day\u20145-day </em>rule. It provides that where the judge \u201cwho is scheduled to try the cause or hear the matter is known at least 10 days before the date set for trial or hearing,\u201d the motion to challenge shall be made at least five days before that date.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second is the <em>master calendar </em>rule which requires a party to assert a challenge motion \u201cnot later than the time the cause is assigned for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">There is no specific provision in section 170.6 about assignments to a judge for \u201call purposes.\u201d However, section 170.6, subdivision (2), does provide that \u201cIn the case of trials or hearings not herein specifically provided for, the procedure herein specified shall be followed as nearly as may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">There have been three decisions which have sought to describe the rule which should apply when an all-purpose assignment has been made. In <em>Zdonek </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 849 [113 Cal.Rptr. 669], division 4 of this district concluded that an assignment for all. purposes, including a future rather than immediate trial, was not a master calendar assignment requiring prompt assertion of a section 170.6 challenge. Instead, the 10-day\u20145-day rule applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>This decision was criticized and rejected by the Fourth District <em>in Augustyn </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d 1221, where a challenge to an all-purpose assignment, made approximately three months after the assignment, was attacked as untimely. The court concluded that the master calendar rule applied to the all-purpose assignment. The court stated, \u201cIn the case of an all-purpose assignment, that assignment instantly pinpoints and establishes for all purposes the identity of the judge in the matter. The litigant does not need any further information to know who will try the case. There is no policy reason to allow further postponement of the decision whether to challenge. Further, ... to allow such postponement frustrates the entire purpose of an all-purpose assignment, to expedite complex matters by permitting one judge to handle the entire matter from start to finish, acquiring an expertise regarding the factual and legal issues involved which will expedite the process.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>Augustyn </em>was followed by <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 407, where the same panel which had decided <em>Zdonek </em>concluded that its earlier decision was incorrect. In <em>Woodman, </em>a criminal case, the People sought to assert a challenge against the trial judge, who had been assigned for all purposes, including trial, <em>nearly a year earlier. </em>The court rejected its prior opinion in <em>Zdonek </em>as \u201cwrongly decided\u201d and concluded that the master calendar rule, requiring the <em>immediate </em>assertion of the challenge upon learning of the assignment of the trial judge, was the proper rule. The court stated, \u201cAn all-purpose assignment clearly contemplates assignment to a specific judge to process the litigation in its totality rather than a trial department in which the identity of the judge is subject to the vagaries of personal and administrative necessity. The purpose of such assignment is to permit the efficient disposition of complex matters and this commendable purpose would be utterly frustrated unless there is certainty that once assigned, the all-purpose judge will preside over the action from beginning to end. The purpose of the disqualification statute is, after all, to promote fair and impartial trials, not to serve as a device by which one party or the other can inordinately delay or otherwise frustrate the judicial proceedings. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 670, 677 [203 Cal.Rptr. 290].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Thus, without regard to the impact of the Local Rules, the state of the law seems clearly to be that all-purpose assignments require assertion of a section 170.6 challenge \u201cat the time\u201d the assignment is made to a specific all-purpose judge. For plaintiffs, this is the end of the discussion,  The assignment of the judge under the project is certainly for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>purposes, including trial. Thus, they ask, does not the express language of Section 170.6, subdivision (2), as interpreted and construed by <em>Augustyn </em>and <em>Woodman, </em>compel the conclusion that defendants\u2019 challenge of Judge Kakita came too late?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In our view, plaintiffs\u2019 argument overlooks the significance of the Legislature\u2019s determination to grant wide procedural latitude to the project trial courts in their development of the rules and procedures to implement the Act. That legislation clearly represented a fundamental change in the approach to the problem of court congestion. It embraced the principle of active judicial management which required that trial judges aggressively monitor and manage litigation from the filing of the first pleading until final disposition. This effort to transfer control of the pace and timing of litigation from the lawyers to the trial judge was a major departure from long-accepted traditional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Thus, broad authority was necessarily given to the project trial courts by the Act to fashion rules appropriate to carrying out the Act\u2019s basic and fundamental purposes. The authority given to the Judicial Council to adopt standards for the timely disposition of cases (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68603)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>and the direction given to the project trial courts to adopt, utilize and enforce procedures, standards and policies which would be used in the project (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 68608 and 68612)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> necessarily recognized that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>conflict might arise with procedures and time limits contained in either the rules of court or in statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Initially, Government Code section 68612 <em>expressly </em>authorized deviation only from the rules of court, but said nothing about the consequences of any conflict with a statute. However, the urgent nature of the problem which the Act sought to address,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the broad scope of the authority given to the Judicial Council and the project trial courts by the Act, when read in its entirety, strongly implied that there was authority for procedural deviation from statutory language in ways <em>reasonably necessary </em>to carry out the clearly stated and mandatory provisions and goals of the Act. Subsequent action of the Legislature confirms this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In an amendment to Government Code section 68612,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which, due to an urgency clause, became effective on <em>September 22, 1988 </em>(about two weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>before </em>this action was filed), the Legislature provided that the procedures, standards and policies adopted by the project trial courts could not only be inconsistent with the rules of court but such courts were also permitted to \u201cimpose procedural requirements in addition to those authorized by statute\u201d and to \u201cshorten any time specified by statute for performing an act.\u201d  The Legislature regarded this not as a change in the law but merely declaratory of existing law under the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Plaintiffs vigorously argue that to permit defendants 10 days in which to assert a section 170.6 challenge does not shorten, but rather extends, an existing statutory time period. They contend section 170.6, as construed by <em>Augustyn </em>and <em>Woodman, </em>provides for a much shorter period and Local Rule 1104.1 is thus in derogation not furtherance of the expeditious litigation goals of the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>First, we view Local Rule 1104.1 as a \u201cprocedural requirement\u201d not otherwise provided for in section 170.6 with respect to all-purpose judicial assignments in the project. Thus, the question of whether the rule shortens or lengthens a statutory time period is simply not reached. Secondly, the traditional all-purpose assignment made by a master calendar judge (and this certainly includes the assignments made in <em>Augustyn </em>and <em>Woodman) </em>is made more than 10 days after a case has been filed. To require that a party have no more than 10 days after appearance in the action in which to assert a challenge is at least compatible with the goals of the Act and represents a reasonable accommodation with the obvious due process problems which would be created if we embraced plaintiffs\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We therefore hold that a project rule, duly adopted under the mandate of Government Code section 68612, and not expressly prohibited thereby, which either imposes a procedural requirement not authorized by statute or shortens the time specified by statute for performance of an act, will control, to the extent reasonably necessary to carry out and further the provisions and goals of the Act, in those cases to which the project rules apply. Thus, the provisions of Local Rule 1104.1, which impose the procedural requirement that a challenge under section 170.6 against a project judge must be made within a fixed period of 10 days following a defendant\u2019s appearance in the action, apply in this case. The rule endorsed by <em>Augustyn </em>and <em>Woodman </em>imposing the master calendar rule on all-purpose assignments, thereby requiring an immediate assertion of a challenge, will not apply in project cases where, as here, duly adopted project rules expressly provide otherwise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Therefore, defendants\u2019 exercise of a section 170.6 challenge against Judge Kakita, by the filing of a proper motion on October 13, 1988, was timely under Local Rule 1104.1, unless they had lost the right to assert that challenge by their participation in the ex parte TRO hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>2. <em>Defendants\u2019 Participation in the TRO Does Not Bar the Assertion of an Otherwise Timely Challenge Under Section 170.6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The answer to the question of whether defendants waived their right to assert a challenge within 10 days by participation in the TRO hearing depends upon whether that hearing involved the resolution of a contested fact issue. \u201c \u2018Prior to 1965, if a party failed to exercise his section 170.6 rights before a pretrial hearing involving a contested issue of law or fact, he lost his right to peremptorily disqualify the judge.\u2019 <em>(In re Abdul Y. </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 847, 857 [182 Cal.Rptr. 146], citing <em>Swartzman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 195 [41 Cal.Rptr. 721].) \u2018In 1965, the Legislature, at the suggestion of the State Bar of California, adopted the following amendment to section 170.6, subdivision 2: \u201cThe fact that a judge has presided at or acted in connection with a pretrial conference or other hearing, proceeding or motion prior to trial and not involving a determination of <em>contested fact issues relating to the merits </em>shall not preclude the later making of the motion [to disqualify] provided for herein at the time and in the manner hereinbefore provided.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Kohn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 428, 429-430 [48 Cal.Rptr. 832].) (Italics in original.) \u2018The underlined language is at the heart of, reflects the motivating purpose of the 1965 amendment. [SYc. ] This addition preserves the right of a party to disqualify a judge under . . . section 170.6 notwithstanding the fact the judge had heard and determined an earlier demurrer or motion, or other matter not involving \u201ccontested fact issues\u201d relating \u201cto the merits\u201d without challenge in the same cause. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(In re Jose S. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 619, 626 [144 Cal.Rptr. 309]; accord <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Swickard </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 820, 825 [209 Cal.Rptr. 844].)\u201d <em>(Bambula </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 653, 656-657 [220 Cal.Rptr. 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u201cAs stated in <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 428, 430 [48 Cal.Rptr. 832], it is \u2018crystal clear\u2019 that a motion to disqualify a judge can be made after any hearing or proceeding which does not involve a contested fact issue. In order to act as a bar to the motion to disqualify, the judge must have actually resolved conflict in factual contentions relating to the merits. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 430-431.)\u201d <em>(Landmark Holding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 525, 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In <em>Landmark, </em>we concluded that an ex parte hearing concerning a TRO did not involve the determination of a contested fact issue so as to constitute a bar (pursuant to \u00a7 170.6, subd. (2)) to an otherwise timely exercise of a challenge to an assigned judge. We said there, \u201cThe ex parte hearing concerning a TRO is no more than a review of the conflicting contentions to determine whether there is a sufficiency of evidence to support the issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of an interlocutory order to keep the subject of litigation in status quo pending a full hearing to determine whether the applicant is entitled to a preliminary injunction. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Bybee </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 564, 571 [141 P.2d 32].) The issuance of a TRO is not a determination of the merits of the controversy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>All that is determined is whether the TRO is necessary to maintain the status quo pending the noticed hearing on the application for preliminary injunction. <em>(Biasca </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 366, 367 [228 P. 861].)\u201d <em>(Landmark Holding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 525, 528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cA TRO is purely transitory in nature and terminates automatically when a preliminary injunction is issued or denied. <em>(Houser </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1932) 121 Cal.App.31, 33 [8 P.2d 483].) No final determination of a contested fact issue is made during the ex parte proceeding. A disposition of an incidental matter not affecting the merits of the case cannot act as a bar to the statutory right provided by section 170.6. We therefore conclude a peremptory challenge under section 170.6 is timely when filed subsequent to an ex parte proceeding concerning a TRO and prior to the hearing on a preliminary injunction, where, as here, said challenge is filed in accord with the statutory time periods set forth in section 170.6, subdivision (2).\u201d <em>(Landmark Holding Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 525, 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\"><em>Landmark </em>is dispositive of the issue raised here by the plaintiffs.

In our view, the more reasonable explanation of the reference to <em>Augustyn </em>was to demonstrate that the rule drafters had rejected the 10-day\u20145-day rule of <em>Zdonek </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.3d 849 (which was then an unrecanted decision), and had adopted the master calendar approach of <em>Augustyn, </em>but had superimposed thereon, for the reasons already discussed above, a specific 10-day limitation. This case is perhaps a paradigm illustration of the wisdom and fairness of that 10-day period. If it were not available it would place upon the defendants, faced with responding to an application for a temporary restraining order, the unreasonable burden of an immediate decision regarding their sole peremptory judicial challenge without a fair opportunity to even read and review the pleadings they had just received and reflect upon the case being asserted against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Plaintiffs argue that since Lanham had been engaging in the allegedly improper activities on the RTP job site for a number of months, an order restraining him was more than a mere maintenance of the status quo, but in fact was a change. However, the record reflects that the behavior of Lanham which plaintiffs sought to restrain (i.e., harassment of plaintiffs\u2019 employees) was apparently of a far more recent vintage. Plaintiffs did not express objection to Lanham\u2019s activities until September 15, 1988. Thus, his actions prior to that date were apparently not of the same character as those to which plaintiffs now take exception and which are the subject of these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that to permit defendants\u2019 challenge will promote judicial inefficiency due to the loss of Judge Kakita\u2019s experience with the case is not supported by the record. According to plaintiffs\u2019 own declarations, Judge Kakita only had 15 minutes to review the file prior to the commencement of the TRO hearing. The hearing itself lasted 30 minutes. It does not appear that Judge Kakita reviewed the file again before ruling to deny defendants\u2019 challenge on October 19, 1988 (see fn. 4, <em>ante). </em>Certainly, any involvement which Judge Kakita may have had with the case subsequent to the assertion of defendants\u2019 challenge cannot be urged as a reason for its denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
