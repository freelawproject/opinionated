On May 22, 1860, an execution was duly issued thereon to the sheriff of New York city. Subsequently, but on the same day, at the urgent request of Sauvestre, Jacot\u2019s attorney wrote to the sheriff the following note:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\"><em>\u201c </em>It is the desire of the plaintiff simply to make a levy, s\u00f3 as to claim a preference.

Immediately upon receiving notice of this fact, \u2022 Jacot\u2019s attorney urged the sheriff to sell at once; but he did not do so until July 14,1860. The sale produced $254, which was claimed by both Jacot and Dunderdale. Judge Daly, at special term, directed it to be paid to the latter, and from this order Jacot appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-14\"><em>W. D.

The sole motive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the instructions to the sheriff was to avoid the useless expense of keeping a man to take charge of the goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\">II.

It could not have been compelled to be made previously.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">IV. There was no request to <em>defer the sale. </em>This case is, therefore, essentially different from the cases, Storm <em>a. </em>Woods (11 <em>Johns., </em>110) ; Kellogg <em>a. </em>Griffin (17 <em>Id., </em>274) ; Kimball <em>a. </em>Munger (2 <em>Hill, </em>364), in which the general rule is laid down.

It wras not necessary that the sheriff should remove the goods. The levy was complete.

There is no need of keeping a man in charge. I am sure nothing will be removed.\u201d The object of the paper, as appears upon its face, and the effect of it upon the sheriff, was necessarily delay. It was equivalent to saying: \u201cAfter the levy don\u2019t remove the property, and don\u2019t sell until some other process is received.\u201d This is apparent from the declaration that it was the desire of the creditor simply to make a levy to secure a preference, thus leaving the property in the possession and under the control of 'the defendant, and relieving the sheriff from the duty of removing it, or exercising any dominion over it. To constitute a levy on personal property, the officer must assume dominion over it, having the property at the time within Ms power, and subject to imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>diate.seizure. (Green <em>a. </em>Burke, 23 <em>Wend., </em>490, and cases cited; Camp <em>a. </em>Chamberlain, 5 <em>Den., </em>198; Dresser <em>a. </em>Ainsworth, 9 <em>Barb., </em>619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In this case the dominion, as in the case of. Price <em>a. </em>Shipps (16 <em>Barb., </em>585), was a qualified dominion, because the custody of the property was conferred upon the debtor, and he permitted . to employ it as he thought proper. But aside from that view of the levy itself, it is clear that the directions were intended to delay the execution of the process, and it became, therefore, . dormant. (Whipple <em>a. </em>Foot, 2 <em>Johns., </em>418 ; Storm <em>a. </em>Woods, 11 <em>Ib., </em>110 ; Kellogg <em>a. </em>Griffin, 17 Ib., 274 ; Knower <em>a. </em>Barnard, 5 <em>Hill, </em>377 ; Price <em>a. </em>Shipps, 16 <em>Barb., </em>585; Russell <em>a. </em>Gibbs, 5 <em>Cow., </em>390; Benjamin <em>a. </em>Smith, 12 <em>Wend., </em>404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Although the application of the. rule by which executions are deemed to be dormant depends upon- the circumstances of each particular case, and the discussion, of the rule in the adjudged cases has thrown around it some confusion, if not obscurity, it is nevertheless well settled, that if the execution be accompanied by instructions,,from which the fair inference is that the debtor is <em>to </em>be left in possession of the. property levied- upon, and the sale thereof delayed .until rendered necessary by .the pressure of other process, the execution becomes dormant. \"It must not be used as a cover. There must be an absolute intention ' to collect the judgment in the ordinary legal mode. Where a levy is made to secure a preference, and the debtor-permitted to remain in possession and to exercise control, no such \u2022 intention can be said to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The order at special term should be-affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Daly, F. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> Present, Daly, F.J., Brady and Hilton, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b132-10\">Hilton, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Aya\">\u2014I do not concur.in the.view that the execution in favor, of Jacot became, dormant because the attorney,, at the request of the. defendant, and'without the knowledge of his. client,- addressed a note to the sheriff, in substance informing him that there was no need of going to the expense of placing akeepej; in charge of.the property, levied on, as the defendant could be trusted with its safe-keeping, and that he would not remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">For such an act of humanity and confidence in favor of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>debtor, I am not prepared to say that the creditor, whose debt and judgment is wholly unimpeached, forfeits all rights acquired by a valid levy under an execution issued by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Another, and it seems to me a fatal objection, to holding that the execution of Jacot and the levy thereunder was dormant, is, that it appears the goods have been actually sold under it, and the proceeds now in the hands of the sheriff, which Dunderdale seeks to have paid over to him, have resulted from such levy and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In my opinion, these funds belong to Jacot, and should be paid over to him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
