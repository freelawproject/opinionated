S. Steam Sugar Refining Company, a corporation created under the general law, authorizing the formation of corporations for manufacturing, mining, mechanical, and chemical purposes, passed February 17, 1848, commenced this action for themselves and all other creditors who should come in, &amp;c., to procure the dissolution of the company, and the appointment of a receiver for the sequestration and distribution of its assets; on the grounds\u20141. That the company was insolvent, and its property, consisting of real estate for the most part, was not worth more than fifty per cent, of its unsecured debt; and 2. That its trustees, who were made defendants, ought to take proceedings for the dissolution of the corporation and the equal distribution of its property among the creditors; but that, instead of doing so, they intended to facilitate the recovery of judgments against the company to an amount exceeding half the value of its assets, and thus by the priority of lien to give preferences, and, by suffering the judgments tobe executed, to effect alienations of the property of the company contrary to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">Upon the application for the continuance of an injunction temporarily obtained, and for the appointment of a receiver, defendants\u2019 affidavits denied the inadequacy of the property of the company to satisfy all its debts, unless it should be sacrificed by a forced sequestration; they denied any intent or act to facilitate, by confession or otherwise, the recovery of judgments against the company; they exhibited the solid and valuable character of the company\u2019s property, and its condition of debt; they showed that a portion of its debts matured earlier than other portions, and claimed that no defence, legal or equitable, existed in favor of the company against the recovery of judg- _ ment on these debts; that these earlier maturing debts were for money advanced to the company for the purpose of making a pro-rata payment upon the general debts, and that the money was so employed; and that the legal priority to be gained from the earlier maturity of these debts was equitable, and was an understood consideration, with.the knowledge and assent of the general creditors, upon which the money was supplied, which went to the reduction of the general debts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Francis H. Dykers </em>and <em>Charles O\u2019Conor, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">\u2014I. Whenever a corporation becomes unable to pay all the demands against it, the directors may apply for a dissolution. (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>768, \u00a7 69.) This proceeding contemplates an equal pro-rata distribution among all creditors <em>(Ib., </em>771, \u00a7 90) ; and it is not merely within the power of the directors, but it is their duty to take measures for such distribution. (Innes <em>a. </em>Lansing, 7 <em>Paige, </em>583 ; 2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>600, \u00a7 4 <em>; Ib., </em>658, \u00a7 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\">II. Either the attorney-general or any creditor may, by action against the corporation and its directors, compel an account of the management of the property, and restrain any threatened or apprehended alienation of the property of the corporation or other mismanagement. (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>762, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 43, 45.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-6\">III. Whenever such action is brought, the court will restrain any creditor from proceeding to obtain a preference at law. <em>(3 Rev. Stat., </em>767, \u00a7 65 <em>; Ib., </em>763, \u00a7 45.) 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>764, \u00a7 50, recognizes the authority to appoint receiver, under the visitorial jurisdiction. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 244, subd. 4.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">IV. The appointment of a receiver is necessarily a part of the relief to which the plaintiffs will be finally entitled, if the action is properly brought. \u2022 If a <em>prima-facie </em>case is made out in favor of the plaintiffs, a receiver should be provisionally appointed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\"><em>Joseph H. Choate </em>and <em>William, M. Evarts, </em>for the company.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYm\">\u2014I. A court of equity, in this State, has no general jurisdiction over corporations, to restrain or correct their action, or to dissolve them and wind up their affairs, but in all these respects the statutes are the source and the measure of the jurisdiction in equffy. (Atty. Gen. <em>a. </em>Utica Ins. Co., 2 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>370 ; Atty. Gen. <em>a. </em>Bank of Niagara, <em>Hopk., </em>354.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-9\">II. The plaintiffs\u2019 case does not fall within any of the statutory provisions giving or regulating procedures for the dissolution of a corporation, or the sequestration of its property through a receiver. Proceedings are authorized in but three cases. 1. Upon the application of a creditor by judgment or decree, on the return of an execution unsatisfied. (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>463, \u00a7 36 ; 3 <em>Ib., </em>5 ed., 763, \u00a7 44.) 2. Upon the fact of insolvency continued for a year, or of the payment of debts neglected or refused for a year, or of suspension of its business for a year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>(Ib., </em>\u00a7 [38] 46) 3. Upon the application of the directors or trustees, when, in their judgment, the condition of the corporation makes it desirable. <em>(Ib., </em>467, \u00a7 58 ; 3 <em>Ib., </em>5 ed., 768, \u00a7 69.) For a criticism upon these statutory provisions, see Mann <em>a. </em>Pentz (2 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>257.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-6\">III. These provisions, by a necessary construction, limit the policy and effect of the legislation to these cases; and especially, when we find the policy, and the effect of the same statutes, giving wider scope for these remedies against \u201c moneyed corporations.\u201d (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 764, \u00a7\u00a7 47 [39], 48 [40].) It seems impossible that, upon a\" complaint exhibiting the plaintiffs\u2019 standing as that of creditors at large, and the corporation\u2019s defaults or suspensions as quite short of the year of default or suspension, made the condition by the statute, the remedies of the statute can be pursued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">IV. If the plaintiffs, as creditors at large, have an equitable action against the trustees of the cempany, or any of them, for their personal defaults, neglects, or misconducts, a sequestration of the corporate property, or a dissolution of the corporation, forms no part of the remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-8\">V. But the complaint shows no case against the trustees under the statute, or upon general principles. 'The trustees have the management of the corporate interests, and the discretion as to voluntary dissolution of the corporation is wholly reposed in them. The, creditor cannot coerce the discretion of the trustees, or make his interest the sole controlling consideration of their duty. . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-9\">VI. The utmost equity that a creditor, or other person, interested to obtain a dissolution of a corporation can claim is, to compel the trustees to set in motion the proceedings for its dissolution, mentioned by the statute. But to give a party this relief, he must have legal right to the only remedy approjuiate to accomplish it\u2014viz., a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\">VII. The notion, that a creditor, hot in the predicament to pursue the statutory remedy provided by creditors, can, from the omission,-however wrongful, of the trustees to pursue the course open by the statute to them, invent a remedy more \u2018energetic and summary than either, and without the safeguards provided for both, is wholly irrational. The case of Innes <em>a. </em>Lansing (7 <em>Paige, </em>583), and the principles there established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>that an extension of equitable remedies on the part of the court, will follow a new equity arising on the frame of a statute, although the statute, in terms, does not provide the specific remedial procedure, cannot help the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-5\"><em>Dennis McMahon </em>for a judgment-creditor of the company.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A93\">\u2014I. James Olwell, a judgment-creditor of the company, is not a party to this action. It was irregular to give an order staying the proceedings of all the creditors, so as to affect his lights. 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>767, \u00a7 65, gives no such power, or at most a power to restrain a creditor\u2019s proceedings at law before j udgment, not after.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">II. This statute certainly cannot apply to any creditor, without giving him notice of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">III. James Olwell has a legal preference, which the court cannot, devest. (Matter of Waterbury, 8 <em>Paige, </em>380 ; Fiske <em>a. </em>Keeseville Manufacturing Co., 10 <em>Ib., </em>592.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-8\"><em>Henry P.
