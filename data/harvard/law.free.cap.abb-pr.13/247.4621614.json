From this order the plaintiff appealed. The defendant moved to dismiss the appeal, and the appeal and motion were heard together.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>S. A. Foot, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-O\">I. The real object of section 309 of the Code was to enable the courts, in the cases mentioned, to add a reasonable and moderate amount to the taxable costs, so as to bring them up to the standard of the old fee bills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">II. It is a violation of the spirit of this section to allow an enormous sum to cover extravagant charges of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">III. The enormous allowance in this case is a violation of a substantial right, and not the mere exercise of discretion. It is, therefore, reviewable on appeal.

The order is not appealable, and the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\">II. The action has been difficult and extraordinary in the highest degree. The parties have been repeatedly before the court, and the defendant has been arrested on charges decided by the referee to be unfounded.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-9\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014 Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A66\">\u2014Without expressing any opinion as to the amount of the allowance, we think the appeal in this case cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">There can be no doubt that the case is one contemplated by \u25a0 the Code as a suitable one in which to make an allowance. The judge at special term had the discretion vested in him to settle the rate of allowance, being only confined to the maximum limit of five per cent. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The mode in which he has exercised that discretion is not to be reviewed by the general term, even if the allowance should be thought to be too large.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The Legislature must give the general term power to review such questions before we can entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">' Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">II.\u2014Appeal from an order for a further, report.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The plaintiff moved, at special term, for leave to apply to the referee, who tried the cause, for a further report on certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>issues. Leave was granted by an order which did not specify the particular points upon which a report was required. From this order the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>Dudley </em>Field, for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>S.

The order does not specify any particular mode of report, and leaves that to the referee. The order might have specified the points upon which such report was to be made, but the information can be obtained from the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-16\"> Present, Ingraham, Clerke, and Leonard, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
