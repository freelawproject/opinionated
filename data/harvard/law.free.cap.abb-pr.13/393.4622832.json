The plaintiff was the assignee of one Cockle. The answer denied any agreement to pay Cockle any share in such commissions, and, along with other matters of defence, set up, by way of counter-claim, a j udgment by the defendants against said Cockle for $722.99, in the Superior Court, and alleged that the demand existed at the time of the assignment, and belonged to the defendants in good faith before notice; and likewise set up said judgment in bar, alleging that Cockle, in May, 1854, commenced an action in the Superior Court for the same cause of action; that the defendants appeared and answered; that the action was tried on the merits, and judgment rendered for the defendants, which afterwards was docketed for the defendants for said sum, and which was in full force; and demanded that the complaint be dismissed with costs. The reply alleged that the judgment was not a just and legal set-off and counterclaim against plaintiff\u2019s claim; and that the plaintiff therein never brought the action to trial, and no proceedings were had by him, or proofs presented by him, and no judgment rendered by the court upon the claim mentioned in the complaint in such action, but only for the counter-claim and set-off, and denied that the j udgment was a bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">The cause was tried before the Hon.

(Eastmure <em>a. </em>Laws, 5 <em>Bingham\u2019s New </em>Cases, 444 ; Le Guen <em>a. </em>Gouverneur, 1 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>436 ; Castle <em>a. </em>Noyes, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>(4 <em>Kern.), </em>329 ; see Outram <em>a. </em>Morewood, 3 <em>East, </em>345.) In Eastmure <em>a. </em>Laws, Coltman, J., says: <em>\u201c </em>Outram <em>a. </em>Morewood decides that when the same fact has been put in issue in a former cause, the verdict in that cause is an estoppel in a second action ; here the same claim has been put in issue and has already been decided between the parties.\u201d Erskixr, J., concurred. In the present action the claim of the plaintiff is at issue, upon the record of the former action, and a judgment was therein rendered for the defendants after a trial of the cause. 1. The suit in the Superior Court was for the same cause of action by the assignor of the plaintiff against the same defendants; it came- on regularly for trial; was tried by the court in lieu and stead of a jury, a jury trial being -waived by the parties, and a judgment was rendered' for the defendants against the then plaintiff, for so much damages and the costs of the action. 2. The- claim of the plaintiff was at issue therein. The trial and judgment were upon the merits. The defendants\u2019 set-off was finally established, and adjudged to be true upon the trial, and whether upon the admission of the plaintiff, or direct testimony, can make no difference. (Dunckel <em>a. </em>Wiles, 1 <em>Kern., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>420.) A judgment in favor of a plaintiff upon a failure to answer, is as final and conclusive, and as much upon the merits, as if rendered after the sharpest controversy. 3. The plaintiff did not discontinue his action, nor dismiss his complaint, nor was such discontinuance or dismissal permitted or adjudged. (Cockle <em>a. </em>Underwood, 1 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., 1 ; </em>S. C., at general term, 3 <em>Duer, </em>676 ; Seaboard &amp; Roanoke R. R. Co. a. Ward, 1 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr., </em>46, recognizing and approving the decision in the last case; Averill <em>a. </em>Patterson, 10 <em>How. Pr., </em>85.) Had the action been discontinued, or the \u2022 plaintiff hionsuited, both the plaintiff and the\" cause would have been out of court. (Hope <em>a. </em>Acker, 7 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>308.) 4. If the plaintiff in that \"action was dissatisfied with the ruling of the judge, he should have appealed. Its correctness cannot now be examined collaterally. 5. \u201cIt is true, if a person sues upon several and distinct causes of action, and submits only a part of them to a jury, he is not precluded from suing again for such distinct cause of action as was not passed upon. In that case, he was not bound originally to unite the different'causes of action, and therefore shall not be bound.\u201d (Wheeler <em>a. </em>Van Houten, 12 <em>Johns., </em>311 ; S. P., Seddon a<em>. </em>Tutop, 6 <em>Term R., </em>607, where the defendants\u2019 plea could not, of course, be maintained, for the recovery in the former action was not on the' same promises and undertakings.) But .where.there is only a single cause of action, the principle is inapplicable. (See <em>supra ; </em>Markham <em>a. </em>Middleton, 2 Strange, 1259.) 6. That the judgment is a bar, is evident from the nature of a plea of set-off (Eastmure <em>a. </em>Laws, 5 <em>Bingham\u2019s N. C., </em>444 ; Collins <em>a. </em>Collins, 2 <em>Burr, </em>825 ; Burgess <em>a. </em>Tucker, 5 <em>Johns., </em>105.) It is a plea in bar going to the merits. It confesses and avoids the demand alleged by the plaintiff. It prays that the defendants\u2019 demand be set off or over against the plaintiff\u2019s demand. The recovery is of the balance of such account, and of course is conclusive upon the existence and extent of the \u00a1plaintiff\u2019s demand.' When a plea of set-off is pleaded, the complaint becomes a defence to the defendant\u2019s plea; and if that defence fail from want of proof or otherwise, and judgment is rendered for the defendant, it is <em>res adjudicata </em>that the pleading by -which such defence is set up is not true, and that the cause of action therein alleged does not exist. (9 <em>Johns., </em>232 ; 12 <em>Ib., </em>347 ; 14 <em>Ib., </em>377 ; 13 <em>Ib., </em>187.) The statute prescribes the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ment to be rendered. (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>353, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22.) Thus the whole merits are involved, and the plaintiff\u2019s demand forms a constituent element of the judgment. It is only when a balance is found to be due from the plaintiff to the. defendant that judgment is to be rendered for him. As a matter of equity and justice, and of the public policy defined by the Code of Procedure, the defendants ought not to be twice vexed. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 149, 150, 258, 274 ; Cockle <em>a. </em>Underwood, 1 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>R. E. Mount, Jr., </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aob\">\u2014The judgment in the Superior Court, in favor of Cockle,' is no bar to this action; because Cockle never prosecuted his action, and there was no trial upon the merits. The defendants in said action, by reason of their answer, became virtually plaintiffs for their counterclaim, and were entitled to judgment for the same, without trial,\u2014no reply having been made, and the plaintiff having applied for a discontinuance. (Mason\u2019s Executors <em>a. </em>Alston, 5 <em>Seld., </em>28 ; Hadley <em>a. </em>Greene, 2 <em>Cr. &amp; Jer., </em>374 ; Seddon <em>a. </em>Tutop, 6 <em>T. R., </em>607 ; <em>Ravee a. </em>Farmer, 4 <em>Ib., </em>146 ; Davis <em>a. </em>Talcott, 14 <em>Barb., </em>611 ; Doty <em>a. </em>Brown, 4 <em>Comst., </em>71 ; Sweet <em>a. </em>Tuttle, 4 <em>Kern., </em>465.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-6\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">Whatever issues or questions in an action are adjudicated by a court, cannot again be the subjects of inquiry until the judgment is set aside by an appellate tribunal. Consequently such judgment can be set up as a bar to the same claim in another action. In the present case it appears, on the very face of the judgment, that the plaintiff\u2019s demand was not passed upon by the court. It states expressly that the plaintiff applied for a discontinuance, and, when refused, declined to give any evidence; and the court merely considered the counterclaim of the defendant, who, in fact, then became the actor in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We think the plaintiff had a right to maintain this action for the demand, which he declined to submit for adjudication in the former action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Present, Clerkk, P.
