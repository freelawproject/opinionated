It is true that in Moody <em>a. </em>Payne (2 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>548), a contrary doctrine was held; but at the time of this decision the rule at laxv did not permit the sheriff to deliver the whole partnership property to the purchaser at a- sale by him on an execution against-one partner, while the rule is now established that the sheriff may, on such an execution, seize the whole co-partnership property, sell the interest of the execution-debtor, and deliver the whole property to the purchaser. This might work irreparable injury to the right of the other partners. The rule in Moody <em>a. </em>Payne should not therefore be followed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-9\"><em>A. J.

Ch., </em>548 ; Phillips <em>a. </em>Cook, 24 <em>Wend., </em>389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In the case of Phillips <em>a. </em>Cook, although an action at law, the English authorities, upon which ours are founded, are carefully reviewed by Judge Cowen, and he comes to the conclusion that the remedy of the solvent partner, where he has been injured by such a levy, is to proceed in. equity against the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, for the purpose of ascertaining the interest which the purchaser has acquired, or which the debtor owned in the property at the time of the sale, and that the creditor has an absolute right to have the interest of his debtor in partnership property sold on execution, which neither a court of law or equity ought to restrain. (See, also, <em>Colnyer on Part., </em>4 Am. ed., \u00a7 831, note 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The purchaser acquires only the interest which the debtor has in the partnership property, after the payment of partnership liabilities, and the protection of the rights of the other partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In the present case there are no averments in the complaint to show that the debtor, in the execution, had not some interest in the property levied on after the satisfaction of partnership debts, and after deducting the interest of the plaintiff from the partnership estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">It is stated that the \u00abliabilities are $18,000, and that the plaintiff contributed $11,000 to the joiiit-st\u00f3ck'; but it is not stated what was the amount or value of the contribution of the debtor Lawrence, or what is the present value of the partnership estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">There are no means of determining, from these averments, that the debtor has not an interest which the creditor should be allowed to reach by a sale on his execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">If the debtor has an interest in the assets of the partnership over and above the claims of partnership creditors and of the plaintiff, there is no reason at law or in equity for interfering to stay the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\u25a0 The plaintiff should at least make it appear by his complaint that there was no such interest to be reached by levy or sale. <em>(Story on Part., </em>\u00a7 264.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Judgment for the defendant Kelly on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
