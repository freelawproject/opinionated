While he occupied it, the defendant cut a door into one of Eychen\u2019s rooms. He assigned his cause of action for the injury, to the plaintiff; and, being examined as a witness, was asked by the plaintiff, <em>\u201c </em>How much damage did you sustain in this operation of the work?\u201d The defendant objected in general terms, but was overruled. Judgment was rendered in'favor of the plaintiff for $40. The defendant appealed to the County Court, and from thence to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-11\"><em>J.

The question was a legal and proper question. (Morehouse <em>a. </em>Mathews, 2 <em>Comst., </em>514.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-13\">II. The objection must state the grounds of the objection, or it will be regarded as no objection at all. (Dunham <em>a. </em>Simmons, 3 <em>Hill, </em>609 ; Whiteside <em>a. </em>Jackson, 1 <em>Wend., </em>418 ; Potter <em>a. </em>Deyo, 19 <em>Ib., </em>361.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 Gould, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A61\">\u2014The evidence, as to amount of damages, was called out by this question, \u201c How much damage did you sustain in this operation of the work ?\u201d To this question the defendant interposed a general objection, specifying no ground therefor; and the witness answered, <em>\u201c </em>the damage for the two acts was $50.\u201d There is no point of view in which this testimony was admissible. It is a mere opinion; and the question calls for a mere opinion in gross. Ho facts were asked for; none were given. (2 <em>Comst., </em>514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The plaintiff claims that the objection was not specific, and therefore not good; citing 3 <em>Hill, </em>609. But that was a case where an untenable ground was assigned for the objection; and the case decides only that, having assigned a ground the party must be held to that; and if it was an insufficient ground, he should not be at liberty to take up a new one on the argument. But in a later case (5 <em>Hill, </em>603) precisely such a general objection was held good, in a case where it was manifest that the question must call for an opinion. It would seem a case j ust like the present, and fully sustains a reversal of the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Judgment of County Court and justice reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\"> Present, Gould, Hogeboom, and Peckham, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
