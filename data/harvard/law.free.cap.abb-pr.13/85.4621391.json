After .levy, defendant appealed to the general term, and gave an undertaking to procure a stay of proceedings on appeal, and served a copy of the same on the sheriff. Defendant\u2019s sureties were excepted to, and justified. Defendant then moved, at special term, to set aside the execution and the levy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-12\"><em>Owen, Gray &amp; Owen, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqZ\">contended that the execution of an undertaking, and the justification of sureties on appeal, stayed all proceedings under the execution, and that the levy by sheriff was superseded by the undertaking.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAv5\"><em>Shaffer &amp; Huff, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4EK\">\u2014I.

But the court has power, in the exercise of its discretion in its equitable control over its own judgments and process, to do both, if the ends of justice or the prevention of unnecessary or oppressive hardship requires it. And it should be done when there is no suggestion that the appeal is not taken in good faith, or that the security given on the appeal is not ample to secure to the defendant the amount of his recovery, if the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">On the payment, by the appellant, of the sheriff\u2019s fees on the execution herein already accrued, the levy may be discharged and the execution set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
