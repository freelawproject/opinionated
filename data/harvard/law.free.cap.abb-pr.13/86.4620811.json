A sham answer is false, and being put in merely for delay, will he stricken out under \u00a7 152 of Code. (See Danon <em>a. </em>Miller, 5 <em>How. Pr., </em>247.) A frivolous answer is one that states no legal defence. (Brown <em>a. </em>Jennings, 3 <em>Sandf., </em>732.) An answer setting up new matter or containing a material denial; may be stricken out though verified, if the court is satisfied that it is sham or false. (People <em>a. </em>McCumber, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>315.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">. II. 1. The first amended answer is false. 2. The defendant is estopped by the fact that the notes are given to a company by that name ; and the defendant admits giving the notes. The case is not altered by the plaintiffs being a foreign corporation. (Holyoke Bank <em>a. </em>Hoskins, 4 <em>Sandf., </em>675 ; <em>How. Code, </em>212.) 3. Plaintiffs, under defendant\u2019s answer, will not be required to prove the incorporation. (Shoe and Leather Bank <em>a. </em>Brown, 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>308.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-10\">ITT. The allegations in the answer, of an agreement to renew the notes, are clearly frivolous, as there wa's no consideration for any such agreement. (Miller <em>a. </em>Holbrook, 1 <em>Wend., </em>317 ; Pabodie <em>a. </em>King, 12 <em>Johns., </em>426 ; Fulton <em>a. </em>Mathews, 15 <em>Ib., </em>432.) And it could not be available unless in writing. (McCartee <em>a. </em>Stevens, 13 <em>Wend., </em>527 ; Payne <em>a. </em>Ladue, 1 <em>Hill, </em>6 ; Pratt <em>a. </em>Gulick, 13 <em>Barb., </em>297 ; Hull <em>a. </em>Smith, 8 <em>How. Pr., </em>149.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-11\">IV. In a suit against a corporation, it is not necessary to set out in the complaint, or refer to the act of incorporation, or mention any of its officers. (Accome <em>a. </em>American Mineral Co., 11 <em>How. Pr., </em>24 ; Bank of Waterville <em>a. </em>Beltser, 13 <em>Ib., </em>270 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Shoe &amp; Leather Bank <em>a. </em>Brown, <em>9 </em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr., 218 ; S. C., 18 <em>How. </em>Pr., 308 ; and see 3 Kern., 309.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-5\">A. C. M. Pennington, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad2\">\u2014I. The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs are a foreign corporation, and is defective in not reciting or referring to the act, nor stating the title or date of the act of incorporation. 1 It has never been, held under the Code, at general term in this court, nor in the Court of Appeals, that in the dase of a foreign corporation, the mere allegation that the plaintiffs are a corporation (such as is made in this case), is sufficient. The decisions in this court, at special term, have been at variance on this question. 2. It is fairly to be inferred from the provisions of the Revised Statutes (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>4 ed., 699, \u00a7 11), that in the case of a foreign corporation, the objection taken by the .demurrer is well founded. 3. And so, also, from \u00a7 163 of the Code. Indeed, from this section, it would seem to be imperative in the case of a foreign corporation to plead the act of incorporation by its title and the day of its passage. 4. It is no answer to this objection to say, that the defendant has admitted the existence of the corporation by dealing with them in their corporate name, and admitting in the answer that he made the notes to, and dealt with them in, that name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">II. The statement of the first cause of action is defective in three particulars. 1. In not alleging that the note was ever delivered by the defendant. The delivery of a note is absolutely essential to its maturity, for it has no inception till it is delivered. Mr. Justice Clerke is reported to have refused to-treat a demurrer as frivolous which interposed this objection. (A<em>bbotts' </em>Pleadings, 117, note <em>s.) </em>2. In not alleging any breach, as the non-payment of the note in whole or in part, nor that it is due from the defendant to the plaintiff. (Keteltas <em>a. </em>Myers, 1 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>403.) This is not a complaint under \u00a7 162 of the Code. 3. It appears, by the complaint, that the note was made payable to William Shove, in the character or by the description of agent, and that he has transferred and indorsed it, not in the character nor by the description of agent, but in his individual name and capacity, without showing his authority to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">III. The answer is not frivolous, for the following reasons: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>1. It takes issue on the fact of the existence of the corporation which is alleged by the complaint, a traversable fact, denying it on information and belief. 2. It takes issue also on the fact of the making of the note alleged as the second cause of action, also a traversable fact, denying it on the knowledge of the defendant. 3. The two remaining defences, that which relates to the circumstances under which the notes were given, and the credit on the account between the parties, in reference to which the notes were given, and that which relates to the amount due on the account between the parties (though they both set up new matter, and are not simply \"a negative of the allegations of the complaint), clearly set up good and valid defences. These matters are set up on the knowledge of the defendant, and cannot be said to be frivolous. There is nothing on the face of them suspicious, unusual, or extraordinary, in view of the relations of the parties to the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">IY. The answer is not sham or false in the sense of the Oode, so that the court may treat it as such on motion. 1. It is verified by the defendant himself, on his own knowledge. 2. A sham defence sets up new matter, specious and false: Such is not the case here. 3. The defence of the defendant as to the second cause of action is corroborated, and the affidavits produced by the plaintiffs are contradicted by the original complaint in this action, whereby the note alleged as the second cause of action, is described as a note materially different from that described in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">Y. In doubtful cases the court will not try issues of facts on affidavits, but will put the parties to a trial, and so in a conflicting case. (Munn <em>a. </em>Barnum, 12 <em>How. Pr., </em>363 ; Farmers <em>&amp; </em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>a. </em>Smith, 15 <em>Ib., </em>329.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> In the cases of The Shoe and Leather Bank <em>a. </em>Field and Camp <em>(Supreme Court First District; Special Term, </em>1861), the same rule was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The facts are stated in the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Mullin, J.\u2014The motions to strike out portions of the answers in these cases \u25a0 must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">The facts alleged by way of defence are, that when the notes were made, Stout, the president of the plaintiff, was indebted to Field in a large sum of money, and it was agreed by and between Field, Stout, and the bank, that Field should make \" his notes to be indorsed by Camp, and the bank would discount them, pass the notes to Field\u2019s credit, and Stout would pay them, or cause them to be paid. The plaintiff moves to strike out all except as to the payment by Stout.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">If Stout has paid the notes, the portion of the answer which alleges payment is all that is necessary to enable the defendants to make that defence available. The other matters would only be evidence, and not pleadable.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">If the defendant means to set up an agreement by the bank to accept Stout as its debtor, and that the defendant was by that agreement discharged from all lia- \u2022 bility on the papers, such an agreement is no defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">The defendant says the agreement was made at or about the time the note was given. If the bank, concurrently with the making and discount of the note, agreed that the defendant should not be liable upon it (for that is the proposition), the verbal agreement contradicts the writing, and is not available for that-reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">There is no consideration whatever alleged or shown, to support such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">For these and other reasons which might be given, I think the motion should be granted, with S10 costs in each case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-7\">Leonard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_W\">\u20141. The demurrer is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">2. The act of incorporation is not properly attested, and cannot be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u201cThe acts of the Legislature of the several States shall be authenticated by having the seal of their respective States affixed thereto.\u201d (2 <em>Laws of U. S., </em>102, \u00a7 1 ; <em>Cow. &amp; Hills' Notes, </em>note 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The affidavits of plaintiffs do, however, prove the existence of the corporation, and that it is engaged in business. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>fendants were called upon to show why the plaintiffs were not a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, not being contradicted, satisfactorily prove that every denial included in the second answer is false. The authority of The People <em>a. </em>McCumber (18 <em>N. </em>Y., 315), is sufficient for striking out those denials, under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The complaint, when amended, is the pleading which is before the court, and not the original one. A reference to the original complaint will not falsify the statements of the amended one, however inconsistent, unless there are some other circumstances to corroborate or show that the statements of the former pleading, which have been amended, were not the result .of mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The amendment of a pleading is an acknowledgment of the pleader that he has been mistaken. That is the <em>prima-facie </em>effect, and not that the party or the pleader has wilfully or knowingly made a false statement in the pleading so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The first and second answers are stricken out as false.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The third and fourth answers are frivolous, and-in respect to them, judgment is granted to the plaintiffs on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">There is no consideration for the agreements referred to as defences in the third and fourth answers, and they are inconsistent with the tenor of the notes mentioned in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Judgment is, therefore, rendered for the plaintiffs, as to the demurrer and the third and fourth answers, on account of the frivolousness thereof, and the first and second answers are stricken out as false: with $10 costs of this motion to the plaintiffs, and the costs of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
