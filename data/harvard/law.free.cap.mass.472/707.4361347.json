L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (b), and furnishing alcohol to a minor, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34. At trial, the defendant testified both that his sexual contact with the victim did not involve penetration and that it was consensual. To establish the element of penetration necessary to sustain a conviction of rape, the Commonwealth offered, in addition to the victim\u2019s testimony, results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing that purportedly identified the defendant\u2019s saliva on \u201cintimate\u201d swabs taken from the victim\u2019s vagina. To prove that the sexual contact was noncon-sensual, the Commonwealth offered, among other evidence, testimony concerning the victim\u2019s conduct shortly after the alleged rape occurred. The defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury in May, 2011, on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce, through the testimony of an expert witness who was not present when the victim\u2019s \u201crape kit\u201d examination was performed, evidence concerning how the various swabs that the expert tested were collected. The defendant further contends that the judge violated his right to a public trial by holding, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B (rape shield law), an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence relating to the victim\u2019s prior sexual contact with the individual to whom the victim first reported the alleged rape (first complaint witness). Finally, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s decision, also based on the rape shield law, to prohibit defense counsel from introducing evidence regarding the victim\u2019s prior sexual relationship with the first complaint witness, and challenges the jury instructions as inconsistent with a decision issued by this court after the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">We hold that the judge erred in permitting the expert to testify about how the various swabs she tested had been collected, and that the preserved error was prejudicial. We therefore vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. We further conclude that the judge erred in closing the rape shield hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>without conducting the four-prong analysis required for court room closures under <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984) <em>(Waller). </em>Because we are ordering a new trial based on the erroneously admitted expert testimony, we address only briefly the defendant\u2019s two remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence presented at trial, with particular focus on the evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal. We reserve certain substantive and procedural facts for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">On October 17, 2008, the victim, P.B.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then a high school senior, attended a party at the defendant\u2019s house in Gardner. Also in attendance were several other high school age friends of the victim: Rachel, Tim, and the defendant\u2019s son, Chris.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim and Rachel testified that, shortly after they arrived, they drank some beer, followed by \u201cnips,\u201d small containers of flavored alcoholic beverages. The group then played a game of \u201cstrip poker,\u201d although the victim testified that she only took off her sweatshirt and possibly her socks. The defendant provided marijuana, which everyone smoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The defendant then offered P.B. and Rachel shots of rum, which they accepted. He served the rum out of wine glasses. Both P.B. and Rachel testified that they saw some type of pink substance in the glasses before they drank.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">After drinking the rum, both the victim and Rachel became violently ill. Although the victim had consumed alcohol before, she testified that she had never felt as sick as she did that night. She vomited in the bathroom for approximately ten minutes, and then went limp. The other attendees picked the victim up from the bathroom floor and placed her on a couch in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. While she was being carried, her head struck the doorframe.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">When the victim awoke, she was lying naked on her stomach on the bed with the defendant behind her. She felt the defendant\u2019s fingers in her vagina; she then felt the defendant\u2019s penis in her vagina. When she turned over, he jumped out of the bed and announced that he had to go to the bathroom. After the victim put her clothes on, the defendant emerged from the bathroom wearing a robe. The victim said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The victim entered the living room and climbed onto the couch where Tim was sleeping, placing herself between the couch and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Tim\u2019s legs. Tim said, \u201cNah,\u201d pushed the victim away, and moved to another seat. At that point, the victim said, \u201c[Chris]\u2019s dad just fucked me,\u201d and began to cry. The victim then spent forty-five minutes to one hour making telephone calls and sending text messages, trying to contact someone to pick her up from the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m., the victim finally reached a school friend, Alexis. The victim left the defendant\u2019s house and went to a nearby twenty-four hour pharmacy. Alexis, in a vehicle driven by her mother, arrived to pick up the victim. They found her sitting on the curb outside the pharmacy, crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Alexis\u2019s mother urged the victim to go to the hospital. The victim initially declined. Instead, she went into Alexis\u2019s room, and the two talked for a while. Another school friend, Ellen, along with Ellen\u2019s boy friend, then came to get the victim and drove her to Ellen\u2019s house. There, the victim was picked up by her boy friend, Chad, and taken to her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">That afternoon, Chad took the victim to the hospital. They first went to a hospital in Fitchburg. From there, they were directed to a hospital in Leominster, where a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) performed a \u201crape kit\u201d examination on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">At trial, the defendant, testifying in his own defense, offered a different account of the events of the evening. According to the defendant\u2019s testimony, after the victim was laid on his bed (rather than on the couch in his bedroom, as other witnesses testified), the group continued drinking. The defendant then went into his room to watch television. He sat down on the bed next to the victim, who was sleeping and was still fully clothed. After the defendant watched television for fifteen or twenty minutes, the victim woke up. She rolled over and said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d The pair watched television together for about twenty minutes. The victim then invited the defendant to rub her back. He began rubbing her back, and then began touching her buttocks. The victim pressed her buttocks against the defendant\u2019s genitals, and removed her pants. The defendant licked his finger, reached around, and \u201ctouched her vagina.\u201d The defendant testified that he touched the \u201ctop part\u201d of her vagina, that the touch was very brief, that he \u201cfelt mostly hair,\u201d and that he did not feel either \u201cthe lips of her vagina\u201d or \u201ca wet part of her vagina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The defendant then announced that he had to go to the bathroom. When he returned from the bathroom, the victim was on the couch in the living room with Tim. The defendant testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that he believed that the victim was interested in having sex, and that he too wanted to have sex. He claimed, however, that he never penetrated her vagina, either with his penis or with his finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Commonwealth offered the testimony of two experts that contradicted the defendant\u2019s account. The first expert, a chemist at the State police crime laboratory, testified that she performed testing on three swabs purportedly collected from the victim during the \u201crape kit\u201d examination at the hospital in Leominster: a genital swab, which the expert testified was taken from \u201cthe outside of the genital area\u201d; a vaginal swab, which the expert described as \u201can intimate swab of the vagina\u201d; and a peri-anal swab, which the expert testified was taken \u201cfrom the outside of the anal area.\u201d The expert indicated that all of the swabs tested negative for semen agellin. The vaginal and genital swabs, however, tested positive for human alpha-amylase, commonly known as saliva.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The second expert was also a chemist at the State police crime laboratory. She testified that she performed DNA analysis on the saliva recovered from the vaginal and genital swabs. She indicated that the DNA profile obtained from the vaginal swab matched a DNA sample acquired from the defendant. She testified that, based on currently available databases, the DNA profile obtained was \u201cnot expected to occur more frequently than 1 in 1,065 Caucasian males, 1 in 936 African-American males, 1 in 561 Hispanic males, and 1 in 198 Asian males.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">After the defendant\u2019s convictions on both indictments, he moved for a new trial on the basis of the court room closure during the rape shield hearing. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant appealed from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Confrontation clause and common-law evidentiary rules. </em>The Commonwealth did not offer at trial the testimony of the nurse at the hospital in Leominster who conducted the \u201crape kit\u201d examination. Instead, the judge permitted the Commonwealth\u2019s first expert witness, who was not present during the examination and had no apparent connection to the hospital at which the swabs were taken, to testify to her \u201cunderstanding\u201d of how the three swabs had been collected. That understanding was apparently based, in part, on information the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>expert learned from the \u201cevidence collection inventory list\u201d purportedly completed by the nurse who conducted the \u201crape kit\u201d examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The defendant objected to the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony \u201cidentifying] what swab came from where.\u201d Defense counsel argued that it was \u201cimproper\u201d for the first expert \u201cto testify to facts for which [she] [was not] present,\u201d that defense counsel had \u201cno ability to cross examine\u201d the expert as to \u201chow that swab was taken, or whether it was taken with the correct procedure,\u201d and that the admission of the testimony would violate the defendant\u2019s right to be confronted with witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In response, the prosecutor did not assert that the nurse was unavailable to testify. Indeed, she indicated that the defense had the nurse on the witness list. She further indicated that she would request a continuance to secure the nurse\u2019s presence if the judge deemed the nurse\u2019s testimony necessary, but urged the judge to reject the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause argument. The judge overruled the defendant\u2019s objections and allowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The Sixth Amendment provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights similarly protects a criminal defendant\u2019s right \u201cto meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d Although art. 12 \u201chas been interpreted to provide a criminal defendant more protection than the Sixth Amendment in certain respects,... when the question involves the relationship between the hearsay rule and its exceptions, on the one hand, and the right to confrontation, on the other hand, the protection provided by art. 12 is coextensive with the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment\u201d (citation and quotation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 388 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004) <em>(Crawford), </em>the United States Supreme Court swept aside its prior approach to the confrontation clause, under which the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant did not violate the confrontation clause so long as the statements \u201cf[ell] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or showed \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980). See <em>id. </em>at 65 n.7. Instead, the Court held in <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 68, that, \u201c[wjhere testimonial evidence is at issue, ... the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Although the hearsay evidence at issue in <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 38-42, involved statements to police officers, the rule articulated in the case called into question the admissibility at criminal trials of the results of scientific or forensic testing. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221 (2012); <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011); <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305 (2009). During the <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>era of confrontation clause jurisprudence, such results had been admitted routinely, even without the opportunity to cross-examine the analyst who actually conducted the testing, on the theory that the results showed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Crawford </em>eliminated that rationale, potentially suggesting that any person who played a role in the forensic or scientific testing of evidence must be called to testify before the prosecution may present expert opinion testimony regarding the evidence. See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 332 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">This court responded to the difficulty posed by forensic or scientific opinion testimony in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. 580, 593, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 166 (2013) (Greineder). There we held that, under our common-law evidentiary rules, \u201c[ejxpert opinion testimony, even if based on facts and data not in evidence, does not violate the right of confrontation,\u201d provided that the facts and data \u201care independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion\u201d (citation omitted), and that two further conditions are met. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 584. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 527-528 (1986). First, the expert must \u201cnot present on direct examination the specific information on which he or she relied\u201d; second, the expert witness must have the capacity to \u201cbe meaningfully cross-examined about the reliability of the underlying data.\u201d <em>Greineder, supra </em>at 583, 595. We characterized this evidentiary rule as \u201cmore protective . . . than the [United States] Supreme Court would require,\u201d and observed that, by fashioning such a rule, we \u201cnecessarily satisfy the mandates of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Our common-law evidentiary rules, therefore, afford the defendant a choice. If the defendant challenges the reliability of the expert\u2019s underlying data on cross-examination, then \u201cbasis evidence that is hearsay may become available to the jury to evaluate a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600. By contrast, \u201c[i]f a defendant does not open the door on cross-examination to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>hearsay basis of an expert\u2019s opinion, then the jury may properly accord less weight to the expert\u2019s opinion\u201d due to the absence of any testimony providing the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Our common-law evidentiary rules decisively resolve this case. In labeling the various swabs and completing the \u201crape kit\u201d \u201cinventory list,\u201d the nurse essentially made a series of factual statements concerning how the various swabs were collected. The purpose of a \u201crape kit\u201d is to gather forensic evidence for use in a criminal prosecution. See What Is a Rape Kit?, Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, https://rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-recovery/rape-kit [http://perma.cc/R7AN-NJM5]. Therefore, these statements were plainly testimonial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 394 (2008) (evidence is testimonial where \u201ca reasonable person in [the speaker\u2019s] position would anticipate his [findings and conclusions] being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>135 S. Ct. 2173, 2181 (2015) (rejecting confrontation clause claim where hearsay statements at issue \u201cclearly were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence for [the defendant\u2019s] prosecution\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006) (statements to police officers are \u201ctestimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no . . . ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d). And because the Commonwealth\u2019s first expert then recited these testimonial statements to the jury, they also were plainly hearsay. Although the prosecutor suggested at trial that the first expert\u2019s recitation was permissible because the expert merely was \u201ciden-tif[ying] ... the hearsay material on which . . . she relied,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizanowicz, </em>459 Mass. 400, 411 (2011), the expert obviously was \u201ctestifying to, and asserting the truth of, [the] statements recorded by\u201d the nurse. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 392. Indeed, the very relevancy of both experts\u2019 testimony was dependent upon the jury accepting the nurse\u2019s assertions about how and from where the various swabs had been collected, relayed through the first expert, for the truth of the matter asserted. Without the nurse\u2019s statements linking the swabs to the examination performed on the victim, the Commonwealth merely would have presented two experts who performed various tests on three swabs \u2014 origin unknown \u2014 and identified on two of them saliva containing DNA that matched the defendant\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Because the challenged parts of the first expert\u2019s testimony constituted testimonial hearsay, their admission was permissible only if it complied with the rule articulated in <em>Greineder. </em>It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">First, the <em>Greineder </em>rule only allows an expert, on cross-examination, to present the specific underlying facts, derived from hearsay statements, on which the expert relied. The challenged testimony at issue here, however, came in on direct examination. Indeed, the expert\u2019s statements concerning how the various swabs had been collected were made near the beginning of her testimony, because the import of the test results that she later described hinged on those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Second, the <em>Greineder </em>rule demands that \u201cthe expert witness ... can be meaningfully cross-examined about the reliability of the underlying data.\u201d <em>Greineder, supra </em>at 595. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tassone, </em>468 Mass. 391, 392 (2014) <em>(Tassone); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 790-791 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011). <em>Greineder </em>responded to a recurrent situation involving forensic and scientific evidence whereby the testifying analyst, in formulating her expert opinion, draws upon testing conducted and results reached by other analysts, who do not testify. See <em>Greineder, supra </em>at 582. We held that such testimony is permissible provided that the testifying analyst \u201creviewed the nontestifying analyst\u2019s work, . . . conducted an independent evaluation of the data,\u201d and \u201cthen expressed her own opinion, and did not merely act as a conduit for the opinions of others\u201d (quotation and citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">This case presents a significantly different scenario from that involved in <em>Greineder </em>or in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s confrontation clause decisions involving forensic or scientific testimony. The case does not involve a situation where a testifying analyst reviewed and then built on the findings of a non-testifying analyst in reaching his or her expert opinion. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. at 527-528. Instead, the hearsay testimony at issue here involved the circumstances under which the evidence that the testifying expert tested was collected in the first place. For the Commonwealth\u2019s expert to testify to how the swabs were collected from the victim would be akin to allowing a chemist to testify to the chemist\u2019s \u201cunderstanding,\u201d based on information relayed to the chemist in a report drafted by nontestifying police officers, that a substance later determined to be cocaine had been found in the defendant\u2019s trouser pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Furthermore, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert did not \u201creview\u201d or make an \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d of the nurse\u2019s representations indicating that a given swab was collected from a particular part of the victim\u2019s body. Having no personal knowledge of the process by which the swabs were collected, the expert lacked any capacity to do so. Under these circumstances, the expert could not be \u201cmeaningfully cross-examined about the reliability\u201d of the nurse\u2019s representations concerning the origins of the swabs. <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The expert also lacked any capacity to address the chain of custody and evidence-handling protocols relevant to the process by which the swabs were collected. See <em>Tassone, </em>468 Mass. at 401. In <em>Tassone, supra </em>at 394, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert purportedly had conducted an \u201cindependent review\u201d of a DNA profile generated by a nontestifying analyst from a swab taken from eyeglasses found at the scene of a crime, before concluding that that profile matched the defendant\u2019s DNA profile. We nevertheless held that, because the testifying expert was \u201ca chemist at the State police laboratory,\u201d while the DNA profile had been generated by Cellmark, an outside laboratory, the defendant was deprived of a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert as to the reliability of the underlying facts or data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 401. The expert, we observed, \u201cwas not in a position to confirm that the DNA profile was from the eyeglasses swab; she knew only that Cellmark said that it was.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Here, similarly, the expert, by her own account, had \u201cno idea how [the swabs] were collected.\u201d Consequently, the defendant was deprived of any opportunity to question the expert about the protocols in place to ensure that the swabs were properly collected and labeled. Simply put, the expert took it as given that the swabs were collected as the nurse said they were, and then relayed these statements to the jury. Where the only answer that the expert can give to questions concerning the chain of custody and evidence-handling protocols is \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d a defendant has been deprived of the opportunity for meaningful cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We have observed that a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine an expert witness regarding chain of custody and evidence-handling protocols is especially crucial in relation to DNA evidence. \u201c[W]ith DNA analysis, the testing techniques are so reliable and the science so sound that fraud and errors in labeling or handling may be the only reasons why an opinion is flawed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 790. By introducing the critical facts concerning how the swabs were collected from the victim through the testimony of an expert witness who played no role in the collection process whatsoever, therefore, the Commonwealth sidestepped the one aspect of the forensic evidence presented in this case that was likely most \u201cmeet for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705, 2714 (2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Because defense counsel objected to the first expert\u2019s testimony, we must determine \u201cwhether the error was nonprejudicial, that is whether the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u201d (quotation and citation omitted). <em>Tassone, </em>468 Mass. at 403. We conclude that the error was prejudicial. The defendant testified that he licked his finger and touched the outside of the victim\u2019s vagina, but did not penetrate her or come into contact with her vulva or labia, as required for a conviction of rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donlan, </em>436 Mass. 329, 336 (2002). The victim, by contrast, testified that the defendant penetrated her vagina with his finger and penis. Because the expert testified that the defendant\u2019s saliva was found on \u201can intimate swab\u201d taken from the victim\u2019s vagina, the expert\u2019s testimony supported the victim\u2019s account and undermined the defendant\u2019s account on a key aspect of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>testimony reflected an effort \u201cto come up with an explanation that\u2019s short of penetration to get the saliva there,\u201d and attacked that explanation as inconsistent with the DNA test results, asking, \u201c[I]f he just touched her, then how did the saliva get inside her vagina?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Had the nurse or some other individual with knowledge of the process by which the swabs were collected testified, a skillful defense attorney could have asked questions aimed at challenging the integrity of the evidence-gathering process. Defense counsel might have questioned, for instance, whether the purportedly \u201cintimate\u201d swab taken from within the victim\u2019s vagina could have come into contact with the \u201cexternal\u201d genital swab, thereby creating the false impression that the defendant\u2019s saliva was contained within the victim\u2019s vagina. In responding to such questions, the nurse or other individual would have made \u201crepresentations . . . relating to past events and human actions\u201d that are \u201cnot revealed in raw, machine-produced data.\u201d See <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New </em>Mexico, 131 S. Ct. at 2714. Such questioning has prompted expert witnesses to realize that they had made labeling or handling errors, thereby preventing convictions based on incorrect or misleading DNA test results. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221, 2264 (2012) (Kagan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Of course, faced with these questions, the nurse or other individual might have provided answers that convinced the jury of the reliability and integrity of the evidence-collection process. But that is precisely why our evidentiary rules demand an opportunity meaningfully to cross-examine the expert regarding chain of custody and evidence-handling protocols. By requiring that opportunity, our common-law evidentiary rules, like the confrontation clause itself, \u201ccommand[ ] . . . that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d See <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61. Because the process by which the swabs were collected was crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and because, as a result of the trial judge\u2019s error, the defendant was deprived of the opportunity for cross-exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>nation regarding that process, we conclude that the error was prejudicial and requires a new trial. See <em>Tassone, </em>468 Mass. at 402-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Finally, we do not agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the defendant waived his confrontation clause claim by agreeing to the admission of the unredacted inventory list from the defendant\u2019s \u201crape kit\u201d examination. It is true that, before the expert testified, the judge allowed the victim\u2019s medical records to be marked as exhibits, and these records included the inventory list purportedly completed by the nurse who examined the victim. At that time, however, defense counsel observed that the medical records had \u201cto be redacted significantly.\u201d The Commonwealth agreed that \u201cthere are redactions,\u201d and indicated that \u201cthey won\u2019t go to the jury until counsel and I have agreed on the redactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Later, when the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified, defense counsel made clear that she believed that it would violate the confrontation clause for the expert to testify to facts that were based in part on information learned from the inventory list. Defense counsel stated that, \u201cif [the prosecutor] wanted to put on a case which wouldn\u2019t raise questions about confrontation, she would have put on the SANE [i.e., the nurse] ... as her witness. She didn\u2019t.\u201d Defense counsel further objected that \u201c[t]he only way it\u2019s coming in is through this expert.\u201d The judge acknowledged that \u201cthere could be testimony from the person who did the swabbing that T took this swab from the defendant and the vaginal area of the complaining witness,\u2019 \u201d but rejected defense counsel\u2019s confrontation clause argument. The judge noted defense counsel\u2019s continuing objection to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Defense counsel later apparently agreed to the admission of the medical records, including the inventory list. Counsel\u2019s apparent agreement to allow the inventory list to be presented to the jury, however, occurred long after the expert had already testified \u2014 over defense counsel\u2019s strenuous objection \u2014 to her \u201cunderstanding\u201d regarding how the swabs had been collected. While the better practice would have been for defense counsel to renew her objection to the information concerning the collection of the swabs, we do not regard the subsequent admission of the unredacted inventory list as a retroactive waiver of the objection that defense counsel clearly voiced earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The inventory list, moreover, did not include the actual content regarding how the swabs were collected. The list, for instance, simply indicates \u201cVaginal Swabs and Smear\u201d with a check mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>next to it, without describing the swab as an \u201cintimate swab of the vagina.\u201d By testifying to her \u201cunderstanding\u201d concerning how the swabs were collected, therefore, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified to underlying facts of which she had no personal knowledge, and that went beyond the facts later admitted in evidence via the inventory list. For both of these reasons, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">b. <em>Public trial right. </em>At trial, the defendant sought to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual relationship with Tim, the first complaint witness. Defense counsel argued that this prior sexual relationship was \u201cdirectly related to [the victim\u2019s] motivation to lie.\u201d Defense counsel contended that the victim\u2019s conduct, in climbing onto the couch where Tim was sleeping, constituted a sexual advance. Tim\u2019s apparent rejection of that sexual advance, defense counsel claimed, gave the victim an incentive to fabricate her rape allegation against the defendant. The Commonwealth countered that the proposed testimony was inadmissible under the rape shield law.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The judge held an evidentiary hearing on the proposed testimony. Before the hearing began, the prosecutor asked that the court room be closed, contending that the rape shield statute required that the hearing \u201cbe done in camera.\u201d The judge agreed, and \u201cask[ed] the court officers, for the purposes of this rape shield hearing, to make sure that no member of the public comes in for a short period of time.\u201d Defense counsel requested \u201cthat Mr. Jones\u2019s family be allowed to be with him during this stage of the trial.\u201d The judge asked, \u201cThey would be members of the public, no?\u201d Defense counsel argued that, as \u201cwith any trial proceeding, [the defendant] should have the right to have the support of his family there.\u201d The parties then disputed the purpose of the rape shield statute, with the defendant contending that its purpose is to guard against evidence introduced for the \u201cimproper purpose\u201d of arguing that the victim\u2019s lack of chastity established consent, rather than for the more general purpose of \u201cprotecting the privacy of the alleged victim.\u201d The judge, after noting that the statute specifically provides for an \u201cin camera hearing,\u201d denied the defendant\u2019s request and closed the court room.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Following his conviction, the defendant moved for a new trial on the basis of the court room closure during the rape shield hearing. In support of his motion, the defendant submitted affidavits from various individuals who indicated that they were excluded from the court room during the hearing. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>wealth stipulated that potential observers were excluded from the hearing, and did not argue that the public trial issue was unpreserved. The motion judge denied the motion, concluding that the court room was closed properly during the rape shield hearing in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, the rape shield law.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The rape shield law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cEvidence of the reputation of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct shall not be admissible in an investigation or proceeding before a grand jury or a court of the commonwealth for a violation of [certain sexual offense statutes]. Evidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct in such an investigation or proceeding shall not be admissible except evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim; provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing on a written motion for admission of same and an offer of proof. If, after said hearing, the court finds that the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim, the evidence shall be admitted; otherwise not. If the proceeding is a trial with jury, said hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. The finding of the court shall be in writing and filed but shall not be made available to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. In addition to the express exceptions to inadmissibility articulated in the statute, this court has determined \u201cthat other exceptions may arise under the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mountry, </em>463 Mass. 80, 86 (2012). One of these exceptions applies where evidence that otherwise would be barred by the statute \u201cis relevant to the question of a victim\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention \u201cthat G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B[,] allows for public attendance at its required \u2018in camera hearing,\u2019 \u201d and concluded that this mandatory closure rule was permissible. We agree with the motion judge that the requirement of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, for \u201can in camera hearing\u201d indicates that the court room must be closed during the proceeding. The term \u201cin camera\u201d derives from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the Latin meaning \u201cin a chamber,\u201d and may denote a proceeding taken either \u201c[i]n the judge\u2019s private chambers\u201d or \u201c[i]n the court room with all spectators excluded.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 878 (10th ed. 2010). Under either definition, therefore, an \u201cin camera hearing\u201d denotes one from which the public is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">While we agree with the motion judge that the statute provides for mandatory closure of the rape shield hearing, we conclude that the mandatory closure rule is impermissible. In reaching that conclusion, we emphasize at the outset that we do not question the compelling interest underlying the rape shield statute. That statute, like similar statutes in other States, was enacted in response to the pervasive practice of attacking a victim\u2019s testimony that she did not consent to sex with evidence of the victim\u2019s \u201clack of chastity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 227-228, 231 (1981) (\u201cThe major innovative thrust of the rape-shield statute is found in the first sentence, which reverses the common law rule under which evidence of the complainant\u2019s general reputation for unchastity was admissible\u201d). See Berger, Man\u2019s Trial, Woman\u2019s Tribulation: Rape Cases in the Courtroom, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 17 (1977) (Berger). And although \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the statute is to prevent a general credibility attack of a victim with evidence of his or her promiscuity,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mountry, </em>463 Mass. at 86, the statute\u2019s requirement for an \u201cin camera hearing\u201d on the admissibility of evidence of sexual conduct reflects a legitimate interest in guarding against the public \u201crevelation of facts that can only smear\u201d a rape victim, and in \u201cprotecting complainants and encouraging victim cooperation in bringing suspected assailants to trial.\u201d See Berger, <em>supra </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We also stress the narrowness of our holding: we do not determine that this particular rape shield hearing should have been open to the public, much less that all rape shield hearings must be open to the public. Instead, we merely conclude that, before a judge may order the court room closed for a rape shield hearing, the judge must make a case-by-case determination in accordance with the four-prong framework articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48, decided after the enactment of the rape shield law at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The Sixth Amendment, which applies in State court proceedings, guarantees to the accused \u201cin all criminal proceedings . . . the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d See <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 267 (1948). The closing of a criminal proceeding to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>public also may implicate rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 106 (2010). \u201c[T]he explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused,\u201d however, \u201cis no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.\u201d <em>Waller, supra </em>at 46. Because the public trial right is constitutionally based, in reviewing an asserted violation of the right, the court \u201cexercise[s] its own judgment on the ultimate factual as well as legal conclusions\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Sixth Amendment right to a public trial \u201ccovers the entire trial, including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict\u201d (footnote omitted). 6 W.R. LaFave, J.H. Israel, N.J. King, &amp; O.S. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 24.1(a) (3d ed. 2007). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sorrentino, </em>175 F.2d 721, 722 (3d Cir. 1949). Even where the public trial right attaches to a given proceeding, however, the right is \u201cnot absolute.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court for the County of Norfolk, </em>457 U.S. 596, 606 (1982) <em>(Globe Newspaper Co.). </em>A court room closure may be permissible, provided the party seeking the closure satisfies the four-part test articulated in <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48: \u201c[1] the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced; [2] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest; [3] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding; and [4] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has articulated a clear test for determining the threshold question whether a given proceeding constitutes part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for purposes of the public trial right. In <em>Waller, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that the public trial right attaches to a pretrial suppression hearing. In reaching that conclusion, the Court identified several values that the public trial right serves. <em>Id. </em>at 46-47. Various United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have enumerated these values, and turned to them to determine whether the public trial right attaches to a given proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">These courts have determined that the public trial right attaches to a given proceeding where recognition of the right would serve \u201c1) to ensure a fair trial; 2) to remind the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions; 3) to encourage witnesses to come forward; and 4) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>discourage perjury.\u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>85 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir. 1996). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>682 F.3d 1223, 1229 (9th Cir. 2012); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>479 F.3d 885, 890-891 (D.C. Cir. 2007); <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>227 F.3d 908, 918-919 (7th Cir. 2000). Based on these factors, these courts have found violations of the public trial right where the court room was closed \u201cduring [a] hearing\u201d at which \u201cmatters of vital importance were discussed and decided.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 1232 (finding violation of public trial right where defendant\u2019s family members were excluded from sentencing proceedings). By contrast, courts have rejected Sixth Amendment challenges based on court room closures during \u201croutine jury administrative matters,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ivester, </em>316 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding no violation of public trial right where judge closed court room to address jurors\u2019 concerns about their safety), or where the closure was \u201cso trivial as not to implicate the right to a public trial.\u201d <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>421 F.3d 83, 92 (2d Cir. 2005) (no violation of public trial right where judge excluded defendant\u2019s ex-mother-in-law from court room during testimony of single witness). See <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Powell, supra </em>at 919 (no violation where judge excluded former member of venire from trial); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 41 (no violation where judge inadvertently closed court room during defendant\u2019s testimony, which lasted approximately fifteen to twenty minutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">A rape shield hearing is neither a routine administrative matter nor \u201ctrivial\u201d to the trial. On the contrary, a rape shield hearing has a far closer kinship to pretrial suppression hearings, to which the United States Supreme Court decided in <em>Waller </em>that the Sixth Amendment public trial right attaches, than to any of the routine administrative matters that courts have subsequently determined may be conducted in a closed court room. Like a pretrial suppression hearing, the determination emerging from a rape shield hearing often will have a critical impact on the trial itself, particularly in cases that hinge on the issue of consent. Additionally, the admissibility of evidence otherwise barred under the rape shield law hinges on a showing that the evidence fits into one of the exceptions to the statute, and that its \u201cweight and relevancy ... is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. The outcome of a rape shield hearing, then, like that of a pretrial suppression hearing, \u201cfrequently depends on a resolution of factual matters.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Citing a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vazquez-Botet, </em>532 F.3d 37, 51-52 (1st Cir. 2008), the Commonwealth contends that the rape shield hearing is \u201cmore akin to \u2018question-and-answer\u2019 offer of proof hearings . . . than to potentially dispositive suppression hearings to which the public trial right applies.\u201d In that decision, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit expressly \u201cle[ft] open the possibility that the public-trial right may apply to some offer-of-proof hearings,\u201d only \u201cdeclin[ing] to recognize such a right on facts as uncompelling as these.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. In concluding that the public trial right did not attach to the particular offer of proof hearing at issue in that case, moreover, the court emphasized that the hearing \u201cdiffered in at least two fundamental respects from the categories of non-trial hearings to which the Sixth Amendment public-trial right has been held to apply in the past.... First, the evidence elicited at the hearing had already ... been ruled irrelevant. . . . Second, the district court was under no obligation to hold the hearing in the first place, but chose to do so for our and the defendants\u2019 benefit. . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Here, by contrast, the judge did not hold the rape shield hearing solely \u201cin order to create a record\u201d of a relevancy decision that it had already made for appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 45. On the contrary, it was only after the rape shield hearing, and on the basis of the testimony presented and the arguments offered by the attorneys at that hearing, that the judge here made his decision regarding the admissibility of the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct. Furthermore, the judge had no choice whether to hold the hearing. Rather, the judge was obligated, under the rape shield statute, to hold the hearing before reaching a decision on the admissibility of evidence purportedly barred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In determining that the public trial right attaches to a rape shield hearing, we acknowledge that courts of other States have reached differing conclusions. On the one hand, the Connecticut Supreme Court has held that a trial judge erred in justifying the closure of the court room for a rape shield hearing on the basis of a \u201cgeneral reference to the rape shield statute,\u201d as also occurred here. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 374 (1988). Instead, the court held that, before closing the court room, the trial judge should have made the case-specific \u201cfindings as required by Waller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>950 F. Supp. 461, 468 (D. Conn. 1996) (on collateral challenge to defendant\u2019s conviction, \u201cconcur[ring] with the [Connecticut] Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>court improperly closed the courtroom at the petitioner\u2019s trial in that the trial court failed to make any findings adequate to support the closure,\u201d but rejecting Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s requirement that petitioner prove prejudice to obtain relief for Sixth Amendment violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">On the other hand, courts in Oregon and North Carolina have rejected public trial challenges to statutes mandating the closure of court rooms during rape shield hearings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeil, 99 </em>N.C. App. 235, 242 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>MacBale, </em>353 Or. 789, 813-815 (2013); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>53 Or. App. 906, 909-920 (1981). The crux of the reasoning in these decisions is that, because a \u201crape shield\u201d hearing \u201cis a preliminary one and is conducted only to exclude from the trial that which is irrelevant to the proceeding,\u201d and because \u201c[ujnder the rules of evidence, that which is irrelevant should not be heard at all,\u201d the closure of the court room for the hearing does not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, supra </em>at 919. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>MacBale, supra </em>at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We are not persuaded by the analysis in these decisions. First, evidence barred under the rape shield statute does not necessarily fail to meet the \u201cminimal standard\u201d of \u201c[rjelevancy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>53 Or. App. at 919. On the contrary, Massachusetts\u2019s rape shield statute precludes the admission of evidence concerning a victim\u2019s past sexual conduct unless the evidence fits within the exceptions to the statute <em>and </em>the judge finds \u201cthat the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. The statute, then, contemplates situations in which evidence is relevant, but its relevance is outweighed by its prejudicial effect to the victim. Second, the rape shield hearing may result in a finding that the weight and relevancy of the evidence does outweigh its prejudicial effect, and that the evidence consequently may be presented at trial. In <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 43, the United States Supreme Court observed that, following the petitioners\u2019 trial, \u201cthe transcript of the suppression hearing was released to the public,\u201d yet the public release of the transcript had no impact on the Court\u2019s determination that the closure of the court room during the hearing violated the petitioners\u2019 right to a public trial. Similarly, the fact that a defendant \u201cwill ultimately have the use of all . . . evidence\u201d deemed relevant at the rape shield hearing has no bearing on the constitutionality of the court room closure during the hearing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>53 Or. App. at 919. The subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>presentation of certain evidence at trial cannot \u201ccure\u201d the problem resulting from the mandatory closure rule any more than the subsequent release of a pretrial suppression hearing transcript could \u201ccure\u201d the closure of the hearing. The notion that the ultimate presentation of evidence at trial somehow may retroactively remedy the closure of the hearing is particularly misguided because it was the improperly closed hearing itself that determined the scope of the evidence that could be presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Finally, we discern no support for the assumption that the public trial right attaches only to proceedings at which relevant evidence is presented. On the contrary, the United States Supreme Court has made clear that the public right \u201cextends beyond the actual proof at trial.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 44. The right, for instance, encompasses the pretrial jury selection process, <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>558 U.S. 209, 213 (2010); opening statements by counsel, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patry, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474 (2000); instructions to the jury, <em>id.; </em>the return of the verdict, <em>id.; </em>and posttrial sentencing proceedings, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>682 F.3d at 1228. At none of these proceedings is relevant evidence presented, yet the public trial right attaches to all of them because of the values that the right serves. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe right of access to criminal trials plays a particularly significant role in the functioning of the judicial process and the government as a whole. . . . [I]n the broadest terms, public access to criminal trials permits the public to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process \u2014 an essential component in our structure of self-government.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>457 U.S. at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Courts that have determined that the public trial right does not attach to a rape shield proceeding have further observed that \u201ca rape victim who is examined about the details of her personal sexual background may be less likely to be forthcoming if forced to discuss the matter in open court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>MacBale, </em>353 Or. at 814. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>53 Or. App. at 920. That analysis confuses the threshold inquiry into whether the public trial right attaches to a rape shield hearing at all with the ultimate validity of a decision to close the court room during the hearing. The \u201cpublic trial guarantee\u201d is \u201cone created for the benefit of the defendant,\u201d <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>DePasquale, </em>443 U.S. 368, 380 (1979); it is built on the premise that \u201c[t]he knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>power.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 270 (1948). In light of the important role that the public trial guarantee provides in protecting the rights of criminal defendants, we decline to conclude that a crucial hearing, whose outcome has a significant impact on a prosecution, falls outside the public trial right altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">That conclusion does not mean, however, that we cannot consider other interests, including the interest in guarding against \u201charassment and further humiliation of the victim\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Joyce, 382 Mass. at 228. As noted, the public trial right is not absolute, but may give way in the face of \u201can overriding interest.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. Accordingly, the judge is free to consider, among other things, the complainant\u2019s privacy interests and the potential impact that the public disclosure of intimate details concerning a rape victim\u2019s sexual history may have on a complainant\u2019s willingness to come forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Indeed, this court and others have upheld court room closures in a variety of contexts where trial judges complied with these constitutional requirements. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>459 Mass. 271, 283-284 (2011), for instance, we concluded that the trial judge, after making the findings required by <em>Waller, </em>properly excluded from the court room spectators who threatened a court officer with bodily harm. Other courts have concluded that a trial judge, again after making the findings required by <em>Waller, </em>properly closed the court room during an undercover police officer\u2019s testimony during a drug trial. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kuhlmann, </em>142 F.3d 529,537-539 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>96 N.Y.2d 213, 220 (2001). Similarly, this court has found that, generally, \u201cthe judge\u2019s verification of the validity of\u2019 an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination must \u201cbe based on information provided in open court.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 827, 833 (2009). A judge may hold an in camera hearing (called a <em>\u201cMartin </em>hearing,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496 [1996]) on the validity of an assertion of the right against self-incrimination only after holding an open hearing at which the parties are \u201cinvite[d] ... to provide the court with information that may shed light on whether the witness\u2019s testimony . . . could possibly tend to incriminate him.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>\u201cOnly in those rare circumstances where this information is inadequate to allow the judge to make an informed determination should the judge conduct an in camera <em>Martin </em>hearing with the witness to verify the claim of privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201ca <em>Martin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>hearing should be conducted only as an exception to the general rule that the judge\u2019s verification of the validity of the privilege be based on information provided in open court\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 295-296 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Our conclusion that the public trial right attaches to rape shield hearings, therefore, does not mean that such hearings must be open to the public. It does not contemplate a major change in the practice of court room closures during rape shield hearings; the State\u2019s overriding interest in protecting the privacy rights of rape victims and the absence of any other more narrowly tailored means of accommodating that interest may well mean that the majority of rape shield proceedings properly are closed. Our conclusion simply means that, in view of the importance of the public trial right, before the court room properly may be closed during a rape shield procedure, the trial judge must conduct an individualized analysis consistent with the constitutional requirements set forth in <em>Waller, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>457 U.S. at 598, is instructive. That case concerned a statute that required the closure of a court room during the testimony of child victims of sexual assault. The Commonwealth contended that the statute sought to protect \u201cminor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. The Court agreed that the Commonwealth\u2019s asserted interest was \u201ca compelling one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded, however, that, \u201cas compelling as that interest is, it does not justify a <em>mandatory </em>closure rule,\u201d noting that \u201c[a] trial court can determine on a case-by-case basis whether closure is necessary to protect the welfare of a minor victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607-608. The Court further concluded that, because the statute \u201crequires closure even if the victim does not seek the exclusion of the press and general public,\u201d and because the statute did not take into account whether \u201cthe names of the minor victims were already in the public record\u201d or whether the victims would \u201chave been willing to testify despite the presence of the press,\u201d the statute could not \u201cbe viewed as a narrowly tailored means of accommodating the State\u2019s asserted interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608-609. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 16D <em>(b) </em>(1) (requiring judicial determination before child witness\u2019s testimony may be offered in closed court room).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The same reasoning applies to the rape shield law. The public undoubtedly does have a compelling interest in protecting the privacy rights of rape victims and guarding against retrauma-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tization through the public disclosure of intimate details regarding their past sexual conduct. Like the similarly compelling interest in protecting minor victims of sexual abuse, however, the interest in protecting rape victims does not require a mandatory closure rule, which commands that the proceeding be conducted in camera regardless of the wishes of the victim or any other factors that might argue against closure. In sum, the mandatory closure rule cannot be regarded as narrowly tailored to the State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting rape victims against retraumatization and smear tactics, because that interest could be served equally well by a case-by-case assessment, in accordance with the constitutional framework articulated in <em>Waller. </em>On remand for a new trial, therefore, the trial judge may close the rape shield hearing only after making the findings as required by <em>Waller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Finally, we make a few remarks to clarify the implications of our determination regarding the public trial issue for other cases. Here, we are ordering a new trial on the basis of the impermissible admission of the first expert\u2019s testimony concerning how the swabs she tested were collected. Because the trial must be conducted anew, so must the rape shield hearing, if the defendant again seeks to offer evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual interactions with the first complaint witness. In doing so, the judge must conduct the individualized analysis required by <em>Waller </em>before ordering a court room closure. While a violation of the public trial right is a structural error, the failure to comply with the <em>Waller </em>requirements before ordering a court room closure does not, standing alone, require a new trial. <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 49-50. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 118-119 (2010). Rather, in <em>Waller </em>itself, the United States Supreme Court, after concluding that the suppression hearing was closed improperly, held that \u201cthe remedy should be appropriate to the violation.\u201d <em>Waller, 461 </em>U.S. at 50. Consequently, the Court required only a new suppression hearing, observing that, \u201c[i]f, after a new suppression hearing, essentially the same evidence is suppressed, a new trial presumably would be a windfall for the defendant, and not in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the <em>Waller </em>Court\u2019s observations, various courts have concluded that, where a court room closure could have been justified, but the judge failed to comply with the requirement for individualized findings under <em>Waller, </em>the proper course is \u201cto remand the case ... for a hearing to reconstruct the circumstances that existed at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>of the trial and to determine whether the application to close the courtroom was well justified.\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>211 F.3d 735, 738 (2d Cir. 2000). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>937 F.2d 542, 547 (10th Cir. 1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>137 N.H. 193, 197 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We believe that the same approach is appropriate where a trial judge improperly closed a rape shield hearing without making the case-specific findings required in <em>Waller. </em>In such cases, assuming the objection to the closure of the hearing was properly preserved, and the case is still on direct appeal, the proper remedy will be to remand to the trial judge to determine whether the circumstances that existed at the time of the trial would have warranted the closure of the court room for the rape shield hearing. Even if the judge concludes that the circumstances did not warrant the closure of the hearing, the result will not necessarily be a new trial. Rather, the judge should then conduct the rape shield hearing anew. If the new rape shield hearing results in a determination regarding the admissibility of evidence of prior sexual conduct by the victim that is \u201cessentially the same\u201d as the determination that emerged from the original hearing, then no new trial is required. See <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 50. A new trial will be necessary as a result of our holding, therefore, only if the circumstances that existed at the time of the trial did not justify the court room closure during the rape shield hearing, and only if the judge\u2019s decision in the wake of the new rape shield hearing is not \u201cessentially the same\u201d as the decision that emerged from the original rape shield hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">c. <em>Remaining arguments. </em>The defendant offers two additional arguments. Because we have granted a new trial on the basis of the expert\u2019s improper testimony, we address these issues only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">First, the defendant argues that his rights to a fair trial, to confront witnesses against him, and to present a defense were violated by the judge\u2019s decision to prohibit defense counsel from questioning either the victim or Tim about their prior sexual contact. Because this decision was based on the testimony and argument presented at the closed rape shield hearing, and our remand may result in a new rape shield hearing, we do not address the defendant\u2019s argument at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Second, the defendant argues that the judge erred in instructing the jury regarding the impact of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication on whether he \u201creasonably should have known\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>victim\u2019s capacity to consent. In response to a jury question regarding the meaning of \u201creasonably should have known,\u201d the judge indicated that the phrase denotes \u201can objective rather than subjective standard\u201d that \u201crequires you to consider all of the believable evidence in determining whether ... an ordinary, prudent person would have considered the complainant too impaired to give consent.\u201d In its brief, the Commonwealth acknowledges that the jury instruction was inconsistent with this court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mountry, </em>463 Mass. at 92, where we held that the \u201celement of knowledge is not purely objective,\u201d and that the Commonwealth must \u201cprove what <em>the defendant </em>reasonably should have known, not what the average reasonable unintoxicated person would have known\u201d (quotation omitted). Because that case was decided after the defendant\u2019s trial, however, and because the new standard it articulates is a common-law rule and is not constitutionally compelled, the Commonwealth argues that it should be applied only prospectively. Since we are remanding for a new trial, we need not address this question. At the defendant\u2019s new trial, the judge should instruct the jury in accordance with the new standard articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mountry, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s convictions are vacated and set aside. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial and for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As a general rule, information concerning how such swabs were collected should be admitted through the testimony of a person, such as, without limitation, the nurse or the victim, who has personal knowledge of the specific \u201crape kit\u201d examination at issue. We leave for another day the question whether evidence concerning the collection of the swabs could be admitted through the testimony of a person who lacks personal knowledge of the specific \u201crape kit\u201d examination, but who is familiar with the general procedures and protocols ordinarily employed at a given facility in connection with the conduct of a \u201crape kit\u201d examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Because the testimonial hearsay related to a key factual dispute, this case differs from those decisions in which we have determined that testimonial hearsay was improperly admitted, but did not necessitate a new trial. In a few of these cases, the defendant objected, but this court concluded that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>460 Mass. 409, 421-422 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>459 Mass. 249, 264-266, cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 813 (2011). In most, however, the defendant failed to object, causing us to review only for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Furthermore, in most of these cases, the hearsay evidence at issue was an autopsy report, and the cause of death was not a contested issue at trial, leading us to affirm despite the error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emeny, </em>463 Mass. 138, 144-146 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phim, </em>462 Mass. 470, 479-480 (2012); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 594 n.6 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Housen, </em>458 Mass. 702, 710 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>456 Mass. 198, 211 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>455 Mass. 372, 377-378 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>455 Mass. 1, 15 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>454 Mass. 721, 732-734 (2009). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 582-588 (2010) (reversing where medical examiner\u2019s testimony was improperly admitted, issue was preserved, and \u201c[t]he cause of death was very much a disputed issue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b750-7\">Gants, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGv\">(concurring, with whom Spina, J., joins). I agree with the court that making a determination in accordance with <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48-50 (1984), is constitutionally required before closing a court room to conduct a rape shield hearing under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. <em>Ante </em>at 722. I also recognize that, because \u00a7 21B requires the hearing to be conducted \u201cin camera,\u201d the public has been excluded from the court room without a <em>Waller </em>determination for most, if not all, rape shield hearings conducted prior to the issuance of this opinion. Consequently, some may fear that this opinion will generate a plethora of motions for a new trial claiming structural error as a result of the violation of the public trial right. I write separately to provide some perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">A motion for new trial (or a claim on direct appeal) based on the absence of a <em>Waller </em>determination will almost certainly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>futile unless, as in this case, the defendant objected to the closing of the court room at the time of the rape shield hearing. <em>Ante </em>at 731.1 doubt that many defendants timely made such an objection. Without doing so, a defendant will be deemed to have waived his or her claim of error regarding the closure of the court room for such a hearing, and may only claim that defense counsel was ineffective for having failed to object. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>467 Mass. 96, 102-103, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 356 (2014) (\u201cthe right to a public trial may be procedurally waived by a failure to lodge a timely objection to the offending error,\u201d and if waived, \u201cwe still may have occasion to review that error in the postconviction context of a challenge to trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness in failing to raise the objection\u201d). To prevail, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would require a finding that a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice arose from the absence of such an objection, and under these circumstances it is difficult to imagine a case where such a finding would be warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>469 Mass. 854, 857-858 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In the rare case where a defendant has preserved his or her claim of error by objecting to the closure of the court room during a rape shield hearing, the remedy the court provides is a remand for a posttrial <em>Waller </em>hearing, where the trial judge (or another judge, if the trial judge is no longer on the bench) will determine whether the closure of the court room would have satisfied the constitutional requirements of <em>Waller </em>had the judge made a <em>Waller </em>determination at the time of trial. <em>Ante </em>at 731. The court states in its opinion that \u201cthe State\u2019s overriding interest in protecting the privacy rights of rape victims and the absence of any other more narrowly tailored means of accommodating that interest may well mean that the majority of rape shield proceedings properly are closed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 729. Thus, I expect that few, if any, posttrial <em>Waller </em>hearings will lead to a finding that the court room would not have been closed had the judge made a <em>Waller </em>determination at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Where there is such a finding, the court makes clear that the remedy is a new rape shield hearing with an open court room, not a new trial. <em>Ante </em>at 731. A new trial will be required only if the judge determines at the new rape shield hearing that significant evidence of prior sexual conduct by the victim, which was found inadmissible at the earlier rape shield hearing, would be admissible at a new trial. <em>Id. </em>I can understand why a judge, upon revisiting a rape shield issue, may come to a different conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>regarding the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, but it is hard to imagine that this determination would be materially affected by whether the court room was open or closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Consequently, I foresee that very few, if any, defendants will receive a new trial as a result of this opinion. As with <em>Waller, </em>the opinion here is not limited to prospective application, but its practical impact will be.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
