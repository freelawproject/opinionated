The defendants, Jason Estabrook and Adam Bradley, stand indicted for murder and related crimes arising out of a shooting that took place on July 7, 2012, in Billerica. They moved to suppress evidence of historical CSLI pertaining to Bradley\u2019s cellular tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>phone that the police initially obtained in July, 2012, without a search warrant but in compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703 (2006), and then, in November, 2013, reobtained pursuant to a warrant. The defendants also sought suppression of statements they each made to police in 2012, following the receipt of Bradley\u2019s CSLI. A judge of the Superior Court denied the motions after an evidentiary hearing; the defendants filed these interlocutory appeals. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Returning to an issue briefly touched on in <em>Augustine, </em>467 Mass. at 255 n.37, we conclude that a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy protected under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is not violated where the Commonwealth requests up to six hours of historical CSLI without obtaining a search warrant. In this case, however, because the Commonwealth requested two weeks of historical CSLI, a search warrant was required, even though the Commonwealth proposes to use only six hours of the CSLI as evidence at trial. Nevertheless, we decide that many of the defendants\u2019 statements and Bradley\u2019s CSLI are not subject to suppression on account of the CSLI that was first obtained unlawfully: the defendant\u2019s statements were not made in response to being confronted by that tainted CSLI, and the 2013 search warrant was supported by probable cause derived from information the Commonwealth obtained independently rather than through exploitation of the tainted CSLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\"><em>Background. </em>To provide context, we summarize some of the background facts as found by the motion judge, reserving additional facts for consideration in connection with the issues raised in these appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At approximately 3:50 a.m. on July 7, 2012, Quint\u00edn Koehler (victim) and his brother, Ryan, were at their home in Billerica when they heard loud noises coming from the kitchen. According to Ryan, the two brothers went into the kitchen where they were confronted by three to four masked men. Each of the intruders appeared to be in his early twenties, and at least two of them were holding firearms. One of the intruders, whom we shall call the \u201cfirst intruder,\u201d had a gun and ordered the two brothers onto the ground. The victim refused and hit a different intruder, whom we shall call the \u201csecond intruder,\u201d with a tea kettle, after which a struggle ensued between them. At that point one or two of the other intruders shot the victim in the head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>and shoulder. All the intruders then fled the scene on foot. A few minutes later, police and emergency personnel arrived, and at 3:58 a.m. the victim was transported to a hospital where he died of a gunshot wound to the head. On July 10, 2012, Nicholas Cappello told Deputy Chief Roy Frost of the Billerica police department and State police Trooper Anthony DeLucia that he lived with the victim, that he regularly purchased and distributed marijuana, and that at times he purchased the drugs from a supplier in Lynn named Ashley. The police learned that the supplier was Ashley Marshall, and that the defendant Bradley was an associate of hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Prior to July 25, 2012, an assistant district attorney obtained through administrative subpoenas, see G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17B, certain telephone records (call logs) of Bradley and Marshall. The call logs associated with Bradley\u2019s cellular telephone revealed the time and duration of incoming and outgoing calls. They also showed the telephone numbers associated with each call; they did not contain CSLI. These call logs revealed, among other things, that Bradley\u2019s telephone was in contact with Marshall\u2019s telephone often on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">On July 25, 2012, based on information gleaned from the call logs and the police investigation, the Commonwealth filed an application in the Superior Court seeking an order to obtain from Bradley\u2019s cellular service provider certain records, including historical CSLI, relating to his cellular telephone for the period from July 1 through July 15, 2012. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d), a Superior Court judge issued the requested order (\u00a7 2703 [d] order).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bradley\u2019s CSLI evidence indicated that at the time the shooting took place, his cellular telephone was in the area of Burlington and Bedford and communicating with a cell tower located three miles from the victim\u2019s home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>On August 2, 2012, police officers interviewed Bradley, who was not in custody and who denied involvement in the July 7 shooting but, in response to their questions, told the officers of his cousin, the defendant Estabrook. Police then interviewed Estabrook on August 15, during which Estabrook volunteered that he had sought treatment for a dislocated shoulder at Salem Hospital in the early morning hours of July 7, shortly after the shooting had occurred. After the police conducted further investigation, on September 26, 2012, Estabrook was arrested for the murder of the victim. On September 27, in another interview with the investigating officers, Estabrook detailed the facts of the July 7 home invasion and shooting and implicated himself, Bradley, and others in the crimes. That same day, the officers also spoke to Bradley, who again denied any personal involvement, saying that he knew of how the incident transpired only from what Estabrook had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">On December 6, 2012, a Middlesex County grand jury returned indictments against Bradley and Estabrook, charging each with murder in the first degree, armed home invasion, attempted armed robbery, carrying a firearm without a license, and unlawful possession of ammunition. On November 20, 2013, Billerica police applied for and obtained search warrants for the same CSLI that the Commonwealth had collected pursuant to the \u00a7 2703(d) orders obtained in 2012, including Bradley\u2019s CSLI covering the period from July 1 to July 15, 2012.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In June, 2014, Bradley and Estabrook filed separate motions to suppress evidence of Bradley\u2019s historical CSLI on the ground that the Commonwealth had obtained this evidence in violation of art. 14.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Augustine, </em>467 Mass. at 232. Both motions also sought suppression of the defendants\u2019 statements made to police alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>edly derived from the CSLI: Estabrook argued in favor of suppression of his August 15 and September 27 statements; Bradley sought suppression of the statements he made on August 2 and September 27.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge denied the defendants\u2019 motions. The judge determined that the July 25, 2012, \u00a7 2703(d) order for Bradley\u2019s CSLI was not supported by probable cause. She further concluded, however, that probable cause and a search warrant were not required for the CSLI pertaining to the six-hour period surrounding the time of the July 7 shooting because the defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in CSLI covering so brief a period. As to the CSLI covering the periods beyond this six-hour window, the judge ruled that suppression was not called for in light of the fact that the police had obtained a search warrant for this CSLI, which was supported by probable cause derived from evidence independent of the CSLI. A single justice allowed the defendants\u2019 applications for interlocutory review and directed that their appeals be consolidated and heard in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact and will not disturb them absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 250 (2009). However, we undertake \u201can independent determination as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">2. <em>Warrant requirement. </em>The defendants challenge the motion judge\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth did not need a search warrant to obtain the CSLI covering the six-hour window surrounding the July 7 shooting.* ***<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They contend that any suggestion in this court\u2019s decision in <em>Augustine </em>that a request for CSLI for a period of six hours or less would not require a warrant is irrel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>evant to this case because here the Commonwealth requested CSLI covering a period of two weeks, thereby subjecting the request to the warrant requirement of art. 14. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In <em>Augustine, </em>the court held that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in historical CSLI relating to his or her cellular telephone, at least insofar as it covers a two-week period, and that this expectation of privacy rendered the Commonwealth\u2019s access to this information a search in the constitutional sense, subject to the warrant requirement of art. 14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Augustine, </em>467 Mass. at 232, 255. However, we surmised that there may be \u201csome period of time for which the Commonwealth may obtain a person\u2019s historical CSLI by meeting the standard for a \u00a7 2703(d) order alone, because the duration is too brief to implicate the person\u2019s reasonable privacy interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. Although we declined in <em>Augustine </em>to announce \u201ca temporal line of demarcation between when the police may not be required to seek a search warrant for historical CSLI and when they must do so,\u201d we assumed without deciding that \u201ca <em>request </em>for historical CSLI. . . for a period of six hours or less would not require the police to obtain a search warrant in addition to a \u00a7 2703(d) order\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 255 n.37. We now hold that, assuming compliance with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703, the Commonwealth may obtain historical CSLI for a period of six hours or less relating to an identified person\u2019s cellular telephone from the cellular service provider without obtaining a search warrant, because such a request does not violate the person\u2019s constitutionally protected expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">It is important to emphasize that, in terms of reasonable ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>pectation of privacy, the salient consideration is the length of time for which a person\u2019s CSLI is requested, not the time covered by the person\u2019s CSLI that the Commonwealth ultimately seeks to use as evidence at trial. <em>See Augustine, </em>467 Mass. at 254. It would violate the constitutional principles underlying our decision in <em>Augustine </em>to permit the Commonwealth to request and obtain without a warrant two weeks of CSLI \u2014 or longer \u2014 so long as the Commonwealth seeks to use evidence relating only to six hours of that CSLI. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez, </em>494 U.S. 259, 264 (1990), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 354 (1974) (Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cprohibits \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 whether or not the evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial, and a violation of the Amendment is \u2018fully accomplished\u2019 at the time of an unreasonable governmental intrusion\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 906 (1984) (wrong under Fourth Amendment is \u201cunlawful search or seizure itself\u2019 [citation omitted]). Because the Commonwealth requested, and obtained, CSLI relating to Bradley\u2019s cellular telephone covering an entire two-week period of which the six hours at issue were just a small part, as in <em>Augustine, </em>see 467 Mass at 232-233, the warrant requirement applied to the entirety of Bradley\u2019s CSLI that was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">This conclusion, however, does not resolve the defendants\u2019 appeals. The statements made by Bradley and Estabrook after the police obtained Bradley\u2019s CSLI still are admissible if they are not the fruits of the illegal search of the CSLI. Similarly, Bradley\u2019s CSLI is admissible if the search warrant ultimately obtained for this CSLI was based on evidence that provided probable cause and derived from a source independent of the tainted CSLI. We address these two issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">3. <em>The defendants\u2019 statements. </em>The defendants assert that their statements to the police must be suppressed as a result of the initial illegal search of Bradley\u2019s CSLI.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Their claim is a general one: because the police obtained Bradley\u2019s CSLI before any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>the several interviews of Estabrook and Bradley, everything the defendants stated during those interviews must be suppressed as tainted fruits of the unlawfully obtained CSLI. We disagree; the inquiry is more individualized. The \u201ccrucial question\u201d regarding whether a particular statement must be suppressed as the fruit of the initial illegal search of Bradley\u2019s CSLI is whether that statement \u201chas been come at by exploitation of... [the illegal search] or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bradshaw, 385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982), quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963). With this in mind, we examine the statements at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">a. <em>Bradley\u2019s interview on August 2. </em>The motion judge implicitly found that the police were investigating Bradley\u2019s involvement in the shooting prior to obtaining his CSLI,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as demonstrated by her finding that the Commonwealth sought and obtained through an administrative subpoena Bradley\u2019s call logs before seeking and securing the \u00a7 2703(d) order for Bradley\u2019s CSLI.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When Frost and DeLucia interviewed Bradley on August 2, before the officers confronted Bradley with any information derived from the tainted CSLI, he identified Estabrook as someone who occasionally used his cellular telephone.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, Bradley\u2019s statement did not result from the police exploiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Bradley\u2019s CSLI and was not a fruit of the illegal search of that CSLI. See <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. at 258. Suppression of this statement is not required.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">b. <em>Estabrook\u2019s interviews on August 8 and August 15. </em>Soon after Bradley\u2019s August 2 interview, the police began investigating Estabrook\u2019s involvement in the shooting and learned that his large physical build was consistent with the description of the second intruder, and that he, like Bradley, had a history of convictions for offenses involving violence and firearms. The police first interviewed Estabrook on August 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In the August 8 interview, Frost told Estabrook, \u201c[W]e had this incident ... on that Saturday, early morning hours, and, you know, we have some information that puts you there.\u201d Almost immediately thereafter, however, State police Trooper Kevin Baker said to Estabrook, \u201c[W]e know that there was a group of people there. We have some good information on the reason they were there and what was going on and how things went down and what those people look like and what their appearance was and where they and how they fled,\u201d and that Estabrook\u2019s name \u201ccontinually keeps coming up.\u201d Here, an argument could be made that the police officers were exploiting Bradley\u2019s illegally obtained CSLI because Frost had been told by Bradley that Esta-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>brook occasionally used Bradley\u2019s telephone and Bradley\u2019s CSLI placed the telephone close to the scene of the shooting at the time it occurred. We conclude that it is more probable that the police officers\u2019 statements reflect the results of the continuing investigation into the shooting that they were conducting independent of Bradley\u2019s CSLI. At this time the police did not have any information about whether Bradley or Estabrook had Bradley\u2019s telephone at the time of the shooting. Furthermore, Bradley had given Estabrook\u2019s name to investigators prior to being confronted with the tainted CSLI, and the police then determined, necessarily independent of any CSLI, that Estabrook matched the physical appearance of the second intruder who had been described by the victim\u2019s brother shortly after the shooting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>375 Mass. 472, 483 n.9 (1978) (defendant\u2019s statements were not fruit of earlier illegality where \u201cstatements came to light by means independent from\u201d illegality).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">As for Estabrook\u2019s August 15 statements, it appears that this interview of Estabrook was not recorded, and the undisputed testimony of Frost was that the police did not confront Estabrook with any information related to the CSLI. Accordingly, suppression of evidence of Estabrook\u2019s statements made on August 8 and August 15 is not called for. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shipps, </em>399 Mass. 820, 829 (1987) (\u201cimproper conduct unrelated to the statements does not compel suppression of the statements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">c. <em>Estabrook\u2019s interview on September 27. </em>Unrelated to any exploitation of Bradley\u2019s CSLI, the police discovered from Estabrook during his August 15 interview that he had sought treatment at Salem Hospital on the night of the shooting. Police obtained copies of Estabrook\u2019s medical records and gleaned from the hospital surveillance videos that he had arrived at the hospital shortly after the shooting wearing clothes substantially matching those of the second intruder, and told medical staff that he was \u201chit in the head with a tea kettle.\u201d Because Estabrook\u2019s statement was consistent with the victim\u2019s brother\u2019s account of what happened to the second intruder at the scene of the shooting, the police arrested Estabrook and advised him of the Miranda rights. He agreed to speak with the police. During that interview, Estabrook implicated himself, Bradley, and others in the shooting. These statements also are not required to be suppressed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 649 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>(2011) (police misconduct \u201ccannot deprive the [Commonwealth] of the opportunity to prove [the defendant\u2019s] guilt through the introduction of evidence wholly untainted by the police misconduct\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">d. <em>Bradley\u2019s interview on September 27. </em>Frost and DeLucia interviewed Bradley again on September 27, 2012, following their postarrest interview of Estabrook.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As he had on August 2, Bradley denied involvement in the shooting and stated repeatedly that Estabrook had informed him of the shooting incident. Specifically, Bradley said that Estabrook told him that he, Estabrook, had been hit in the head with a pot; that another individual, Gabriel Arias, shot the victim; and that a third individual, Peter Bin, also was present in the house for the shooting. Bradley said that, according to Estabrook, Bin carried a .45 caliber pistol and Arias had a nine millimeter handgun during the home invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Suppression of these statements is not required. Throughout this interview, Frost and DeLucia confronted Bradley with information they had just learned from Estabrook, independently of the CSLI.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To the extent the police told Bradley during the interview that they knew he was involved in the shooting, their questions and statements made clear that they had obtained this information through Estabrook\u2019s untainted confession and other independent sources, rather than by exploiting the CSLI.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Although the defendants challenge the admissibility of <em>all </em>their statements as tainted by the previously obtained CSLI for Bradley\u2019s cellular telephone, we have rejected that approach. Rather, we have focused primarily on the statements that were included in the affidavit and that support probable cause independent of the earlier, unlawfully obtained CSLI. The motion judge relied on <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-604 (1975), to conclude that none of the statements of Estabrook or Bradley needed to be suppressed because they were sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search of Bradley\u2019s CSLI. We agree with the judge insofar as her decision applies to Estabrook\u2019s statements, because we are persuaded that none of his statements was the product of the police confronting him with evidence of Bradley\u2019s CSLI. Certain of Bradley\u2019s statements are another matter. At times during their interviews of Bradley, and particularly in the August 2 interview, the police officers asked questions based directly on the tainted CSLI. The Commonwealth argues that all of Bradley\u2019s statements, including the responses to direct CSLI challenges, are admissible because, like Estabrook\u2019s, they were attenuated from the initial illegal search of the CSLI. We disagree. Even though the Commonwealth requested Bradley\u2019s CSLI on July 25 and obtained it on July 31, Bradley was not confronted with any question based on his CSLI until he was interviewed on August 2 and September 27.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the circumstances here are materially different from cases, relied upon by the Commonwealth, in which a defendant\u2019s statements made hours after he was illegally arrested or after his home was illegally searched \u2014 and, thus, made hours after he became aware of the arrest or the search \u2014 were too attenuated from the arrest to be suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>380 Mass. 180, 183-185 (1980), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>371 Mass. 97, 113-114 (1976). Insofar as Bradley is concerned, his statements in direct response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>confrontation with evidence of his CSLI were made in close proximity to the illegality, and there were no intervening circumstances between the police questions based on the CSLI and Bradley\u2019s responses thereto. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, </em>444 Mass. 444, 456 (2005). The statements must be suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 518 (2012) (direct product of unlawful search must be suppressed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter P., </em>456 Mass. 254, 275 (2010) (suppression required of juvenile\u2019s statement about gun, made immediately after search of juvenile\u2019s room, and juvenile\u2019s removal from room; statement was not so distant in time from illegal search to dissipate taint). We now turn to the CSLI itself, which was the subject of the 2013 search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">4. <em>Search warrant for CSLI. </em>Even though the exclusionary rule generally bars from admission evidence \u201cobtained during an illegal search as fruit of the poisonous tree, evidence initially discovered as a consequence of an unlawful search may be admissible if later acquired independently by lawful means untainted by the initial illegality\u201d (quotation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 624 (2003). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frodyma, </em>393 Mass. 438, 441 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>382 Mass. 210, 216-217 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>389 Mass. 411 (1983). See <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 443 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silvestri, </em>787 F.2d 736, 740 (1st Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1233 (1988). Accordingly, the appropriate inquiry here is whether, given the \u201cprimary illegality\u201d of the Commonwealth\u2019s access to Bradley\u2019s CSLI pursuant to a \u00a7 2703(d) order, the 2013 search warrant for the same CSLI was secured \u201cby exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d See <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 392 (1920); <em>Frodyma, supra, </em>quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>85 Mass.

The Commonwealth bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence the absence of taint, i.e., that the Commonwealth obtained information supplying the requisite probable cause through an independent source.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 459 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>It is well settled that the court looks to the \u201cfour comers of the affidavit\u201d to determine whether a search warrant application establishes probable cause. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 297 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villella, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 (1995). The defendants concede that on its face Frost\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the warrant established probable cause to search Bradley\u2019s CSLI. They argue, however, that, contrary to the determination of the motion judge, much of the information set forth in the affidavit was obtained as a result of Bradley\u2019s unlawfully obtained CSLI. Accordingly, our task in evaluating the defendants\u2019 claim is to determine whether there are enough facts in the affidavit traceable to sources independent of the illegally obtained CSLI to establish probable cause for the search warrant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 692 (2010) (evidence obtained during search pursuant to warrant obtained after illegal entry would be admissible if search warrant affidavit contained information supplying probable cause obtained from independent, untainted source). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>454 Mass. 542, 552-553 (2009) (under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 [1978], where defendant shows affidavit supporting warrant includes affirmative misstatement, judge considers whether \u201caffidavit purged of false material, establishes probable cause\u201d). Cf. also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>620 Pa. 465, 481 (2013) (court may look beyond affidavit supporting search warrant where objective of inquiry is \u201cto determine whether a fact in the affidavit would be included or stricken when determining probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Frost\u2019s affidavit describes the following: an eyewitness account (provided by the victim\u2019s brother) of the shooting; police investigation into drug distribution from the victim\u2019s home and into the ultimate supplier of these drugs; identification of Bradley as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>suspect and obtaining his call logs through an administrative subpoena; Bradley\u2019s statement giving Estabrook\u2019s name to police on August 2; Estabrook\u2019s statement on August 15, regarding his treatment at an area hospital in the early morning of the shooting, and review of his hospital record; Estabrook\u2019s statement on September 27, implicating himself and Bradley in the shooting; Marshall\u2019s grand jury testimony implicating Bradley in the robbery scheme; and forensic evidence linking Bradley to the shooting. Frost avers in his affidavit that he \u201cspecifically avoided\u201d including information obtained pursuant to the \u00a7 2703(d) orders in delineating this evidence. Our review of the record persuades us that Frost succeeded in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The following information included in the affidavit was gathered before the Commonwealth initially obtained Bradley\u2019s CSLI without a search warrant and, therefore, by definition was discovered independently of it. At approximately 3:55 a.m. on July 7, the victim was shot in his home. The victim\u2019s brother, who witnessed the shooting, told the police that three to four masked men in their early twenties had entered the home by kicking in a door to the kitchen; two of these intruders had firearms. One of them, the first intruder, was a white male with blue eyes and blonde hair. He was carrying a nine millimeter handgun, and ordered the victim and his brother to \u201cget down on the ground.\u201d The victim refused and hit the second intruder with a tea kettle. The second intruder was a heavyset white male dressed in a red shirt and black shorts with blue stripes. While the victim struggled with the second intruder, the first intruder, and perhaps another intruder as well, shot the victim. The intruders left the scene in a small sedan; the victim later died of a gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">When police executed a search warrant for the victim\u2019s residence that same day, they found more than $10,000 in cash in the victim\u2019s bedroom, more than one pound of marijuana, and what appeared to be drug ledgers. On July 10, 2012, Cappello told Frost and DeLucia that he lived with the victim, and that he regularly purchased and distributed marijuana. He also said that he had purchased multiple pounds of marijuana from a supplier in Lynn named Ashley in the past, but that he had not done so since May, 2012, because when he last purchased marijuana from Ashley she was accompanied by a \u201cscary\u201d man introduced to him as the \u201cthug.\u201d According to Cappello, the \u201cthug\u201d had many tattoos, including one on the back of his head that read \u201cLYNN, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>MASS.\u201d Cappello believed that the \u201cthug\u201d provided security to Ashley\u2019s boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Frost and DeLucia obtained Ashley\u2019s telephone number from Cappello, and investigators learned through further investigation that \u201cAshley\u201d was Ashley Marshall, and the \u201cthug\u201d was Bradley, who has a \u201cLYNN, MASS\u201d tattoo on the back of his head. Bradley\u2019s race and blue eyes were consistent with the description of the first intruder, and his probation record revealed a history of charges involving violence and firearms. During the police investigation, the district attorney\u2019s office obtained through administrative subpoenas call logs associated with the cellular telephones of Bradley, Bin, and Marshall.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These records revealed that at various intervals between 8 p.m. on July 6 and 6 a.m. on July 7, these individuals were in regular contact with one another.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">On July 25, the Commonwealth requested and obtained \u00a7 2703(d) orders, and as a result received the CSLI of Bradley and others soon thereafter. (See notes 5 &amp; 14, <em>supra.) </em>The lettered list that follows summarizes information contained in Frost\u2019s affidavit that was obtained by the police after they had received Bradley\u2019s CSLI, but without exploiting the tainted CSLI.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Frodyma, </em>393 Mass. at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">a. Bradley\u2019s interview with Frost and DeLucia on August 2. Bradley admitted to knowing Marshall and her boy friend, and stated that Estabrook occasionally used his cellular telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">b. Frost\u2019s August 15 interview of Estabrook. Estabrook volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>teered that on the night of the shooting he had dislocated his shoulder at a party in Salem and had been treated at Salem Hospital at 4:15 a.m. \u2014 a time that was shortly after the shooting had occurred. The hospital\u2019s surveillance videotape revealed that Estabrook appeared in the hospital lobby at approximately 5:15 a.m. on July 7, wearing a red T-shirt and black shorts, consistent with the description of the second intruder except for the lack of stripes on the shorts. Medical records, obtained from the hospital through a grand jury subpoena, indicated that Estabrook was admitted at approximately 5:20 a.m. on July 7, and that he told those treating him that he had been \u201chit in the head with a tea kettle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">c. Estabrook\u2019s recorded interview with Frost and DeLucia on September 27. He told the investigators that the robbery of the victim was Bradley\u2019s idea, and that Bradley had lured him into the robbery scheme with the promise that they could steal some $40,000 from the victim. He also identified other individuals involved in the crimes, including Bin, Arias, Steven Touch, and Sophan Keo. Further, he stated that the group entered the victim\u2019s home with two firearms \u2014 a nine millimeter handgun and a .45 caliber pistol; that while Bradley, Keo, and Touch waited outside, he, Arias, and Bin entered the home where Arias shot the victim in the head; that members of the group who had been wearing latex gloves discarded the gloves as they fled the scene; and that later that morning, Estabrook, Bradley, Bin, Touch, and Arias met and urged one another to keep the details of the shooting a secret from the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">d. The November 15, 2012, grand jury testimony of Marshall, who had been granted immunity.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Marshall stated that Bradley had asked her a few weeks before the shooting for a target to rob; that, on the evening of July 6, she suggested that he rob Cappello and showed Bradley photographs of what she believed to be Cappello\u2019s home; and that Bradley then left with a group of Asian males.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> When Bradley spoke to Marshall one or two weeks after the incident, he denied having entered the victim\u2019s home himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>but told her that other individuals had done so, and said words to the effect of \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEp\">e. Details concerning a latex glove. On the day of the shooting police found a latex glove on a road approximately one quarter mile from the victim\u2019s home, and determined that Bradley was a potential contributor to the glove\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile, and that the chances of the DNA of a randomly selected Caucasian male matching the DNA profile of the glove was 1 in 1.875 quadrillion. In addition, the glove contained gunshot residue, indicating that the person wearing the glove fired a gun or was near a gun at the time it was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">An affidavit in support of a search warrant for CSLI must demonstrate \u201cprobable cause to believe [1] \u2018that a particularly described offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed, and [2] that [the CSLI being sought] will produce evidence of such offense or will aid in the apprehension of a person who the applicant has probable cause to believe has committed, is committing, or is about to commit such offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Augustine, </em>467 Mass. at 256, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 825 (2009). The information just summarized, all contained in Frost\u2019s affidavit and all of which had a source separate and apart from the tainted CSLI, meets this two-pronged test. As to the first prong, certainly the affidavit supplies probable cause to believe that the criminal offenses of murder and home invasion, among others, were committed at the victim\u2019s home, given that the victim\u2019s brother witnessed the incident and Estabrook confessed to details of the crimes. With respect to the second prong, the independently obtained facts in Frost\u2019s affidavit (including Estabrook\u2019s September 27 statements to the police detailing his and Bradley\u2019s involvement, and Bradley\u2019s DNA on the latex glove) provide probable cause to believe that Bradley and Estabrook were part of the group who perpetrated the home invasion and murder of the victim. Accordingly, the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that the CSLI would \u201cproduce evidence\u201d of these offenses by indicating whether Bradley\u2019s cellular telephone, which also may have been used by Estabrook, was located near the victim\u2019s home on the night of the shooting and, therefore, whether Bradley (or Estabrook) was in the area of the shooting when it occurred. Given that the 2013 search warrants for the CSLI were supported by probable cause based on evidence independent of the illegally obtained CSLI, suppression of evidence relating to Bradley\u2019s CSLI is not warranted.

Nevertheless, the thrust of Frost\u2019s testimony is that the police focused on Bradley as a suspect soon after the shooting and were interested in interviewing him prior to obtaining his CSLI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\">State police Trooper Anthony DeLucia asked Bradley whether anyone else had used his telephone in the past. We do not view this question as exploiting Bradley\u2019s CSLI because he already had confronted Bradley with his call logs that revealed multiple calls having been placed from Bradley\u2019s telephone to Ashley Marshall\u2019s telephone on the night of the shooting. The basis for DeLucia\u2019s questions, therefore, had a source, the call logs, that was independent of and indeed existed prior to the CSLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Furthermore, to the extent that the motion judge concluded that Bradley led investigators to Estabrook only after being confronted with the illegally obtained CSLI, we disagree. Although Bradley only described Estabrook\u2019s allegedly violent tendencies after being confronted with the CSLI, see note 17, <em>infra, </em>Bradley volunteered Estabrook\u2019s name as his cousin who used his cellular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>telephone before the CSLI came into play in Bradley\u2019s August 2 interview. Given that Bradley told police that Estabrook occasionally used his telephone and that the police knew from the call logs that Bradley\u2019s telephone made and received numerous calls immediately around the time of the shooting, it is reasonable to assume that the police would have investigated Estabrook even absent the information from Bradley describing Estabrook\u2019s alleged propensity for violence. Frost indicated as much in his testimony at the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In Bradley\u2019s August 2 interview, DeLucia and Frost \u201cexploited\u201d his CSLI for the first time by asking Bradley, \u201c[I]s there any reason why [your] phone would not be in Lynn [on the night of the shooting] and somebody would be on it outside of Lynn?\u201d In response, Bradley again mentioned Estabrook, described Estabrook as a person who is \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201clikes to rob people,\u201d and later added that Estabrook is \u201ccapable\u201d of committing murder. Independent of whether these statements were the fruit of the illegal CSLI, Bradley\u2019s statements of opinion about Estabrook\u2019s supposed character and propensities would be inadmissible at trial on the ground that Bradley\u2019s opinion on such issues is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Bradley also mentioned, at some point after being confronted with his CSLI, that Estabrook had a cut on his head in July, 2012. Bradley was unable to say with any certainty, however, whether Estabrook had the cut around the time of the shooting. We leave for the motion judge on remand to determine whether Bradley\u2019s statement regarding Estabrook\u2019s cut was sufficiently connected to any confrontation with CSLI to warrant suppression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The record indicates that Estabrook made incriminating statements in the interview after Frost twice told him that he knew Estabrook was in the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>when the shooting occurred. However, what Frost told Estabrook was not, in our view, an exploitation of Bradley\u2019s tainted CSLI. It is more likely that Frost\u2019s statement that Estabrook was at the scene of the shooting was derived from Estabrook\u2019s appearance at the hospital right after the shooting, in attire substantially matching that of the second intruder, and from Estabrook\u2019s statement to his treatment providers that he had been hit with a tea kettle. All that Bradley\u2019s CSLI did, after all, was locate his cellular telephone and its user \u2014 whether Bradley or Estabrook \u2014 within three miles of the victim\u2019s home in Billerica; the CSLI did not place the telephone in the house itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">At the time of this interview, Bradley was also under arrest, but in connection with an unrelated matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b881-9\">During the interview the investigators asked Bradley who had his telephone on the night of the shooting and told him that his \u201cphone was in Billerica.\u201d As discussed <em>infra, </em>Bradley\u2019s responses to these questions are inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Bradley\u2019s contention that his September 27 statements must be suppressed under the \u201ccat-out-of-the-bag\u201d rule.

We have concluded that the bulk of Bradley\u2019s statements in his first interview on August 2 are admissible.

Holding otherwise would contravene \u201cthe principle of the independent source doctrine that \u2018the interest of society in deterring unlawful police conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a <em>worse, </em>position [than] they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.\u2019 \u201d See <em>id. </em>at 443, quoting <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 443.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Bradley argues that Marshall\u2019s grand jury testimony is tainted by the CSLI because, he contends, Marshall was given immunity on account of the fact that her own illegally obtained CSLI showed she was not in or near Billerica at the time of the shooting. Bradley has no standing to challenge Marshall\u2019s grand jury testimony, and in any event, his argument is based on pure speculation: the record offers no basis on which to reach any conclusion about why Marshall was granted immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">According to Frost\u2019s affidavit, Steven Touch, Bin, and Sophan Keo are Asian males.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
