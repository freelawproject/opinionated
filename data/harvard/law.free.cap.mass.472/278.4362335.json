The defendant and Aaron Morin were charged with murder in the first degree in the death of the victim. The Commonwealth contended that the defendant acted as a joint venturer with Morin, who was tried separately. In November, 2012, a jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree on the theory of felony-murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues (1) error in the partial denial of his motion to suppress statements he made to police; (2) error in the denial of defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case two days before trial; and (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements made after being taken involuntarily to the police station should have been allowed in its entirety because these statements were the inadmissible fruits of an unlawful arrest. Because the defendant did not seek suppression on this ground, however, we review to determine if the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and conclude that it did not. We reject as well the other claims of error and, therefore, affirm the order denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the facts the jury could have found. The victim, who was twenty-five years of age, lived in Florida and regularly supplied the defendant with Percocet for the defendant\u2019s drug dealing business. On November 3, 2009, the victim flew to Providence, Rhode Island, rented an automobile, and drove to Massachusetts to meet with the defendant to supply him with Percocet. He telephoned his girl friend to let her know that he had safely landed. She never heard from him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The defendant and his wife<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were both involved in the sale of Percocet and both developed a dependency on the drug. The defendant supplied pills to his friend Morin, and also to Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Stenstream<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Stenstream\u2019s friend Brandon George.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">About one week prior to the murder on November 3, the defendant\u2019s wife and George drove to Florida to purchase pills from the victim. The defendant\u2019s wife gave the victim $42,000 in cash. The victim telephoned the defendant because the amount was short of what he had expected. Nevertheless, the victim supplied the defendant\u2019s wife with about 4,000 Percocet pills that she brought home to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Before this trip to Florida, Morin told the defendant that the victim was dealing to other people in Massachusetts. The defendant expressed disbelief, so Morin, in the defendant\u2019s presence, telephoned a man and put the call on speaker phone. The man confirmed what Morin had stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">On the morning of November 2, the day before the murder, Morin visited the defendant at the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s home, where they were then living. The defendant\u2019s wife had been sleeping. She woke up and heard Morin whisper something about \u201chitting\u201d someone and something about a black hat. She also overheard Morin say, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the other two\u201d or \u201cThey will take care of the other two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">During the late afternoon of November 2, Morin met with his friend Michael Matteson. Matteson owed Morin money, and Morin offered him an opportunity to repay the debt. Morin told Matteson that he was going \u201cto rob his connect\u2019s connect and make some money.\u201d Morin\u2019s \u201cconnect,\u201d or drug supplier, was the defendant. Morin explained that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconnect\u201d would be arriving to sell Percocet and they were going to rob him; \u201cthey\u201d included Morin, a person named Walter Babcock, and the defendant. Morin explained further that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconnect\u201d would be at an apartment owned by the defendant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Morin would receive a telephone call when he arrived. The \u201crobbers\u201d would go through the back door, Matteson would take the money and drugs, Babcock would grab the defendant\u2019s \u201cconnect,\u201d and Morin would make it look like he was holding down the defendant. Matteson said he would think about it, but ultimately decided not to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>On November 3, the defendant and his wife expected the victim to visit them at their apartment. The defendant had his wife help package between $42,000 and $58,000 in cash. The defendant\u2019s wife heard him ask someone over the telephone whether he was \u201cgoing to get it back.\u201d Shortly after 8 p.m., the defendant left the apartment wearing a black hat.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He took the money with him. Approximately thirty minutes later, the defendant\u2019s wife was speaking with the defendant on the house telephone when the victim called her on her cellular telephone. After communicating with her husband, the defendant\u2019s wife told the victim that the defendant wanted him to go to Stenstream\u2019s apartment. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">At the Bay Street residence, the defendant\u2019s sister, Lucia Rodriguez, and her husband, Gabriel Rodriguez,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were in the living room of the first-floor apartment. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>After Gabriel had settled in to watch a television program that commenced at 9 p.m., the defendant came into the apartment and spoke with Lucia. The defendant told her that he was going upstairs to speak with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Soon thereafter Lucia heard the footsteps of multiple people heading upstairs. Gabriel heard more than one set of footsteps coming from above. The defendant came down from the second-floor apartment and went into the kitchen with Lucia. He told her to stay downstairs and then \u201cbolted\u201d back upstairs. While the defendant was speaking to her, Lucia heard a \u201cbig rumbling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Gabriel then heard what sounded like multiple people running down the back stairs of the second-floor apartment. Looking outside a window, he saw an automobile leave his home quickly. Lucia heard people run out and saw a gray automobile departing with two people in the front and one person in the back. She heard the voice of another person that she did not recognize upstairs with her brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The defendant came downstairs, took some ice packs from the refrigerator, told Lucia he would be \u201cright back,\u201d and returned upstairs. After a few minutes the defendant asked Lucia to check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>on the victim because he was not responding. From the kitchen, Gabriel heard something about a fight and heard the defendant say, \u201cI think he got hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Upstairs, Lucia discovered the victim lying on his back on a bed in the spare bedroom. There were ice packs on his neck. She tried to see whether he was breathing. The victim was not moving, and she told the defendant to telephone 911. The defendant insisted that he wanted his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">At about 8:45 or 9 p.m., Morin, out of breath, telephoned the defendant\u2019s wife, asking for the defendant. Morin asked her, \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d He added, \u201cMan, that kid was tough.\u201d The defendant\u2019s wife told Morin that the defendant was not there. The defendant\u2019s wife asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d and Morin replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got to call [Lucia].\u201d The defendant\u2019s wife then telephoned Lucia, who stated that she did not know where the defendant was. Soon thereafter Lucia arrived and insisted that the defendant\u2019s wife and their daughter accompany Lucia back to the Bay Street apartment. The defendant\u2019s wife agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Stenstream and his girl friend returned to his apartment at approximately 9:45 p.m. He sent a text message to the defendant to confirm whether the defendant was still there. The defendant did not respond. There was an unfamiliar automobile in the driveway (the victim\u2019s rental vehicle). Stenstream\u2019s girl friend waited in his automobile. He then went up to his apartment and shortly thereafter returned to the automobile. Stenstream brought his girl friend upstairs to his apartment and instructed her to go straight to his bedroom, to keep her head down, and not to look around. As she made her way through the apartment, she observed blood on the floor and on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Stenstream found the defendant and the victim in a spare bedroom. The victim was lying on his back, his eyes and mouth were open, and he was not moving. The defendant was holding a package of peas or ice to the victim\u2019s head and was telling the victim to \u201cwake up.\u201d Stenstream asked what was going on. The defendant replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Close the door.\u201d Stenstream left, but returned shortly thereafter suggesting that the defendant telephone an ambulance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stenstream asked again what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>was going on. The defendant said, \u201cFucking Ace.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Stenstream again asked the defendant to arrange for an ambulance. The defendant said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. We should get him to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The defendant lifted the victim and started carrying him down the stairs. The defendant was struggling and asked Stenstream for help. Stenstream was reluctant, but agreed. Gabriel came out of his apartment. He could not find a pulse and noted that the victim was not moving. Stenstream observed that the victim\u2019s chest was blue and his legs were stiff. Gabriel opened the door to the back seat of the victim\u2019s rental vehicle, and the defendant and Stenstream put the victim inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The defendant went to Lucia\u2019s apartment, where he spoke with his wife, who by then had arrived. After inquiring about the victim, the defendant\u2019s wife went out to the victim\u2019s rented automobile where she saw him in the back seat. She observed that the victim\u2019s eyes were open and he was not moving; his wrist was by his forehead in a fixed position. She started crying and screaming, and yelled at the defendant, \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d The defendant drove off with the victim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The defendant\u2019s wife went inside Stenstream\u2019s apartment, and he gave her the victim\u2019s jacket, shoes, and wallet. She saw blood \u201ceverywhere\u201d in the living room, including on the walls and on the floor. After about five to ten minutes, she went to Morton Hospital in Taunton, where the defendant had taken the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">While in the entrance area to the emergency room, the defendant attempted to perform chest compressions on the victim. Medical personnel took over and brought the victim into an examination room. It became immediately clear to the staff that the victim was in a state of rigor mortis and was dead. A physician pronounced the victim dead at 11:05 p.m. The physician then spoke with the defendant, who provided the victim\u2019s name and stated that he was his friend from Florida. The defendant also told the doctor that the victim had gone out for a cigarette and that, when he did not return about fifteen minutes later, the defendant went to check on him, finding him outside on the ground. In response to questions posed by the doctor, the defendant stated that he did not think that the victim had ingested any drugs. The defendant was visibly upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Police arrived shortly thereafter and, after speaking with the emergency room physician, talked with the defendant in the family room.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In summary, the defendant gave two different accounts of how the victim came to be injured. In his original version of events, the defendant stated that the victim had taken a handful of pills and then went outside to make some telephone calls. The defendant stated that, when the victim had not returned thirty minutes later, he went to check on the victim and found him outside, lying on the ground and bleeding from the head. The defendant carried the victim upstairs; tried to revive him with ice cubes; and when that did not work, decided about ninety minutes later to bring him to the hospital. In the subsequent version of events, the defendant stated that he and the victim were visiting in Stenstream\u2019s apartment when three males arrived to make a drug deal. The men pulled out guns. The defendant escaped downstairs. After the men left, the defendant returned upstairs and found the victim with zip ties around his legs. The victim was alive and stated that he did not want to go to the hospital, but the defendant brought him anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Police transported the defendant from the hospital to the police station, where he was interviewed after being given Miranda warnings. In keeping with the motion judge\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, a redacted version of the recorded interview was admitted in evidence and played for the jury. During that portion of the interview, the defendant did not admit to killing the victim himself or to being involved in the killing, or robbing (or attempting to rob) the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The medical examiner who conducted the victim\u2019s autopsy opined that he died as a result of asphyxia by strangulation. She testified that he suffered multiple blunt force injuries to his head, neck, and extremities. He had a gaping laceration to his scalp hidden in his hairline and rib fractures that perforated his lungs. Toxicology screen results revealed that the victim did not have any drugs or alcohol in his system.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">On November 4, the defendant\u2019s wife went to Morin\u2019s home. Morin told her that he owed the defendant money and gave her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>$5,000. Morin also said he had done a lot for the defendant. On November 5, Morin asked Matteson to meet him. Morin told him that he should say \u201cnothing to anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">After speaking to the defendant, the police secured Sten-stream\u2019s apartment, where they recovered zip ties from the kitchen trash and various items in a dumpster in the rear of the building. They took samples of various red-brown stains from within the apartment, including in the living room and back stairwell, which tested positive for human blood. Deoxyribo-nucleic acid (DNA) testing revealed that the victim\u2019s DNA was present on one of the zip ties recovered. Further, testing showed that the victim\u2019s DNA was recovered from a stain on the defendant\u2019s shirt and a stain on the upper right arm of the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Telephone records admitted in evidence at trial established that, on the afternoon of November 3, the telephones of the defendant and the victim were in communication with each other. In addition, between noon and midnight on that day, there were thirty-six contacts between the telephones of the defendant and Morin, including several calls made between 8:45 and 11:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The defendant did not testify. His trial counsel argued that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses were not to be believed for various reasons, including the fact that most had entered into agreements with the Commonwealth providing for their immunity. Defense counsel also argued that the defendant\u2019s statements were not voluntarily made and that the police investigation had been inadequate. Defense counsel argued that the defendant had not been involved and did not share Morin\u2019s intent to rob or to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion to suppress statements, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>The defendant filed a motion to suppress statements he made on November 3 and 4 at the hospital and at the police station, claiming, on State and Federal constitutional grounds, that his statements should be suppressed because they were not preceded by an adequate recitation of the Miranda warnings. He also argued that he did not make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights and that his statements were not voluntary because of his state of exhaustion, drug ingestion, and drug withdrawal. Last, the defendant asserted that police failed to honor his invocation of his right to counsel. After an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>hearing, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, made the following relevant findings of fact, which we supplement where necessary with evidence in the record that is uncontroverted and that was implicitly credited by the motion judge, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008), and with the video recording of the interview of the defendant, which was admitted in evidence at the motion hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In the late evening of November 3, 2009, Dr. Peter Bosco, an emergency room physician at Morton Hospital, encountered the defendant and the victim, who was slumped over in a wheelchair. The defendant was attempting to perform chest compressions on the victim. The defendant told Dr. Bosco that he had been at the same residence with the victim; that the victim went outside to smoke; and that, when the victim had not returned after fifteen minutes, the defendant went to check on him, finding him there. The defendant did not tell the doctor that he had brought the victim upstairs after finding him. The defendant was agitated and upset, which the doctor construed as appropriate for someone who cared about another.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">After examining the victim, Dr. Bosco spoke with the defendant in the family room. He informed the defendant that his friend was dead and that something did not \u201cadd up\u201d because rigor mortis already had set in, suggesting that the victim had been dead for several hours. The defendant appeared to be in disbelief; he was distraught and upset. His speech was clear, but he was agitated. As the defendant spoke with Dr. Bosco, he recovered his composure and pleaded with the doctor to do something to resuscitate the victim. Dr. Bosco brought the defendant into the examination room to see the victim. Around this time, shortly after 11 p.m., Taunton police Officer Ralph Schlageter and Detective Robert Schwartz separately arrived in uniform at the examination room in response to a dispatch of a report that someone had brought a deceased person to the hospital\u2019s emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Dr. Bosco escorted the defendant to the family room. He explained to the defendant that, because the victim\u2019s death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>suspicious, it would need to be investigated by the police and a medical examiner would take over custody of the body. He asked the defendant to stay so police could speak with him. The defendant was agreeable. No police officers were in the family room at this time. Dr. Bosco had not been asked by police to speak to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Dr. Bosco left the family room and informed Schlageter that the victim had a head wound and was in state of rigor mortis when he arrived, and that the defendant was the person who had brought the victim to the hospital. Dr. Bosco did not suspect the defendant of any involvement in the death and did not communicate any such suspicion to Schlageter or to any other officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Schlageter then spoke with the defendant in the family room. No one else was present. The defendant was disheveled and visibly upset. He was crying, was almost hysterical, and put his head in his hands. When Schlageter spoke with the defendant, Schlageter viewed him as a concerned friend, not as someone who had been involved in the victim\u2019s death. The defendant did not appear to have been drinking, but seemed to be \u201con something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">After a couple of minutes, the defendant calmed down so that Schlageter could understand him. They spoke for approximately five minutes. The defendant was coherent and clear. He identified himself and provided his date of birth as well as the victim\u2019s full name. The defendant gave Schlageter the following account. Around 9:30 p.m., the victim had visited the defendant in Sten-stream\u2019s apartment. Sometime later, the victim announced that he wanted to go outside to smoke and to make telephone calls. About twenty to thirty minutes later, the defendant went downstairs to check on the victim and found him on the ground beaten up. The defendant carried the victim upstairs back to the apartment. Because the defendant knew that the victim had a history of drug use, the defendant thought that he may be overdosing, so he laid him on a bed and tried to revive him with ice. The defendant became concerned when he saw the victim\u2019s skin turn blue. Schlageter did not question the defendant further. Schlageter left the room, leaving the defendant alone inside. Schlageter did not give any Miranda warnings to the defendant before or during their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Taunton police Detectives Susan Dykas and Shawn Mulhem arrived at the hospital. They were not in uniform. They viewed the victim, observing the large cut on his head, and learned that he had been dead for a significant period of time. Schlageter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>informed the detectives that the defendant had brought the victim\u2019s dead body to the hospital and was in the family room. Schlageter also told the detectives the substance of his conversation with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The detectives entered the family room, where they found the defendant alone and crying. The detectives did not give any Miranda warnings to the defendant before speaking with him, or at any time while they spoke with him at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Mulhem recognized the defendant from the defendant\u2019s previous employment as a bouncer at a nightclub and asked what was going on. The defendant gave the following account of what had occurred earlier that day. The defendant had been \u201cchilling\u201d at a second-floor apartment with the victim, who was a friend visiting from Florida. The victim went downstairs to make a telephone call, and when he did not return, the defendant went downstairs and found him unconscious and bleeding from the head. The defendant dragged the victim back upstairs and tried to revive him with ice packs. The defendant took the victim to the hospital when he was not doing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Mulhem was the primary questioner and expressed disbelief that the defendant had dragged the victim upstairs. The defendant then gave a different account of what had occurred. In this version, the defendant stated that the victim came from Florida to use the apartment for a drug deal. Two white males and one black male entered the apartment and argued with the victim and brandished guns, at which point the defendant went downstairs to his sister\u2019s apartment. When the commotion was over, the defendant returned upstairs, where he discovered that the victim had been beaten up, his legs bound with zip ties, and his mouth gagged. The victim initially was conscious, but when he lost consciousness, the defendant carried him downstairs with the help of the defendant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law, and drove him to the hospital. The defendant did not make any statements that suggested in any way that he was responsible for the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The detectives were aware of the defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s prior involvement with drugs, and suspected that the defendant had more information, but not that he was responsible for causing the victim\u2019s death. With the defendant\u2019s permission, they searched his cellular telephone and noticed numerous calls to a single number (Morin\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The detectives spent thirty to forty minutes with the defendant in the family room. During this time, he squirmed quite a bit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>appeared visibly nervous and upset. He alternated between calmness and lucidity, and incoherency. The defendant\u2019s eyes were somewhat bloodshot, and he appeared to be under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">After they finished speaking with the defendant, Mulhem told the defendant, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to [the] police station and finish this interview because we have to sort through this.\u201d Mulhem directed Schlageter to drive the defendant to the police station. Schlageter escorted the defendant to the back seat of a marked police cruiser, which locked and could not be opened from the inside. He did not handcuff the defendant. He did not give Miranda warnings prior to or during the transport to the station, he did not ask the defendant any questions on the way there, and the defendant did not make any statements along the way or on his arrival at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On arrival, at about 12:45 a.m., Schlageter brought the defendant into the station through the front lobby and to an interview room. There, Mulhem and State police Trooper Anthony Spencer spoke with him. The interview was audio and video recorded, and the defendant was aware that the interview was being recorded. The interview lasted about two hours and forty-five minutes, excluding a one-hour break after two and one-half hours into the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">At the beginning of the interview Mulhem read the defendant the Miranda warnings from a preprinted form. The defendant nodded that he understood. After, at 12:55 a.m., the defendant signed a waiver of rights from a notification of rights form, which he did not read. Under the signature line on the form, the form stated: \u201cPerson in Custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">After signing the form, the following exchange between the defendant and Mulhem occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Defendant: \u201cI would feel more comfortable if I had a lawyer right now talking, but if you want to show me pictures and names, I\u2019ll give it to you. Because, honestly, like obviously I do not want to get more in a jam than this. I will show you who did it and everything. I just want out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">Mulhern: \u201cOkay. So, why do you \u2014 you feel like you want to \u2014 if you don\u2019t want to talk, that\u2019s your right \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">Defendant: \u201cThe thing is I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">Mulhern: \u201c\u2014 but if you feel like you need a lawyer, you know \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Defendant: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. Like, honestly, I\u2019ll help you but it seems like what do I say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">Mulhern: \u201cOkay. Why don\u2019t we ask you questions \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Defendant: \u201cAlright.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">Mulhern: \u201c\u2014 and we can go from there. We can find out the story first.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Defendant: \u201cAlright.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">For the first hour of the interview, the defendant did not appear to be particularly tired, but he was experiencing some pain in his groin. He told the officers that he had stopped dealing drugs and went \u201ccold turkey\u201d two or three months earlier because his marriage and job were being affected. He admitted that if he could \u201cmake a quick buck here and there,\u201d he would sell drugs, but that he did not \u201ctouch anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">After about one hour of questioning, the defendant appeared nervous and jumpy. As Mulhern began to convey a high degree of skepticism of the defendant\u2019s statements, the defendant increasingly slouched. The defendant remained alert and consistently resisted suggestions from the officers and confrontational harangues from Mulhern. He insisted that he was not part of the drug deal and that he did not personally struggle with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Around this time, the tenor of the interview changed. Mulhern frequently interrupted the defendant and, for a period of about twenty minutes, screamed at him in an accusatory tone. The defendant hung his head, but did not buckle. At this point, now about ninety minutes into the interview, the defendant appeared to be tired and started answering some questions with his head down. He adamantly insisted that he did not push or \u201ctussle\u201d with the victim or put his hands on him accidentally or during an argument. The defendant was not easily led by the officers and spontaneously clarified several matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">At one point the officers left the defendant alone for several minutes, during which time he sniffled and his legs were shaking. The defendant rubbed his eyes and looked exhausted. When the officers returned, the defendant continued to give coherent, exculpatory responses although visibly tired. For example, when confronted with the fact that bedding (from the apartment) had been stripped and left in a dumpster, the defendant denied having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>done that. He stated that he had not touched the bedding and that cameras at the location would show that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do shit.\u201d He also did not let himself be trapped by Mulhem\u2019s mischaracter-izations of what he had said. After about one hour and fifty minutes of questioning had elapsed, the defendant reiterated his statement that he had bolted from the apartment. Although his legs were shaking and he was tired, the defendant was sufficiently alert after two hours of interrogation to divulge the password on his cellular telephone and to go through photographs shown to him by police, indicating what persons he did and did not recognize. He was also careful to identify one person as \u201clooking like\u201d one of the men who had been in the apartment fighting with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The defendant had self-protective explanations for, among other things, the pain in his groin, the money found in his pocket ($1,600), the injury to his upper lip, a fresh scratch, the blood on his clothes, the time discrepancies in his statements, and his delay in taking the victim to the hospital. From the defendant\u2019s responses, it was clear that he understood what the officers were asking him and saying to him. He showed himself to be quick-witted and consistently self-protective. While he added details as the interview proceeded, the defendant did not at any point admit any involvement in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">After viewing the photographs, the defendant\u2019s exhaustion began to overcome his ability to speak in a fashion such that his statements could be considered the product of a rational intellect and free will. The defendant\u2019s physical state, compounded by Mulhem\u2019s shouting, made it unlikely that the defendant\u2019s statements from this point onward were the result of his free and willing act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When left alone for two minutes, the defendant moaned and mumbled. His legs shook badly, and his head lolled back and forth. When the officers returned, about two and one-half hours into the interview, the defendant continued speaking, but his head was usually facing down and leaning to the side. His legs were constantly shaking. He did not make much eye contact with the officers, and his responses were often too inaudible to be coherent. His demeanor was so indicative of someone who had lost his ability to focus that Mulhem commented, \u201cI mean you\u2019re falling apart . . . doing drugs and dealing drugs . . . .\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>defendant was half-asleep, and he rubbed his eyes often, yawned, and barely was able to keep his eyes open. The questioning, however, did not stop. When a few minutes later the defendant asked if they could finish the interview the next day, he was rebuffed. As the defendant continued to insist that he was \u201cexhausted out of [his] mind,\u201d Mulhem started to scream at him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">After about two hours and thirty-six minutes of questioning, the defendant twice asked for a lawyer, which Mulhern and Spencer simply ignored. Spencer finally ended the interview, at which point the defendant was arrested for misleading a police officer under the witness intimidation statute. He later was charged with murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The motion judge concluded that the defendant had not been in \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), until Mulhem instructed that the interview at the hospital would continue at the police station and directed a uniformed officer to take the defendant there.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge further determined that the defendant was in custody at the station when he was given Miranda warnings. The judge concluded that after the defendant was given the Miranda warnings, he voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived them. She did not consider his initial statement that he would \u201cfeel more comfortable\u201d with a lawyer as an unambiguous invocation of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Noting that the defendant\u2019s initial waiver of the Miranda rights does not irretrievably bind him, the judge pointed out that the Commonwealth conceded that the defendant unambiguously invoked his right to counsel when he stated after two hours and thirty-six minutes of questioning that he needed a lawyer. While the judge agreed that the defendant had invoked his right to counsel at this point, she determined that somewhat earlier in the interrogation (see note 16, <em>supra), </em>the defendant\u2019s statements were no longer voluntary. The judge based her conclusion on the circumstances of Mulhem\u2019s shouting at the defendant, the defendant\u2019s state of exhaustion, and the after-effects of whatever substance the defendant had ingested during the day. Suppression of the defendant\u2019s statements from that point of the interview and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>onward therefore was necessary. Based on these findings, the motion judge denied in part and allowed in part the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">b. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe review de novo any findings of the motion judge that were based entirely on the documentary evidence, i.e., the recorded interviews of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>469 Mass. 531, 539 (2014). \u201cWe accept other findings that were based on testimony at the evidentiary hearing and do not disturb them where they are not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, we \u2018make an independent determination as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. 199, 205 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">c. <em>Validity of waiver of Miranda rights. </em>The defendant argues that his waiver of Miranda rights was invalid because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made. Because the defendant was advised of, and waived, the Miranda rights, the issue becomes whether the Commonwealth has proved \u201cthe validity of a Miranda waiver beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 669 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBeau, </em>451 Mass. 244, 254-255 (2008). \u201cTo be valid the waiver must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 670. \u201cIn determining whether a waiver was made voluntarily, the court must examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cRelevant factors to consider include, but are not limited to, \u2018promises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence, and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>432 Mass. 82, 86 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s conclusion that his waiver was valid for several factual reasons, including that he had not been asked whether he wished to waive his rights; he had not been asked whether he wished to speak with police; and the fact that his signature on the notification of rights form indicated only that he was advised of the Miranda warnings, not that he had waived them. The defendant also argues that he \u201cobviously\u201d was undergoing drug withdrawal. We conclude that the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The defendant signed the notification of rights form, which expressly indicates that the person signing understands the Miranda rights and \u201cknowingly waive[s]\u201d those rights; heard the recitation of the Miranda warnings; and nodded, which reasonably could be inferred as indicating that he understood them. Thereafter, he engaged in discussion with the officers. \u201cThis conduct hardly expressed an unwillingness to continue speaking with police that could be \u2018considered tantamount to the exercise of the right to remain silent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Garcia, 443 Mass. 824, 833 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 662 (1995). Further, during the admitted portion of the interview, the defendant appeared alert, coherent, calm for the most part, and appropriately responsive, and appeared to understand the situation and what was asked of him. He was drinking a beverage, and the interview was conducted in an interview room as opposed to a cell. Although the defendant very well may have been under the influence of drugs, there was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s resulting physical condition was so disabling as to render his waiver invalid. The judge thoroughly considered the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s likely drug use, which does not compel a conclusion that his Miranda waiver was invalid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>469 Mass. 721, 728 n.7 (2014), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>466 Mass. 268, 274-275 (2013). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>462 Mass. 620, 625-627 (2012). The evidence supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s Miranda waiver was valid.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">d. <em>Invocation of right to counsel. </em>The defendant contends that the motion judge erred in concluding that his statement, made after he was given the Miranda warnings, \u201cI would feel more comfortable if I had a lawyer right now talking, but if you want to show me pictures and names, I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d was an ambiguous and therefore ineffective invocation of the right to counsel. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">During a custodial interrogation, \u201c[i]f the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u2018the interrogation must cease.\u2019 If he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>requests counsel, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>463 Mass. 273, 285 (2012), quoting <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 481 (1981). The request or invocation of counsel must be \u201ca sufficiently clear statement such \u2018that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 150 (2011), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Here, the defendant\u2019s statement, when viewed in context, was not an unambiguous request for counsel and reflected a desire ultimately to go forward with questioning without an attorney. \u201cWhen a suspect\u2019s statement... simply reflects his musing about the possibility of stopping the questioning until he has spoken with an attorney, we have consistently found the statement to be too ambiguous to constitute an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>455 Mass. 388, 398 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>467 Mass. 96, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 356 (2014). We conclude that the defendant\u2019s statement falls into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant further argues that, even if his invocation of the right to counsel had been ambiguous, the police were required under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to clarify the defendant\u2019s intent before proceeding with questioning. In support of this contention, he cites to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 349 (2012), and <em>Santos, </em>463 Mass. at 286. Those cases, however, do not support the defendant\u2019s argument that such a clarification was required here. In <em>Santos, supra </em>at 285-286, we suggested clarification as the better practice because the defendant initially had unequivocally invoked his right to counsel but then continued, without any intervening comment or question by police, to speak. We concluded that, in those circumstances, the police could have been uncertain concerning the nature and scope of the defendant\u2019s invocation, and before recommencing questioning would be \u201centitled to ask a question to clarify the defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. In <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 343, we dealt with a defendant\u2019s unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent, not an invocation of a right to counsel. No clarification is required where, as the judge found here, the defendant equivocated, stating only that he would \u201cfeel more comfortable with an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">e. <em>Statutory right to a telephone call. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that his statements during the interview should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>suppressed because the police did not afford him his statutory right under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A, to use the telephone when he arrived at the police station or after questioning had exceeded one hour. This right \u201cdid not accrue until he was formally arrested.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>457 Mass. 152, 159 (2010). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 719 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>441 Mass. 358, 374-375 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">f. <em>Detention of the defendant. </em>For the first time on appeal the defendant argues that his involuntary transport to the police station for questioning amounted to an unlawful arrest under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because it was not supported by probable cause.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He asserts that the entirety of his interview with police therefore should be suppressed as the fruit of the illegal arrest. Last, the recitation of the Miranda warnings, he contends, did not purge the taint of the illegal arrest. Because the defendant did not raise this claim below, we review for error and, if so, whether the error caused a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tu Trinh, </em>458 Mass. 776, 782-783 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Generally speaking, there are three categories of police-citizen encounters: \u201c(1) consensual encounters which do not implicate the Fourth Amendment;[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] (2) investigative detentions which are Fourth Amendment seizures of limited scope and duration and must be supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity[, see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1 (1968);<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] and (3) arrests, the most intrusive of Fourth Amendment seizures and reasonable only if supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>682 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>920, 925 (10th Cir. 2012). Here, the judge\u2019s decision did not address the issue (because the defendant did not make the argument below), but her findings instruct our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The judge found that once Mulhern determined that further questioning would continue at the police station and directed an officer to transport the defendant there, the defendant was in custody, albeit for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>She further found, based on the notification of rights form designating the defendant as a \u201cperson in custody,\u201d and statements made by the interviewing officers, that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have felt free to leave. We agree with the defendant that, in these circumstances, his involuntary transport and detention for interrogation purposes amounted to a \u201cseizure\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes and became the functional equivalent of an arrest.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In <em>Kaupp </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>538 U.S. 626, 629 (2003), the United States Supreme Court stated the settled rule that \u201cinvoluntary transport to a police station for questioning is \u2018sufficiently like arres[t] to invoke the traditional rule that arrests may constitutionally be made only on probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630, quoting <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816 (1985). See <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 503 (1983) (concluding that airport detention exceeded limits of investigatory stop and amounted to de facto arrest); <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 212 (1979) (concluding that where petitioner was taken from neighbor\u2019s home to police vehicle, transported to police station, and placed in interrogation room, detention was \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from traditional arrest and required probable cause or judicial authorization); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>729 F. Supp. 2d 479, 487 (D. Mass. 2010) (stating that limitation on valid investigatory stop is that suspect may not be removed to police station without his or her consent). Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cthe line is crossed when the police, without probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a person from his home or other place in which he is entitled to be and transport him to the police station, where he is detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes.\u201d <em>Hayes, supra. </em>\u201cIn the name of investigating a person who is no more than suspected of criminal activity, the police may not... seek to verify their suspicions by means that approach the conditions of an arrest.\u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 499. \u201cNothing is more clear than that the Fourth Amendment was meant to prevent wholesale intrusions upon the personal security of our citizenry, whether these intrusions be termed \u2018arrests\u2019 or \u2018investigatory detentions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721, 726-727 (1969). See 2 W.E. Ringel, Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions \u00a7 23:5, at 23-18 (2d ed. 2014) (Supreme Court has held that when police take suspect involuntarily for station house questioning, such custodial detention requires probable cause as it is equivalent to formal arrest; investigatory detentions not requiring probable cause must be brief in duration and not lengthy investigation to develop probable cause). Many United Stated Circuit Courts of Appeals have followed this precedent.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Because there was no probable cause to arrest the defendant<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or judicial authorization to do so, \u201cwell-established precedent requires suppression of the [statement] unless that [statement] was \u2018an act of free will [sufficient] to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kaupp, </em>538 U.S. at 632-633, quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 486 (1963). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, </em>444 Mass. 444, 453 (2005). Demonstrating that the underlying illegality is purged from taint falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>on the Commonwealth. See <em>Kaupp, supra </em>at 633; <em>Damiano, supra </em>at 454. Relevant considerations include \u201c(1) the temporal proximity of the admission to the arrest; (2) the presence of intervening circumstances between the arrest and the admission; (3) the observance of the Miranda rule subsequent to the unlawful arrest; and (4) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d <em>Damiano, supra </em>at 455. The observance of the Miranda rule standing alone is insufficient to remove the taint of an unlawful detention. See <em>Kaupp, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Although the officers recited the Miranda warnings to the defendant, consideration of the remaining factors reveals little to no attenuation between the arrest and interrogation. The defendant was questioned within ten minutes of arriving at the police station, and no intervening circumstances occurred before the interview commenced. Further, in transporting the defendant to the police station for interrogation, the police sought expediently to confirm or to dispel whether the defendant had involvement in the victim\u2019s death. On balance of the factors, we conclude that the Commonwealth has not satisfied its burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statement resulted from an unlawful arrest does not end our inquiry. We must determine, under the circumstances, whether the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s interview with police (the portion that the motion judge did not suppress) created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>469 Mass. 410, 417 (2014). The relevant inquiry is whether the jury\u2019s verdict finding that the defendant was guilty of felony-murder would likely have been the same had the interview been suppressed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The defendant argues that his recorded interview was the \u201cclearest and least equivocal evidence that any robbery or attempted robbery actually took place in the apartment.\u201d We disagree. The evidence, apart from the defendant\u2019s statements to the police during the recorded interview, was strongly supportive of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the defendant had participated in a joint venture to rob the victim on the night of the murder. We recount the relevant evidence below to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The defendant had already told police at the hospital that the victim was at the apartment for a drug deal; that three men entered, some of whom had guns; that the defendant escaped downstairs to his sister\u2019s apartment; and that, after the men left, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the defendant found the victim alive, but badly beaten. Thus, the purpose of the encounter with the victim did not derive solely from the defendant\u2019s recorded interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Although the defendant denied any involvement in the crime, it was the defendant\u2019s wife who firmly placed the defendant in the midst of the scheme to rob the victim. Her testimony that the defendant instructed the victim to meet at Stenstream\u2019s apartment instead of his wife\u2019s apartment as originally planned; that the defendant packaged between $42,000 and $58,000 in cash and took it with him when he left to meet the victim; and that the defendant questioned someone on the telephone before he left for Stenstream\u2019s apartment as to whether he was \u201cgoing to get it back\u201d established the defendant as a willing and necessary participant in the plot to rob the victim. Also, Matteson\u2019s testimony that Morin, the day before the killing, had informed him of a plot involving Morin, the defendant, and others to rob the victim at an apartment owned by the defendant further corroborated the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s extremely damaging testimony. From this testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that <em>the defendant </em>was involved in a robbery or attempted robbery of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">To be sure, some of the defendant\u2019s statements in his recorded interview added information that the jury did not hear or learn elsewhere at trial. For instance, in the recorded interview the defendant stated that the victim told the three men that they owed him money and that the victim had a large plastic bag in his pocket that contained drugs. This information, however, did not implicate the defendant in the robbery or attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">While the defendant\u2019s recorded interrogation added for the first time that one of the men hit the victim with a gun, that detail did not add anything of significant value, as the defendant kept to his story that he \u201cbolted\u201d as soon as he had the opportunity and that he did not have any involvement with the three men and the incident that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Also, the defendant\u2019s admission in his recorded interview that $1,000, from the $1,600 discovered on his person that night, was payment from the victim for use of the apartment was not relevant to the defendant\u2019s participation in a robbery or attempted robbery of the victim. Rather, the admission concerning the money only strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s existing evidence that the defendant was at that time, contrary to his statements, still involved in drug dealing and perhaps even this particular drug deal. None of the defendant\u2019s statements suggested that the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>deal was a ruse for a robbery or attempted robbery. That suggestion came from Matteson during his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"ARW\">We turn now to the information obtained from the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone, which the defendant argues derived from the illegal interrogation. While at the hospital when he was not in custody, the defendant granted permission to police to look at his cellular telephone. From this examination, police learned that the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone recently had been in communication with Morin\u2019s telephone numerous times. Further, as we have already noted, the defendant\u2019s wife testified about communications between Morin and the defendant on the day before the victim\u2019s death, and a telephone call from Morin looking for the defendant after something had \u201chappened\u201d with \u201cthat kid\u201d who was \u201ctough.\u201d Also, telephone records of Morin\u2019s cellular telephone independently supported the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the telephones of the two men had been in frequent communication before and after the victim\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s telephone records were cumulative of Morin\u2019s records and other evidence, and any effect on the jury from their admission thus was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A close examination of the defendant\u2019s statements in the recording shows that his statements strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the defendant was involved in drugs and drug dealing, but not in a robbery or attempted robbery of the victim. Concerning the robbery or attempted robbery, the interview bore little on the jury\u2019s determination that the defendant was a joint venturer in the robbery or attempted robbery of the victim. The significant evidence, which the defendant overlooks, was the testimony of his sister and her husband regarding what they heard that night above them; his wife\u2019s testimony regarding the events of the night; and Matteson\u2019s testimony that Morin had revealed to Matteson what had been planned and who was involved the day before the victim\u2019s death. In these circumstances, we conclude that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage occurred by the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s statements made during his interview with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">2. <em>Motion to withdraw. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in \u201cforcing\u201d him to trial with defense counsel who unsuccessfully had sought to withdraw his representation of the defendant just two days before trial. He further contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel because he was forced to stand trial with defense counsel who did not want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to represent him and who purportedly had admitted to preparing his defense at a \u201clow level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On October 29, 2012, which was two days prior to trial, defense counsel, who was retained by the defendant and his family, filed a motion to withdraw. In support of that motion, defense counsel filed an affidavit stating the following. Communication between defense counsel and the defendant had \u201cbroken down.\u201d Defense counsel had learned that the defendant recently had accused him of \u201cjamming him up,\u201d not preparing his case, and forcing him to accept a plea to murder in the second degree. The defendant had telephoned his office on October 25 and had told an associate that he was dissatisfied with defense counsel\u2019s representation and no longer wished for him to serve as his trial counsel. Defense counsel indicated that the defendant felt that counsel was not acting in the defendant\u2019s best interests; that he had not properly prepared the defendant\u2019s case; and that, by advising the defendant to take a plea, he had abandoned the defendant\u2019s case. Defense counsel stated that the defendant wanted to be heard by the court and that he had advised the defendant and his family that they needed to arrange for successor counsel. Defense counsel went on to state that, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s position, he was continuing to prepare the case for trial. Defense counsel also represented that, with several exceptions regarding some specific pretrial preparation (preparing a witness list, for example), he had been fully prepared for trial prior to the defendant\u2019s telephone call on October 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The judge, who was also the trial judge, held a hearing on October 29. The defendant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">\u201cI no longer trust [defense counsel], I lost all my faith in him. I feel [that he] hasn\u2019t taken my best interest, fifteen to life, when I\u2019m one hundred per cent innocent. He also told me he\u2019ll put no more effort into my case. I\u2019m indigent. And I have lawyers that state that, your Honor. On top of that, writing letters that you\u2019re going to proceed on my trial at a low level.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The defendant added that he was dissatisfied because he requested, but was not afforded, either an expert to review the medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report or a private investigator to speak with \u201ca few people.\u201d The defendant also wanted \u201csome motions in\u201d after he \u201clost\u201d the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The letters to which the defendant referred included one dated October 15, 2012, from defense counsel to the defendant, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the defendant submitted to the judge. In the one-page letter, defense counsel expressed concern regarding the large amount owed for his services and expenditures. Defense counsel also wrote, \u201cMuch work remains on your case although I am ready on a low level. I feel however you want additional work and I am willing to provide it subject to me getting paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Defense counsel confirmed at the hearing that he had sent the defendant the October 15 letter. He explained what he meant by the phrase \u201clow level,\u201d which included preparing indexes for every police report, every grand jury hearing, and every other hearing, including the extensive suppression hearing. \u201cLow level\u201d preparation, according to defense counsel, did not constitute extensive trial preparation, which involves working \u201cday and night\u201d and weekends in order to try the case when the trial date is firm. When defense counsel authored the letter, he was not yet conducting actual trial preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Defense counsel told the judge that communication between him and the defendant deteriorated for several reasons, including that the defendant refused to accept the impact of our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Zanetti, 454 Mass. 449, 466-468 (2009), which effectively erased the distinction between principal and joint liability with regard to joint venture liability. In addition, defense counsel informed the judge that he had consulted at least two doctors to review the autopsy report, and the defendant did not want to accept their opinions that there was no basis to dispute the victim\u2019s cause of death. The defendant also \u201crejected] entirely\u201d the fact that his wife, who apparently was not going to testify against him, had changed her mind and would be testifying \u201cto some major things that are very problematic.\u201d Another damaging fact that the defendant refused to accept was his sister Lucia\u2019s expected testimony that, on the night of the killing, after the group had run out of Stenstream\u2019s apartment, she heard the defendant and another voice from Stenstream\u2019s apartment, which was significant because the testimony supported an inference that the victim had been alive and alone with the defendant. Defense counsel stated that his plea recommendation had nothing to do with \u201cthe payment of fees, but an evaluation of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Defense counsel sought to withdraw, but stated he would \u201cdo [his] best\u201d were the judge to order him to proceed. The judge ruled that the defendant had the right to bring in new counsel \u201cprovided new counsel is prepared to impanel this case [in two days].\u201d The judge noted that the case commenced in \u201cthe early portion of 2010\u201d and that the Commonwealth \u201ccan be prejudiced by the denial of a speedy trial as its witnesses\u2019 memories may dull and wane by the passage of time.\u201d The judge added that the motion judge had actually agreed with defense counsel regarding a portion of the motion to suppress, so that it was not fair to state that the motion had been lost. The judge stated that an attorney is not to \u201coperate simply as an accommodating party\u201d and is required to be effective in plea negotiations in addition to a trial. He validated the challenges defense counsel faced based on the circumstances and facts of the case. Last, the judge rejected the accusation that defense counsel had abandoned the defendant, pointing to his voir dire questions and motions in limine that had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The judge declined to continue the case to permit the defendant to obtain new counsel. The defendant stated that he did not see how it could be possible to try the case in two days with new counsel. The judge denied the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We review the denial of a motion to withdraw counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 297 (2004). We also review the denial of a request for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>467 Mass. 115, 128 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] guarantees the right to effective assistance of counsel, but it \u2018does not invariably require a \u201cmeaningful attorney-client relationship.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 600 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 806 (1985). \u201cFreedom to change counsel ... is restricted on the commencement of trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 711 (1993). \u201cA motion to discharge counsel, when made on the eve of trial, or on the day on which trial is scheduled to begin, \u2018is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tuitt, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>at 804, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moran, 388 Mass. 655, 659 (1983). There is no \u201cmechanical test\u201d that applies. <em>Chavis, supra. </em>A trial judge is to \u201cbalance the movant\u2019s need for additional time against the possible inconvenience, increased costs, and prejudice which may be incurred by the opposing party if the motion is granted. He must also give due weight to the interest in the judicial system in avoiding delays which would not measurably contribute to the resolution of a particular controversy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 51 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Turning to requests for continuances, we have explained that \u201cthere is no \u2018mechanical test\u2019 for determining whether the denial of a continuance constitutes an abuse of discretion because we must examine the unique circumstances of each case, particularly the reasons underlying the request.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>462 Mass. 183, 190 (2012). \u201cA judge should grant a continuance only when justice so requires, balancing the requesting party\u2019s need for additional time against concerns about inconvenience, cost, potential prejudice, and the burden of the delay on both the parties and the judicial system.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>467 Mass. at 128. \u201c[C]ognizant of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional entitlement to assistance of counsel, who \u2018must be afforded \u201ca reasonable opportunity to prepare and to present the defence,\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 128-129, quoting <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. at 50, we have cautioned that \u201ca trial judge may not exercise his discretion in such a way as to impair\u201d this right. <em>Ray, supra </em>at 129, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 85 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Here, the judge gave the defendant the opportunity to explain his reasons for his dissatisfaction with defense counsel and acted within his discretion in denying both the motion to withdraw and the request for a continuance. See <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. at 712 (judge gave defendant \u201cfair opportunity to explain the reasons for his dissatisfaction with trial counsel\u201d). The judge appropriately gave consideration to the facts that the case was scheduled for trial in two days, the defendant had been indicted some two years earlier, and he had not engaged successor counsel. The judge did not misstate the law concerning a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial, but rather, in context, properly considered the defendant\u2019s needs against the legitimate needs of judicial administration, including the need for witness testimony to be unhindered due to the passage of time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilchrest, </em>364 Mass. 272, 276 (1973). The judge could properly take such matters into account even in the absence of evidence of a calculated effort made by the defendant to postpone the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The judge considered the nature and seriousness of the conflict between the defendant and his counsel. See <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. at 297. Implicit in the judge\u2019s conclusion was that he credited defense counsel\u2019s explanation of what he meant by using the phrase \u201clow level.\u201d Further, the judge credited defense counsel\u2019s statements that he was prepared for trial, noting his extensive trial preparation efforts, namely the motions he had filed on the defendant\u2019s behalf and the filings submitted in preparation of jury empanelment. Cf. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. at 48, 57 (error to deny continuance where defense counsel stated he was not prepared). The judge explored the allegations that defense counsel had not met all of the defendant\u2019s demands, finding them unreasonable or unsupported in the circumstances. For these reasons, there is no basis for the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge abused his discretion in failing to reach a different conclusion, namely, that defense counsel had \u201cwashed his hands\u201d of the defendant and was willing to put in only minimal effort for trial. See <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. at 601 (stating that counsel\u2019s failure to meet all of defendant\u2019s demands does not equate with \u201can irreconcilable breakdown of communication\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Last, concerning the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel because he was forced to stand trial with defense counsel who did not want to represent him and who purportedly had admitted to preparing his defense at a \u201clow level,\u201d the \u201cultimate question is whether the defendant likely would be denied the effective assistance of counsel if counsel is not removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the record before us, we conclude that the defendant has failed to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument is predicated on the claims of error we have already addressed and, thus, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">4. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Pursuant to our statutory duty, we discern no basis to reduce the verdict or to order a new trial pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the order denying in part the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements. We affirm the order denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The jury did not indicate the predicate felony on which the verdict was based.
