The shooting came on the heels of an argument between the victim and Brandon Payne, a friend of the defendant. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation. The trial judge subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. On appeal from his conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant claims that (a) his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance; and (b) on the eve of trial, the judge erred by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the identity of an informant who, according to a report prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), had heard that Payne, not the defendant, had shot the victim. We reject the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but remand for further proceedings in connection with his motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. We do not now see cause to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence at trial included the following. Soon after 1 a.m. on a night in November, 2009, police found the victim lying on the ground in a parking lot across the street from a nightclub, with a gunshot wound in the area of his right ear. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he died two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">A .22 caliber Beretta firearm was located at the crime scene. The firearm did not have a magazine in it. Without a magazine, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>could have been loaded manually with one cartridge. A cartridge casing that had been discharged from the gun was found by the sidewalk of the parking lot. A spent projectile recovered from the victim\u2019s body was consistent with that of a .22 caliber projectile.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The events of the night of the shooting were described by Sheffery Johnson, the victim\u2019s cousin. Johnson testified that, on the day of the shooting, she picked up Payne in her truck. Johnson and Payne drove to a parking lot across the street from the nightclub. After they sat in the truck for some time, Johnson saw the victim leaving the nightclub. At about the same time, she saw a \u201cdark skinned guy,\u201d wearing a gray sweat suit, dancing outside the nightclub. Johnson identified that man in court as the defendant. According to Johnson, Payne had introduced her to the defendant, to whom Payne referred as \u201chis boy Black,\u201d \u201c[a] couple days before\u201d the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The victim and his girl friend walked over to Johnson\u2019s truck. Payne and the victim had been involved in \u201csome tension\u201d several months before. Payne got out of the truck and walked over to the victim. Then Payne, the victim, and the victim\u2019s girl friend stood behind the truck and conversed. Johnson, who noticed that the victim was \u201cgetting upset,\u201d walked over and joined the group. Johnson heard Payne and the victim arguing. The victim said, \u201cSee, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you fucking with my sister\u201d \u2014 apparently referring to Johnson \u2014 because you got a smart-ass mouth.\u201d Payne, for his part, asked the victim, \u201cWhy you keep throwing your hands in your pocket?\u201d Johnson \u201cs[aw] a shadow pass [her],\u201d but did not \u201cfocus[ ] on who it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Eventually, the victim suggested that he and Payne \u201cgo around the corner,\u201d \u201cshoot the ones,\u201d and \u201cdap up.\u201d This meant, according to Johnson, that the two men would have a fistfight and, after one of them had won, would \u201cshake hands, and that was going to be it.\u201d Johnson demurred, announcing that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no fighting [her] cousin,\u201d grabbing Payne, and swinging him around back toward the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">As soon as Johnson\u2019s back was turned, she heard a \u201cpop\u201d from the direction of where the victim had been standing. When she turned around, Johnson saw the defendant standing over the victim\u2019s body, trying to tuck a gun into his pants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then run<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>ning off.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Although, in court, Johnson identified the defendant as the man who had been dancing outside the club and who was standing over the victim\u2019s body, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination, as well as the testimony of a police officer called by the defense, indicated that earlier she had thought otherwise. In December, 2009, Johnson was shown a photographic array. She picked out an individual who was not the defendant as a person involved with the shooting. Johnson selected the defendant\u2019s photograph as \u201cfamiliar to her,\u201d but said that she \u201cdid not think he was there that night.\u201d She also told a police officer that \u201cshe did not get a good look [at] the face of the person after the shooting.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Johnson\u2019s trial testimony was corroborated, in part, by a confession reportedly made by the defendant to another witness, Joseph Burns. Burns was in Federal prison at the time of trial, and he acknowledged that he was cooperating with the authorities in the hope of earning a lighter sentence. According to Burns, he and the defendant had done \u201cbusiness\u201d together: Burns had sold the defendant guns, and had bought \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine from him. The guns were .25 caliber, nine millimeter, and .22 caliber. Bums stated that, several months after the shooting, in early 2010, he met the defendant in Lynn, to which the defendant recently had returned from New Jersey. The defendant told Burns that he and the victim \u201chad words after the club,\u201d that the defendant \u201ctold [the victim] [to] take that around the corner,\u201d and that the defendant then \u201cshot [the victim] in the face.\u201d The gun \u201cdidn\u2019t have a clip to it so there was only one round in it, in the chamber.\u201d On the day after that conversation, the defendant asked Burns to take him to the scene, to see if the firearm was still there. Police officers testified that the press were never informed that the gun found at the scene did not have a magazine in it, or that, in a confrontation involving the victim, words were exchanged about \u201cgoing around the corner.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Forensic evidence tied the defendant to the crime. Two latent prints were identified on the weapon found at the scene. One, a palm print on the back strap of the gun, was of sufficient quality and quantity to be analyzed. A police crime-scene analyst testified that, in his opinion, the palm print on the gun was the defendant\u2019s.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Biological matter detected on the gun contained a mixture of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from at least two individuals. The defendant\u2019s DNA matched the major male profile found in that mixture. The probability that the DNA profile of a randomly selected African-American individual would match the major profile was one in 2.1 trillion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Payne was found to be a potential contributor to the mixture. The probability that a randomly selected African-American individual would be a potential contributor to the mixture was one in eight. The victim was excluded as a contributor to the mixture.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Finally, five video recordings were presented at trial. Two were security video recordings filmed at establishments located near the crime scene. The recordings provided little information about the circumstances of the shooting, primarily because of the poor quality of one recording and the unhelpful vantage point of the other. The remaining recordings showed portions of police inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>views with the defendant, with Johnson, and with Burns.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The interview with the defendant revealed that he had a distinctive tattoo that Payne had as well. The interview also showed the defendant denying, in the face of repeated accusations by police, that he had been at the club or the parking lot on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The jury were charged on the fourth day of testimony and returned a guilty verdict on the same day. Represented by new counsel, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, asserting that his trial counsel had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. We remanded the motion to the Superior Court. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion was denied by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant points to an array of ways in which, in his view, the assistance provided by his trial counsel was ineffective. The standard that governs ineffective assistance claims is two-pronged. First, a defendant asserting such a claim must demonstrate \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>460 Mass. 249, 252 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). We have emphasized that \u201c[tjrial tactics which may appear questionable from the vantage point of hindsight, do not amount to ineffective assistance unless \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when undertaken.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 133-134 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 777-778 (1992). A tactic that was reasonable in the circumstances, given the information available at the time, will not support an ineffective assistance claim \u201c[rjegardless [of] whether counsel intended the strategy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>458 Mass. 791, 806 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The second prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard is, ordinarily, that counsel\u2019s inadequate performance \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96. In an appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree, we apply the test \u201cmore favorable to a defendant\u201d of whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>a substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>459 Mass. 235, 244 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>453 Mass. 203, 204-205 (2009). Under this test, we examine \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spray, </em>467 Mass. 456, 472 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>469 Mass. 447 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was first presented in a motion for a new trial. We review the denial of such a motion for \u201ca significant error of law or other abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forte, </em>469 Mass. 469, 488 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986), granting \u201cspecial deference\u201d to the rulings of a motion judge who, like the judge here, also presided at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forte, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra. </em>Nevertheless, on appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree, the defendant \u201chas the benefit of our independent review, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E . . . , of the entire record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 513 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Against the backdrop of these principles, we examine the specific missteps that the defendant attributes to his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">a. <em>Concession that the defendant was at the scene. </em>The defendant\u2019s first argument is that his attorney erred by conceding that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime. Counsel made this concession in passing in his opening statement, stating that, after the shot was fired, \u201cEveryone leaves. They walk away .... Everyone, including Sheffery Johnson and Brandon [Payne] and [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">This tactic was not manifestly unreasonable. \u201cWhen the evidence implicating the defendant is strong, and a concession does not undercut viable defenses, a tactical concession ... is securely within the realm of effective representation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evelyn, </em>470 Mass. 765, 771 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arriaga, </em>438 Mass. 556, 581-582 (2003). This kind of concession commonly is \u201cpart of a litigation strategy to boost [the defendant\u2019s] credibility with th[e] jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>466 Mass. 489, 496 n.8 (2013). The evidence tying the defendant to the crime, including the fingerprint evidence, the DNA evidence, and the detailed confession that the defendant reportedly made to Burns, was strong. It was not unreasonable for his attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>focus on the argument that the defendant was not the shooter, and to enhance the credibility of that defense by conceding a fact that did not contradict it.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">b. <em>Johnson\u2019s testimony. </em>Next, the defendant argues that his attorney erred in connection with two aspects of the testimony provided by Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">First, on direct examination, Johnson was asked whether Payne (her date, and the defendant\u2019s friend) had gone anywhere after the shooting, to which she responded, \u201cI just remember saying, \u2018Who the fuck was that that just shot my cousin?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Your fucking boy just killed my cousin? Who the fuck was that?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Black. That was Black.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel did not move to have the out-of-court statements of Johnson and Payne stricken.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">We cannot say that counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Johnson\u2019s own out-of-court questions to Payne was manifestly unreasonable. Given that Johnson was the only percipient witness to testify, the prospects of a successful defense depended, to some degree, on undermining her identification of the defendant (which had occurred soon before the exchange about which the defendant complains). To this end, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Johnson, and his closing argument, stressed that Johnson had not seen the victim being shot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the judge explained in his written decision on the defendant\u2019s motion, this line of defense stood to gain also from Johnson\u2019s testimony on direct examination that, immediately after the shooting, Johnson asked questions suggesting that she did not know who the shooter was.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Payne\u2019s reported response, \u201cThat was Black,\u201d did not serve the defense\u2019s objectives in the same fashion. But we agree with the judge that counsel\u2019s failure to request that this remark be stricken did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. For at least two reasons, Payne\u2019s reported words were unlikely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>carry significant weight with the jury. First, as the judge noted, Payne himself was present at the scene \u2014 indeed, it was he, not the defendant, who had been quarreling with the victim. Payne thus had a palpable incentive to shift attention away from himself. In addition, given Johnson\u2019s fervent belief, by the time of the trial, that the defendant was the shooter, her stated recollection of Payne\u2019s words was likely to be accorded limited credence. We are persuaded that, in the context of the physical and testimonial evidence as a whole, Johnson\u2019s impassioned recounting of Payne\u2019s answer to her questions did not affect the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The second piece of Johnson\u2019s testimony with which the defendant takes issue occurred on cross-examination. In the course of his questioning, defense counsel showed Johnson an excerpt from one of the security camera recordings. While counsel was locating the relevant portion of the recording, Johnson exclaimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">\u201cYou can see him clearly come from the side of the building and blow my cousin\u2019s fucking brains out. Are you stupid? You clearly can see a hand come out and he blew my fucking cousin\u2019s brains out. Period. He did, him, Black, Barnett [sic], or whatever the hell his name is .... He killed my fucking cousin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The judge told Johnson repeatedly to \u201c[hjold on,\u201d instructing her to \u201cwait until there\u2019s a question.\u201d Defense counsel did not move to strike Johnson\u2019s outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">We discern neither ineffective representation nor prejudice to the defense. Johnson was both the victim\u2019s cousin and herself the physically impaired survivor of a different shooting that occurred sometime before trial (a fact known to counsel, although not disclosed to the jury). Defense counsel properly could have expected that Johnson would be a volatile witness. As the motion judge explained, counsel\u2019s questioning elicited \u201cloud and hyper emotional\u201d testimony from Johnson that \u201cdetracted from her credibility.\u201d Although this testimony included Johnson\u2019s exclamation that the video recording showed the defendant to be the shooter, the jury could see otherwise with their own eyes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>457 Mass. 268, 275 (2010). Consequently, Johnson\u2019s emotional and plainly incorrect description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>the recording provided a benefit to the defense, by diminishing the degree to which her testimony could be perceived as accurate and reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">c. <em>Johnson\u2019s in-court identification. </em>The defendant\u2019s next contention is that his counsel should have moved in limine to prevent Johnson from identifying the defendant in court as the man she had seen dancing outside the nightclub and standing over the victim\u2019s body. As previously mentioned, when Johnson was shown a photographic array soon after the shooting, she selected an individual who was not the defendant as a person involved with the shooting, and stated that she did not think that the defendant\u2019s photograph depicted a man present at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>470 Mass. 255, 262 (2014) <em>(Col</em>lins), expanding on the holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. 228, 241-242 (2014) <em>(Crayton), </em>we announced that, in future cases, in-court identifications generally will not be permitted where a witness participated in a pretrial identification procedure that \u201cproduced something less than an unequivocal positive identification.\u201d An attorney is \u201cnot ineffective for failing to make an objection that would have been futile under the prevailing case law,\u201d however. <em>Crayton, supra </em>at 261, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255, 264 (1983). We therefore must evaluate defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Johnson\u2019s in-court identification testimony under the law as it was at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Before <em>Collins </em>and <em>Crayton, </em>an in-court identification was excluded primarily if, \u201cin the totality of the circumstances, it was \u2018tainted by an out-of-court confrontation . . . that [was] so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastaldo, </em>472 Mass. 16, 31 (2015), quoting <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. at 238 (omission and alteration in original). In all but unusual cases, an impermissibly suggestive out-of-court confrontation would render an in-court identification inadmissible only if the confrontation had been \u201carranged by the Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alcide, </em>472 Mass. 150, 165 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bol Choeurn, </em>446 Mass. 510, 520 (2006). \u201cAn in-court identification was admissible in the absence of any prior out-of-court confrontation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastaldo, supra, </em>citing <em>Crayton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The defendant does not suggest that Johnson\u2019s identification was tainted by any suggestive out-of-court confrontation, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>orchestrated by the Commonwealth or otherwise. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alcide, supra </em>at 153-154 (after failing to make unequivocal identifications of defendant in photographic arrays, two witnesses encountered defendant\u2019s photograph in newspaper articles; one witness also reported being shown photograph of defendant at district attorney\u2019s office). Accordingly, defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Johnson\u2019s identification testimony did not amount to ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">d. <em>Videotaped police interview. </em>As noted, the jury were shown a video recording of a police interview with the defendant. Portions of the recording were redacted. The defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to two aspects of the redacted recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">First, the defendant points out that the recording included out-of-court statements made by the officers. The relevant portion of the interview was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">Q.: \u201cNovember 22, 2009, there was an incident at Soriano\u2019s. You know what Soriano\u2019s is, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">A.: \u201cIt\u2019s like a club.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cI know you were there . . . out in the parking lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">A.: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cThere\u2019s a video with you in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-12\">A.: \u201cYeah?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-13\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cRight? I know you were there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-14\">A.: \u201cI\u2019m gonna see the video?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-15\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cI can show you the video. I don\u2019t have it with me now .... But I know you were there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-16\">A.: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to vouch for that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-17\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cPeople have told me you were there. I got you on a video there. A kid, [the victim], . . . was killed there . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-18\">A.: \u201cYou think I had something to do with that too?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-19\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cNo, man. Were you there? \u2019Cause it doesn\u2019t look good if you tell me you weren\u2019t there and I can clearly see it on video, wearing a grey sweatsuit, right? You own a grey sweatsuit, right? . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>A.: \u201cNah .... That ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me, bro.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, his trial attorney explained that he chose to cooperate with the admission of the recorded interview as \u201ceffectively a way of [the defendant] getting up on the stand and being able to testify he wasn\u2019t there without him taking the stand.\u201d This line of reasoning does often support the strategic judgment that the introduction of out-of-court denials of guilt will benefit the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 799 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011); <em>id. </em>at 799-800, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>453 Mass. 266, 274 (2009), overruled on another ground by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 548 (1989). Here, however, the defendant was shown on the recording denying that he had been at the club on the night of the shooting \u2014 a position that defense counsel had conceded in his opening was not the case. The recorded interview consequently was likely to harm the defense, by suggesting that the defendant had been untruthful upon his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">For related reasons, however, the recording would have been admissible over objection, if one had been made. It is true that \u201cif a defendant is charged with a crime and unequivocally denies it, that denial is not admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>468 Mass. 360, 375 n.20 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant\u2019s denials here, however, were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>of the requisite unequivocal character that would render them inadmissible. In particular, when told by police that a video recording showed him at the club, the defendant first asked \u201cYeah?\u201d and then wondered aloud whether he would be permitted to see that video recording. And although he had initially responded in the negative when told that police knew he had been in the parking lot where the victim was shot, the defendant subsequently said only that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to vouch for that.\u201d These were \u201cequivocal response[s] that could be construed as self-incriminating and therefore admissible,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>465 Mass. 119, 127 (2013); the true meaning of these responses \u201cwas for counsel to argue and the jury to determine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, to the extent that the defendant denied being at the nightclub on the night of the shooting, the evidence suggested, as defense counsel conceded, that that denial was a \u201cfalse statement,\u201d admissible \u201cto show consciousness of guilt.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 649 (1991). In sum, defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the admission of the recording made no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The defendant\u2019s second complaint about the recorded interview is that the recording showed him wearing handcuffs. Defense counsel did not overlook that issue at trial. Before the Commonwealth introduced the video, counsel informed the judge that his \u201c[njumber one concern\u201d was that \u201cthe video has [the defendant] being interviewed while he has handcuffs on his hands.\u201d Counsel argued that \u201c[it] would be prejudicial for the jury to see that.\u201d The judge disagreed, reasoning essentially that the probative value of the recording was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or the risk of misleading the jury.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>470 Mass. 320, 330 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pytou Heang, </em>458 Mass. 827, 851-852 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Although defense counsel arguably failed to preserve an objection to that ruling, this omission worked no harm on the defense. \u201cThe weighing of the prejudicial effect and probative value of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which we will not overturn unless we find palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass. 821, 831 (2006). No such palpable error occurred here. As the judge noted, the admission of a recording showing the defendant to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>handcuffed at the police station, soon after being arrested, does not signal to the jury that the judge has determined the defendant to be dangerous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such a recording is thus less prejudicial than an order that the defendant be handcuffed in the court room. On the other side of the scale, the recorded interview of the defendant was probative both of the defendant\u2019s ties to Payne and of a consciousness of guilt. A preserved objection to the recording thus would have been fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">e. <em>Gun and drug sales. </em>The defendant argues that his attorney should have objected to Burns\u2019s testimony that Burns had sold the defendant guns, and that the defendant had sold Bums dmgs. At least one question posed by defense counsel also referred to these transactions. Again, we discern neither ineffective assistance nor the requisite prejudice to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Defense counsel explained, in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, that his goal in coping with Bums\u2019s testimony was to suggest that it was not plausible that the defendant would have confessed to Burns. In order to achieve this aim, counsel sought to stress that \u201c[tjheir business relationship was just that, a business relationship.\u201d This theme was pursued in counsel\u2019s cross-examination, which revealed that Bums and the defendant \u201cnever really hung around\u201d and that \u201c[ejvery time [Bums] met with [the defendant] was either to sell a gun or to buy drugs.\u201d In closing, counsel disparaged Burns\u2019s assertion that \u201csomeone who ... knows him only for business, has confessed to him about shooting someone.\u201d This tactic was not unreasonable. And although it is possible that counsel could have pursued the same approach while more artfully skirting the precise nature of the defendant\u2019s role in his business dealings with Bums, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below\u201d what would be expected of an \u201cordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>460 Mass. 249, 252 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Nor did counsel\u2019s performance on this score create a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>tial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. In his decision on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge indicated that he would have denied a motion to exclude the evidence that Burns had sold guns to the defendant, if one had been made. Such a decision would not have been reversible error. Evidence showing a defendant\u2019s access to firearms may be \u201cadmissible for purposes other than showing a defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal propensity,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>467 Mass. 141, 157 (2014) <em>(McGee), </em>if the probative value of that evidence \u201coutweigh[s] the likelihood that [it] will have an impact on the jury unfair to a defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 358 (1985). Our recent decisions have indicated that this standard typically will not be satisfied by evidence showing only \u201ca person\u2019s general acquaintance with weapons,\u201d <em>McGee, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, supra, </em>particularly where the weapons in question \u201cdefinitively could not have been used in the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>McGee, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>463 Mass. 116, 122 (2012). Here, while the Commonwealth did not suggest that the victim was shot with a gun sold by Bums,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there also was no \u201cforensic evidence establishing] that the weapon[s] could not have been used to commit the crime.\u201d See <em>McGee, supra </em>at 157-158, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>463 Mass. at 123. And the evidence in question was not only probative of the defendant\u2019s access to firearms; it also represented significant information for the jury to consider in assessing Burns\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the judge provided an appropriate limiting instruction, stating that the jury could consider \u201ctestimony concerning certain involvement that [the defendant] may have had in the trafficking of guns\u201d only as to \u201cwhether [the defendant] had access to a firearm at or around the time of the killing\u201d and \u201cas to the relationship between Mr. [Burns] and [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>defendant].\u201d See <em>McGee, supra </em>at 158, and cases cited. Finally, the evidence that the defendant had purchased guns \u201creceived only \u2018scant attention\u2019 at trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 124.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s failure to object was, again, without consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">f. <em>Closing arguments. </em>The defendant\u2019s last pair of complaints about his attorney\u2019s performance concerns the closing arguments. One of these criticisms concerns defense counsel\u2019s own argument; the other concerns counsel\u2019s failure to challenge a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s closing was devoted to the argument that the Commonwealth had failed to prove that the defendant was the shooter. According to the defendant, his attorney was remiss in failing to argue also that the shooter did not premeditate the killing. The judge understood this argument to suggest that counsel should have taken the inconsistent position: \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, but if I did, it wasn\u2019t murder in the first degree.\u201d We do not think that the argument is so lightly dismissed. It would have been consistent, and conceivably beneficial, for counsel to have argued that the defendant was not proved to be the shooter, and that the shooter \u2014 whoever he was \u2014 was not proved to have acted with premeditation. Even so, we cannot say that the approach taken by counsel was manifestly unreasonable. As indicated earlier, a tactical decision to focus on the most important or promising lines of defense, while relinquishing others, can serve to enhance the credibility of a defense, in part by warding off the impression that a defendant is grasping at straws. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>466 Mass. 489, 496 n.8 (2013).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The fact that the tactic chosen \u201cmay appear questionable from the vantage point of hindsight\u201d does not suffice to support an ineffective assistance claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 133-134 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 777-778 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Lastly, the defendant contends that his attorney should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, in closing, that the defendant \u201cwaited in the shadows like a coward\u201d before shooting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>victim. Any error on this score does not warrant reversal. Johnson testified that, while Payne and the victim were arguing, she \u201cs[aw] a shadow pass [her], but... never focused on who it was.\u201d In the security camera footage, the entire scene appears to be bathed in shadows, whether due to the late-night hour, the poor quality of the recordings, or both. At worst, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was a minor embellishment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>464 Mass. 818, 834 (2013), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997), and counsel\u2019s failure to object to that remark did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">g. <em>Cumulative effect. </em>Considered both separately and cumulatively, the missteps that the defendant attributes to his counsel do not rise to the level of a violation of rights requiring a new trial. The assistance provided to the defendant by his attorney was sufficiently effective to render the trial fair, even if not perfect, and that is all that can be asked. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brescia, </em>471 Mass. 381, 391 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>363 Mass. 863, 872-873 (1973) (\u201c[a] defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one, \u2018for there are no perfect trials\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 20-21 (2004) (Sosman, J., concurring), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984) (\u201cthe purpose of the effective assistance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] is ... to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">3. <em>Unidentified informant. </em>The defendant\u2019s other claim of error concerns rulings made by the judge with regard to the disclosure of the identity of a purportedly confidential informant. One week before trial, defense counsel received from the Commonwealth a report prepared by the FBI, apparently produced as a document containing \u201cfacts of an exculpatory nature\u201d pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (1) (A) (iii), as amended, 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). The report recounted a meeting between an informant and three law enforcement agents: an FBI special agent, and two officers of the Lynn police department, who also served as \u201ctask force officers.\u201d The report described the informant as \u201c[a]n individual, who is in a position to testify.\u201d According to the report, the informant \u201cheard from someone that the word on the streets of Lynn\u201d was that \u201cPAYNE shot and killed [the victim]. Immediately after the shooting, PAYNE provided the pistol to [the defendant], aka BLACK, and ordered him to get rid of the weapon.\u201d The report added that the informant knew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>defendant had \u201cmoved from New Jersey to Lynn, MA, shortly before [the victim\u2019s] murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Upon receiving this report, defense counsel moved for an order requiring the Commonwealth to provide him with the name and address of the informant. A judge of the Superior Court, who was not the trial judge, ordered the Commonwealth to \u201cinquire of [the Lynn police officers] as to the identity of \u2018an individual, who is in a position to testify.\u2019 \u201d On the first day of jury selection, defense counsel told the trial judge that the prosecutor had responded that \u201cthe Lynn officers were not authorized to disclose any of that information to counsel.\u201d Counsel requested that the Commonwealth \u201cstill be ordered to provide . . . that information.\u201d He explained that, \u201cif [he] knew the name of that someone, [he] would send an investigator out to speak to that person to see if there\u2019s any relevant evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">At the judge\u2019s request, the prosecutor telephoned an assistant United States attorney (AUSA) involved with the FBI\u2019s dealings with the informant. After that conversation, the prosecutor told the judge that, according to the AUSA, the informant was considered to be \u201ca confidential source,\u201d who \u201cmay be in a position to testify at some point down the road.\u201d The prosecutor reported that the Lynn police officers were \u201cnot authorized to disclose\u201d information about the informant\u2019s identity, which those officers had acquired \u201cin their capacity as members of the [F]ederal task force.\u201d He said also that the AUSA had \u201cexplained] . . . [that] in the [F]ederal rules, they don\u2019t have to disclose [whether a witness will testify] until [twenty-one] days before trial .... And [the AUSA] wouldn\u2019t get into any of that with me and I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The judge then denied the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. The judge also declined to permit defense counsel to pose questions about the informant\u2019s identity to the Lynn police officers. The defendant preserved his objections to these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The judge gave two reasons for his rulings. The first concerned the fact that the informant\u2019s identity was held by the FBI, not by State prosecutors or police. The second reason was, in essence, that the defendant had no right to learn of the informant\u2019s identity, irrespective of which body held that information. Taking up these reasons in order, we conclude that neither suffices to support the judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">a. <em>Dual sovereignty. </em>The judge\u2019s first stated reason was that the \u201c[F]ederal government is a separate sovereign,\u201d which \u201chas re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>fused to comply.\u201d The judge reasoned that \u201cthe way we have to look at it is it\u2019s as though the United States was Bolivia. And Bolivia has refused to give us the information.\u201d For purposes of our discussion, we adopt the far-from-certain premise that the information reported by the prosecutor sufficed to establish that the Commonwealth possessed no knowledge of the informant\u2019s identity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even so, we do not share the analysis offered by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We have recognized for many years that the interface between State and Federal sovereigns in criminal investigations and prosecutions \u201ccreates a potentiality for unfairness which would need correction if realized in practice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 674 (1980) <em>(Liebman </em>I), <em>S.C., </em>388 Mass. 483 (1983) <em>(Liebman II). </em>In order to allay this concern, we have held that \u201cin dual sovereignty situations . . . \u2018the burden of securing Federal cooperation should be placed on the State prosecutor rather than on the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>451 Mass. 310, 327 (2008), quoting <em>Liebman I, supra </em>at 675. See <em>Matter of Pressman, </em>421 Mass. 514, 518 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, 396 </em>Mass. 590, 598-600 (1986). In an instructive case, the defendant moved unsuccessfully to obtain Federal grand jury minutes, to which he would have been entitled had the grand jury been convened by the State (or, it appeared, had the trial been conducted in Federal court). <em>Liebman I, supra </em>at 674-675. We remanded with instructions that the district attorney be required \u201cto take whatever steps are appropriate to secure the minutes in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675. \u201cIf the Federal court. . . refuses to send to the State court the requested transcripts,\u201d we said, the State indictment would be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, supra </em>at 598-599; <em>Liebman II, supra </em>at 486-487.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The same analysis applies here. Assuming that the defendant is entitled to the information that he seeks, that entitlement must not be foiled by \u201c[t]he introduction of two sovereignties,\u201d each able to withhold information by asserting its independent sovereignty. See <em>Liebman I, </em>379 Mass. at 674. \u201c[Cjooperation between State and Federal prosecutors is and should be common enough\u201d that the equitable course, here, too, is to require that the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>wealth bear the onus of securing Federal cooperation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>396 Mass. at 600, quoting <em>Liebman I, supra </em>at 675.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">b. <em>Informant privilege. </em>The second reason the judge gave for his rulings was that the information relayed in the FBI report \u201cis so remote that it does not warrant penetrating what appears to be a claim of informant privilege.\u201d This line of reasoning, while relevant to an appropriate examination of the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity, should not have been the beginning and end of that examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u201cThe government\u2019s privilege not to disclose the identity of an informant has long been recognized in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>451 Mass. 463, 468 (2008) <em>(Dias), </em>and cases cited. This \u201cinformant privilege\u201d may be asserted where the Commonwealth otherwise would be required to provide an informant\u2019s identity to a defendant as part of its discovery obligations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957) <em>(Roviaro). </em>The justification for permitting the Commonwealth to maintain an informant\u2019s anonymity is the need to encourage \u201ccitizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The analysis of whether an informant\u2019s identity should be kept confidential or disclosed may best be described as generally occurring in two stages. The first stage involves preliminary determinations as to (a) whether the Commonwealth has properly asserted an informant privilege, and (b) whether the defendant has adequately challenged the assertion of the privilege as an impermissible interference with his or her right to present a defense. The second stage of the analysis then involves a balancing test, introduced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Roviaro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>supra, </em>in which the interest of the public in protecting the anonymity of informants is weighed against the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The preliminary stage calls for the two following inquiries. First, \u201c[t]he scope of the [informant] privilege is limited by its underlying purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. Accordingly, the privilege may be asserted only where disclosure would endanger the informant or otherwise impede law enforcement efforts. See <em>id.; Puerto Rico </em>v. <em>United States, </em>490 F.3d 50, 62 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1295 (2008). Ordinarily, the facts indicating whether the privilege would serve its underlying purpose are within the Commonwealth\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Second, if the Commonwealth properly has asserted an informant privilege, the defendant may request that the privilege be set aside on the grounds that it \u201cinterferes with a fair defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 544 (1974), <em>S.C., </em>372 Mass. 185 (1977) <em>(Johnson). </em>A defendant making such a claim is required to present \u201csome offering so that the trial judge may assess the materiality and relevancy of the disclosure to the defense, if that relevancy is not apparent from the nature of the case and the defense offered thereto.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>464 Mass. 315, 323 (2013) <em>(Kelsey), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. 268, 276 (1975).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The relatively undemanding nature of this standard is the result of the fact that, again, the details concerning privileged information sought by the defendant ordinarily are not in his or her possession. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>421 Mass. 272, 276 (1995), quoting <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The second stage of the analysis is undertaken if the privilege both has been asserted properly by the Commonwealth and has been challenged adequately by the defendant. Then the judge must decide whether the informant\u2019s identity and concomitant information are sufficiently \u201crelevant and helpful to the defense of an accused\u201d that it must be disclosed. See <em>Dias, </em>451 Mass. at 468, quoting <em>Roviaro, supra </em>at 60-61. This determination requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the judge to engage in Roviaro's \u201cbalancing [of] the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his [or her] defense,\u201d taking into account \u201cthe crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the [privileged] testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Dias, supra </em>at 468-469, quoting <em>Roviaro, supra </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity here was not grounded in an informed application of this framework. Beginning with the element of the preliminary inquiry concerned with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion of the informant privilege, a meager basis at best was presented to believe that the privilege was appropriately being invoked. All of the information concerning the informant was conveyed to the judge second-hand, by a State prosecutor with no personal knowledge of the circumstances. The prosecutor could say only, in essence, that the Federal government did not wish to reveal the informant\u2019s identity at that time \u2014 and that the AUSA involved \u201cwouldn\u2019t get into any of that. . . and I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d No details were provided with regard to whether the authorities were treating the individual interviewed by the FBI as a confidential informant who must remain anonymous. And no facts presented indicated that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity would imperil the informant or injure other law-enforcement interests.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While it is possible that the importance of concealing an informant\u2019s identity is, in some instances, self-evident, we do not think that it was here, particularly in view of the statement in the FBI report that the informant was \u201cin a position to testify.\u201d This enigmatic statement at least called for further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The other element of the preliminary analysis, namely, the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s contention that the informant privilege should give way to his right to present a defense, may have been the focus of the judge\u2019s remark that the information contained in the FBI report was \u201cremote.\u201d For at least two reasons, however, the remoteness of that information did not itself establish that the informant\u2019s identity was not material and relevant to the defense. With regard to relevancy, the defendant posited at trial that the victim had been shot by another man; the informant\u2019s report that Payne was the shooter was thus intensely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>relevant to the theory of the defense. Contrast <em>Kelsey, supra </em>at 326 (identity of percipient witness not obviously relevant to defense where defendant did not apparently intend to pursue defense of misidentification).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">As for the materiality of the informant\u2019s identity, it is true that, according to the FBI report, the information relayed by the informant concerned the \u201cword on the streets of Lynn\u201d; standing alone, \u201c \u2018word on the street\u2019 carries no indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 804 (2009). Still, the informant apparently was able to provide details that went beyond a threadbare rumor, such as the fact that both Payne and the defendant had handled the murder weapon (which was compatible with the DNA evidence) and the fact that the defendant had traveled to New Jersey (which dovetailed with Burns\u2019s trial testimony). See <em>id. </em>at 804-805 (reliability of \u201cword on the street\u201d may be bolstered by showing \u201cthat the \u2018word\u2019 came from a percipient witness\u201d or by other facts rendering that \u201cword\u201d inherently plausible). At a minimum, the question whether the informant was a percipient witness to the shooting, or whether he had spoken to a percipient witness, should have been explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Moreover, in some circumstances, knowledge of the informant\u2019s identity can offer substantial aid to the defense even if the informant himself cannot provide testimony sufficiently relevant and reliable to be admitted at trial. See <em>Dias, supra </em>at 473 (\u201cWhile calling the informant as a witness might be one way of putting that information to good use in this case, it is not the only way, and it may not be as useful to the defense as knowledge of his [or her] identity before trial\u201d); <em>Roviaro, supra </em>at 64 (\u201cThe desirability of . . . interviewing [a confidential informant] in preparation for trial . . . was a matter for the accused rather than the Government to decide\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Saa, </em>859 F.2d 1067, 1074 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1089 (1989) and cases cited (\u201cthe right under <em>Roviaro </em>to information about an informant [is] not merely so that the defense can call the informant to testify, but so that it can seek to interview him first\u201d). Here, there was no apparent reason to doubt that, by employing an investigator or other means, the defendant might have explored whether the informant knew other pertinent information, whether the person who had told the informant about the \u201cword on the streets of Lynn\u201d could be identified, and whether that person could elaborate on the sources and substance of his or her information. The Commonwealth was of course free to endeavor to persuade the judge that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity would yield little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>of value to the defense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the judge were persuaded, upon a proper showing, that the informant\u2019s identity would be unlikely to lead the defendant to more than second- or third-hand \u201cword on the street,\u201d the conclusion that the defendant had made an inadequate showing of materiality might have been warranted. But no such showing was undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">We need not speculate about what the results of a second-stage <em>Roviaro </em>balancing exercise might have been, had the judge properly determined that the Commonwealth appropriately asserted the informant privilege and that the defendant made an adequate offering concerning the materiality and relevancy of the informant\u2019s identity to the defense.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The point is that \u201c[tjhere was no attempt by the judge at orderly appraisal of the actuality of any threat and the materiality of the [information] sought. Nor was any compromise considered that might allow disclosure while minimizing danger to the [informant].\u201d Johnson, 365 Mass. at 546. See <em>Kelsey, </em>464 Mass. at 327-328. We remand for further proceedings to conduct the requisite \u201corderly appraisal\u201d of the relevant factors in accordance with the framework we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">We envision that those proceedings will include the following. Upon remand, a hearing should be held to reconsider the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. If the judge determines that the motion was meritorious,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the defendant should be afforded a reasonable interval to try to interview the informant and to investigate pertinent information, if any, that the informant may provide. If the defendant then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>successfully presents evidence that \u201cmight create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, a new trial may be appropriate. If . . . not, the verdict and judgment may be permitted to stand.\u201d <em>Liebman I, </em>379 Mass. at 676.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Because the defendant preserved the issue prior to the current appeal, the reconsidered decision on the merits of his pretrial motion \u2014 and, if that motion is allowed, the decision whether information uncovered as a result warrants a new trial \u2014 will be appealable as decisions on a postconviction motion filed before direct appeal. See <em>Liebman II, </em>supra; <em>Liebman I, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel. We remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. On our review of the entire record now before us, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we do not discern cause to reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">In her grand jury testimony, with which she was impeached on cross-examination, Sheffery Johnson stated that she saw the defendant put \u201csomething\u201d in his pants, and that she could not see that object. A police officer testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>in an interview some hours after the shooting, Johnson stated repeatedly that she had not seen a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Neither the victim\u2019s girl friend, who appeared before the grand jury, nor Brandon Payne was called to testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The officer testified that Johnson had not known the name of the shooter. He could not recall if she had known the shooter\u2019s nickname.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In corroboration of Joseph Burns\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth offered testimony from Thomas Arrington, the defendant\u2019s roommate at the time of the shooting. Arrington testified that he saw the defendant at various times with several guns, none of which was a .22 caliber. See note 16, <em>infra. </em>The roommate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>asked the defendant if he was involved in the shooting, and the defendant shrugged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The analyst spoke of \u201cindividualizing\u201d prints based on their \u201cunique\u201d characteristics, stating twice that \u201c[n]o two individuals have ever been found to have the same unique sequence of\u2019 print characteristics. The defendant does not contend that this testimony ran afoul of our admonition that \u201copinions expressing absolute certainty about, or the infallibility of, an \u2018individualization\u2019 of a print should be avoided.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gambora, </em>457 Mass. 715, 729 n.22 (2010). Regardless of whether the analyst\u2019s testimony exceeded permissible bounds, a question we need not decide, it did not in any event give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant did not deny that he had touched the gun, a fact supported also by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 728-729.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The record reveals that the defendant is African-American, and it suggests that Payne may be as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The officer who had collected biological material from the gun and from the defendant testified at trial, as did the analyst who had generated the DNA profiles of the defendant, the victim, and Payne. The analyst who had generated the DNA profile of the material taken from the gun, Kathleen Gould, was unavailable to testify. Testimony was offered by a chemist who had reviewed Gould\u2019s work, Cailin Dragan. As required, Dragan\u2019s testimony was devoted to Dragan\u2019s own analysis, not to the \u201cfacts or data underlying [Dragan\u2019s] opinion.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tassone, </em>468 Mass. 391, 399 (2014), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The recording of Burns\u2019s interview was played during his cross-examination but was not made an exhibit. The recording of Johnson\u2019s interview was not shown during trial, but it was marked as an exhibit, and the jury were informed that they could watch an excerpt of that exhibit upon request. The record suggests that no such request was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b852-9\">In closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Payne\u2019s out-of-court statement, saying, \u201cBrandon [Payne] who told Sheffery [Johnson] he was the one who did it, he was the one who shot him, calls him Black.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Counsel also reminded the jury, in his argument, that Johnson had failed to identify the defendant at a photographic array conducted shortly after the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b852-11\"> Although the judge stated otherwise, the record indicates that defense counsel did not provide an explanation for why he left Johnson\u2019s out-of-court statements unchallenged. Nevertheless, the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s course of action undermines the ineffective assistance claim regardless of whether counsel consciously articulated the reasons for his actions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jenkins, 458 Mass. 791, 806 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">We make this observation based on our own review of the recording. The judge, of course, saw the recording at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">\u201cThe rationale for the rule is that \u2018[ejxtrajudicial accusatory statements made in the presence of a defendant, which he has unequivocally denied, are [inadmissible] hearsay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>468 Mass. 360, 375 n.20 (2014) , quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>457 Mass. 268, 272 (2010). Such accusatory statements shed their hearsay character when they are offered not for the truth of the matters asserted, but to provide context for admissible statements of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pytou Heang, </em>458 Mass. 827, 855 (2011); <em>United. States </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>434 F.3d 30, 33-35 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1199 (2006). Although the defendant does not so argue, it may have been appropriate for his attorney to request an instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the officers\u2019 recorded statements to this nonhearsay purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 275 (1990); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 105 (2015) . Even assuming that such an instruction should have been requested and given, we discern no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The officers\u2019 statements played an insubstantial role in the evidentiary picture presented at trial. In particular, the jury would have seen for themselves that the defendant was not, as the officers stated, identifiable on a video recording of the crime scene. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, supra </em>at 275. There was no suggestion at trial that the officers\u2019 mention of \u201cpeople\u201d who reported seeing the defendant at the scene referred to individuals other than the trial witnesses. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the statement that \u201cit doesn\u2019t look good\u201d if the defendant were to say falsely that he was not at the scene was a commonsense observation, not a fact otherwise unknown to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The judge did not address a related issue posed by the recording, namely, that portions of it revealed, at least to an attentive viewer, that the defendant had been arrested and handcuffed in connection with a different, subsequent investigation. It is possible that this issue could have been averted if defense counsel had requested additional redactions to the recording. In any event, we are confident that presentation of this issue would not have altered the judge\u2019s highly discretionary decision to admit the recording, and that any inference by the jury that the defendant may have been involved in a later, undescribed incident would not have influenced their decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Burns testified that he regularly obliterated the serial numbers from firearms before selling them. The gun recovered at the scene of the shooting had an identifiable serial number on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Similarly, the testimony of Arrington, the defendant\u2019s roommate, that he had seen the defendant with guns, but not with a .22 caliber, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>was probative of Burns\u2019s credibility, because it tended to confirm Burns\u2019s testimony that he had sold the defendant a variety of guns. Other factors noted in our discussion of Burns\u2019s testimony also would have countered any claim (which the defendant does not make) that the admission of Arrington\u2019s testimony was reversible error and, by extension, any claim (also not made) that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to that testimony amounted to ineffective assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The evidence that the defendant had sold drugs to Burns received even less attention at trial and was unlikely to sway the jury\u2019s view of whether the defendant was guilty of murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Otherwise put, a reasonably effective attorney could have been concerned that the jury might overlook the subtlety of the claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, and whoever did it did not premeditate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Notwithstanding the limited, second-hand information relayed by the prosecutor, it remains unclear whether the investigation that gave rise to the Federal Bureau of Investigation report was conducted jointly with the Commonwealth, and what role, precisely, the Lynn police officers played in that investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">A different analysis applies where a defendant asserts after trial that, although no judicial error occurred, the prosecutor \u201csuppressfed] . . . evidence favorable to an accused\u201d concerning a confidential informant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 728 (1992), quoting <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). A determination that the undisclosed information was held only by the Federal government may defeat this type of claim, because \u201c[t]he prosecutor cannot be said to suppress that which is not in his [or her] possession or subject to his [or her] control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>396 Mass. 590, 596 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\">There is apparently no disagreement that, absent the assertion of the informant privilege, the identity of the person who provided the information detailed in the report produced to the defendant would be discoverable under Mass.
