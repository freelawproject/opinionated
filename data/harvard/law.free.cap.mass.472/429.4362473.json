The defendant was charged with several firearms offenses, as well as resisting arrest. Prior to trial in the Boston Municipal Court, the defendant moved to suppress all evidence derived from the encounter. After an evidentiary hearing, a Boston Municipal Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The Appeals Court reversed the allowance of the motion to suppress, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones-Pannell, </em>85 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 391 (2014), and we allowed the defendant\u2019s petition for further appellate review. We affirm the motion judge\u2019s order allowing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s factual findings, which were prefaced with his statement that \u201c[t]he following facts are the only ones found by the court based on credible testimony presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">At approximately 12:37 a.m., two Boston police officers were on routine patrol along Norfolk Avenue in an unmarked police vehicle. The officers noticed the defendant, a black male, walking on the sidewalk ten to twelve feet away. Neither officer recognized the defendant, although they were \u201cfamiliar with the gang members active in the area.\u201d The judge found that, \u201c[although the officers knew of some crimes that had been reported in the area, Norfolk [Avenue] between East Cottage Street and Burrell Street was not a high crime area or so-called \u2018hot spot.\u2019 \u201d One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>officer observed the defendant\u2019s \u201cright hand in his pants between his waist and his crotch but didn\u2019t see any other bulge in his pants.\u201d The defendant \u201clooked towards the police vehicle, looked up and down the street and continued walking.\u201d One of the officers twice asked to speak to the defendant, but he looked away and kept walking. The defendant accelerated his pace, keeping his hand in his pants, and the police vehicle kept pace with him. As the defendant turned a comer, the officers got out of the vehicle. One of the officers called, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d in a loud voice. The defendant started jogging. The officer began chasing the defendant, who began running, with the officer in pursuit. The officer could see the defendant\u2019s left hand, but not his right hand. The defendant was apprehended twenty to thirty seconds later.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u2018we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings absent clear error \u201cbut conduct an independent review of [the] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>470 Mass. 740, 742 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 214, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1079 (2007). Although an appellate court may supplement a motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings with evidence from the record that \u201cis uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008), it may do so only so long as the supplemented facts \u201cdo not detract from the judge\u2019s ultimate findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>471 Mass. 121, 127-128 (2015). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 492 (2001), <em>S.C., </em>440 Mass. 642 (2004) (that appellate courts have been willing to supplement motion judge\u2019s findings of fact is based \u201cnot only upon the fact that the evidence was uncontradicted but also upon our conviction that the motion judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In this case, it appears from the judge\u2019s prefatory statement that he intended to credit only those portions of the testimony that were reflected in his findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is therefore not implicit in the judge\u2019s findings that [the judge] found the entirety of the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>testimony credible.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 749 (2013). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gentile, </em>466 Mass. 817, 820-822 &amp; n.5 (2014) (supplementing judge\u2019s findings with testimony that \u201cwas controverted and disputed,\u201d where judge found witness\u2019s testimony \u201ccredible in its entirety,\u201d but reversing judge\u2019s denial of motion to suppress because \u201ceven if the judge had explicitly made findings adopting every factual assertion in [witness\u2019s] testimony, the findings would still fall short of establishing a reasonable belief that the defendant was in the home at the time of entry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The Commonwealth essentially asks us to do what our case law proscribes: to rely on testimony that was neither explicitly nor implicitly credited by the motion judge, otherwise put, that we in essence make additional findings, and reach a different result, based on our own view of the evidence. The Commonwealth argues that the judge wrongly determined the points at which the defendant began to jog and run, and therefore erred in deciding when the defendant was seized. The Commonwealth asks also that we consider the officer\u2019s testimony anew and conclude, contrary to the judge\u2019s finding, that the neighborhood was in fact a \u201chigh crime\u201d area. The Commonwealth suggests further that we should supplement the judge\u2019s findings with additional evidence concerning the officer\u2019s training, in order to conclude that the officer reasonably suspected the defendant was carrying a firearm unlawfully. This we cannot do. After review of the judge\u2019s findings and rulings and the record, we conclude that the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings are not erroneous; they amply \u201csupport his general findings [and] conclusions based thereon.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 547 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">a. <em>Point at which the defendant was seized. </em>Identifying the moment of seizure is a critical question for purposes of deciding a motion to suppress. \u201cA person is seized by the police only when, in light of all of the attending circumstances, a reasonable person in that situation would not feel free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 369 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Here, the judge concluded that the defendant was seized when an officer \u201cexclaimed \u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 and then began chasing the defendant.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the defendant was not seized until he was physically apprehended. It argues that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s flight was not prompted by anything the police did,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>459 Mass. 572, 578 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1739 (2012), because he already was running when the officer began to chase him. The judge found otherwise, and his findings are not clearly erroneous; although the officer\u2019s testimony characterized the defendant\u2019s pace in a number of ways, the judge\u2019s factual findings resolve the differences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, regardless of when the defendant started \u201cjogging\u201d, or what rate of speed was meant by that term, the judge found that the defendant increased his pace after the officers initially asked to speak to him, and that the defendant started to run when the officers got out of the vehicle, one officer called out loudly to \u201c[wjait a minute,\u201d and the officer then gave chase. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 174-176 (2001). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, supra </em>(no seizure where flight not prompted by police activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The defendant was free to reject the police officer\u2019s multiple requests to speak with him, just as he was free to respond to the requests by increasing his pace. Unlike the situations in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>449 Mass. 308, 313-314 (2007), the judge\u2019s findings in this case, which are supported by the evidence, support the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s eventual running was prompted by the officers\u2019 actions. The officer\u2019s loud command to \u201c[wjait,\u201d and his pursuit, had compulsory aspects that his prior requests did not. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, supra </em>at 174-176. The evidence amply demonstrated that the defendant was not free to leave at that point. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">b. <em>Suspicion of criminal activity. </em>The legal question then becomes whether, at the time the defendant was seized, the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201chad an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on specific and articulable facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, supra </em>at 176. The judge found that the factors relevant to the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 suspicion were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cflight from police officers and keeping his right hand in his pants between his waist and his crotch. That it was just after midnight adds little if anything to the calculus of reasonable suspicion. Other factors that in some cases support a finding of a reasonable suspicion are missing: this was not a high crime area; the police didn\u2019t know the defendant; there were no reports or radio calls of a crime having been recently committed in the area; the officers were on routine patrol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s refusal to respond to the officer\u2019s initial requests to speak with him did not generate an objectively reasonable suspicion and that, while flight from police and holding one\u2019s hand at one\u2019s waist or inside one\u2019s pants may sometimes indicate that an individual has a weapon, it also is consistent with other, nonviolent activities. Although acknowledging these two factors to be \u201cimportant,\u201d the judge determined that, without more, they were \u201cnot enough to support a conclusion of reasonable suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Commonwealth contends that testimony concerning the character of the neighborhood as \u201chigh crime\u201d added substantially to the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 suspicions. Although a characterization that an area is one of \u201chigh crime\u201d may be relevant in determining whether a police officer\u2019s suspicion is reasonable, the accuracy of the characterization in a particular case depends on specific facts found by the judge that underlie such a determination, rather than on any label that is applied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>454 Mass. 159, 163 (2009). And, as we cautioned in that case, whether a neighborhood is a high crime area is a consideration that must be applied with care.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cThe fact that the officers were in a high crime area is unquestionably a factor to consider, albeit with caution; we recognize that so-called high crime areas are inhabited and frequented by many law-abiding citizens who are entitled to be protected against being stopped and frisked just because of the neighborhood where they live, work, or visit. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 663 (2001). The term \u2018high crime area\u2019 is itself a general and conclusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>term that should not be used to justify a stop or a frisk, or both, without requiring the articulation of specific facts demonstrating the reasonableness of the intrusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 513, (2009).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that the stop here did not take place in a \u201chigh crime\u201d area was not clearly erroneous. In some circumstances, locations where firearms offenses are common, or where rival gang activity occurs, have been considered \u201chigh crime\u201d areas. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 781 783 (2005). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sykes, supra </em>at 314-315 (in high crime area where large group congregated, attempting to avoid contact with police and clenching waistband while running contributed to reasonable suspicion). Isolated incidents of nearby gun activity, or the mere presence of gangs in the vicinity, however, does not require a finding that a particular street is a \u201chigh crime area.\u201d In this case, there was no testimony concerning arrests in the area of Norfolk Avenue; no testimony about any crime on the street in question; and no testimony that police patrolled Norfolk Avenue because of any specific criminal activity occurring there. Indeed, at the time of the stop, the officers were on routine patrol and were not responding to any radio call. One officer stated that he \u201cknew of some crime that had been reported in the neighborhood,\u201d but this testimony was supported by few specific facts: he testified only to a radio call of \u201cshots fired\u201d about two weeks previously, and a shooting and recovery of a gun sometime in the preceding several months. With respect to his testimony that there was \u201cundescribed gang activity in the area,\u201d the officer articulated no specific facts, and made no statement that firearms or violence were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">That one or more \u201ccrimes\u201d occurred at some point in the past somewhere on a particular street does not necessarily render the entire street a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d either at that time or in perpetuity. Here, on the evidence before him, the judge\u2019s determination that \u201cNorfolk [Avenue] between East Cottage Street and Burrell Street was not a high crime area\u201d was not clear error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The same can be said with respect to the judge\u2019s findings concerning the officer\u2019s training and experience. The judge credited the officer\u2019s testimony that, nine years earlier, he had completed an eight-hour training class titled \u201cCharacteristics of Armed Gunmen.\u201d The judge was not required to conclude that this training \u2014 by itself or in combination with other factors \u2014 made the officer\u2019s suspicion objectively reasonable. Likewise, the judge was not required to make detailed findings about the content of the course. The judge\u2019s findings accurately reflect that, apart from the eight-hour training class about which there was testimony, there was \u201cno other testimony about [the officer\u2019s] training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">c. <em>Supplementation of judge\u2019s findings in future cases. </em>We recognize that our decisions have engaged in (and condoned) a practice of \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cinterstitial\u201d supplementation of a motion judge\u2019s findings with uncontroverted facts. At times, that practice is benign, simply serving to fill out the story. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>423 Mass. 517, 526 n. 10 (1996). This practice also may be appropriate where a judge\u2019s findings are sparse and additional facts are needed to provide context. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 30 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hecox, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 278 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 368 (1980). And, as noted, we may affirm a judge\u2019s order on a motion to suppress based not only on the facts as found, but also on evidence that was \u201cimplicitly or explicitly credited\u201d by the motion judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., supra </em>at 337. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>471 Mass. at 127-128 (appellate court may supplement with additional undisputed facts that \u201cdo not detract from the judge\u2019s ultimate findings\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bostock, </em>450 Mass. 616, 617 n.1 (2008) (reviewing court may supplement \u201cwith uncontested testimony presented at the hearing by a witness whose testimony largely was credited by the judge and does not contradict the judge\u2019s findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">But the mere absence of contradiction is not enough to permit supplementation with facts not found by the judge. A reviewing court should exercise caution in supplementing a motion judge\u2019s findings of fact with evidence in the record that was not included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>in the judge\u2019s findings, and as to which the judge made no statement of credibility, on the assertion that the judge implicitly credited that testimony. While, for instance, a judge\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress may in some circumstances imply resolution of \u201cfactual issues in favor of the Commonwealth,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 57 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 137 (2001), where a judge made \u201ccareful and detailed findings,\u201d we may have \u201cno way to tell whether, or to what extent,\u201d the judge believed the testimony as to which he or she made no findings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>381 Mass. 65, 76 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 465, 472 (2007) (judicial silence, reflected in absence of finding supportive of witness, can suggest that judge rejected witness\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Where a motion judge\u2019s findings of fact are insufficient to support the judge\u2019s conclusions of law, and it is not apparent from the judge\u2019s decision or the record that the judge credited other testimony as to which no findings were made, ordinarily a reviewing court will reverse the judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 741-742 (2008). We have on occasion supplemented a judge\u2019s findings with additional facts necessary to support the judge\u2019s conclusion, such as where the judge found the witnesses\u2019 testimony \u201ctruthful and accurate.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>461 Mass. 616, 619 n.3, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 433 (2012). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 492 (2001). In the absence of findings on a critical issue, however, or where the facts as found are \u201csusceptible of more than one interpretation,\u201d and there is additional evidence in the record, neither implicitly credited nor discredited by the judge, remand may be appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., supra </em>at 338-339 (remanding for further findings where judge made no credibility determination concerning detective\u2019s testimony, and court was unable to determine whether omission was error or testimony was not credited). A judge may resolve any uncertainty by including in the decision a statement as to whether the judge credits, or does not credit, all or a portion of a particular witness\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 749 (2013) (where judge stated that her findings were based on \u201ccredible testimony\u201d of police officer, but stated also that she did not find credible officer\u2019s testimony that he had heightened awareness of danger, \u201c[i]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>therefore not implicit in the judge\u2019s findings that she found the entirety of the officer\u2019s testimony credible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">But, as our long-standing jurisprudence makes plain, in no event is it proper for an appellate court to engage in what amounts to independent fact finding in order to reach a conclusion of law that is contrary to that of a motion judge who has seen and heard the witnesses, and made determinations regarding the weight and credibility of their testimony. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 340-341 (2012) and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>451 Mass. 370, 381 (2008), and cases cited. A motion judge cannot be deemed implicitly to have credited testimony that is contrary to the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions simply because, as is often the case in a criminal proceeding, only one witness testified at the hearing, so the testimony is \u201cuncon-troverted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Here, the judge\u2019s decision included a detailed statement of facts, prefaced by a statement that the facts stated were based on the only testimony that the judge found credible. Such a statement leaves no room for supplementation of the judge\u2019s findings of fact. Because the judge\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, we must accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact, and consider only whether they support the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 403, 405 (1999) (\u201cmotion judge\u2019s findings of fact are binding in the absence of clear error\u201d). \u201cWe cannot properly be asked to revise a judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact, where they are warranted by the evidence, or to review the weight (or credibility) of the evidence related to the findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 550 (1972) (Hennessey, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The judge\u2019s findings refer to \u201cNorfolk Street,\u201d but it is clear from the transcript of the suppression hearing that the judge and the parties were in agreement that the incident occurred on Norfolk Avenue. We therefore refer to Norfolk Avenue throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The judge\u2019s prefatory statement does not, as the Commonwealth contends, insulate his findings of fact from appellate review. It is the motion judge\u2019s responsibility to make credibility assessments, weigh the evidence, and make findings of fact; it remains the responsibility of an appellate court to evaluate whether those findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Where a party contends that a motion judge failed to make findings warranted by the evidence, and that supplementation with material facts would require reversal of the suppression order, a reviewing court will not engage in fact finding, but may remand so that the judge may consider whether additional findings are warranted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337-338 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 495-496 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Specifically, the Commonwealth contends that the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant started \u201cjogging,\u201d only after the officer yelled, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d is clearly erroneous. We are not convinced that there was clear error. While there is some possibly equivocal testimony about when the defendant started jogging, ample testimony in the record supports the judge\u2019s finding, and the judge clearly indicated that he did not find all of the testimony credible. The judge was not required to, and apparently did not, credit equivocal testimony to the effect that the defendant was already \u201cjogging\u201d prior to the moment the officer yelled at him to \u201c[wjait,\u201d and merely speeded up thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Nor was there error, as the Commonwealth contends, in the judge\u2019s determination that the time of night added \u201clittle if anything to the calculus of reasonable suspicion.\u201d The defendant was stopped just after midnight on a summer evening. Nothing in the judge\u2019s decision suggests that he ignored the time or declined to consider it. To the contrary, the judge addressed the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of the time of night explicitly, apparently having concluded that, in light of the other evidence before him, the time at which these events took place was not a significant factor with respect to the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s suspicion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> An appellate court is, of course, \u201cfree to affirm a ruling on grounds different from those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997).
