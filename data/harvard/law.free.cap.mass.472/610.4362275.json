L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to vacate the conviction, order a new trial, or reduce the conviction to murder in the second degree because the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and not consonant with justice. In addition, he claims that the murder conviction should be vacated or a new trial ordered because his right to a public trial was violated by the unconstitutional closure of the court room during jury selection; because the jury were not instructed about the risk of honest, but mistaken, eyewitness identification; and because the prosecutor vouched for the accuracy of the key eyewitness and expressed her personal belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt during closing argument. Finally, the defendant claims that, even if his murder conviction were to be affirmed, he is entitled to a reduction in sentence to life with the possibility of parole where he was seventeen years old at the time of the killing. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree, but order the case remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>466 Mass. 655, 671-674 (2013), <em>S.C., </em>471 Mass. 12 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>Background. </em>Because the defendant challenges the sufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of the evidence, we recite the evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief in detail and in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Labadie, 467 Mass. 81, 93-94, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 257 (2014).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the defendant additionally claims that the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence, we also summarize the other relevant evidence, including the defendant\u2019s trial testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass. 895, 896 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">1. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. </em>Serrano had dated Jennifer Suarez \u201con and off\u2019 for approximately four years when she ended her relationship with Serrano and began dating the victim in January, 2004. Serrano told Suarez that \u201che didn\u2019t want [her] with [the victim],\u201d and that she was \u201chis girl and [was] always going to be with him.\u201d Serrano also threatened the victim, telling Suarez that \u201che\u2019s going to kill\u201d the victim, and \u201c[w]atch when he catches him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On the evening of April 1, 2004, Serrano knocked on the apartment door of Suarez\u2019s cousin, Vicky Gonzalez, who resided in a three-story multifamily building in Lawrence near the corner of Haverhill Street and Oxford Street. Gonzalez \u201ccracked\u201d open the door and saw Serrano, whom she knew, dressed in a \u201cbrown down coat.\u201d Serrano\u2019s jacket had a hood, but he did not \u201chave it on.\u201d Just behind Serrano was a man she did not know, who was dressed \u201call in black\u201d: \u201c[b]lack sneakers, black pants, [and a] black jacket.\u201d The man had his \u201chood\u201d on, and his face was \u201ctotally covered\u201d with \u201cwhat must have been a mask or something.\u201d Serrano asked for Suarez, and pushed the door, trying to look into the apartment. Gonzalez told him to leave, and Serrano said, \u201cI want Jennifer and I know she\u2019s here.\u201d Gonzalez told him that she would call the police if he did not leave, and he and the other man left.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Unknown to Serrano, the victim was in the apartment when Serrano tried to enter. Minutes earlier, the victim had come to the apartment in an automobile with his friends, Johan Abreu and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Santo Suarez,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and they were waiting for the victim in the automobile in a parking lot off of Oxford Street outside the entrance to Gonzales\u2019s apartment. When Serrano walked outside, he banged on the hood of the automobile.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Abreu asked Serrano what he was doing there, Serrano pulled out a gun from his waistband and told them \u201cit\u2019s not with you\u201d and \u201cto get. . . out of here.\u201d As this was happening, the victim came out of the apartment building and stepped between Serrano and his friends, facing Serrano. Serrano pointed the gun at the victim\u2019s face and said, \u201cLook where I found him,\u201d \u201cthis is the way I want[ed] to catch you.\u201d He asked, \u201cWho\u2019s a bigger man with a gun?\u201d Abreu screamed at Serrano to put down the gun and fight with his hands. The victim told Serrano, \u201cDo what you got to do.\u201d Serrano struck the victim with his free hand and called for \u201cFifty\u201d to come out, at which point the defendant came out from an alley alongside the apartment building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Serrano said he wanted to fight the victim, and handed the defendant his gun. Serrano and the victim started \u201cscuffling,\u201d and then \u201cwrestling, trying to throw each other down to the ground.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant, who was pointing the gun at the victim, said, \u201cFuck these dudes,\u201d and Santo ran. Abreu saw the victim \u201ctrying to cut loose,\u201d and Abreu ran, thinking the victim was going to run behind him. Abreu ran \u201cfaster than a cat\u201d up Haverhill Street, and then down an alley back towards the entrance to Gonzalez\u2019s apartment. As he was running down the alley, he heard a gunshot. He then ran back to the comer of Haverhill Street and Oxford Street, where he found the victim \u201c[ljaying down\u201d on the sidewalk. He did not see who had fired the gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The medical examiner concluded that the victim died from a single bullet wound at the top and towards the rear of the victim\u2019s head. From the nature of the wound, he offered the opinion that the barrel of the gun was against the victim\u2019s scalp, and that the path of the bullet was \u201cdownward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The only witness to the shooting was Jose Estrella, who was at a gasoline station on Haverhill Street on the opposite side of the street from where the shooting occurred, pumping gasoline into his car on the street side of the pump. From that vantage point, he saw a man, later identified as the victim, run north on Oxford Street and turn left on Haverhill Street. The victim suddenly stopped on Haverhill Street and turned around to face in the direction of the corner with Oxford Street. He saw a second man running right behind the victim, who stopped \u201cright on the corner\u201d after the victim stopped, and who then began to walk towards the victim. The victim raised both hands above his waist and said something to the second man, who said something back. The second man continued to approach, getting so close to the victim that he was \u201cbreathing on [his] face.\u201d The second man then lifted his right hand upwards over his head, \u201cswinging\u201d it around and pointing it downward towards the head of the victim. Estrella heard a gunshot, and the victim immediately fell to the ground. The second man walked back in the direction from which he had come, and then began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Estrella noted that it was dark and drizzling when he saw the shooting. From his vantage point, Estrella was between 178 and 230 feet from the location of the shooting. Estrella saw that the shooter was wearing a black or dark-colored winter coat, with a hood over his head. Estrella testified that the second man was taller than the victim, and that he could see when they came close together that the second man\u2019s chin nearly touched the center of the victim\u2019s forehead.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The victim was five feet, six inches tall; Serrano is five feet, five inches tall; the defendant is five feet, eleven inches tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">During the examination of the crime scene, next to a bloodstain on the sidewalk the police found a Virgin Mary medallion that belonged to Serrano, a single .22 caliber shell casing, and a closed pocket knife. Nearby, they found a Jesus medallion that belonged to the victim, and a jacket that belonged to the victim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The first 911 call reporting the shooting was made at approximately 9:00 p.m. Approximately twenty minutes later, Officer Jamie Adames conducted an investigative stop of Serrano in the Essex Street projects, which is approximately \u201cthree intersections\u201d from the location of the shooting. Serrano was wearing a black \u201cbubble\u201d jacket. The jacket had a hood, but Serrano was not wearing the hood, even though it was \u201cpouring\u201d rain. Officer Adames conducted a patfrisk of Serrano, but found no weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On the evening of April 3, after speaking by telephone with the defendant, Stephanie Bertone traveled by taxicab to a motel in Middleton, where the defendant was now staying.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant told her that \u201cthere were people after him.\u201d They stayed for \u201ca couple of days\u201d at the motel, and then traveled to Shamokin, Pennsylvania, where they stayed with a friend of the defendant\u2019s mother. While in Pennsylvania, Bertone asked the defendant why they had left and why they were there. The defendant told her that he was driving around with \u201cBenji\u201d in Benji\u2019s motor vehicle when Benji saw \u201csome kid that he had a problem with and they stopped the car.\u201d Benji got out of the vehicle and \u201cstarted arguing with the kid and he ended fighting with him.\u201d When the kid had Benji down on the ground, Benji told the defendant to get out of the vehicle and bring him the gun that Benji had in it. The defendant walked over to \u201cwhere Benji and the other kid were fighting,\u201d and the defendant \u201cwent to hand\u201d Benji the gun. The defendant then paused, and Bertone asked him what happened. He responded, \u201cYou can guess what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The defendant was arrested in Shamokin on April 14, and State police Trooper Brandon Arakelian interviewed him in the library of the county jail on April 15, in the presence of Lawrence police Detective Victor Morales and Officer William Miner of the Sham-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>okin police department. After the defendant was advised of the Miranda rights and waived them, the defendant provided a signed written statement in which he said that on the evening of April 1, he was home from 6 p.m. to after midnight with his friend, \u201cDavid Domingoes,\u201d and his girl friend, \u201cMelanie.\u201d Domingoes left to go home but returned at around 1 a.m. The defendant left with Domingoes in Domingoes\u2019s mother\u2019s automobile and was traveling on Basswood Street, near the comer of Juniper Street, when someone in another vehicle with four people inside \u201cshot at\u201d the automobile in which the defendant was traveling. Two persons stepped out of that vehicle, walked over to Domingoes\u2019s automobile, and fired \u201ca couple of shots\u201d at the driver\u2019s side of it, putting holes in the windows. The defendant stayed at his home that night but the next day went to the home of his mother\u2019s friend \u201cbecause [he] got shot at.\u201d After one night there, he went to stay at the motel. He called Bertone and \u201ctold her that [they] needed to bounce.\u201d He did not learn that the victim had been killed until after he arrived in Pennsylvania. The defendant also said in his statement that he knew \u201cBenji from the area\u201d and knew that Benji \u201chad problems\u201d with the \u201ckid who got shot . . . over a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The defendant gave a cellular telephone number for Domin-goes, but Trooper Arakelian was unable to reach Domin-goes at the number and was never able to locate him. Trooper Arakelian also asked the defendant for Melanie\u2019s last name and street address, but the defendant provided neither. The trooper also determined that there were no reports of shots fired in the area of Basswood and Juniper Streets on the night of April 1, or the day that preceded and the day that followed that night. In fact, the only report of gunfire in that time frame in Lawrence was the report of the shot that killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">After this police interview, the defendant asked to speak with Officer Miner alone. The officer explained to the defendant that the best thing the defendant could do was tell the other officers the tmth. The defendant \u201ctook a breath\u201d and told Officer Miner, \u201cI was there; I had the gun.\u201d The defendant then paused and added, \u201cThings just got crazy.\u201d After another pause, he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s trial testimony. </em>The defendant testified in his own defense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He said that he had known Serrano for about one and one-half months before the shooting. On April 1, at approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>mately 8 p.m., he was at a barber shop and saw Serrano, who told him he was going to see his girl friend. He stood behind Serrano, on the stairs, when Serrano knocked on an apartment door and learned that \u201cJennifer\u201d was not home. The defendant told Serrano he was going to go home. Serrano passed him on the stairs and approached an automobile that was parked outside. Two men got out of the vehicle, and Serrano asked, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d One of the men said he did not know. A \u201ckid\u201d then came down the same set of stairs that Serrano and the defendant had just descended. Serrano saw the kid, pulled out a gun and said, \u201cThis is the way I wanted to catch you.\u201d Until that moment, the defendant had not seen the gun and did not know that Serrano was carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Serrano pointed the gun at the top of the kid\u2019s head, with the wrist aimed downward, and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the man now?\u201d After the kid told him, \u201cDo what you have to do,\u201d Serrano punched the kid in the face with his left hand, and said he was going to fight him first. Serrano then said, \u201cYo Fifty,\u201d and the defendant stepped out to where they were standing. Serrano handed him the gun, which the defendant pointed toward the sky. The two men who had been in the automobile ran away. The kid placed Serrano in a bear hug, lifted him up, slammed him on the ground, and began punching him in the face and stomach. Serrano twice told the defendant to \u201cgive me my gun,\u201d but the defendant refused. The kid then got off the ground, threw his jacket over his shoulder, and walked quickly out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Serrano, still lying on the ground, told the defendant that he was \u201ca fucking punk,\u201d and asked him, \u201cWhy you let him beat me up like that?\u201d The defendant told him he should have defended himself. Serrano then got up off the ground, said, \u201cGive me my fucking gun,\u201d and pulled the gun away from the defendant\u2019s hand. The defendant walked north up Oxford Street, crossed Haverhill Street, and went down Railroad Street, heading home. He looked back, and he saw \u201cBenji coming around the comer towards\u201d where the kid was standing on Haverhill Street. The defendant \u201ckept walking,\u201d thinking to himself that \u201cthis ain\u2019t my problem\u201d and that \u201ceverything was over.\u201d As he was walking towards the other end of Railroad Street, he heard \u201ca pop\u201d but ignored it \u2014 because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what it was\u201d \u2014 and continued on to his mother\u2019s house. The next morning, his mother woke him at 5 a.m. and told him that someone had called her and that she needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>get him out because \u201cthey were going to kill\u201d him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">He admitted that he lied to Trooper Arakelian but said he did so because he was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get charged with something [he] did not do.\u201d The defendant maintained that false alibi even after Trooper Arakelian told the defendant that he knew the defendant was there, because the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want to rat on Benji.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Sufficiency and weight of the evidence. </em>The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty based on the insufficiency of the evidence at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence. The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying these motions, and that he is entitled to reversal of the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The defendant challenges the appellate standard that reviews a claim of insufficiency of the evidence. Under that standard, we determine whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Hilaire, </em>470 Mass. 338, 343 (2015), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). The defendant argues that we should instead determine whether the essential elements of the crime could have been found beyond a reasonable doubt by \u201ca reasonable jury.\u201d The defendant cites in support of his position a law review article by then-Chief Judge Jon Newman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who feared that \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 and the wholly gratuitous and potentially misleading underscoring of that word . .. can subtly shift an appellate court\u2019s attention from the correct construct of the reasonable jury to the quite incorrect construct of just one out of a distribution of reasonable juries.\u201d Newman, Beyond \u201cReasonable Doubt,\u201d 68 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 979, 992 (1993). Judge Newman\u2019s concern was that appellate courts under the <em>uany </em>rational trier of fact\u201d formulation might \u201cexamine a record to satisfy themselves only that there is <em>some </em>evidence of guilt and . . . not conscientiously assess whether the evidence suffices to permit a finding by the high degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>persuasion required by the \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standard\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact\u201d standard was stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, immediately after the Court stated that \u201cthe critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be ... to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. In <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677, we quoted both of these standards. Neither the Supreme Court in <em>Jackson </em>nor this court in <em>Latimore </em>suggested that these two standards are substantively different.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We decline to characterize them now as different in substance. We regard them simply as alternative formulations of the same appellate standard. We note that we have used the alternative to the <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact\u201d formulation in earlier cases without intending any difference in the standard of review. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>460 Mass. 139, 141 (2011) (\u201cwe review the evidence ... to determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer the existence of each essential element of the crime charged, beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 15 (1981) (\u201cwe must determine whether [the] evidence, considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to permit a jury reasonably to infer the existence beyond a reasonable doubt of each essential element of the crime charged\u201d). Under both formulations of the appellate standard, \u201cit is not enough ... to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense.\u201d <em>Latimore, supra. </em>Rather, the evidence must be sufficiently strong to permit a reasonable jury to find that each essential element of the charged offense was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See cases cited, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Applying that standard, we conclude that the evidence in this case was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ant guilty of the premeditated murder of the victim. It is true, as the defendant argues, that Serrano had the stronger motivation to kill the victim, and that the medallion found at the scene of the killing belonged to Serrano, not the defendant. But the jury were reasonably entitled to credit Estrella\u2019s eyewitness testimony that the shooter\u2019s chin was level with the center of the victim\u2019s forehead, which would make the defendant, not Serrano, the shooter, where the defendant was five inches taller than the victim and the victim was one inch taller than Serrano. Also, where the defendant was seen wearing a hood when he pointed the gun at the victim during the fight, the jury reasonably could have credited Estrella\u2019s observation that the shooter wore a hood on his head, and inferred that Serrano, whose hood was off his head before the shooting, would not likely have put his hood on had he given chase to the victim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although Serrano, not the defendant, had threatened the life of the victim for dating the woman who had been Serrano\u2019s girl friend, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Serrano brought the defendant to the encounter to assist Serrano in doing harm to the victim. After receiving the gun from Serrano, the defendant pointed it at the victim, and the jury reasonably could have inferred that part of the defendant\u2019s purpose in doing so was to prevent the victim from getting away. Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred that, when the victim fled the scene, the defendant was the person who gave chase, especially where the defendant was holding the gun during the fight and the gunshot was heard within moments after Abreu ran from the scene of the fight. The jury also reasonably could have inferred that the victim pulled off Serrano\u2019s Virgin Mary medallion while he was wrestling with Serrano, and dropped it, along with the knife he was carrying, when he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The consciousness of guilt evidence also points to the defendant as the shooter. The jury reasonably could have inferred that, regardless of whether it was arrest or retaliation that he feared, he went to the motel and later left for Pennsylvania because he had shot and killed a person on the evening of April 1. Had he not been the shooter, it is unlikely that he would have felt the same need to flee. The jury also reasonably could have inferred that the closest he came to speaking the truth was when he told Officer Miner, \u201cI was there,\u201d \u201cI had the gun,\u201d and \u201cThings just got crazy.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>explanation is consistent with the defendant acting instinctively to chase the victim while he \u201chad the gun,\u201d and shooting the victim because \u201c[t]hings just got crazy.\u201d Although this evidence, viewed in its totality, does not eliminate the possibility that Serrano, not the defendant, was the shooter, the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, not Serrano, was the shooter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>470 Mass. 464, 477 (2015) (\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt, for everything in the lives of human beings is open to some possible or imaginary doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Having reviewed the entire record in this case pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we also address the defendant\u2019s contention that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. Section 33E \u201cdoes not . . . convert this court into a second jury, which must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of a defendant .. . without the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass. at 916, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>416 Mass. 258, 265 (1993). \u201c[F]or this court under the statute ... to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, it must appear that the verdict . .. would work a miscarriage of justice .... It is not enough that the judge or judges, if on the jury, would have felt a reasonable doubt which the jury did not share.\u201d <em>Franklin, supra, </em>quoting <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 266. In evaluating the weight of the evidence, we do not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and are free to consider the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>470 Mass. 163, 163 (2014); <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 267 (under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we consider \u201cthe thrust of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">It is reasonable to conclude that the defendant\u2019s version of what happened after the fight ended between Serrano and the victim is not credible for various reasons. It is not credible that the victim simply walked away from the fight, where the defendant was pointing a gun at him. Nor is it credible that, <em>after </em>the victim left the scene of the fight, the defendant walked away and got as far as he said he did past the comer of Haverhill and Oxford Streets when he heard the gun shot <em>behind </em>him at that corner; the victim had not ran far from the scene of the fight before he suddenly turned to face the person chasing after him, and their encounter was brief before the shooting. Nor is it credible that he ignored the \u201cpop\u201d sound he admits that he heard, or that he did not recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the meaning of the \u201cpop.\u201d Nor is it credible that he fled his home early on the morning of April 2 for reasons unrelated to what had happened at approximately 9 p.m. on April 1. In short, the weight of the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant, rather than Serrano, was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. <em>Court room closure. </em>After being convicted, the defendant moved for a new trial on the grounds that the court room had been improperly closed during jury empanelment, and that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to object to the closure. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mother and a friend of hers were excluded from the courtroom during the jury [ejmpanelment,\u201d and that \u201cthe [cjourt itself, from the bench in open court, directed that the courtroom be cleared of spectators before the prospective jurors entered.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defense counsel \u201cadvised [the two spectators] that they would have to remain outside until [e]mpanelment was complete,\u201d which they did. He did not object to the closure and, after the jury were empaneled, stated that \u201cthe accused [was] satisfied with\u201d the empanelment process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Based on these facts, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, concluding that the defendant both waived his right to a public trial during jury selection and procedurally waived the claim of a violation of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant\u2019s right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to jury empanelment proceedings, and the violation of that right is structural error where the claim of error is properly preserved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 105-106 (2010). See also <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>558 U.S. 209, 213 (2010). But \u201c[w]here counsel fails to lodge a timely objection to the closure of the court room\u201d \u2014 as happened in this case \u2014 \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim of error is deemed to be procedurally waived.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaChance, </em>469 Mass. 854, 857 (2014), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 317 (2015), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>467 Mass. 96, 102, cert. denied, 135 U.S. 356 (2014), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. 83, 87-88 &amp; n.8, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2356 (2013). Having waived his claim of error regarding the denial of his right to a public trial during jury selection, the defendant after conviction may claim that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to the closure of the court room. See <em>LaChance, supra </em>at 858; <em>Morganti, supra </em>at 103. However, even if a defendant were to show that his or her attorney was deficient for failing to make a timely objection, the defendant would be entitled to relief in a murder case only if he or she can show that a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arose from the court room closure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>471 Mass. 262, 269 (2015).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe structural nature of the underlying error does not automatically excuse the defendant from showing prejudice when advancing an unpreserved claim.\u201d <em>LaChance, supra </em>at 857. Here, the defendant has not claimed that the closure of the court room during jury selection was likely to have had any effect on the judgment. See <em>id. </em>at 859, quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691 (1984) (\u201cjury empanelment closed to spectators [other than jurors] and the defendant\u2019s family ... will rarely have an \u2018effect on the judgment\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, the defendant\u2019s public trial right claim fails because it was procedurally waived, and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because he has made no showing of prejudice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">3. <em>Absence of instruction regarding honest mistake in identification. </em>The defendant also contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial judge did not instruct the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>possibility that an eyewitness who observed the shooting may have made an honest but mistaken observation of the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The defendant requested a five-part jury instruction on \u201cmistaken observation,\u201d which the judge and defense counsel characterized as an \u201camplification\u201d of the instruction regarding eyewitness identification that this court approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (Appendix) (1979), <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass. 1006 (1995). The judge declared that he was not inclined \u201cto do the amplification,\u201d but was inclined to give \u201cthe straight <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction,\u201d fearing that the additional detail in the amplified instruction would put him \u201cmore in the role of advocate than [he] ought to be.\u201d The judge agreed to defense counsel\u2019s request that his objection be noted for the record, even though defense counsel added that \u201cthere is no legal basis\u201d for the objection \u201cother than looking for an expansion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">At the charge conference that followed the close of evidence at trial, the judge said that he no longer thought that the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction was appropriate because that instruction provides guidance regarding \u201can actual identification\u201d and there was no identification of the shooter in this case. The judge said he would draft an instruction that would make clear to the jury that there was no identification of the shooter but there was testimony from Estrella regarding the \u201cphysical characteristics and attire\u201d of the shooter, and set forth the factors the jury might use in assessing that testimony. Defense counsel agreed that \u201cthat would be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The judge instructed the jury regarding eyewitness identification as he had promised.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>\u00bb<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>this instruction or to any of the judge\u2019s jury instructions. The judge, however, did not include a jury instruction regarding the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification, even though the defendant had sought such an instruction in the fifth part of his proposed five-part jury instruction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983), we declared that where \u201c[ijdentification [is] crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case ... [f]aimess to a defendant compels the trial judge to give an instruction on the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and when the defendant requests it.\u201d Here, where the facts permitted such an instruction and the defendant requested it, the judge should have instructed the jury about the risk of an honest but mistaken observation even in the absence of a positive eyewitness identification. See <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass. at 912. The defendant, however, did not object to the judge\u2019s jury instructions at trial, and therefore failed to alert the judge of the need for such an instruction.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Where the objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>tion was not preserved, we consider whether the error produced a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>449 Mass. 12, 17 (2007). We conclude that there was no such risk in this case because, even without the instruction, the jury reasonably would have understood that they needed to consider whether Estrella made a good faith, honest error in his observations of the shooting. The defendant never suggested that Estrella was lying; nor was there any evidence that Estrella had any motive to lie. The possibility that Estrella\u2019s testimony was based on an honest mistake was the focus of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Estrella and his closing argument.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Given this context, the jury would have known what the missing instruction would have told them. Therefore, \u201cwe are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">4. <em>Closing argument. </em>In her closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that the defendant \u201ccan\u2019t tell you the truth because the truth doesn\u2019t help [the defendant]. The truth is . . . that [the defendant] was the shooter.\u201d She later said that Estrella \u201c[has] no reason to come in here and tell you anything but the truth. And that\u2019s exactly what he did.\u201d She concluded, \u201cThe defendant is the trigger man. That is the truth .... It was the defendant who murdered [the victim].\u201d The defendant argues that, in making these statements, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the accuracy of Estrella\u2019s testimony and improperly expressed her personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. Where, as here, the defendant did not object to these closing argument statements at trial, we determine whether the statements created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice that requires a new trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 296 (2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(where there was no objection to closing argument statements in first-degree murder case, \u201cwe review to determine whether the statements were improper, and, if so, whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We agree with the defendant that the statements were improper. A prosecutor is free to provide the jury with the reasons why they should find a witness\u2019s observations to be accurate, but she cannot tell the jury that the witness speaks the truth. See <em>id. </em>at 297 (\u201c[T]he prosecutor [may not] suggest that he has personal knowledge of, or vouch for, the credibility of a witness . . . [but may] state logical reasons why a witness\u2019s testimony should be believed\u201d). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1113(b)(3)(B) (2015) (impermissible in closing argument \u201cto state a personal opinion about the credibility of a witness\u201d). A prosecutor is also free to harness the key evidence and provide the jury with the reasons why they should conclude that a defendant was the shooter, but she cannot tell the jury that she knows it to be true that he was the shooter. See <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 296-297 (\u201cA prosecutor may not express his personal belief in the testimony or suggest that he has knowledge independent of the evidence at trial. . . [but] may comment on and draw inferences from the evidence at trial\u201d). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1113(b)(3)(B) (impermissible in closing argument \u201cto state a personal opinion about... the ultimate issue of guilt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We conclude, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in this case, although improper, did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. A prosecutor\u2019s vouching for the truth of a witness\u2019s testimony or of the defendant\u2019s guilt is improper because it might suggest to the jury that the prosecutor has special knowledge, apart from the evidence presented at trial, that enables her to know that the witness is telling the truth or that the defendant committed the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989), and cases cited. But there was little danger that the jury would make that inference here because the prosecutor argued the reasonable inferences from the evidence at trial and did not suggest that she came to the \u201ctruth\u201d based on anything other than the evidence at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 831, 834 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>418 Mass. 58, 60-61 (1994) (\u201cprosecutor\u2019s assertions that the defendant was lying[ ] generally were accompanied by the words \u2018the evidence establishes,\u2019 and thus were \u2018expressed as a conclusion to be drawn from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>and not as a personal opinion\u2019 \u201d). The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Estrella was telling the truth was made immediately after the statement that Estrella had \u201cno reason\u201d to do anything but tell the truth, and immediately before the prosecutor argued based on Estrella\u2019s testimony that the shooting was uniquely memorable for Estrella. And immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he truth is . . . that [the defendant] was the shooter,\u201d the prosecutor said, \u201c[T]he evidence tells us so.\u201d Because a reasonable jury would have understood the prosecutor\u2019s assertions of the \u201ctruth\u201d to be based on the evidence at trial, there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">5. <em>Resentencing as a juvenile. </em>The defendant was seventeen years old at the time of the crime. After conviction, he received the mandatory sentence for murder in the first degree under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2 \u2014 life in prison without the possibility of parole. The defendant was sentenced in 2007, prior to <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455, 2464 (2012), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the mandatory imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on an offender under the age of eighteen violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and prior to <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>466 Mass. at 671 &amp; n.16, in which we held that the imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on an offender under the age of eighteen violates art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Because we give the \u201cnew\u201d rules announced in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Diatchenko </em>retroactive effect, see <em>Diatchenko, supra </em>at 666, the defendant is entitled to be resentenced on his murder conviction to life in prison with the possibility of parole. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>467 Mass. 115, 140 (2014) (remanding case to Superior Court \u201cfor resentencing consistent with Diatchenko\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>6. <em>Review under G.

Where the verdict is not contrary to the weight of the evidence, and where the defendant is entitled to have his sentence for murder in the first degree reduced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in light of <em>Diatchenko </em>because he was under the age of eighteen at the time of the shooting, we decline to exercise our authority under G.

That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>objection focused on the judge\u2019s unwillingness to give an \u201camplification\u201d of the instruction regarding eyewitness identification in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (Appendix) (1979), <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass. 1006 (1995), and his inclination to give a \u201cstraight\u201d <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction, an inclination the judge later revised when he learned there was no positive identification of the defendant as the shooter. Where the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction is silent as to the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification, defense counsel\u2019s objection to the judge\u2019s disinclination to give an amplified <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction would not reasonably have alerted the judge that the defendant objected to the absence of an honest, but mistaken, identification instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In closing argument, defense counsel referred to Estrella as a \u201c[g]ood man [who] cares about the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Commonwealth concedes that the defendant must be resentenced to life with the possibility of parole on his murder conviction. But in addition to murder in the first degree, the defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>and sentenced to one year in a house of correction, to run concurrently with the life sentence for murder in the first degree, and with credit for time served, which at the time of sentencing was already 1,001 days. We have not addressed the issue whether a convicted offender entitled to resentencing under <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>466 Mass. 655, 671-674 (2013), <em>S.C., </em>471 Mass. 12 (2015), may also be resentenced on convictions in which he did not receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>472 Mass. 139, 143-146 (2015) (at resentencing of juvenile defendant who had been convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of two murders and sentenced to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, judge may revisit whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent).. We need not address that issue here, because the Commonwealth at oral argument indicated that it would not seek resentencing on the firearms conviction, and because the defendant has already completed his sentence on the firearms conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
