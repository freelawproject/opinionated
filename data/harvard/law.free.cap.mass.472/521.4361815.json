L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13. The plaintiffs, who represent a certified class of sex offenders subject to the ordinance, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance on various grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court invalidated the ordinance under the Home Rule Amendment. The city appealed and we granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We affirm the Superior Court judgment based on our conclusion that the ordinance is inconsistent with the comprehensive statutory scheme governing the oversight of convicted sex offenders, and therefore, it fails to pass muster under the Home Rule Amendment and the Home Rule Procedures Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed facts as drawn from the summary judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">1. <em>The ordinance. </em>The city adopted an \u201cOrdinance Pertaining to Sex Offender Residency Restrictions in the [city]\u201d (ordinance) on January 12, 2011. The stated purpose of the ordinance is to \u201creduce the potential risk of harm to children of the community by impacting the ability of registered sex offenders to be in contact with unsuspecting children in locations that are primarily designed for use by, or are primarily used by children.\u201d Observing that \u201c[Registered sex offenders continue to reside in close proximity to public and private schools, parks and playgrounds,\u201d and that \u201cregistered sex offenders will continue to move to buildings, apartments, domiciles or residences in close proximity to schools, parks and playgrounds,\u201d the city council enacted the ordinance to \u201cadd location restrictions to such offenders where the [S]tate law is silent.\u201d The ordinance imposes broad restrictions, with only narrow exceptions, on the ability of registered level two and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>level three sex offenders to reside in the city.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinance establishes the area within 1,000 feet of a school or park as a residential exclusion zone for level two and level three sex offenders, and includes in its description of \u201cschool\u201d all public, private, and church schools, and any other business permitted as a school. The ordinance also applies to all temporary and permanent residences except a \u201cresidence at a hospital or other healthcare or medical facility for less than fourteen consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in the aggregate during any calendar year.\u201d The geographical and temporal reach of the ordinance effectively prohibits all level two and level three sex offenders from establishing residence, or even spending the night in a shelter, in ninety-five per cent of the residential properties in Lynn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ordinance would affect, at least in some degree, all 212 registered level two and level three sex offenders residing in the city, as of April 22, 2014. A sex offender required by the ordinance to move from his or her residence could encounter similar restrictions in attempting to relocate to nearby cities and towns. At least forty municipalities have adopted sex offender residency restrictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The expansive coverage of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>is mitigated by narrow exceptions to the residency restrictions applicable to those who (1) have established, prior to the effective date of the ordinance, a permanent residence within a restricted area by purchasing real property or by being the lessee of an unexpired lease or rental agreement; (2) are a \u201cminor\u201d; (3) are \u201cresiding with a person related by blood or marriage within the first degree of kindred\u201d; or (4) have been residing at a permanent residence before the school or park creating the applicable restricted area was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Failure to comply with the ordinance results in a penalty of $300 for each day that a sex offender subject to the ordinance remains in a restricted area thirty days after receiving a notice to move from the city, or if such sex offender moves within the city into a restricted area. Additionally, if there is a \u201csubsequent offense,\u201d the sex offender\u2019s \u201clandlord, parole officer and/or probation officer, and the . . . Sex Offender Registry Board\u201d (board) shall be notified that the offender has violated a municipal ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>The plaintiffs, who represent a certified class of \u201call registered [ljevel [two] and [l]evel [three] sex offenders who are now or who may in the future be prohibited from living at various places in the [city] by the city\u2019s ordinance pertaining to sex offender residency restrictions,\u201d commenced this action after receiving the notices to move, as authorized under the ordinance. The city sent letters notifying each that he lives within a restricted area under the ordinance and that he has thirty days from the date of the letter \u201cto relocate to another address which is in compliance with the [ordinance\u201d or be subject to a fine of $300 for each day of residing in a restricted area.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the counts in the complaint asserting that the ordinance (1) violates the Home Rule Amendment; (2) is an ex post facto law under the Federal and State Constitutions; and (3) violates the plaintiffs\u2019 right to travel under the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The city defended the ordinance by arguing, with regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Home Rule Amendment, that the residency restriction is not inconsistent with State law, and that the shared purpose \u2014 the protection of children from sexual predators \u2014 supports and supplements the law governing the oversight of sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In a thorough and well-reasoned memorandum of decision, the judge granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs and invalidated the ordinance under the Home Rule Amendment, concluding that that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances support an express legislative intent to forbid local activity in the area of the civil regulation and management of the post-incarceration lives of convicted sex offenders.\u201d In particular, the judge determined that the ordinance is inconsistent with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q, the Sex Offender Registry Law (registry law); and G. L. c. 123A, the law providing for the \u201cCare, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexually Dangerous Persons\u201d (SDP law). In light of this disposition, however, the judge declined to review the remaining constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The city argues on appeal that the ordinance was adopted as a valid exercise of its police power, that there is no evidence of legislative intent to occupy the field governing the management of postincarceration sex offenders, and that the ordinance does not conflict with State law. The plaintiffs counter that the judge correctly determined that the ordinance is unconstitutional and urge this court to affirm the judge on the broader constitutional grounds, asserted in their motion for partial summary judgment. We decline to reach the broader constitutional grounds, but we agree that the judge properly invalidated the ordinance as unconstitutional under the Home Rule Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">A local regulation is unconstitutional under the Home Rule Amendment if it is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the constitution or laws of the Commonwealth. <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 35 (1999). This principle is derived from the language of the Home Rule Amendment that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201cAny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>function which the general court has power to confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court by section eight, and which is not denied, either expressly or by clear implication, to the city or town by its charter, whether or not it has adopted a charter pursuant to section three.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. \u201c[T]he touchstone of the analysis [of whether a local ordinance is inconsistent with State law] is whether the State Legislature intended to preempt the city\u2019s authority to act.\u201d <em>Connors, supra, </em>citing <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155 (1973). Review of a local ordinance is focused on the Legislature\u2019s preemption prerogative because, as the title suggests, the Home Rule Amendment was enacted to restore to municipalities the \u201cright of self-government in local matters.\u201d Art. 89, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. The genesis of the Home Rule Amendment as a means to expand municipal legislative authority<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> thus informs the analytical directive that, in reviewing a local ordinance, the \u201cquestion is not whether the Legislature intended to grant authority to municipalities to act... , but rather whether the Legislature intended to deny [a municipality] the right to legislate on the subject [in question].\u201d <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985). \u201cMunicipalities enjoy \u2018considerable latitude\u2019 in this regard,\u201d and a local regulation will not be invalidated unless the court finds a \u201csharp conflict\u201d between the local and State provisions. <em>Easthampton Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>470 Mass. 284, 289 (2014), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Bloom, </em>363 Mass. at 154. A sharp \u201cconflict \u2018appears when either the legislative intent to preclude local action is clear, or, absent plain expression of such intent, the purpose of the legislation cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Easthampton Sav. Bank, supra, </em>quoting <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979). Where, as here, the Legislature is silent on the issue of local regulation, we also may infer an intent to forbid local regulation if \u201clegislation on a subject is so comprehensive that an inference would be justified that the Legislature intended to preempt the field.\u201d <em>Easthampton Sav. Bank., supra, </em>quoting <em>Wendell, </em>394 Mass. at 524. The burden is on the challenger to establish that the local enactment is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Constitution or State law. <em>Springfield Preservation Trust, Inc. </em>v. <em>Springfield Library &amp; Museums Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>447 Mass. 408, 418 (2006), citing <em>Grace, supra </em>at 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We turn now to the application of these principles to the ordinance. Based on our de novo review of the judge\u2019s decision, <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>468 Mass. 260, 267 (2014), citing <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 215 (2003), we conclude that the ordinance is inconsistent with the comprehensive scheme of legislation intended to protect the public from convicted sex offenders and, thereby, manifests the \u201csharp conflict\u201d that renders it unconstitutional under the Home Rule Amendment. Although the registry law and the other laws governing sex offenders do not expressly prohibit local regulation, we infer from the comprehensive nature of the statutory scheme for oversight of sex offenders and the negative effect that the ordinance may have on the monitoring and tracking of sex offenders that the Legislature intended to preclude local regulation of sex offender residency options.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">To provide context for our conclusion that the Legislature intended to preclude further regulation of sex offender residence options, we first recapitulate the depth and breadth of the legislation mandating oversight of sex offenders. In 1999, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive package of laws that effected a major overhaul of the statutory scheme governing the identification, treatment, and postrelease management of convicted sex offenders. St. 1999, c. 74. That package of laws, described as \u201cAn Act improving the sex offender registry and establishing civil commitment and community parole supervision for life for sex offenders,\u201d includes the registry law, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q. St. 1999, c. 74, as amended by St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7 12. The stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>purpose of the act is to \u201cassist local law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to protect their communities by requiring sex offenders to register and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about certain sex offenders to the public as provided in this act.\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. It accomplishes that purpose through three primary mechanisms: (1) compelling sex offenders to register and maintain current personal information with the board and local police, and distributing such information in accordance with the registry law, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, and as amended by St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7 12; (2) civilly confining certain offenders deemed most likely to reoffend, G. L. c. 123A, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a73-8; and (3) controlling certain aspects of the postincarceration lives of certain sex offenders, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133D, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 9 (community parole supervision for life).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The first mechanism in the 1999 registry law, as amended through St. 2013, c. 63, requires that sex offenders update their registration information annually and when they change residences, employment, or schooling; a sex offender who is homeless must also update his or her registration information every thirty days and wear a global positioning system (GPS) device. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178F, 178F, 178F %. The law defines who is considered a \u201csex offender\u201d; creates the board; requires sex offenders to register with the board; requires the board to create a central computerized registry of sex offender information and transmit that data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to police departments in the municipalities where the offender intends to live and work; creates a classification system for offenders subject to judicial review; and, after classification, requires sex offenders to maintain current registration information with local police. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C, 178D, 178E, 178F, 178F Fa, 178K, 178L, 178M. The law creates criminal penalties for failing to register and provides a mechanism for terminating the obligation to register. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178F, 178G, 178H, 178K.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The registry law further provides guidelines for determining the offender\u2019s classification level, which is based on the risk of reoffense and the public safety interest in making registration information available to the public. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (a)-(c). In that regard, the classification level assigned to each sex offender depends, in part, on the amount of personal information deemed necessary for public safety and appropriate for public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>availability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Registration information for level one sex offenders is not provided to the public, information for level two and level three offenders is available to the public by request or on the Internet,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and information for level three offenders may be disseminated actively to the public. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178D, 1781, 178J.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This framework demonstrates the legislative priority attached to monitoring the residence, employment, and schooling locations of sex offenders as a means to protect the public from sex offenders. That monitoring sex offenders is a priority is demonstrated clearly by the Legislature\u2019s choice to insert only a narrow residency restriction in the registry law. That restriction only bars level three offenders from residing in rest homes or similar long-term care facilities. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (e). Although we concluded in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>460 Mass. 342, 343 (2011), that this restriction was unconstitutional without an individualized hearing to determine the risk posed by the petitioner to the vulnerable community sought to be protected, the restriction is instructive of legislative intent. This provision demonstrates that the Legislature considered and addressed potential risks involved with sex offender residency in relation to a vulnerable population. We note that the Legislature limited its restriction to those offenders seeking to reside in an integrated setting with a vulnerable population and did not include those seeking to reside geographically close to a vulnerable population. We infer from the details of the rest home restriction that the Legislature intended to exercise control over any sex offender residency requirements at the State level and that the Legislature may not have considered it appropriate to create a blanket prohibition on residency. The ordinance, which restricts all level two and level three sex offenders from living in ninety-five per cent of the residential areas of the city, conflicts with the relatively narrow rest home restriction created by the Legislature and is thus inconsistent with State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>As a final observation on the legislative choice to define the sex offender residency restriction narrowly, we note the grave societal and constitutional implications of the de jure residential segregation of sex offenders. Except for the incarceration of persons under the criminal law and the civil commitment of mentally ill or dangerous persons, the days are long since past when whole communities of persons, such as Native Americans and Japanese-Americans, may be lawfully banished from our midst.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, because of the tension between a sex offender\u2019s liberty interest, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>460 Mass. 336, 338 (2011), and the imperatives of public safety, the Legislature has demonstrated a concern for careful crafting of laws in a field fraught with constitutional peril.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 423 Mass. 1201, 1202-1203 (1996) (providing guidance from this court in determining constitutionality of community notification provisions of registry law). For this reason as well, the Legislature cannot have intended to permit local regulation of sex offender residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Apart from the conflict with the registry law\u2019s narrowly defined residency restriction, the ordinance also is inconsistent with the registry law in that it would undermine the effectiveness of the law\u2019s classification system. The Legislature set forth guidelines to be used by the board in classifying sex offenders and included consideration of whether the \u201csex offender is residing in a home situation that provides guidance and supervision.\u201d G. L. c. 6, 178K (1) (c). The board expanded on that factor by requiring consideration of whether an offender\u2019s \u201cliving and work situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>is stable.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(12) (2013) (identifying supportive home environment as factor minimizing sex offender\u2019s risk to reoffend and degree of dangerousness). By requiring level two and level three sex offenders to move from their residences or face a civil penalty of $300 per day, the ordinance disrupts the stability of the home situations of sex offenders. As a supervised and stable home situation has been recognized as a factor that minimizes the sex offender\u2019s risk of reoffense,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this disruption is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s goal of protecting the public. Insofar as the ordinance is intended to impose residency restrictions on those sex offenders who may pose a risk to public safety that cannot be accommodated by the registry law, the second mechanism in the 1999 package of laws, the SDP law, serves that purpose. St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, amending G. L. c. 127. Through the civil commitment procedure under G. L. c. 123A, the Legislature already has provided a method to exclude those sex offenders determined to be most likely to reoffend from the general population, even after their incarceration has been completed. G. L. c. 123A. Before a sex offender is released from incarceration, confinement, or commitment (with a limited exception for an offender imprisoned for six months or less on a parole violation), a determination is made whether that offender is likely to be a sexually dangerous person. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13. If a judge determines, in accordance with certain procedures and evidentiary standards, that an offender has been \u201cconvicted of a sexual offense, suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that renders him a menace to the health and safety of others, and is likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined,\u201d the Commonwealth may civilly confine the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fender.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fay, 467 Mass. 574, 580, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 150 (2014), citing G. L. c. 127A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14. See <em>Fay, supra </em>at 585, n.13. Accordingly, the SDP law is the Legislature\u2019s chosen method to control sex offenders where it has been determined that maintaining and distributing the offender\u2019s registry information is insufficient to protect a community\u2019s public safety interest. The SDP law, therefore, further demonstrates the intent of the Legislature to focus on maintaining and distributing sex offender information as a means to protect the public for offenders who are not deemed dangerous enough to confine and the ordinance conflicts with that purpose by intruding on the controls deemed appropriate by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The third mechanism in the 1999 package of laws, the community parole supervision for life (CPSL) law,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> together with other parole and probation laws, was intended to allow the Commonwealth to control sex offenders\u2019 postincarceration lives by requiring certain conditions dependent on the offender\u2019s particular situation. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 133A (parole), 133D (CPSL), and 133D <em>xh </em>(parole and CPSL controls); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47 (probation controls). In addition to discretionary controls that may be assessed, the Legislature mandated that all persons under such controls wear a GPS device and be subject to certain geographic exclusion zones, \u201cin and around the victim\u2019s residence, place of employment and school and other areas defined to minimize the [offender\u2019s] contact with children, if applicable.\u201d G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133D <em>Vi. </em>G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Guzman, 469 Mass. 492, 493 (2014) (GPS monitoring mandatory where defendant sentenced to probationary term for enumerated offense).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The targeted approach to controlling sex offenders based on their particular circumstance and the GPS requirements set forth by the Legislature demonstrates the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to encourage sex offender monitoring with minimum disruption to the stability of a broad population of offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In addition to the three mechanisms contained in the 1999 package of laws, other laws support the legislative goal of protecting communities through monitoring sex offenders and controlling only specific situations most likely to cause harm. First, the various methods used to encourage registration demonstrate that maintaining current sex offender information is a primary goal. In addition to the criminal penalties contained in the registry law, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, the Legislature mandates that transient benefits be withheld, G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 38, and motor vehicle licenses and registration be suspended, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (/'), if a sex offender has not maintained current registration information. The Legislature also has imposed narrow restrictions to protect certain vulnerable communities from interaction with sex offenders instead of broadly affecting housing options for sex offenders. General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (e), inserted by St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 6, prohibits level three sex offenders from living a rest home or other regulated long-term care facility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition to this restriction, the Legislature has limited a sex offender\u2019s ability to live with adopted or foster children, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26A, or to work as a child care provider, G. L. c. 15D, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, a school bus operator, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 8A, 8A <em>Vz, </em>or an ice cream truck vendor, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The totality of the 1999 statutory scheme, incorporating as it does a series of interdependent policies and practices specifically designed to protect the public from level two and level three sex offenders by monitoring and notification to the public, evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent to have the first and final word on the subject of residency of sex offenders. In addition, insofar as the ordinance effects a wholesale displacement of sex offenders from their residences, it frustrates the purpose of the registry law and, therefore, is inconsistent and invalid under the Home Rule provisions. <em>Wendell, </em>394 Mass. at 527-528, citing <em>Bloom, </em>363 Mass. at 156.
